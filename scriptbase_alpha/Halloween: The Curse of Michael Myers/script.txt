     Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers - by Daniel Farrands





HALLOWEEN 6
THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS


DARKNESS fills the SCREEN.  SUPERIMPOSE:

October 30, 1995

DEAD SILENCE for what seems like an eternity, followed by a 
startling, bone-chilling SCREAM as we

FADE IN:

INT. DUNGEON - TUNNELS - NIGHT (DISTORTED)

The agonizing SCREAMS continue as we MOVE rapidly through a 
labyrinth of winding underground tunnels.  Glowing torches light 
the way.  Blurry, indistinct silhouettes of grim FIGURES wearing 
black-cowled robes flash along the dank, craggy walls.

As we BLAST around dark corners, we realize we are looking from 
the P.O.V. of a SCREAMING young woman being pushed forward on a 
gurney.  Plunging deeper into this hellish maze.

A door is SLAMMED.  Wooden.  Heavy.  Muffling the SCREAMS.

Spurs CLANK on a pair of silver-tipped cowboy boots as a 
MYSTERIOUS STRANGER steps into VIEW.  Long black duster.  
Widebrimmed fedora.  Lit cigarette dangling between gloved 
fingers.

INT. BIRTHING CHAMBER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A rat scampers from a hole, foraging in the muck of a rotted 
rack.  A white sheet, saturated with blood, covers the parted legs 
of JAMIE LLOYD, now 16, cheeks flushed with perspiration.
          
          JAMIE
     Oh, God, it's coming!  It's coming!

MARY, a young midwife, rushes in with a bowl of hot water.  Jamie 
lurches, knocking the bowl out of the girl's hands; it SHATTERS on 
the floor.
          
          JAMIE
        (continuing)
     Mary, mother of God, please make it stop!

Mary's face is frozen in horror.  Jamie's SCREAMS build to an 
unnerving crescendo.  The paiin too much for her to bear.
               
                    FLASH CUT TO:

Lurid SHOCK CUTS from the previous "Halloween" entries -- a 
surrealistic blend of IMAGES and VOICES -- as Jamie relives her 
terrifying childhood ordeal:
          
          LOOMIS (V.O.)
     ... Ten years ago he tried to kill Laurie 
     Strode ...

A)   LAURIE STRODE (Jamie Lee Curtis) twists and squirms as she is 
     strangled mercilessly in the hands of the murderous SHAPE.
          
          LOOMIS (V.O.)
     ... Now he wants her daughter.

B)   Trapped in her bedroom, 10-YEAR-OLD JAMIE (Danielle Harris) 
     struggles to open the door.  She flings it open.  The Shape is 
     standing there, knife poised to kill!
          
          LOOMIS (V.O.)
     Michael Myers is here to kill that little girl 
     and anyone else who gets in his way!

C)   RACHEL (Ellie Cornell) dies in anguish as the Shape plunges a 
     pair of scissors through her chest.  TINA (Wendy Kaplan) dives 
     right into the path of the Shape's knife.  "Jamie, run!!!"

D)   Jamie sinks to her knees behind the fallen Shape, taking its 
     hand in her own.  CLOSE ON the Shape's hand.  Fingers flexing to 
     life.  A grotesque BRAND on its wrist -- an inverted isocsceles 
     triangle that will come to be known as the mark of THORN.

E)   BLINDING EXPLOSION rips through cinderblock.  A jail cell blown 
     to oblivion.  FIRESTORM rages.  The MYSTERIOUS STRANGER appears, 
     opening fire with a SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE.

Pitiful wails of death.  OFFICERS writhing in pools of blood.  In 
the aftermath of this carnage stands YOUNG JAMIE.
               
                    FLASH CUT TO:

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT (SAME)

Jamie struggles against her bonds.  Pushing.  SCREAMING.  Lapsing 
in and out of consciousness during the excruciating pangs of 
labor.  Haunted by low, moaning VOICES.  CHANTING.
               
                    FLASH CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE STATION - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT (NEW FOOTAGE)

RESUME Jamie, filled with repidation as she staggers through the 
smoke-filled cell into a darkened, drizzly alleyway.

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

Beyond the clearing wisps of smoke, THREE FIGURES wearing black 
ski masks usher THE SHAPE -- arms and legs shackled in heavy 
chains -- into the back of a white van.

BACK TO SCENE

Mutely terrified, Jamie backs away -- into the arms of another 
figure, obscured by smokescreen:  the Mysterious Stranger!

Jamie's scream is cut off as the Stranger descends upon her like 
the Angel of Death.

A cigarette arcs throug the darkness like a tiny flare.  Crushed 
under the boot of the Stranger.

A moment later, Jamie is shoved into the front seat of the van.  
Doors SLAM.  Tires SCREECH over wet pavement.

THE ENTIRE PRECINCT EXPLODES IN A HUGE CONFLAGRATION!
               
                    SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT

A SLAP and the first cry of the newborn BABY.  Jamie sobs 
uncontrollably, the straps preventing her from reaching him.
          
          JAMIE
     Please ... give him to me ...

The infant is wrapped in black swaddling.  The wooden door CREAKS 
open.  Jamie's eyes fill with horror as the shadow of the Stranger 
fills the room.  Standing at the threshold.  Waiting to receive 
the child.
          
          JAMIE
        (continuing)
     No, please ... my baby!

The dark sentinels march out in somber procession, ignoring her 
desperate pleas.  Torches lighting the way.
          
          JAMIE
        (continuing)
     Damn you!!  Damn you all to hell!!!

Jamie's heartrending SHRIEKS are cut off by the cold sound of the 
SLAMMING DOOR.
               
                    FADE TO BLACK.

MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

A diaphanous column rises, a ghostly, slow-motion cylinder of 
flame that BURNS through the SCREEN to form the MAIN TITLE:
               
               HALLOWEEN 6

The OPENING CREDITS are BRANDED against the BLACK SCREEN by an 
invisible, kenetic force, interspersed with a SERIES OF CUTS:

Jamie's baby is lain upon a primitive altar.  Ringed by eleven 
stones engraved with cryptic markings.

Hooded, faceless figures.  Torches held aloft.  Disembodied 
VOICES.  Whispering.  Invoking a dark spell.

MARY, the young midwife, peers around a corner.  Eyes glazed with 
horror.  Watching.  Spying.

The newborn SCREAMS.  The flattened blade of a dagger smears a 
triangular symbol in blood over the baby's torso.

We MOVE IN on this symbol, capturing it in FREEZE FRAME.  It burns 
off into fiery cinders, disintegrating into DARKNESS.

Silence.  Then a startling CLAP OF THUNDER as we
               
                    SHOCK CUT TO:

A SIGN POST

standing askew in a matted patch of lawn.  WIND and RAIN.  INTENSE 
FLASH of LIGHTNING illuminates:

"For Sale By Strode Realty - SOLD"

EXT/INT. MYERS HOUSE - SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

MOVE along a trail of drowning toys -- baseball, Power Rangers, a 
deck of Pogs -- TOWARD a weather-beaten porch.  Leftover gallons 
of Sears Best.  Brushes soaking in turpentine.  A dozen or so 2 x 
2s l;ined up to replace a row of broken railing slats.

P.O.V. LOOKS UP to the tall, brooding edifice.  Address reads:  45 
Lampkin Lane.  Fresh coat of white paint over old clapboard.  New 
shutters on the narrow windows.  A jack-o'-lantern grins behind 
filmy curtains.  The Myers house.

Despite its recent face-lift, it looks just as foreboding as it 
did in "Halloween I."

P.O.V. stalks down the side of the house, around to the back 
door.  Opens it and quietly MOVES inside.

P.O.V. MOVES across the darkened kitchen.  A drawer is opened.  
LIGHTNING reveals a large butcher knife being withdrawn.

P.O.V. glides past the living room -- a few boxes, furniture to be 
arranged -- and MOVES swiftly UP a long flight of stairs.

Down the long, dark hallway ... through a door.  A bedroom.  
P.O.V. FINDS 6-year-old DANNY STRODE ... tossing and turning in 
the throes of a nightmare.

An ear-splitting THUNDER CRASH causes the boy to bolt upright in 
bed, looking right into the P.O.V.  Sweating.  Shaking.  
Petrified.

DANNY'S P.O.V.

The THUNDER seems to ROAR from the ferocious jaws of T-REX -- a 
24" scale model posing on a shelf among an army of Jurassic 
monsters.  Seemingly brought to life by the ELECTRICAL STORM.

FOLLOW DANNY

as he leaps out of bed and pads across polished wooden floors into 
the hallway.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  With the next THUNDER CRASH 
comes a startling, barely intelligible VOICE.
          
          WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
     Danny ...

Danny freezes.  Slowly turns.

DANNY'S POV

An ominous shadow at the end of the hall, illuminated by 
LIGHTNING.  Long duster and brimmed hat.  The Stranger!  In his 
outstretched hand, the gleaming butcher knife!
          
          WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
     Kill for him!

BACK TO SCENE

Danny screams!  THUNDER CRASHES HELLISHLY.  Lights flash on.  
Doors fly open.  Suddenly Danny is swept up in the protective arms 
of his mother, KARA, 22.
          
          KARA
     Danny!

The little boy holds onto her for dear life.  Crying 
hysterically.  Eyes clenched tightly.
          
          KARA
        (continuing)
     Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
          
          DANNY
     The voice man!  He's here!

Kara looks in the direction he's pointing.  In the light there's 
just an antique coat rack -- "dressed" in a hat, rain jacket and 
old silver-tipped umbrella.
          
          KARA
     Danny, no one's there.

Danny dares to look -- but now only cries harder.

Kara carries Danny back to his room, averting the steely-eyed gaze 
of her father, JOHN STRODE, staunch, late 40s, wearing boxer 
shorts and a well-worn undershirt.
          
          JOHN
     Some of us have to get some sleep around 
     here.  What's with that kid?

Kara ignores him as her mother, DEBRA, careworn face with 
compassionate eyes, tries to lend a hand.
          
          DEBRA
     Let me take him for you, Kara.
          
          KARA
     It's all right, Mom.  Go back to bed.

Debra sighs resignedly.  TIM, 18, stocky and streetwise, wearing 
torn red sweat pants and "Ice-T" t-shirt, casually replaces his 
Walkman headphones and returns to his room.

INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (A FEW MINUTES LATER)

Kara opens the closet and switches on the light.  Satisfying Danny 
that it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine.
          
          KARA
     Stay away monters, stay away ghouls. Stay away 
     from Danny.  You jerks know the rules. 
        (crossing to Danny's bed)
     Better?

Danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in.
          
          DANNY
     Mommy, when can we go home?

Kara sighs.  They've been through this one before.
          
          KARA
     Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new 
     house.  At least while I'm in college.  
     Remember our deal.
          
          DANNY
     The kids at school said this is a haunted 
     house -- that a bad man used to live here.
          
          KARA
     They did, did they?  Since when did we start 
     listening to the kids at school?
          
          DANNY
     But I've seen him!
          
          KARA
     You've been watching too much TV.
          
          DANNY
     He says things.  Bad things.
          
          KARA
     Like what?

Danny is afraid to tell her.
          
          KARA
        (continuing)
     If you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes, 
     ignore him.  Once he gets to know you he'll 
     come around ... Let the bad things you hear 
     slide right off your back.

Kara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead.  Then she 
goes to the closet, just about to turn out the light --
          
          DANNY
        (sitting up; panicked)
     No, Mom -- keep it on!
          
          KARA
     Okay ... But just for tonight.

Kara adjusts the closet door, causing one of Danny's school 
drawings to fly off the wall.  She picks it up on her way out.
          
          KARA
        (continuing)
     Good-night, Danny.

Kara softly closes the door.  Danny lies awake, blankets drawn up 
to his chin, eyes wide.  Still very much afraid.

INT. KARA'S ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

Kara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting Danny's 
drawing on a pile of open books.  Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke 
cans.  Telltale signs of a late-night cram session.

Adjusting the dial on her FM/alarm clock, Kara begins to move 
about the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the 
subtly-seductive voice of a WOMAN comes over the radio:
          
          WOMAN (V.O.)
     I know this sounds crazy, Harry, but I love 
     him.  I write to him every week. I think I 
     even want to have his child --

The woman is cut off by the nasally, steel-trap voice of HARRY 
SIMMS, talk radio's most popular man of controversy:
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     Let me get this straight, Debi.  Now you're 
     saying that not only does this guy get you 
     sexually aroused, but now you want to bear his 
     offspring?!

Wearing only her bra and panties, Kara moves to a full-length 
mirror and lets down her long, flaxen hair.  Beneath her studious 
exterior, she is quite attractive:  delicate features with an 
enviable, naturally-toned figure.
          
          WOMAN (V.O.)
     Deep down, he's just like you and me. He just 
     needs someone to understand him.  Someone to 
     love him.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     You're talking about one of this nation's most 
     notorious serial killers like he belongs in 
     some kind of Est seminar!  What planet have 
     you been on, lady?  Michael Myers has been 
     dead for six years!

A CLICK as the woman is abruptly DISCONNECTED.

Kara suddenly whirls around, startled by a FLASH of something -- a 
face -- in the mirror!

Drawn to the window behind her, she rubs off rainy mist and peers 
outside.

KARA'S P.O.V.

of the large Victorian frame house directly across the street.  
Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the shadow of a man standing in 
the uppermost window -- looking right at her!

ANGLE ON KARA

Frightened, her eyes lock on Danny's drawing.  A child's 
scribbling in red Crayon:  The triangular symbol of Thorn!

EXT. MYERS HOUSE / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE

Kara draws the priscilla curtains over the window as we PULL BACK 
through the pouring RAIN ... toward the house across the street.  
An ornate sign on the front door reads:

"Blankenship House - Rooms Available"

CRANE UP toward the window where the shadowy figure stands.  An 
insidious CRASH OF THUNDER as we PUSH through the window.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A macabre display of old newspaper headlines, arranged 
helterskelter on a wall:  "HALLOWEEN KILLS ESCAPES FROM ASYLUM."  
"HORROR IN HADDONFIELD:  MICHAEL MYERS CLAIMS 16 LIVES."  "REIGN 
OF TERROR ENDS AS MYERS PERISHES IN VIGILANTE EXPLOSION."

Harry Simms BOOMS over a state-of-the-art HiFi system.  A cassette 
tape RECORDS the continuing broadcast.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     Now we've got someone who claims he's actually 
     seen Michael Myers.  Does this whacko caller 
     have a name?

Staring out the window at the Myers house, TOMMY DOYLE, a 
strapping 25-year-old with reddish brown hair and intense eyes, 
cradles a cordless phone.
          
          TOMMY
     My name's Tommy.  I was only eight- years-old 
     when I saw him.  But I was lucky.  I survived.

Tommy paces nervously around his sparsely-furnished attic 
apartment.  Classic horror movie one-sheets and mint first edition 
comic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns, 
knives, and survivalist weapons.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     Sounds like you're a candidate for 
     electroshock therapy, Tommy.  Don't tell me 
     after all this time you still believe Myers is 
     alive?!

Tommy pauses, mesmerized by one of the newspaper clippings.
          
          TOMMY
     Michael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield.  
     Now it's just a matter of time before he comes 
     home to kill again.  But this time I'll be 
     ready.

MOVE IN TIGHT on the headline, frail and yellowed by age:  
"November 1, 1978.  TOMMY DOYLE SURVIVES BABYSITTER BLOODBATH."  
Directly beneath this:  "November 3, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD FEARED 
DEAD IN POLICE STATION MASSACRE."

CLOSE ON a photograph of young Jamie and
               
                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DUNGEON - CHAMBER - NIGHT

Jamie remains strapped to the table, wrapped in bloody sheets.  
Eyes closed.  Deathly still.  Suddenly an urgent, WHISPERING VOICE 
pierces the darkness:
          
          WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
     Jamie?  Jamie?!

Jamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her 
straps.
          
          MARY
     Come with me if you want to save your baby.

Jamie can't believe her eyes.  Mary opens a threadbare knapsack -- 
revealing the baby inside!

A soul-shuddering RUMBLE echoes throughout the cavern.  Jamie 
leaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence.
          
          JAMIE
     Oh, God ... He's coming!
          
          MARY
     We've got to move.  Now!

Pulsing with adrenaline, Jamie harnesses the knapsack over her 
shoulders and follows Mary out into the tunnels.

TUNNEL GATE

Chains GRIND over rusted pulleys.  A massive iron gate rises, 
revealing a pair of filthy work boots.  Legs planted in bold 
stance as a tall, ominous shape begins to emerge.

ANOTHER TUNNEL

The terrified midwife leads Jamie with her baby on a breathless 
flight through the winding network of tunnels.  Haunted by the 
ECHOING SOUNDS of the rising gate.

STALKING P.O.V. - THROUGH TUNNELS

Gliding forward into the hollow catacombs.  Slow by determined.  
Sensing the way.

ANOTHER PART OF THE TUNNELS

Reaching a corner, Mary stops and sends Jamie off in the opposite 
direction.
          
          MARY
     There!  It's that way!
          
          JAMIE
     No --
          
          MARY
     Save your baby -- go now!

Jamie runs, disappearing down the dark tunnel.  Mary quickly 
removes her shoes and tears off, now SILENT.

STALKING P.O.V.

surges around a corner.  FINDS Mary.  MOVES IN on her.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mary turns in small circles.  Fear mounting as she falters into 
darkness.  Heavy, labored BREATHING fills the tunnel.

A mask -- the pale, neutral features of a man weirdly distorted by 
the rubber -- materialized out of the void right behind her.  THE 
SHAPE!

Mary turns, about to scream when the Shape lunges out, lifts her 
up by the nape of the neck and SLAMS her forehead into a large 
metal SPIKE jutting out from the cavern wall!

Leaving her impaled like a fish on a hook, the Shape resumes its 
relentless pursuit.  Eerie under the lighted torches.

END OF TUNNEL

Jamie runs frantically.  Methodical, heavy FOOTSTEPS behind her.  
She chances a look behind.  The Shape is coming!

Jamie vaults up a dark stairwell.  A trap door above.  It won't 
budge.  Jamie frantically POUNDS against the hatch.

The Shape mounts the stairs!

Strength fueled by sheer desperation, Jamie forces the door open.  
Tumbles onto muddy ground.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Jamie drags herself out of the hole and half-runs, half-stumbles 
with her baby through an ugly, charred forest.  Sharp branches 
whip at her face.  RAIN falls.  LIGHTNING streaks across the sky.

As if hell-spawned, the Shape emerges from the underground chamber 
and trudges forward, bold and unstoppable.

Jamie tumbles into a gully, nearly dropping the knapsack.  She 
picks herself up, hands groping at rain-sopped earth.  The Shape 
is right behind her!

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT (SAME)

A slap-happy, overweight MOTORIST sips coffee from a 7-11 cup, 
straining to see the road through falling rain and fogged-up 
glasses.  Harry Simms keeps him mindlessly occupied.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     Next up is Dwayne.  What's on your feeble 
     excuse for a mind, "Dwayne?"

The Motorisft lets out a hardy GUFFAW, spilling his coffee.
          
          MOTORIST
     Shit!

Fingers burning, he searches the glove compartment for a napkin.
          
          DWAYNE (V.O.)
     I'd just like to say that I listen to your 
     show every night, Harry.  I think you're the 
     best.  I can't tell you how excited we are 
     that you'll be paying a visit to our little 
     town tomorrow night.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     Do you have a point to make here, Dwayne, or 
     should I just keep practicing my wrist 
     exercises?
          
          DWAYNE
        (chortles)
     Harry, you're too much.  I'd just like to say 
     that I understand how things have changed in 
     the 90's.  Gays in the military, cut off your 
     husband's do- jigger, become a national hero.  
     But I just can't see any sense in bringing 
     Halloween back to Haddonfield.

The Motorist looks up.  Eyes go wide with panic.  Startled GASP.

P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Jamie stands in the middle of the road, SCREAMING bloody-murder.

EXT. WOODED ROAD / INT. PICKUP TRUCK (SAME)

Tires SCREECH.  The pickup stops on a dime.  The Motorist just 
sits there, mouth agape as the shrieking girl throws open the door 
and clambers into the passenger seat.
          
          JAMIE
     Drive!  Goddamnit, drive!

Through his side-view mirror, the unsuspecting Motorist sees the 
outline of a quickly-approaching man.  Unrolling his window, he 
rubbernecks a look outside.
          
          MOTORIST
     Hey, what do you think you're --

CRUNCHING BONE and TEARING FLESH as the Shape's hands shoot 
through the window, twisting the man's head off his shoulders!

Jamie SCREAMS!  Lunges for the steering wheel.  Slams her foot 
down hard on the gas.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The pickup bullets forward, fishtailing up the road, never slowing 
down as the driver's door flies open, dumping the motorists's 
headless bulk into a muddy ditch.

INT. PICKUP (SAME)

Jamie drives.  Checks to see that her baby is safe.  Then lets out 
a PRIMAL SCREAM.  A hysterical release of fear and rage, drowned 
out by the squabble of VOICES over the radio:
          
          MALE CALLER #2 (V.O.)
     You're coming here for this Halloween fair -- 
     it's all just a game -- a publicity stunt for 
     you, isn't it Harry?  These kids -- they're 
     not old enough to remember what Myers did 
     here. They look up to you.  Now you're just 
     asking for trouble.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     You people really get me.  What are they 
     putting in the water in that town?
               
                    CUT TO:

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

LIGHTNING FLASHES and RAIN pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin.  
This is a man's retreat and has been for years.  Dark wood, worn 
leather, a few tastefully-chosen antiques.  Floor-to-floor ceiling 
shelves containing a myriad of books and an impressive display of 
awards and degrees, all bearing the name:  SAMUEL J. LOOMIS, Ph.D.

After a STATION IDENTIFICATION, "The Harry Simms Show" resumes, 
tinny-voiced CALLERS blaring over a handsomely-restored 1928 
Bremer-Tully.
          
          MALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)
     All these fanatics aside, Harry, I'd 
     personally like to thank whoever did the 
     masked one in.  Saved us tax-payers a lot of 
     money in the long run.
          
          FEMALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)
     Yeah, that sucker's been dead for six years.  
     It's about time they had a Halloween revival 
     in this town.  Now my kids can stop driving me 
     crazy!

MOVE IN behind a bald, sharp-featured man, hunched over a can as 
he reminisces over a collection of framed photographs -- memories 
of his wife and children.
          
          MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
     What happened to that psychiatrist of his?  
     Loomis, I think was his name.  I heard the old 
     quack was dead.

Turning at the mention of his name is DR. LOOMIS himself, wearing 
spectacles, a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee.  For 
the first time ever, we actually see him smile.  The burn scars on 
his face have all but faded away.  Last traces of the horrid past.
          
          LOOMIS
     Not dead.  Just very much retired.

Loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper 
article.  As he arranges the strips of paper in a leather-bound 
scrapbook, a sudden KNOCK at the door gives him a startle.

EXT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

An ominous FIGURE, clad in hat and trench coat, stands beneath the 
glowing porch light, silhouetted in the pouring RAIN.

Loomis opens the door, eyes straining in the semi-darkness, trying 
to identify his unexpected visitor.
          
          LOOMIS
        (sudden recognition)
     What the devil?!  Come in -- come in!

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Shuffling inside, dripping with rain, DR. TERENCE WYNN, a 
well-dressed gentleman in his 50s, removes his hat and coat, 
quickly making himself at home by the crackling fire.
          
          WYNN
     Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a 
     sign for five miles on that road!
          
          LOOMIS
     That's the whole idea of living in the 
     country.  I thrive on the seclusion.

Wynn heads for the kitchen, rummaging through cabinets and drawers 
as Loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail.
          
          WYNN (O.S.)
     Don't tell me that the reviled Rasputin of 
     Smith's Grove has grown complacent in his 
     golden years.  I don't buy it for a single 
     second, Dr. Loomis.

Loomis immediately senses that Wynn has an angle.
          
          LOOMIS
     And in all these years, I've never known you 
     to make house calls, Dr. Wynn.  Especially at 
     this hour ...

Wynn returns with a bottle of Irish whiskey and two shot glasses.  
Thrusts one in Loomis's hand and begins to pour.
          
          WYNN
     Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not 
     to second-guess the motives of my fellow man.  
     Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar 
     is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink 
     is just a drink.
          
          LOOMIS
     I hope you didn't come all the way out here in 
     this storm just to quote Freud.
          
          WYNN
     As always, your keen powers of perception 
     astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to 
     celebrate. 
        (raising his glass)
     After thirty-two years as Psychiatric 
     Administrator, guess who has been named 
     Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
          
          LOOMIS
     But surely Rogers isn't --
          
          WYNN
     Retiring.

Loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news.
          
          LOOMIS
     Why -- congratulations!  I can think of no one 
     better suited for the position.

The two old sparring partners drink to the occasion.  But Wynn's 
angle soon comes to the helm.
          
          WYNN
     Of course, I need a new Administrator. Someone 
     who can bring new life -- and some old blood, 
     if you'll pardon the expression -- back to our 
     program ...

Loomis prepares himself for the bomb.
          
          WYNN
        (continuing)
     We need you, Dr. Loomis.
          
          LOOMIS
     You should know that it's not wise to play 
     Halloween pranks on me.
          
          WYNN
     You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things 
     haven't been the same since you left.  I'm 
     recruiting the best psychiatric team in the 
     country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change 
     to finally make a difference.

Loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable 
easy chair, amused at the irony of Wynn's speech.
          
          LOOMIS
     Even after my stroke six years ago they 
     practically had to hold a gun to my head to 
     get me to retire.  Now things have changed.  
     I've changed.  The ghosts have been buried.  
     Why on earth would I want to dig them up 
     again?

Loomis finally looks over at Wynn, surprised to find him standing 
at the desk, looking through his scrap book.
          
          WYNN
     Seems to me there's at least one ghost that's 
     still lurking in your closet.

We follow Wynn's gaze down toward the open page.  A blazing 
tabloid headline:  "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OR ALIVE?"
               
                    SHOCK CUT TO:

EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jamie's getaway truck ROARS around a bend, tearing up a deserted 
stretch of highway.  The STORM rages.

INT. PICKUP (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie strains to see as she drives through sheets of RAIN.  Bone 
weary, fighting panic, holding one hand steady against the wheel, 
the other on the CRYING infant.
          
          JAMIE
     God ... Help us, please ...

Something up ahead.  Jamie's face fills with expectancy.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

A lighted sign appears out of the darkness.  Glowing salvation.  
Familiar red-white-and-blue logo.  "GREYHOUND."

EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

The pickup drives into the glow of orange vapor lights.  SKIDS to 
a stop in a deserted parking lot.  Jamie staggers out, cradling 
the knapsack as she runs toward the old depot.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

Jamie blasts through double glass doors.  But the bus station is 
devoid of life.  Empty benches.  Blank ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE 
signboard.  The low hum of vending machines.

Jamie moves toward the ticket counter.  A handwritten sign left by 
the attendant:  "BACK IN 20."

Shivering, holding her baby, Jamie enters an old-fashioned phone 
booth.  Picks up the receiver and immediately dials 911.
          
          VOICE (V.O.)
     You have reached Haddonfield Emergency 
     Services.  Due to severe weather conditions, 
     all circuits are momentarily busy.  If this is 
     not an emergency, please dial directly ...

Jamie slams the phone down in terrified frustration.  Suddenly she 
becomes aware of the radio program.  Piped in over ancient 
loudspeakers:

          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     For anyone who gives a flying circus, this is 
     Harry Simms -- the light in your night, the 
     love of your loins -- and I want to hear from 
     more of you bogeyman believers out there.  So 
     give me your best shot at 1-800-878-7274. 
     That's 1-800-URTRASH!

The STATION IDENTIFICATION cuts in.  Jamie picks up the receiver and 
frantically dials the number.

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn doesn't give up the sales pitch even as Loomis leads him to the 
door.  The radio program still squawking in the b.g.
          
          WYNN
     But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, 
     you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
          
          LOOMIS
     Please try to understand, Terence. I've already 
     made up my mind.

As Wynn continues to talk, his voice trailing off into nothingness, 
Loomis's attention is diverted to the VOICES on the radio.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     So they're trying to kill you and your baby.  
     Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be 
     Rosemary.
          
          JAMIE (V.O.)
        (intense whisper)
     No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming 
     for me and my baby.

Loomis's eyes widen; a man possessed.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's 
     coming?
          
          JAMIE (V.O.)
     It's ... Michael ... 
        (releasing)
     ... Michael Myers!

Loomis staggers.  A lifetime of nightmares coming back to haunt him 
all at once.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME)

PRESS IN TIGHT ON TOMMY in bed.  Listening through headphones.  
Sitting upright.  Thunderstruck.
          
          JAMIE (V.O.)
     Somebody help me!  Dr. Loomis, are you out 
     there?  Can you hear me?

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn watches with rapt attention as Loomis unlocks his safe and 
withdraws a metal case.  He pops it open, revealing his trusted .357 
Magnum and a box of cartridges.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (SAME)

A bus has arrived.  The ATTENDANT returns to his post.  Jamie hangs 
up the phone, filled with trepidation as PASSENGERS file inside.  A 
strung-out ROCKER.  A pair of stern-faced NUNS.  A PRETTY TEENAGER 
greeted in the loving arms of her BOYFRIEND.

Just as she is about to step out of the phone booth, a TALL MAN, 
back turned, wearing a hat and black trench coat, moves to stand 
outside the booth!  Jamie freezes.

Securing her baby in the knapsack, Jamie throws open the door.  
Suddenly the Tall Man steps in her path!
          
          TALL MAN
     Are you all right, young lady?

Shaking uncontrollably, Jamie shrinks away.  Backing down a narrow 
hall through the door marked "LADIES ROOM."

INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT (SAME)

Water runs into a grimy basin.  Unable to contain her tears, she 
washes the newborn.  Takes a roll of paper towels and tries to rub 
the triangular blood mark off his chest.

Suddenly the lights go out.  Jamie gasps.  Clutching her baby, she 
turns off the faucet and melts into the darkness.

The door CREAKS open.  FOOTSTEPS echo inside.

JAMIE

has locked herself inside one of the stalls.  Heart pounding.  The 
FOOTSTEPS grow louder.  Jamie's eyes dart frantically.

STALKING P.O.V.

MOVING methodically past the row of stalls, pushing open each door, 
revealing that they are all empty.  A CRASH from the last stall.  
P.O.V. moves toward it.  RUSTLING and MOVEMENT inside.

A HAND pushes on the door.  An open window above the toilet.  Jamie 
is gone!

EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie trembles off a stack of crates piled beneath the window and 
dashes around the side of the depot.

Suddenly the bus ROARS by, sending up a muddy wave as it pulls out, 
disappearing down the highway.

Jamie moves swiftly across the parking lot, clutching the knapsack.  
She throws open the door of the pickup and jumps into the driver's 
seat.

INT. PICKUP - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Slapping down the locks, Jamie thrusts the key into the ignition.  
The engine REVS to life.  She guns it, peeling out of the parking 
lot.  Back toward the highway.

She drives on, suppressing her tears, stealing glances at the 
knapsack bunched up on the passenger's seat.  Then she turns and 
looks forward with concentrated attention.

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

A sign looms ahead:  "Haddonfield Memorial Hospital - 10 Mi."

BACK TO SCENE

Jamie sighs with relief, steadying the wheel just as --

HIGHBEAMS flash on right behind her, a juggernaut roaring out of 
blackness!  Jamie's eyes flood with terror.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The grill of a familiar white van shoots forward, SLAMMING violently 
against the pickup's rear bumper.

JAMIE

is jolted forward in her seat.  Holding on the wheel with a 
white-knuckle grip as she's repeatedly hit from behind.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The unseen madman noses forward, veering sharply over the double 
yellow line, scraping sides with the truck.

Headlights sear a path through the night, locked in neck-and-neck 
profile.  SPARKS flashing at 70-miles-per-hour.

The van forces Jamie onto the shoulder.  It leaves the road, tearing 
branches from trees.  Jamie SCREAMING.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - THE CHASE

A quick-cut MONTAGE, events ticking out in fractions of a second 
like a nightmare:

The pickup springboards over a gulch and slams down hard, tires 
spinning in waves of mud, careening through a vast field.  A 
pumpking patch.

The van reappears in a glare of headlights.  Its engine screaming 
with fire-breathing rage.

The pickup puts on a furious burst of speed.  Eating up pumpkins and 
spinning out chunks of splattering seeds and pulp.

The van bears down hard, slingshotting across the field, whizzing 
past the pickup, cutting right in front of it.

INT. PICKUP

Something heavy is thrown from the back of the van right through the 
windshield!

Glass EXPLODES!  Jamie SCREAMS, hands going up instinctively to 
protect her face.  Swerving wildly out of control.

She looks to see a sprawling, mutilated corpse on top of her.  Wide, 
cold, lifeless eyes -- Mary!
          
          JAMIE
     No!!!

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH (CONTINUOUS)

The pickup rockets at breakneck speed toward the edge of the field.  
Suddenly --

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

The Shape stands in the field, tall and unmoving, white mask glowing 
hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights.

BACK TO SCENE

The truck plows into the Shape, dragging it under, SLAMMING headlong 
into the trunk of a huge oak tree.

Everything is abruptly and shockingly silent.  Like a phantom in the 
night, the van is gone.  The Shape nowhere to be seen.

Steam billows from the pickup, engine TICKING, a heap of shattered 
glass and mangled steel.  Pinned against the base of the tree is a 
shape in human form -- a scarecrow!

MOVE IN on Jamie, face-down against the steering wheel.  Coughing on 
the noxious fumes, she stirs back to life.  Slowly, painfully, she 
shoulders the door.  Falls onto the ground.

A SPARK ignites.  BLINDING FLASH as the gas tank EXPLODES, setting 
the truck ablaze.  Jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror.  
Debris rains down on her.

Suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field.  The Shape -- wielding 
an enormous butcher knife!

Jamie rolls onto her back, SCREAMING.
          
          JAMIE
     No -- NO!!!

Suddenly the knife plunges down and lands with a terrible THUD.

INT. PICKUP

The knapsack catches fire ... but inside there is no baby.  Only a 
roll of paper towels from the bus depot.

THE SCARECROW

burns; mocking Jamie with its grinning, hand-painted face.
               
                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

THE SHAPE

looks at us, white mask scintillating against blinding rays of 
SUNLIGHT.  Rivulets of blood drip off a large carving knife.

PULLING BACK, we see it is a life-sized, knife-wielding effigy of 
Michael Myers, sitting astride the "For Sale by Strode Realty" 
sign.  Stage blood spells out the words:  "He's coming!"

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

John Strode looks up with disgust as he inspects the grim monument 
that's been left on his front lawn during the night.  Puffing on a 
cigarette, wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe, John raises a 
large axe.

A group of neighborhood KIDS -- some dressed in Halloween 
costumes -- stand a safe distance away.  Gathered on the sidewalk.  
Gawking, whispering, tittering.

John angrily swings the axe into the signpost.  The kids jump with a 
collective start.
          
          JOHN
     Enough ... 
        (one CHOP)
     ... of this ... 
        (two CHOPS)
     ... Michael Myers ... 
        (timber)
     ... shit!

Suddenly the sign crashes down -- and "Michael Myers" with it.  The 
kids huddle.  John turns on them, brandishing the axe.
          
          JOHN
        (continuing)
     You stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the 
     hell off my property!  One, two --

That's all it takes.  The kids scatter, tripping over one another as 
they tear off down the black.

Satisfied with himself, John stubs out his cigarette and hauls the 
sign and its now-headless rider to the trash.

Then he trudges up the porch steps, dropping the axe as he enters 
the house.  Uttering oaths under his breath.

BOOM UP over the surrounding neighborheed.  SUPERIMPOSE:

"Haddonfield, Illinois.  Halloween."

Last night's storm has given way to an incredibly bright and 
picturesque morning.  CHILDREN pour out of their homes, bursting 
with excitement, dressed in colorful costumes.

Even the Myers house, with its trimmed hedges and fresh coat of 
paint, somehow manages to look invite.

A white van slowly rolls up the street.  WKNB logo, streamers and a 
large orange banner proclaiming:  "HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE 
HARVEST FAIRE '95 - See Harry Simms Live - October 31."  A 
now-familiar voice booms over loudspeaker:
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     This is Hard Harry Simms harping on ya from the 
     Big Apple.  Tonight's the night and the place 
     to be is the First Annual Harvest Faire.  So 
     come on out of your broom closets, 'Fielders, 
     and bogey the night away with me.
          
          MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
     Harry, I just won first prize for ugliest 
     costume!  Guess who I'm dressed as.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     Your mother?
          
          MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
     No, man -- You!!!

EXT. SANITARIUM - MORNING

A car bearing an official state emblem stops outside an imposing 
curtain of security gates.  A large sign reads:  "SMITH'S GROVE - 
WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

A hand reaches out and waves a plastic key card in front of an 
infrared scanner.  Surveillance cameras perched on the walls.

As the gate yawns open and the car drives through, we SEE the asylum 
in the distance -- the entire perimeter bounded by woods and barbed 
wire fences.

INT. WYNN'S CAR (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn drives.  Loomis in the passenger seat, fueling his own 
anxieties.
          
          LOOMIS
     It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was 
     Jamie.  Calling for me.
          
          WYNN
     You don't know that for sure.  It could have 
     been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
          
          LOOMIS
     It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew 
     she would one day.  And whatever has brought 
     her back has brought Michael back as well.
          
          WYNN
     After six years?  Sam, she died with him in 
     that explosion after the --
          
          LOOMIS
     That's what someone wants us to believe, but I 
     tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I 
     sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did 
     all those years as I watched him.  Sitting 
     behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing 
     stronger. 
        (off Wynn's silence)
     As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't 
     go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your 
     help to stop him.

Wynn stares.  Loomis's words fall on him like a death sentence.

INT. SANITARIUM - RECEPTION AREA (SAME)

Gold insignia on mahogany doors:  "TERENCE WYNN - CHIEF OF STAFF."

Wynn and Loomis stride through a plush reception area.  DAWN, an 
attractive, high-energy secretary, keeps pace, taking notes, handing 
Wynn his briefcase, phone messages, etc.
          
          WYNN
     Cancel all my appointments.  Get Dr. Loomis 
     anything he needs -- files, tests, records of 
     every treatment ever administered to a former 
     patient of ours -- Michael Myers.
          
          DAWN
        (stunned)
     Michael Myers?

Wynn stops abruptly before heading out the door.
          
          WYNN
     That's right.  We think there's a very good 
     chance he might still be alive.

Loomis acknowledges Wynn's silent understanding.

CORRIDOR

Wynn and Loomis move along a sterile white corridor.  Wynn uses his 
key card to BUZZ them through a series of metal security cages.  A 
retinue of DOCTORS and NURSES fall in behind.
          
          WYNN
        (continuing)
     Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on 
     our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We 
     go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours. 
        (beat)
     If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
          
          LOOMIS
     Or what's left of him.

They cut down a sub-passageway and out a fire exit.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis and Wynn dash across a windswept field where a Smith's Grove 
medical transport helicopter awaits them.  The deafening WHINE of 
spinning rotors as a TECHNICIAN refuels.

The doctors step inside.  The doors close and the helicopter lifts 
off, rising high above the cluster of the white coats below.
               
                    CUT TO:

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

A blender whips up a revolting concoction of chocolate Yoo-Hoo, 
banana yogurt and chewy Gummi-worms as Tim, wearing Levi's baggies 
and a "Harry Simms Kicks Ass" T-shirt, raps on the phone.
          
          TIM
     Bro', I knew Harry when we lived in the city.  
     Don't worry -- he'll be there. We've got 
     everything arranged.  Get with me tonight at 
     the fair and I'll hook you up.  Peace.

Tim hangs up, guzzling down his shake as Debra navigates around him, 
setting out the breakfast dishes as Kara tries to study.

John, dressed in what might be a respectable business suit if it fit 
him better, mutters grumpily as he pours himself a cup of coffee.
          
          JOHN
     Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed 
     them ...
          
          DEBRA
     Relax, John.  They were just kids.
          
          JOHN
     Kids are what's ruining this country. 
     Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn 
     respect.

Tim lets out a huge BELCH as he finishes drinking his breakfast.
          
          JOHN
        (continuing)
     See what I'm talkin' about?
          
          DEBRA
     You'll never pass that exam on an empty 
     stomach, Kara.

Debra snatches the book out of Kara's hands.
          
          DEBRA
        (continuing; reading)
     Cognitive Therapy and Emotional Disorders?  
     What are they teaching in college these days?  
     The art of going crazy?
          
          KARA
        (indignant)
     It's called psychology, Mom.  Living in this 
     house is what's driving me crazy.
          
          JOHN
     Who the hell told you to come live here in the 
     first place?

Kara rises, collects her books, trying to avoid a confrontation.
          
          KARA
     I'd better get Danny to school.
          
          JOHN
     She don't show her face for five years, then 
     expects us to roll out the red carpet.  You 
     think going to college is gonna make up for 
     your mistakes, girl?
          
          DEBRA
     John, please don't --
          
          TIM
     Yo', just lay off her, Dad.

Suddenly Danny runs in, showing off in his dinosaur costume.  
ROARING loudly.  Startling John.
          
          JOHN
     What the fuck --

Kara immediately seizes Danny's hand and ushers him toward the back 
door.
          
          KARA
     Let's go, Danny.
          
          DEBRA
     Kara, wait.  John.  Can't we all just sit 
     down?  Try to be a family for once?
          
          KARA
     I'm sorry, Mom.

Debra reaches into her purse and hands Kara a couple of dollars.
          
          JOHN
     That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash.  
     While you're at it, why don't you just give her 
     all our goddamn money?!

John explodes, dumping the entire contents of her purse onto the 
floor.  Debra recoils.  Kara steps in.  Danny is terrified.
          
          KARA
     Stay away from her, you bastard.
          
          JOHN
        (re Danny)
     I only see one bastard in this house.

Kara flies at him with Medea-like rage.  John instantly grabs her by 
the neck and shoves her violently against the counter.
          
          TIM
     Dad!  Let her go!
          
          DEBRA
     John!  Stop it!  Stop it!

Danny looks outside.  Frozen in horror.  A VOICE whispers.
          
          WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
     Kill him, Danny ... Kill him ...

Danny moves across the kitchen.  Mesmerized.  Through the screen 
door, the Shape can be seen standing in the back yard.

Kara's eyes bulge as John squeezes her throat.  Choking her.
          
          JOHN
     You ever raise your hand to me again, I'll kill 
     you, you understand?

John looks down to see the tip of a butcher knife pointed at his 
groin.  Danny is holding it -- his eyes dark, emotionless.  Ever so 
slowly, John releases Kara.  Debra and Tim watch in horrified 
astonishment.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the back door.  Kara dives toward 
Danny.  The knife clatters to the floor as she picks him up, grabs 
her book bag and hurtles outside.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BACK YARD (CONTINUOUS)

BETH, 19, very "retro," cute in the waifish sense -- milky white 
skin, two-tone hair and a dangling nose ring --is nearly bowled off 
the back porch as Kara and Danny fly out the door.
          
          BETH
     Make way for the Hardin County Express. 
        (following them across the yard)
     Hey, where's Tim?  We're supposed to go over 
     the list of events for tonight --

Beth is taken aback when she sees the bruise on Kara's neck.
          
          BETH
        (continuing)
     He do that to you?
          
          KARA
     Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the 
     Strode house.
          
          BETH
     Pig.  What the hell happened this time?

Suddenly Tim jumps out from behind a clothesline, locking his arms 
around Beth, attacking her with kisses.
          
          BETH
        (continuing)
     Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
          
          TIM
     Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to 
     organnize this friggin' fair? It's only 
     Halloween.

Beth shoves the clipboard at him, a champion of her cause.
          
          BETH
     How many times o I have to tell you? It's not 
     about Halloween.  It's about being political.  
     There are too many people with corn-cobs up 
     their ass in this town telling us what we can 
     and can't do.  If we want change, it's up to us 
     to set an example.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (SAME)

Debra is on the floor, stifling her tears, putting things back in 
her purse.  John stares coldly out the window.
          
          JOHN
     I want her and that kid out of here tonight.

Debra rises, facing him scornfully.
          
          DEBRA
     I thought inheriting your father's house ... 
     the business ... moving out here might change 
     things.  But you're still the same, John. 
        (with finality)
     Kara has come home, and I'll be damned if I let 
     you turn her away again.

Debra storms off.  John bores holes into her with his eyes.

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (SAME)

Tim lifts Danny into the back seat of Beth's convertible VW Bug -- 
plastered with "Greenpeace" and "This is Your Brain on Drugs" bumper 
stickers.  Kara and Beth in front.
          
          TIM
     Whatever happened to women in back?
          
          BETH
     Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.

Pulling away from the curb, Beth honks at MRS. BLANKENSHIP, at least 
80, owner of the student boarding house across the street.
          
          BETH
        (continuing)
     See you tonight, Mrs. Blankenship!

The old woman just stares forward.  A gardem hose in hand as she 
waters a garden of long-dead flowers.

Kara shields her eyes, distracted, looking up at the old Victorian 
house.

KARA'S P.O.V.

Beth drives down a shady, tree-lined avenue, unaware of the white 
van that is following them.
          
          KARA
     Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall 
     from you?
          
          BETH
     Why?  You interested?
          
          KARA
     No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window.  
     Watching me.
          
          BETH
     You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale 
     he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary 
     shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed 
     up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably 
     just lonely.

Tim leans forward, ravaging Beth's neck.
          
          TIM
     Or horny.
          
          KARA
     Tim, do you always have to act like such an 
     asshole?
          
          TIM
     Only when you're around to dump on ... Hey, 
     chill, sis.  I'm just doggin' ya.

Suddenly the van ROARS by and cuts them off.  Beth lays on the 
HORN.  Slams on the brakes.  Narrowly avoiding a collision.
          
          BETH
     Speed kills, asshole!

Suddenly the van swerves around to face the VW head on.  For a 
breathless moment the van and the VW sit at opposite ends of the 
intersection.  Idling.  A tense stand-off.
          
          KARA
     Who is that ...

Kara strains to get a look at the van's driver.  A momentary glimpse 
of a pale white face behind the wheel.
          
          BETH
        (bravely)
     I've got my pepper spray.

Danny sits frozen in the back seat.  Suddenly the van shoots 
forward, tires SCREAMING.  Startled GASPS.  The van turns off 
sharply at the last second, SCREECHING down the next block.
          
          TIM
        (relieved)
     Happy fuckin' Halloween.
          
          BETH
     Someone's trying to scare us out of having this 
     fair ... and it's not gonna work.

Beth drives on, grimly determined.  Kara looks back at Danny.  He 
returns her frightened gaze.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Tommy paces in his cramped apartment.  Dark circles under his eyes.  
A remote control in hand, reviewing his recording of last night's 
Harry Simms broadcast:
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     So they're trying to kill you and your baby.  
     Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be 
     Rosemary.
          
          JAMIE (V.O.)
     No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming 
     for me and my baby.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's 
     coming?
          
          JAMIE (V.O.)
     It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!

Frustrated, Tommy plays it again.  Adjusts the speed.  Tries to make 
out something else in the b.g.  Jamie's voice comes through.  Slow.  
Eerie.
          
          JAMIE (V.O.)
        (continuing; slowed)
     It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!

Another VOICE, distant and distorted, filters up behind hers.
          
          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
     Bus 611 from Russellville now arriving.

Tommy quickly stops the tape, throws on his worn leather bomber 
jacket and bolts straight out the door.

MOVE IN on a pair of old newspaper clippings left on the floor.  
Headlines read:  "November 5, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD STILL MISSING."  
"November 19, 1989.  MYERS' NIECE PRESUMED DEAD."
               
                    DISSOLVE TO:

INT. FORD EXPLORER / EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - MORNING

Tommy drives like a bat out of hell.  The "Greyhound" sign looms 
ahead.

EXT. BUS DEPOT - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

The Explorer pulls up to the depot.  Tommy makes a beeline for the 
entrance, cowboy boots splashing through rain puddles.

INT. BUS DEPOT (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy wades his way through a small crowd up to the ticket booth.  A 
cross-eyed ATTENDANT greets him.
          
          ATTENDANT
     Can I help you, sir?
          
          TOMMY
     Can you tell me if a bus arrived from 
     Russellville last night?

The Attendant checks her roster.
          
          ATTENDANT
     Sure did.  About seven hours ago.  You lookin' 
     for someone --
          
          TOMMY
        (walking away)
     Thank you.

The Attendant eyes Tommy suspiciously as he enters the phone booth 
in the corner.  Inside, he picks up the receiver and pretends to 
dial a number.  Makes a cursory inspection.

TOMMY'S P.O.V. - PHONE BOOTH

On the floor, tiny droplets of what appear to be blood form a dotted 
trail out the door.

TOMMY

follows the crimson path around the corner down a dim hallway, 
stopping at the door marked "Ladies Room."  Checking first to make 
sure the coast is clear, he steps furtively inside.

INT. LADIES' ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy walks past the sink.  Water drips into the filthy basin.  He 
touches something inside, rubs it on his fingers -- blood.

Tommy whirls, startled by a sudden NOISE.  Muffled, indistinct.  
Like CRYING.  Tommy gathers his courage as he slowly moves past the 
long row of empty stalls.  The CRIES grow louder as he reaches the 
final stall.  Jamie's escape route -- the window -- still wide open.

A hole in the wall behind the toilet.  Tommy reaches in, his hands 
locking onto something.  Shock and amazement overcome him when he 
lifts out a baby -- Jamie's baby.
          
          TOMMY
     Jesus ...

The helpless newborn kicks and CRIES, the triangular symbol of Thorn 
still caked in blood over his tiny torso.

SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

Someone partially opens the door, peering in from the hallway as 
Tommy removes his jacket and bundles the baby inside.
          
          TOMMY
     Okay, little guy.  You're okay.

BACK TO SCENE

A CREAK.  Tommy looks up.  The door slowly closes.

DEPOT HALLWAY

Tommy looks into shadowy stillness.  No one there.  Hiding the baby, 
cradling his jacket, he hurries through the crowd and slinks out the 
door marked ENTRANCE.
               
                    SHOCK CUT TO:

HELICOPTER P.O.V.

The SOUND of THWACKING BLADES as we FLY past a winding rural highway 
over a dense grove of oak trees -- massive, ancient guardians of the 
sprawling pumpkin patch that lies beyond.

As we circle the field, red-and-blue gum machines -- police cars, 
fire engines and ambulances -- can be seen through gauzy veils of 
rising BLACK SMOKE, dissipating with the strong WIND.

Charred in the ground, three intersecting lines stretch a hundred 
feet across the plan to form a vivid geoglyphic.  The symbol of 
Thorn.
          
          HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)
        (filtered)
     Chopper One to Smith's Grove.  We've got a 
     visual.  Approximately ten miles due east of 
     Haddonfield.

INT. HELICOPTER (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis surveys the crash site with morbid fascination.  Wynn, 
wearing headphones, shouts over the noise.
          
          WYNN
        (pointing)
     What is that?
          
          LOOMIS
     It's a sign.  He's come home.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

The helicopter lands, windmilling gusts of ashen earth.  Loomis and 
Wynn jump out, ducking past the spinning blades.

We FOLLOW them through EMERGENCY CREWS and a few CURIOSITY-SEEKERS 
toward the center of attention.  A charred body is lifted from the 
eviscerated, flame-blackened pikcup truck.

A few feet away, a team of PARAMEDICS work frantically around 
another body, hidden among a cluster of pumpkins.

Loomis surges forward, at once halted by an armed DEPUTY.

          DEPUTY
     Sir, you'll have to step back.
          
          LOOMIS
     Please.  I need to see the sheriff.
          
          WYNN
     Official business.

Wynn flashes his badge.  The Deputy gives them a vexed glance.
          
          DEPUTY
     Wait here.

Loomis's eyes flicker with nervous anticipation.  The Deputy 
whispers something to SHERIFF JIM HOLDT, a brooding giant of a man 
who dons a Stetson, holstered .44 Special and steel-toed boots that 
give new meaning to the term "bad ass."

Even Loomis steps back as the sheriff lumbers toward them.
          
          LOOMIS
        (extends his hand)
     You must be Sheriff Holdt.

Holdt responds by stubbing out his Marlboro at Loomis's foot.
          
          HOLDT
     As a matter of fact, I am.  And I take it 
     you're the infamous Dr. Loomis.
          
          LOOMIS
     I'd like to introduce you to Terence Wynn, the 
     Chief of Staff at --
          
          HOLDT
     Smith's Grove.  They told me you'd be coming.  
     Now I suggest you fly right on back to your 
     crackpot asylum.  You people got no business in 
     my town.
          
          LOOMIS
     Michael Myers is my business.

Holdt towers above him.
          
          HOLDT
     I want you to listen and listen good, Loomis.  
     Things have been quiet for six years and that's 
     the way they're gonna stay.  The last thing we 
     need is you spouting off your ghost stories.

As usual, Loomis isn't easily intimidated.
          
          LOOMIS
     I suppose it was a ghost that did all this.  A 
     ghost who called the radio station last night.  
     Maybe that same ghost is lying over there right 
     now.

Holdt fumes, ready to boil when --
          
          DEPUTY
     Sheriff!  She's alive!

Holdt and Loomis wade through the crush of paramedics, running 
alongside the stretcher being whisked toward an ambulance.

A large knife extruding from a girl's stomach, packed under sterile 
gauze.  Skin pasty-white.  Lips blue from shock.
          
          LOOMIS
     Dear God ... Jamie!
               
                    CUT TO:

EXT. HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE - PARKING LOT - MORNING

Beth's car pulls into the parking lot of a picturesque, impeccably 
landscaped campus, speckled with colorful leaves.  A buzz of 
excitement fills the autumn air.

Tim and Beth are surprised to see a small crowd -- camped out in 
sleeping bags, holding "We Love to Hate Harry" signs.
          
          TIM
     Yo, check it out.  They've been lining up all 
     night just to see Harry. 
        (to Kara)
     You lose your mind in that thing, Kara?

Kara is nervously rifling through her enormous book bag.
          
          KARA
     I can't find my term paper.
          
          TIM
     So copy someone else's.  I do it all the time.  
     Works primo.

Armed with her clipboard, Beth is assailed by her COMMITTEE.  
Inundating her with QUESTIONS.
          
          BETH
     Give us victory or give us death.  See you 
     tonight, Kara!

Tim and Beth are swept away.  A large sheet of paper falls out of 
Kara's bag.  She picks it up, startled by what she sees.

KARA'S P.O.V. - THE DRAWING

Crayola figures of Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle Tim, and Mommy.  Knives 
piercing them.  Blood dripping.  Mouths screaming.  A black shadow 
figure bearing the word "THORN."

On the flip side, the drawing she found last night.  Danny's 
scribbling of the odd triangular symbol.

BACK TO SCENE

The horrifying images send chills up Kara's spine.
          
          KARA
     Thorn ...

Lost in grim reverie, Kara walks on, oblivious to the activity all 
around her ...

A banner hangs from the eaves of the library:  "HADDONFIELD JR. 
COLLEGE - FIRST ANNUAL HARVEST FAIRE."

Tim and Beth supervise as preparations for tonight's event get 
underway.

STUDENT VOLUNTEERS nailing together booths, hanging decorations.  A 
half-assembled Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, an ominous-looking 
House of Horrors.

Rounding the corner onto the quiet path behind the library, Kara 
suddenly finds herself alone.  WIND whips at her hair.  She glances 
over her shoulder, as if sensing a presence.

KARA'S P.O.V.

No one is there.  Just the rustling of leaves on the ground.

ANGLE ON KARA

Walking off in the distance.  Suddenly the Shape steps shockingly 
into FRAME, watching her disappear around the corner.
               
                    SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. HADDONFIELD MEMORIAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

Doors BLAST open.  The stretcher holding Jamie is pushed through, 
Loomis right beside her.  Wynn follows, trying to stop him.  A 
SHOCK-TRAUMA unit swarms in.  No time to lose.
          
          PARAMEDIC
     Penetrating abdominal trauma.  Massive blood 
     loss.  We've given her two units of O-negative 
     stat and dextran.  BP sixty.  Pulse one-twenty 
     ... Somehow she pulled through out there all 
     night!

DR. BONHAM, the ER resident, peels off the sheet, exposing a dark 
sea of blood around the enormous knife still jutting from Jamie's 
stomach.  Bonham stares, incredulous.
          
          DR. BONHAM
     How can this girl still be alive?! Type and 
     cross-match for another six units!  Get a CT 
     scan and move her into surgery. 
        (re Loomis and Wynn)
     And get them out of here!

ORDERLIES move in.  Loomis won't release Jamie's hand.
          
          WYNN
     Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
          
          LOOMIS
     I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live.  
     You have to.

HOSPITAL ENTRANCE / ADMITTANCE DESK

Pneumatic doors fly open.  Tommy bursts through, holding the baby in 
his jacket.  PATIENTS and COPS everywhere.  He hones in on the NURSE 
behind the admittance desk.
          
          TOMMY
     I need to see a doctor.
          
          NURSE
     What seems to be the problem?
          
          TOMMY
     I-it's a baby -- my baby.  There's been -- been 
     an accident.
          
          NURSE
     What kind of an accident?
          
          TOMMY
        (explodes)
     Just get me a doctor right now!

ADJACENT HALLWAY

Wynn and Loomis skirt past a line of SECURITY GUARDS.
          
          WYNN
     There's nothing more you can do for her.

The shrill sound of Wynn's beeper.  He clicks it.
          
          WYNN
        (continuing)
     I'll be right back.

Wynn disappears around the corner.  Loomis wanders off alone.
          
          TOMMY (O.S.)
     Dr. Loomis!

Loomis reacts, taken aback by the frantic young man bounding toward 
him.
          
          LOOMIS
     Yes?
          
          TOMMY
     Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard 
     her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
          
          LOOMIS
     I'm sorry, but do I know you --
          
          TOMMY
     I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- 
     Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me 
     that night --

Loomis suddenly recognizes him.  It's been a very long time.
          
          LOOMIS
     Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
          
          TOMMY
     Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael 
     Myers come home?

Loomis pulls Tommy aside into an empty alcove.
          
          LOOMIS

          TOMMY
     I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they 
     want us to believe he's dead.  But I know.  
     I've always known.

     Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie 
     Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She

     No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.

Tommy hesitates.  Loomis's eyes are drawn enigmatically to the 
infant in Tommy's arms.
          
          TOMMY
        (continuing; startled realization)
     Oh, God -- his cousins.  The Strodes. They're 
     living in the Myers house!

Loomis's face flls with horror.  Tommy sees the Admittance Nurse, 
flanked by a pair of security guards, walking his way.
          
          TOMMY

     I gotta go.

Tommy bolts toward the exit.  Loomis tries to stop him.

     Tommy, wait!

But he is gone.  A hand taps Loomis's shoulder; he reels.  Wynn.

We peer OVER THE SHOULDER of the Shape, standing across the street.  
Watching Debra, in jeans and a rumpled sweatshirt, collecting 
left-over painting supplies from the front porch.

Debra starts to open the CREAKY screen door when she notices the axe 
John had used earlier.  Clumsily picks it up and slides it through 
the top of the crate she is holding.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (CONTINUOUS)

Laden with her heavy load, Debra nudges the door shut with her 
foot.  Then crosses to another door -- the cellar door.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Debra, silhouetted at the top of the stairs, hits a light switch; a 
naked bulb springs to life.  Slowly she descends the rickety 
staircase.

The basement, pitch dark save for a spear of sunlight shooting 
through an elevated window, is overrun with cobwebs, rusted tools 
and broken bicycle parts.  A clunker of a washing machine RATTLES in 
the corner.

Debra makes space for the crate in a storage cabinet.  Suddenly the 
washing machine stops.  Nonplissed, she moves toward it.  Lifts the 
lid.  The bed sheets inside are sopping wet.

Opening the electrical fuse box, she flicks a switch back and forth 
a few times -- but the washing machine doesn't respond.
          
          DEBRA
     Great.

Frustrated, Debra looks down to see a large puddle of water forming 
on the floor.

Debra hauls a laundry basket upstairs, filled with wet sheets.  She 
turns, startled.  The front door is standing wide open.

Just as she goes to shut it, a man steps out from the living room 
behind her.  She gasps, dropping the basket; it's Loomis.
          
          LOOMIS
     I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.

Debra shudders at the sight of the beguiling, wide-eyed man.

The SOUND of JANGLING KEYS.  A door UNLOCKING.  Tommy scrambles in, 
the baby iin one arm, a bag of groceries under the other.

With a single swipe, he clears away the junk on his futin, then 
carefully lays down the CRYING infant.  He digs through the bag:  
Baby Wipes.  Diapers.  Formula.  Bottles.
          
          TOMMY
     Shhh.  Okay, okay, Kyle.  You like that name?  
     Yeah, I think it suits you.

Quickly he scans the directions on the formula.  Pours the liquid 
into a bottle, nukes it in the microwave, then returns to the 
business at hand.

Tommy grimaces at the mess inside his leather bomber.  The baby 
CRIES harder.

Armed with Baby Wipe and a diaper, Tommy goes to work.

Blood-chilling SCREAMS as we MOVE rapidly through a BLINDING TUNNEL 
OF LIGHT.  Blurred, indistinct images.  FIGURES wearing long white 
coats flash along sterile walls.

As we BLAST around corners, we realize we are seeing from the P.O.V. 
of a girl being pushed forward on a gurney.  It is Jamie.

Her arm injected with a sedative.  Eyes lolling.  Succumbing.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - MOVING (DREAM SEQUENCE)

Even more DISTORTED now, images swirling at random.  Cold, staring 
FACES.  Flashing lights on a wall panel:  "3-2-1-B" -- an elevator.  
Going down.  Down.  Beneath the basement level.

The doors open.  The gurney SLAMS out into DARKNESS.  VOICES ECHO.  
Lighted torches flicker on craggy walls.
          
          JAMIE (O.S.)
     Please -- don't let him do this to me.
          
          VOICE (O.S.)
     We're not going to hurt you, Jamie.  He chose 
     you.  Now it's time.

SHAPE'S P.O.V.

Pacing back and forth behind iron bars, agitated, disturbed.  SEEING 
Jamie strapped to a table.  Surrounded by robed figures.  CHANTING.  
Weakly, Jamie reaches out toward the cell.
          
          JAMIE
     Please, Michael ... Help me.

Suddenly a long SHADOW fills the room.  The P.O.V. becomes more 
restless as the Stranger glides toward Jamie and disrobes.  The 
figures close the circle.  Jamie SCREAMS in terror.

The Shape's hands SLAM violently against the iron bars, a horrific 
SHUDDER of metal as we
               
                    SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT (SAME)

Jamie's eyes flash open!  A dark shadow fills the room.  The 
Stranger descends on her!

Gloved hand covers Jamie's mouth.  A switchblade FLICKS open.
          
          WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
     Your work is done, Jamie.

The glinting blade SLASHES across Jamie's throat, cutting off her 
soundless scream!

Then the Stranger flows out of the room.  Spurs CLANKING.  Like a 
thief in the night.  The shrill sound of a BEEPER going off as we
               
                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HADDONFIELD STREETS - NIGHT - SERIES OF SHOTS

The dark blanket of night envelops the little town.  The LIGHTS of 
the fair twinkle in the distance, bright and beckoning.

Families -- men, women and children alike -- turn out from their 
homes wearing COSTUMES, joining a growing procession along the 
peaceful streets of Haddonfield.

A large group of PROTESTORS carry PICKET SIGNS in front of the 
campus gates.  Rallying against the celebration.

Haddonfield's finest out in full force, squad cars sweeping 
alongside a black STRETCH LIMO as it makes its way through town.  
Tinted windows make it impossible to see inside.

EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT / HARVEST FAIR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Tim and Beth, standouts as punk versions of Frankenstein and his 
bride, stride purposefully toward the fair entrance.  Beth is a 
jumble of nerves as she runs down her checklist of events.
          
          BETH
     Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving 
     jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the 
     school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the 
     tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm 
     forgetting something!
          
          TIM
     Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you 
     Harry would be here?

The limo crawls into the parking lot.  A stampede of overzealous 
FANS surge past them.
          
          BETH
     That's what worries me.

Tim and Beth move into the fair, with all its noise and colorful 
movement.

ANOTHER ANGLE

KIDS waving signs and T-shirts.  Throwing themselves at the 
windows.  Frenzied CLAMORING.  Harry-mania abound.

The WKNB van parks parallel to the steps of the library, adorned 
with HAREM GIRLS and a large golden throne.  The side door opens.  A 
red carpet is rolled out.

A tall, imposing figure emerges from the van and walks up the 
steps.  Spurs CLANKING on black boots.  "Jesse James" style duster.  
Hat cocked slightly.
          
          HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
     Hellllo, Haddonfield!!!

The crowd turns in a mass of confusion.  Standing above them, waving 
from a microphone, is HARRY.  Dark sunglasses.  Gaunt, glacial 
features and an outrageous mane of black hair.

Suddenly Harry throws open his duster -- flashing them -- revealing 
that he has nothing on beneath except his boots and a pair of bright 
orange boxer shorts that say "HAPPY HALLOWEEN."

The kids go insane.

ANGLE ON LOOMIS

Making his way through the teeming crowd.  Walkie-talkie in hand.  
The helicopter zooms overhead.  Wynn's voice squawks over garbled 
RADIO CHATTER.  Conducting a surveillance by air.
          
          WYNN (V.O.)
        (filtered)
     There's more people moving eastbound down Old 
     Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
          
          LOOMIS
        (into walkie-talkie)
     Any word on the location of the Strodes?
          
          WYNN (V.O.)
     No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
          
          LOOMIS
     Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on 
     that house.

Suddenly Loomis is waylaid by a giant wall of a man -- Sheriff 
Holdt.  Loomis meets his fiery gaze.
          
          HOLDT
     I'm warning you, Loomis -- stay out of my way.  
     You may have had free reign when Ben Meeker was 
     sheriff, God rest his soul, but I'm in charge 
     now.  And I'm not about to stand by and watch 
     you turn this night into some kind of sadistic 
     witch hunt.
          
          WYNN (V.O.)
     Sam, I just got word from the hospital. You'd 
     better get over there right away.
          
          LOOMIS
        (into walkie-talkie)
     What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
          
          WYNN (V.O.)
     I'll meet you over there.

Loomis tears off.  Holdt stares brazenly, throwing down his 
cigarette.  Crushes it under his boot and slowly follows him.
               
                    CUT TO:

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY - NIGHT

Carrying the CRYING baby, Tommy leads Kara and Danny into the lobby 
of the vintage boarding home.  Polished wood.  Framed old 
paintings.  Wall-to-wall Tiffany lamps.

Mrs. Blankenship sits behind the front desk, oblivious to the 
GRINDING and SCREAMING on the television as "The Texas Chain Saw 
Massacre" reaches its horrific climax on the annual Horrorthon.
          
          TOMMY
     Quiet around here tonight, huh, Mrs. B.?

As usual, the senile old woman doesn't reply.
          
          KARA
        (indignantly; to Tommy)
     Do you mind telling me what this is all about?  
     Tim and Beth are waiting for us.

Tommy ushers Kara and Danny up the stairs.  Mrs. Blankenship stares 
at the boy -- the kind of stare that would send most kids running 
for their moms.  But Danny is undaunted.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (CONTINUOUS)

The door opens.  Kara is repulsed by the sight of Tommy's musty, 
unkempt apartment.
          
          DANNY
     Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
          
          KARA
        (to Tommy)
     You can't expect us to stay here --

Tommy adjusts the blinds on the window looking out on the Myers 
house.
          
          TOMMY
     I want you to watch your house.  You can see 
     everything from this window.

Kara glares, reminded of last night.
          
          KARA
     Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I 
     supposed to be looking for?
          
          TOMMY
     Him.

Tommy flashes a newspaper article in front of her.  One we've seen 
eariler:  "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OF ALIVE?"

The baby's SCREAMS are verging on overload.  Tommy dashes to the 
recessed kitchen area and heats up another bottle.

As Kara reads, Danny tugs at his mother's blouse.
          
          DANNY
     Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun 
     stuff!
          
          KARA
        (snapping)
     Danny, you're just going to have to wait!

Danny plods off.  Kara hands Tommy a nipple for the bottle.  Their 
eyes lock for a beat.  He takes it.
          
          TOMMY
     Shhh.  It's okay, Kyle.  Just give me one 
     more -- 
        (the microwave BEEPS)
     -- second.  There you go, big guy.

Kara looks on as Tommy attempts to feed the baby.  Despite his 
clumsiness, she's undeniably moved.

Behind them, Danny's imagination kicks into high gear as he drives a 
Power Ranger over an invisible race track.  On the floor.  Across 
the windowsill.  Glancing across the street.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE

Standing below on the front lawn is the Shape, silhouetted under a 
moonlit tree.  Looking right at Danny.

BACK TO SCENE

Danny backs away, terrified.  Tommy and Kara are too concerned with 
the baby to notice.
          
          TOMMY
     God, what's wrong with him?
          
          KARA
     Here.  Let me try.

Tommy gingerly hands the baby over to her.  Instantaneously, Kyle's 
CRIES subside.
          
          KARA
        (continuing; fawning)
     There.  All it takes is a mother's touch.

For one fleeting moment, Tommy and Kara find themselves smiling at 
one another.  Unaware as Danny glides silently out the door.  
Tommy's expression darkens once again.  A man possessed.
          
          TOMMY
     Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know.  
     Now I'm afraid he could be next.
          
          KARA
     Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
          
          TOMMY
     Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family. 
        (reaching toward Kyle)
     Here.  Look at this.

Tommy opens the baby's quilt, revealing the blood mark smeared over 
his torso.  Kara's face registers terrified recognition.
          
          TOMMY
        (continuing)
     It was there when I found him this morning.  It 
     looks like some kind of letter or number or --
          
          KARA
     It's a rune ... Thorn.
               
               CUT TO:

INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM / HALLWAY - NIGHT

POLICE on the scene.  A crying NURSE gives a statement.  A CRIME 
SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER snapps photographs as Jamie's bloody corpse is 
covered over with a white sheet.

Loomis stands frozen in horror.  Tears in his eyes.
          
          LOOMIS
     Jamie ... I failed you again.  I never should 
     have left you.

He spins, pouncing on Sheriff Holdt.
          
          LOOMIS
        (continuing)
     Now will you do something?!  How many more 
     innocent people have to die?!

Wynn restrains him.  Pulls him away.  The sheriff doesn't budge.
          
          WYNN
     Don't do this to yourself, Sam.  Let's go.  
     Come on.

Wynn ushers Loomis out of the room.  Holdt stares apathetically.

HALLWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn tries to calm Loomis down.  Jamie's doctor approaches.
          
          DR. BONHAM
     Dr. Loomis?
          
          WYNN
     What is it?
          
          DR. BONHAM
     I'm very sorry ...
          
          LOOMIS
     You let it get to her.  How could you?
          
          DR. BONHAM
     Dr. Loomis, there's something else you should 
     know.  During surgery, we discovered that 
     Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging.  We found 
     this. 
        (displays a small vital)
     It's placental fluid.
          
          LOOMIS
     God in heaven.  You don't tell me she was --
          
          DR. BONHAM
     I estimate she gave birth no more than a few 
     hours before the attack.
          
          WYNN
     Then where's her baby?

Jamie's covered body is wheeled out past them.  Loomis regards Wynn 
with a look of abject fear.
          
          LOOMIS
     I think I may already know ...
               
                    CUT TO:

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (SAME)

CLOSE ON a chapter heading.  "Thorn - The Devil's Rune."  Beneath 
it, a bold depiction of the familiar Thorn triangle.

PULL BACK to REVEAL Tommy poring over the old library book.  Kara 
paces, rocking the baby, feeding him with the bottle.
          
          KARA
     Runes were a kind of early alphabet that 
     originated in Northern Europe thousands of 
     years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of 
     stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, 
     Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults 
     used them in blood rituals to portend future 
     events and invoke magic.
          
          TOMMY
     Black magic ... 
        (reads)
     'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause 
     sickness, famine and death. Translated 
     literally, it was the name of a demon spirit 
     that delivered human sacrifices ... on the 
     Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
          
          KARA
     Halloween.
          
          TOMMY
     'When applied directly to another person, Thorn 
     could be used to call upon them confusion and 
     destruction -- to literally visit them with the 
     Devil.'

Tommy jumps up, frantically moving around the apartment, collecting 
his jacket, his keys -- a gun.
          
          KARA
        (terrified)
     Where are you going?
          
          TOMMY
     To find the rest of your family before Michael 
     Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling 
     him.

An ominous CLICK as Tommy loads a cartridge into his gun.  He bolts 
toward the door.  Finds it standing wide open.  Kara freezes, 
noticing for the first time that Danny is missing.
          
          KARA
     Oh, God -- Where's Danny? Kara flies down the 
     hall, the baby in her arms.  Tommy moves out 
     right behind her.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS)

Kara and Tommy barrel downstairs, searching frantically.
          
          KARA
     Danny?!  Danny!
          
          TOMMY
     Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy 
     who came in with me and --

They find Mrs. Blankenship and Danny sitting side by side, watching 
the Horrorthon.  A bowl of popcorn between them.
          
          KARA
        (grabs him)
     Danny, don't ever walk off without telling me 
     where you're going!

Danny looks at her.  A blank, hollow stare.  The old woman's eyes 
glitter madly.
          
          MRS. BLANKENSHIP
     The voice.  He hears the voice.  Just like the 
     other little boy who used to live in that 
     house.

Tommy throws on his jacket and opens the front door.
          
          TOMMY
     Take the kids upstairs, lock the door and wait 
     for me. 
        (beat)
     And Kara, whatever you do -- don't go back to 
     your house.

Kara watches fearfully as Tommy heads out the door.  Leaving her 
alone with the children.

EXT. HOUSES / STREET - NIGHT

Wind MOANS.  Dead leaves blow across the WINDY lane as Tommy flies 
down the path of the Blankenship house and hops into his Explorer.  
The Shape suddenly RISES INTO FRAME.  Watching him peel off down the 
block.  Taillights disappearing.

A moment later, another car rambles up the street, swerving 
erratically into the driveway of the Myers house.

The Shape watches.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

The car parks.  Sits in silence.  Suddenly the driver's side door 
opens, emblazoned with the "Strode Realty" emblem.

John spills out, collar unbuttoned, tie dangling.  Picking himself 
up, he staggers out of the garage.  Laughing.  Singing.
          
          JOHN
     ... Pretty woman, walking down the street ... 
     Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

FOLLOW John's circuitous route across the front lawn, stumbling over 
one of Danny's toys on his way up the porch steps.
          
          JOHN
     Damn kid ... this is my house ...

John fumbles wth his key, estimates the location of the lock.  He 
turns the knob -- but the door's jammed.  Chain-locked.
          
          JOHN
        (continuing)
     What the fuck ... 
        (yelling inside)
     ... Debra, open this goddamn door before I 
     break it down!  You got to three ... 
        (no response)
     ... One ... Two ... 
        (still no response)
     ... Two and a half ...

John slams his weight against the door.  It doesn't budge.

Grumbling, John totters off the porch, trying to hold himself 
steady.  Skirting along the side of the house.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS)

John sways in through the back door and flicks on a light.  Strains 
for lucidity.  No one in the kitchen.
          
          JOHN
     Debra -- I'm home!

No answer.  John shrugs and moves to the stove.  Opens the lid on a 
pasta cooker.  Nothing inside.
          
          JOHN
        (continuing; mutters)
     Work all day and not even any supper ...

Frustrated, John opens the freezer and removes a frozen dinner.  
Tears open the box and pops it in the microwave.  Then he flounders 
down the dark alley, knocking picture frames awry.

LIVING ROOM / FOYER

Darkness, save for a glowing jack-o'-lantern.  John stands there, 
listing.  Bewildered.

Then he switches on a lamp, kicks off his shoes and crashes onto his 
lumpy old recliner.
          
          JOHN
     All right ... You can all come out now ...

Still no reply.  John sneers, flicks on the television with the 
remote control and settles back into his chair.

INSERT - TELEVISION

A scene from another horror movie.  A boy shreds his pumpkin mask as 
a mass of beetles and snakes pour out of his skull.

BACK TO SCENE
          
          JOHN
     What is this shit?

Disgusted, he switches channels to the local NEWS.  A shrill BEEP 
from the kitchen startles him.  The microwave.

KITCHEN

John waddles to a drawer and removes a set of utensils.  Then he 
reaches for the microwave, opens it.  But his dinner is gone.

Spinning around, he sees the piping hot entree already sitting out 
on the kitchen table.  John double-takes, mentally retracing his 
steps.  Shrugs.

FOLLOW JOHN

as he picks up his tray and plods back down the hall.  Suddenly he 
trips over something -- the suitcase Debra had packed earlier, 
sitting smack-dead in the center of the hall.
          
          JOHN
     So this is the game you wanna play. Fine.  Go 
     ahead.  Keep it up all night ...

LIVING ROOM

John settles back into his chair and begins to eat ravenously.  
SCREAMS from the television.  He reacts.

INSERT - TELEVISION

Someone has switched it back to the horror movie.  A 
COMPUTER-GENERATED PUMPKIN causes more masked heads to EXPLODE.

BACK TO SCENE

John shakes the remote.  Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a 
shadowy figure darting by in the darkened foyer.
          
          JOHN
     Is that you, you little brat?  Danny?!

John rises, about to go for him when suddenly the power cuts out -- 
and the entire house is plunged into blackness.
          
          JOHN
        (continuing)
     When I get my hands on you, kid, you're gonna 
     wish you were never born!

John pulls a rechargeable flashlight from the wall and goes to the 
cellar door.  It stands open.  An invitation to enter.
          
          JOHN
        (continuing)
     Oh, I'm scared.  I'm really scared.

With that, John steps down into the basement.

INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)

John tentatively descends the stairs.  Barefoot.  The flashlight 
beam preceding his every step.  A RUMBLING below.

The cellar is lit only by a shaft of moonlight cutting through the 
single dusty window.  John probes around, shining the flashlight 
over cobwebs, boxes -- the puddle of water at his feet.  Now 
flooding the entire floor.

John SLOSHES through the water toward the washing machine -- which 
is running at full tact.
          
          JOHN
     What the hell --

He opens the washer lid and lifts out a water-logged sheet.  It 
drips red onto the white appliance -- blood.

John backs away, loses his footing, and slips in the water -- 
landing right at the Shape's feet.  John SCREAMS as the Shape grabs 
him by the neck, lifts him off the floor with one hand, then carries 
him across the basement and SLAMS him brutally against the open fuse 
box.

The Shape's free hand lifts an enormous butcher knife.  A loud WHAP 
as it's driven to the hilt into John's chest, through the fuse box.  
Sparks wain from the wall.  Electricity courses through John's 
writing body.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE (SAME)

Lights flash on and off in the windows.  Suddenly the entire house 
is plunged into darkness.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR (SAME)

John's toes curl.  The skin around where the knife penetrates 
FRIES.  The Shape steps back, head tilted, BREATHING steadily, 
curiously observing John's hanging, lifeless body.
               
                    CUT TO:

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT

Tommy grabs the ticket he's just paid for, hands it to an ATTENDANT 
and moves through the turnstiles amid a steady stream of REVELLERS.

Loud MUSIC, the aroma of apple cider and pumpkin pie fills the air.  
Boots selling food and crafts.  Children carving jack-o'-lanterns.  
Parents beaming with pride.

Trendy co-eds playing games.  Ducking for apples.  Shooting 
pumpkin-faced balloons with water pistols.

EXT. LIBRARY STEPS

Tim and Beth sit on either side of Harry as he interviews them 
during a live BROADCAST.  A large crowd gathered below.

     ultimate juice!
          
          HARRY SIMMS
     I'll remember that the next time my wife tells 
     me I didn't make her climax.
          
          BETH
        (impassioned)
     What Tim means is that we've taken a firm stand 
     against censorship.  Not only for Haddonfield, 
     but for every town in the nation.  Our 
     generation will not let the powers-that-be 
     control our minds, dictate what clothes we 
     wear, what music we listen to, or what holidays 
     we celebrate.

Beth's rousing speech is met by gales of enthusiastic CHEERS.
          
          HARRY
        (off-handedly)
     Have you ever considered running for public 
     office?
               
                    CUT TO:

EXT. HADDONFIELD STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

The distant SOUNDS of the celebration are carried on the wings of 
the WIND.  Howling through dark, empty streets.  Rows of deserted 
houses.  Not a soul in sight.  Preternatural stillness.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT

Kara looks nervously out a window, then walks into the parlor where 
she finds Danny sitting in the dark, glued to the Horrorthon.  
Flames CRACKLE in the fireplace, casting weird shadows.

Mrs. Blankenship sits in a wooden rocker, cradling the infant, 
humming a lullaby.

If we look closely enough, behind her in the window we can see the 
hazy shadow of the Shape looking in.
          
          KARA
     Mrs. Blankenship, what did you mean about the 
     little boy who used to live across the street?

The old woman doesn't seem to hear her.  Lost in her own world.
          
          KARA
        (continuing; insistent)
     Mrs. Blankenship, please.  This is important!

Mrs. Blankenship looks up sharply, startling Kara.
          
          MRS. BLANKENSHIP
     He heard the voice.  Same as your boy hears.
          
          KARA
     What voice?  What are you talking about?
          
          MRS. BLANKENSHIP
     The voice that spoke to Michael Myers. The one 
     that told him to kill his family.

Kara stares at her, numbed.  She gazes over at Danny, his eyes 
riveted  -- not to the TV screen.  Looking past it.  Across the 
street at the Myers house.  The haunting VOICE whispers to him.
          
          WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
     I'm coming for you, Danny ... I'm coming.
               
                    CUT TO:

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT

Tim and Beth ride high atop the Ferris wheel.  Their smiling faces 
aglow in a dizzying whirlwind of LIGHTS.  DARK CLOUDS are gathering 
in the sky, covering the moon and stars.  A light RAIN begins to 
fall.

ANGLE ON TOMMY

Walking, searching, hunting.  Past a large tent where children are 
gathering.  A sign reads:  COSTUME PAGEANT.

Tommy reacts to a terrified SCREAM.  Just a couple of teenage BOYS 
pulling an innocuously fightened GIRL onto another ride.

THE STRANGER

walks steadily past the bright lights of the Ferris wheel.

TOMMY

pushes through a dense crowd.  Suddenly he bumps shoulders with the 
Stranger.  More people pass.  There was something very sinister 
about that man.

Tommy turns to look again, eyes widening in terror.

TOMMY'S P.O.V. - STRANGER'S WRIST

Branded with the mark of Thorn!

TOMMY

removes his gun.  Flows through the crowd like a vengeful wraith.

People see the gun in his hand and back away.  Tommy surges 
forward.  The Stranger walks faster.  Gaining ground.  Toward the 
Halloween tree.

WORKERS hauling wheelbarrows loaded with jack-o'-lanterns cross his 
path.  Tommy stumbles, pumpkins spilling out all around him.

The Stranger is getting away!  Tommy picks himself up, raises the 
gun and begins FIRING shots into the air.  People SCREAM, scattering 
like insects, ducking for cover.
          
          TOMMY
     Stop that man!  Stop him!!!

Tommy races through the horrified crowd.  The Stranger keeps moving, 
never once looking back.

Suddenly SIRENS.  Squad cars converge.  Sheriff Holdt and a slew of 
OFFICERS surround Tommy.  Weapons trained.
          
          HOLDT
     Throw down the gun!  Now!!!

Tommy drops the gun.  Puts his arms up in surrender.  The cops swarm 
in, taking him.
          
          TOMMY
     Stop that man!  He's the one!

ANGLE ON FERRIS WHEEL

Beth and Tim exit the ride and follow the crowd toward the flashing 
LIGHTS of the police cruisers.
          
          TIM
     Who's gettin' busted?

Beth is stunned to see Tommy being searched spread-eagle over the 
sheriff's car.
          
          BETH
     Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
          
          TIM
     Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my 
     sister?
          
          BETH
        (worried)
     Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd 
     better go home and check on them. There's 
     nothing else for us to do here.
          
          TIM
     But they're gonna light the tree in a few 
     minutes --
          
          BETH
        (suggestively)
     We can light our own tree at home.

She brushes against Tim's crotch and saunters away.  Tim glances 
back at Tommy, then follows her like a hungry puppy.
               
               CUT TO:

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kara rushes Danny and the baby inside.  The old spinster close at 
her heels.  Releasing her dark secret.
          
          MRS. BLANKENSHIP
     I was baby-sitting for him that night. Little 
     Mikey Myers from across the street.  That's 
     when the voice told him what to do.  Same as 
     his great- grandfather.
          
          KARA
     His what?!
          
          MRS. BLANKENSHIP
     Eighteen-ninety-five.  A hundred years ago to 
     this night.  All Hallows Eve. Murdered his 
     family in that very same house.  Then the 
     townspeople burned him alive.  Our mother 
     always told us when we were children, 'Don't go 
     near the Myers house.'  We never did.
               
                    CUT TO:

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT (SAME)

The Stranger glides unnoticed among a large crowd gathered for the 
lighting of the Halloween tree.  People putting up umbrellas.  A 
STORM fast approaching.

Hundreds of anxious kids stand beneath the oak tree with open bags 
and pillow cases, waiting for the candy to drop on them.

STALKING P.O.V

MOVING behind the tree where a long-haired figure stands in the 
darkness.  Waiting to make a presentation.

HARRY

turns, sensing a presence.  A knife shoots out of the darkness, 
jabbing him right between the legs.
               
                    CUT TO:

TOMMY

is shoved into the back of the squad car.  Suddenly Loomis appears.  
Prevailing upon the sheriff.
          
          LOOMIS
     Wait!  This boy is being placed in my custody.

Tommy looks out, stunned.
          
          HOLDT
     What are you trying to pull now, Loomis?
          
          LOOMIS
     Uncuff him!  This is a matter of life or death.
               
                    SHOCK CUT TO:

HARRY

The knife is lifted straight up, splitting his torso in two, eyes 
bugging with shock.  He slumps to the ground in a huge pool of 
blood.
               
                    CUT BACK TO:

TOMMY AND LOOMIS

The sheriff uncuffs Tommy and shoves him out of the car.
          
          HOLDT
     You'd better as fuck have an explanation for 
     this, Doctor.

Loomis begins to usher Tommy through the gaping crowd.
          
          TOMMY
     Dr. Loomis, there's something you should 
     know --

Tommy is prodded forward by Loomis's .357.
          
          LOOMIS
     I know enough already.  Just shut your mouth 
     and take me to that baby.

They move swiftly through the gaping crowd.

ANGLE ON TREE

A growing murmur of concern spreads.  "Where's Harry?"  The children are 
becoming impatient, and the impending STORM isn't doing much to calm 
anyone's nerves.  Harry's people are at a loss to explain their star's 
whereabouts.

ANGLE ON LOOMIS AND TOMMY

On the fringes of the crowd.  Walking away.

"Oohs" and "ahhs" as the tree suddenly comes to life with thousands of 
orange lights.  From the boughs of the tree, ropes are pulled.  Bunting 
tears open, dropping hails of CANDY on the SHRIEKING kids.

Tommy glances back.  His eyes drawn to something.  Grotesque and misshapen.  In the 
tree.
          
          TOMMY
     Oh my God --

ANGLE ON TREE

Kids of all ages scurry around the stage, laughing and screaming as a 
rainbow of candy RAINS down on them.  Diving for it.  Fighting over it.  
Scooping it up in big handfuls.

ANGLE ON TOMMY AND LOOMIS

Tommy instantly breaks away and tears back through the crowd.
          
          LOOMIS
     Tommy!

Loomis goes for him.  Sheriff Holdt sees what is happening and 
flies toward them in pursuit.

ANGLE ON TREE

A BALLERINA looks down at her white pillow case in horrified 
astonishment.  Her hands painted red as she reaches inside.  All 
of her candy is covered with blood!

The other kids back away in revulsion -- the entire stage begins 
to drip with blood!

The adults don't seem to notice what is happening, more concerned 
with the sudden burst of POURING RAIN.

Tommy pushes his way through the crowd, SCREAMING.
          
          TOMMY
     Get them out of there!  Get out!!!

Sheriff Holdt tries to intercept Tommy just as he leaps up onto 
the stage, pushing kids out of the way.

Parents' faces register shock when they see their children running 
toward them, SCREAMING hysterically, soaked with blood.

Loomis sees what Tommy sees.  Words cannot convey the horror in his 
eyes.

Just then, a BOLT OF LIGHTNING ignites the tree.  SPARKS flash.  
Tiny pumpkin lights EXPLODE in a startling chain reaction.

Tommy helps the last of the kids off the stage when something falls 
from the gnarled branches:  a dangling, rotating, wrapped-up thing.  
The mutilated remains of Harry Simms!

Horrified, Tommy dashes headlong off the stage.  Runs with Loomis 
with the trampling crowd.

Struck dumb with terror, Holdt looks out upon the mass destruction.  
The bloody corpse hanging from the tree.  People running, SCREAMING, 
carrying their children toward the exits.

EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT (SAME)

Bumper to bumper cars.  Horns BLARING.  Women SCREAMING.  Men SHOUTING.  
Children CRYING.  Pandemonium.

Loomis and Tommy appear out of this jumble of confusion.  More people 
running along the sidewalks.
          
          TOMMY
     Oh, God -- Kara!!!

A car SCREECHES to a halt as Tommy barrels across the street.  Loomis 
right behind him.  Running toward home.

Once again, terror reigns in Haddonfield, Illinois.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kara shivers as she curls up beside Danny on the futon, holding the 
sleeping baby close at her bosom.  THUNDER rattles the old house.
          
          DANNY
     Mommy, I'm scared.
          
          KARA
     There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another 
     storm.  Try to get some sleep.
          
          DANNY
     I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
          
          KARA
     No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
          
          DANNY
     Promise?
          
          KARA
        (kisses him)
     I promise.

Kara stands up and goes to the window, looking out into the 
pouring RAIN.

KARA'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE

Dark and foreboding.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Beth's car parked in 
front.

ANGLE ON KARA

She stares at the car, puzzled.  Quickly she moves away from the 
window, heads out the door.

HALLWAY

She KNOCKS loudly on the door across the hall.  A sign that reads:  
"Beth's Place."
          
          KARA
     Beth, are you in there?

She knocks again.  No response.  Another CLAP OF THUNDER.  Kara 
shudders, quickly returns to Tommy's apartment and locks the door.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (CONTINUOUS)

Sounds of PASSION as we FOLLOW a trail of hastily-discarded costume 
pieces across the darkened foyer.  Tim and Beth are on the stairs, 
half-naked, kissing fervently.
          
          BETH
        (coming up for air)
     Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
          
          TIM
        (hot and heavy)
     Guess so ...

Tim nuzzles his face in Beth's chest.  She's feeling apprehensive.
          
          BETH
     What if your parents come home?
          
          TIM
     Then they can watch.

Laughing, they heard up the stairs, kissing, fondling each other.  
Slowly we PULL BACK into the foyer.  THUNDER and LIGHTNING CLASH, 
revealing the Shape, knife held at ready.  Watching.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (SAME)

She picks up the cordless phone, switches on and dials her home 
number.  We HEAR the phone RINGING on the other end.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Beth collapses with Tim onto Kara's bed.  The PHONE RINGS.  Tim 
ignores it, consumed by passion.  Beth sits up nervously.
          
          BETH
     Aren't you gonna answer that?
          
          TIM
     Answer what?
          
          BETH
        (fends him off)
     What if it's Kara?

Frustrated, Tim jumps off the bed and stomps into the bathroom, 
taking a candle with him.
          
          TIM
     Fine.  You answer it.  I'll make friends with my soap on a 
     rope.

Tim slams the door.  Beth deliberates her move, then goes to pick 
up the phone.
          
          BETH
        (into phone)
     Hello?

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara is frantic.  Looking out the window at the Myers house.
          
          KARA
        (into phone)
     Mom -- Who is this?
          
          BETH (V.O.)
     Kara? ... No, this is Beth.

          KARA (V.O.)
     Is Tim there?
          
          BETH
     He's in the bathroom.

BATHROOM - SHOWER (CONTINUOUS)

A lighted candle flickers.  Tim waits for the running shower to 
warm up as he does a bare-ass jig over to the sink.

Rinsing off his tooth brush, he elbows out a circle of steam from 
the mirror.  He gasps.  The Shape is standing right behind him!

Before he can react, Tim's head is yanked backwards.  The chilling 
SNAP of his neck is punctuated by a CRASH OF THUNDER.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara can SEE Beth on the phone.  Sitting by the window.
          
          KARA
     I'm across the street.  I can see you. Beth, I want you to 
     listen to me.  Get Tim and get out of that house.  Right 
     now.

Unnoticed by Kara, Danny rises and crosses the room.  Drawn toward 
the door by the irascible voice.
          
          WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
     Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM

Beth shifts nervously, looking out across the way at Kara.

THUNDER drowns out the sound of the bathroom door CREAKING open.  The 
Shape advances.
          
          BETH
     Kara, what the hell is going on?

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara's mouth suddenly drops open.  Her mind snaps into sensory overload.  
She can see the Shape walking up behind Beth!  Raising a gleaming 
butcher knife!
          
          KARA
     Beth, look out!  There's someone in the room!  He's right 
     behind you!

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM

Beth drops the phone, eyes bulging as the Shape plunges the knife 
into her back.  She falls, CRASHING against the vanity.

Beth SCREAMS unholy terror.  But the Shape isn't through.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara stands frozen in pure horror, hearing and seeing her friend's 
vicious murder.

Her eyes shoot down.  A little blond-haired boy is walking steadily 
across the street toward the Myers house.

No, it can't be true.  Kara wheels around.  Danny is gone.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW

Danny can be seen below walking toward the house as Beth's 
blood-gurgling SCREAMS fill the room.  The knife repeatedly, 
mercilessly SLASHING down at her.

EXT. STREET / MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Kara bolts out of the Blankenship house and races across the street, 
chasing after Danny through RAIN and LIGHTNING.
          
          KARA
     Danny, no!!!

KARA'S P.O.V. - FOLLOWING DANNY

He glides up the porch steps and slips through the front door of the 
Myers house.  Disappearing inside.

KARA

shoots across the lawn.  Up the porch steps.  Right behind him.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER

Kara dives through the front door.  THUNDER shatters the house.  
Everything is frighteningly dark.  Shockingly quiet.

Inch by inch, she makes her way inside.  Eyes wide.  Savage.  
Shaking uncontrollably.  A CRASHING SOUND behind her.  She jumps out 
of her skin.  Just the door SLAMMING shut in the WIND.
          
          KARA
        (the faintest whisper)
     Danny?

She advances into the hall.  Old floorboards CREAK beneath her feet.  
SOUNDS up ahead.  FOOTSTEPS.

Kara looks up.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Danny is nearing the top of the 
stairs!

Instinct propels her up the stairs after him.  Then suddenly she stops 
dead.  Reason taking over.  And she turns back.

Picks up a fireplace poker sitting in the corner.  Then she heads back 
up the stairs.  Mind-blown with horror.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kara reaches the top of the staircase, looking down the dark hallway.  
Summoning all of her courage, she moves forward.

Suddenly Danny darts out from the adjacent hall and disappears inside 
his bedroom -- a fleeting, ghostly image.  Kara startles.  Follows him 
inside.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Danny stands in a corner.  LIGHTNING illuminates his toy dinosaurs.  
Kara goes to him, takes his hand.  He resists her.
          
          KARA
        (intense whisper)
     Come on ... Danny, please.

She picks him up, carries him toward the door.  LUMBERING FOOTSTEPS.  
Kara stands paralyzed in the doorway as the Shape stalks down the hall.  
Eyes probing.  Walking right past them.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Kara slips silently back into the room, carrying Danny through the 
bathroom.  Adjoining on the opposite side into

KARA'S ROOM

LIGHTNING CRACKLES.  The walls are covered with blood.  Kara stumbles 
over something on the floor.  Cranes her neck to look down.

Beth's bloody, mangled remains at her feet.

Shock waves send Kara reeling backwards against the open bathroom door.  
Hanging on a hook is Tim's naked body, eyes open, staring at her in a 
horrified rictus of death.

Kara SCREAMS.  Drops Danny.  Quickly covers her mouth.  Realizing that 
she's given them away.

Suddenly the bedroom door tears open, buckling off its hinges.  The 
Shape bulldozes in, wielding its huge butcher knife!
          
          KARA
     Danny, run!!!

Danny ducks into the hall, evading the Shape's lurching hands.

DANNY

careens down the stairs.  THUNDER RAGES.

KARA

brandishes the fireplace poker at the killer.  The Shape moves in, 
backing her through the bathroom ... into Danny's room.  Suddenly 
she SLAMS the door on the Shape.

Kara tears off into the hallway.  Turns.  Waiting for the Shape to 
appear.  It doesn't.

Kara vacillates down the hall.  Jumping at every sound.  Training her 
weapon at things unseen.  SLAMMING doors along the way, sealing off 
every passageway as she tries to find her way through the impenetrable 
dark tunnel.

Suddenly something CRASHES down from above.  Kara's mother, strung up on 
a bloody sheet, dangling upside-down from the trap door in the ceiling! 
The axe still protruding from her chest.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Kara SCREAMS, shrinking away from the gruesome sight, faltering through 
the blackened doorway behind her.  An unbearable moment of tension as we 
think the Shape's mask will be there.

Suddenly the Shape shoots up directly in front of her!  Tearing the 
dangling corpse from the sheet, dislodging the axe from Debra's chest 
with a repulsive SQUISH.

Kara wheels toward the stairs.  The Shape advances.  Swings the axe.  
Misses her by inches.  Kara ducks, lurches behind the Shape.  Swings 
the fireplace poker with everything she's got.  CRACKING it full-force 
over the back of the Shape's head.

The Shape breaks through the banister and plunges off the landing, 
SLAMMING hard onto the floor below.

Terrified, Kara chances a look down.  The Shape doesn't move.

EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT (SAME)

Tommy's Explorer skids to a stop outside the boarding house.  Loomis and 
Tommy fly up the front path.  Tommy glances back at the blackened Myers 
house for a moment, then follows Loomis inside.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)

Kara barrels off the stairs.  Moves cautiously past the Shape.  Sprawled 
face-up in the middle of the hall.

LIVING ROOM

Kara searches for Danny, keeping her eyes trained on the Shape.  The 
little boy appears in the doorway directly across the hall.

The Shape lying in between them.
          
          KARA
     Danny, come to Mommy.

Danny shakes his head.  Too frightened to move.

HALLWAY / FOYER

Ever so slowly, Kara moves toward the threshold.  Hefting the fireplace 
poker, she steps right over the Shape.

Instantly she snatches Danny up in her arms.  Takes one step forward when 
suddenly --
          
          DANNY
     Mommy!!!

The Shape springs up, twisting Kara's ankle.  She falls, splaying forward.  
The Shape claws at her leg.  Kara fights back, kicking herself free of the 
vice-like grip.

Scrambling to her feet, Kara rockets Danny through the foyer to the front 
door -- desperately trying to escape from this real-life house of horrors 
-- only to find that it is locked.

The Shape rises, gleaming butcher knife in hand.

Kara twists the deadbolt, but someone's secured the chain lock!  Too late 
to remove it.  The Shape is right behind them.

Only one way to go.  The cellar.  Kara shoves Danny through.

INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)

Kara and Danny clatter down the rickety stairs and SPLASH across the flooded 
basement floor.

A soul-shuddering POUNDING on the door above.

Kara ushers Danny toward the elevated window.

The cellar door EXPLODES, the Shape's hand breaking through, splintering 
the wood as if it were paper.

Kara HEARS the Shape moving rapidly down the stairs.  Lifts Danny up the 
wall toward the window.  But it's not a wall -- it's John's electrocuted 
body, propped inside a storage cabinet!

Danny SHRIEKS, staring into John's lifeless eyes.  Kara pushes him up.  
Danny reaches for the lock.  Just an inch away.

Kara can't lift him any higher.  The Shape is coming!

Danny hoists himself up just enough to twist the lock.  He pushes the 
window open and clambers outside.

Kara scrambles up old pressboard shelves.  They break under her weight; 
she topples back to the floor.

The Shape wades toward her.  Reaching up for the window.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BASEMENT WINDOW

Danny watches his mother struggle to climb out of the crypt.
          
          KARA
     Danny, help me!

Kara's hand reaches toward him.  Danny makes no movement.
          
          WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
     Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.

Danny obediently turns and starts to walk away.
          
          KARA
     Danny!!!

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR

Kara's foot falls on the handle of the knife jutting from her father's 
chest.  Uses it to springboard herself half-way through the window.  
Clawing at wet grass.

The Shape's hand shoots out of the darkness below, grabbing at her legs.  
Kara writhes, kicking and SCREAMING.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara grabs chunks of mud as she is pulled back through the window.  The 
Shape yanks hard.  Kara catches herself on the window frame.  Quickly 
losing her grip.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR

The knife swipes downward, swiping her ankle.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara reacts to the searing pain, releasing her grip on the window frame.  
Suddenly Danny appears, locking onto her collar, pulling her clear in one 
massive heave.

Kara shuffles across the ground and picks herself up.  Grabs Danny's hand 
and runs full-tilt around the side of the house.

EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE

CAMERA FOLLOWS their frenzied flight across the street.  Past Tommy's 
Explorer.  Kara limping.  Danny surging toward the Blankenship house.  Kara 
SCREAMS, pounding frantically on the door.
          
          KARA
     Please!  Open the door!

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Tommy and Loomis have turned the apartment upside-down.
          
          TOMMY
     The baby -- where's the baby?!

Suddenly they HEAR Kara's frantic pleas outside.  Tommy bolts out the door.
Loomis right behind him.

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

Kara POUNDS furiously.
          
          KARA
     Please!  Somebody help us!

Danny huddles beside her, peering out across the street.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - MYERS HOUSE

The Shape trudges boldly down the porch steps -- knife in hand!

BACK TO SCENE

Kara sees the Shape -- walking slowly and deliberately toward them.  Her 
SCREAMS become even more intense.
          
          KARA
     Help us please!!!

The Shape closes in.  At the last second, Tommy throws open the door.  Kara 
and Danny tumble inside.  Into his arms.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY / PARLOR (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis slams and deadbolts the door.
          
          LOOMIS
     Get them upstairs.  Now!

Kara pounds against Tommy's chest.  Hysterical.
          
          KARA
     Where's the baby?!
          
          TOMMY
     He's gone.

Kara holds Danny close to her side, backing away in horror as Tommy and 
Loomis go around the parlor, securing the doors and windows.  THUNDER RIPS 
through the darkened room.
          
          TOMMY
        (continuing)
     Who else knew I had the baby?!
          
          LOOMIS
     No one.
          
          TOMMY
     No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
          
          LOOMIS
     Only me -- 
        (dark realization)
     -- and Dr. Wynn.

Suddenly the window behind Kara EXPLODES.  She SCREAMS, recoiling.  Then 
the window in front of her.  HANDS reach through.  Tommy shoves her out of 
the way.

ANOTHER HAND shoots through the stained glass window in the front door, 
twists open the lock.

Danny races across the lobby and up the stairs.

Robed figures fill the doorways.  Climbing through windows.  Moving inside 
the house.  Surrounding Loomis.
          
          LOOMIS
        (continuing)
     Wynn!!!

The robed figures descend on Loomis.  Drops his .357.  Tommy lurches for it, 
to no avail.  Loomis's SCREAM fills the darkness like a fever dream.
          
          LOOMIS
        (continuing)
     Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
          
          TOMMY
     No!!!

Tommy backpedals up the stairs.  Kara pulling him along as the cloaked 
figures glow toward them.  Daggers raised.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kara reacts to the SOUND of Danny's VOICE.
          
          DANNY
     Mommy!  Please help me!

Kara rushes through darkness to find him.
          
          KARA
     Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
          
          TOMMY
     Kara, no!

Kara trips and falls.  A pair of silver-tipped black boots planted in 
bold stance.  Slowly she looks up the long duster, the cigarette in the 
gloved hand of the nefarious Stranger -- Dr. Wynn!  Danny stands by his 
side, staring dispassionately.
          
          KARA
     Danny, no ... please ...

Kara picks herself up, shaking her head in unmitigated fear, staggering 
back down the hallway.

She turns to see the black figures overtaking Tommy.  His SCREAMS 
swallowed by hollow darkness.

Alone, Kara careens through another doorway into

TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara slams the door, turns in desperate circles.

Stepping out from behind the door is Mrs. Blankenship -- the baby bundled 
in her arms!
          
          KARA
     Mrs. Blankenship -- Oh, God -- Hurry. We have to --

As Kara reaches for the baby, the old woman raises a dagger.  Her eyes 
burning.  Her wrist branded with the mark of Thorn!

Kara SCREAMS.  The old woman opens the door, allowing the figures to 
enter the room.  Daggers drawn.  CHANTING a dark invocation.

The coven forces Kara backwards.  Nowhere to run.  Nowhere to hide.

Suddenly Kara makes a decision -- and takes a running leap toward the 
window!

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

Defenestrating herself, Kara SCREAMS, tumbling through the air, bouncing 
off the porch overhang before plunging to the front lawn below.  A 
thousand grass fragments raining down on her.

KARA

lies on her back, eyes close, hands folded over her chest in silent 
repose.  She doesn't move.

THE HOUSE

is still.  Unearthly silence fills the cold October night.
               
                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

KARA'S P.O.V. - DISTORTED - INT. TUNNELS

A ring of faceless figures move in, completely surrounding her.

Suddenly the feeling of RAPID MOVEMENT.  Glowing torchlight flickers 
across dank walls.

KARA

is being pushed forward on a gurney.  Strapped down.  SCREAMING for God's 
mercy.

TOMMY

is wheeled through another tunnel.  His face a mass of bloody cuts and 
bruises.  His eyes glazed over, trying to find focus.  SLAMMING into 
darkness.

EXT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT

LIGHTNING illuminates the cold, forbidding asylum.  The white van pulls up 
to the security gate.  Headlights illuminate the sign:  "SMITH'S GROVE - 
WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

The main gate cranks open.  The van pulls through.

THE VAN

pulls to a stop near the main building.  The door slides open and Danny 
steps out, surrounded by Smith's Grove staff wearing white jackets.  
Leading him toward the entrance.

LANDING FIELD

The helicopter touches down.  Wynn ducks out, moving in long, even strides 
toward the building.

INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

FOLLOW Wynn through the series of security cages, using his key card to 
BUZZ through.  White coats bringing up the rear.

Through tall mahogany doors, they cross purposefully into the adjacent wing.

EXECUTIVE RECEPTION AREA

Dawn, Wynn's efficient secretary, rises with a congenial smile.
          
          DAWN
     Good evening, Dr. Wynn.  Your -- appointment is waiting 
     inside.

Wynn picks up his messages, then heads straight into the office.  Dawn 
resumes her typing.  Something eerie in her grin.

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn and his staff file inside.  Removing his hat and duster, he walks over 
to where Loomis is seated -- shackled to a chair, a bloody slash across 
his forehead.

Seeing this, Wynn snaps angrily at two burly GUARDS.
          
          WYNN
     What is this all about?  Remove those!

The guards comply.  Loomis rubs his aching wrists, glowering.
          
          LOOMIS
     Where's the child?
          
          WYNN
     Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday 
     happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. 
     Somehow I knew you still had it in you.

Loomis sees his .357 resting atop Wynn's desk -- only inches away.  Wynn's 
hand covers it, slips it inside the top drawer.
          
          WYNN
        (continuing)
     Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know 
     how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your 
     upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I 
     felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth. 
        (gestures to his staff)
     After all, you're the only one around here who's still in 
     the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell 
     you, but you've really given me no other choice.
          
          LOOMIS
     This is madness, Wynn.
          
          WYNN
     Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way 
     things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by 
     your own reality to see. 
        (beat)
     But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in 
     many ways. 
        (smiles)
     You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog.  
     Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his 
     work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last 
     time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible 
     time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
          
          LOOMIS
     It was you.
          
          WYNN
        (lights a cigarette)
     Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
          
          LOOMIS
     Why did you take Jamie?
          
          WYNN
     She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her 
     veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I 
     incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has 
     served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
          
          LOOMIS
     Jamie's baby ...
          
          WYNN
     There you go trying to make sense again. 
        (grimly entranced)
     It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations.  
     As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
          
          LOOMIS
     Samhain.
          
          WYNN
     And I'm its deliverer. 
        (slams his key card on the desk)
     Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it.  
     Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.

Loomis shudders, rocked by these revelations.
          
          WYNN
        (continuing)
     I know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so 
     much more for you to try to make sense of.

Loomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office.  Wynn and 
his white coats flow out behind him.

INT. CELL - NIGHT

A tight, damp, claustrophobic space.  Tommy is strapped upright to a crude 
metal rack, not unlike the one Jamie was bound to the night before.

Feverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge, cutting through 
skin, wearing away his bonds.  Breaking through.

INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A group of white coats, led by Wynn, usher Loomis off an old service 
elevator, leading him through the dark passageway.  Wynn turns around, 
surveying the tunnel.  As he walks on, we SEE something fall from his back 
pocket.

As they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly CREAKS open.  
Tommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs.  Edging along 
the dank, torch-lit walls.  WIND MOANS.  Rats scamper past his feet.

Wynn has dropped his security key card.  Tommy swipes it.

INT. CATWALK (SAME)

Loomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell.  
The Shape lies inside.  Dormant.

Wynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession.  Michael Myers.
          
          WYNN
     Look at him.  So silent, yet so deadly. He moves when I 
     tell him to.  Act on my impulses.  Feels what I feel.

Wynn demonstrates.  Loomis looks on, spellbound.
          
          WYNN
        (continuing)
     Michael -- Rise.

Below, the Shape slowly rises.  Wynn takes out his trusted switchblade.
          
          WYNN
        (continuing)
     Michael -- Pain.

Wynn cuts his hand.  The Shape grabs his own hand in agony.  Wynn smiles, 
sucking the bleeding gash.
          
          WYNN
        (continuing)
     Michael -- Kill.

Suddenly Wynn whirls around, throwing Dawn -- his faithful secretary -- 
inside the Shape's pit.  Wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified 
SCREAMS trail away into blood-gurgling SILENCE.

Loomis closes his eyes in anguish.
          
          LOOMIS
     You've created a monster.
          
          WYNN
     Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.

Wynn carries on without remorse.  Loomis is brutally shoved forward.
          
          WYNN
        (continuing)
     We're not the only ones, you know. There are many 
     believers -- generous contributors to our church.  You'd be 
     amazed to know how far it reaches.

INT. CATACOMBS - STORAGE BUNKER

A metal door BUZZES open.  Tommy makes his way furtively inside, 
pocketing the key card.

A storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates.  Tommy pries one of 
them open.  Eyes widening in startled disbelief.

A small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside.
          
          TOMMY
     Holy shit ...

Tommy lifts a rifle, awed by its devastating lines, then slams in a 
cartridge and bolts out the door.  Back into the tunnels.

INT. CEREMONIAL ROOM - NIGHT

A large, amber-hued chamber.  The CHANTING coven forms a circle around a 
primitive stone altar where Kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her 
head adorned with a wreath of mistletoe.

A wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of 
reverence.

Behind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell.  Waiting.

Loomis is led inside.  Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to 
the altar.  Looming over the terrified Kara.

The CHANTING continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe.  At 
Wynn's gesture, there is SILENCE.  The worshippers offer an obedient 
response, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists.

We recognize many of the faces in the congregation.  Wynn's staff.  Dr. 
Bonham.  Mrs. Blankenship.  The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot.  
People from all walks of life.

Faces glazed with sadistic rapture.
          
          WYNN
        (prophetically)
     Behind, Disciples of Thorn!  The final sign!  The birth of 
     the heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our 
     great Feast of the Sun ... as I have foreseen it.

Jamie's baby is carried forth, CRYING as it is lain inside a baptismal urn 
beside Kara.  Ringed by candles and a circle of stones -- eleven in all -- 
etched with symbolic runes.

INT. TUNNELS

Letting the rifle guide him, Tommy makes his way through the tunnels.  
Toward the sound of MUFFLED CHANTING up ahead.

CEREMONIAL ROOM

The coven CHANTS its invocation.  Wynn draws a magic circle around the 
infant with blood from a silver chalice.  Then he inscribes a pentagram in 
the air with an ornate dagger.
          
          WYNN
     Spirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this 
     ritual.  Bear our gifts to Thorn.  Open us to the path of 
     Darkness.  By these runes transform us. Open our eyes and 
     show us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of 
     Innocent Blood.

Suddenly Danny is issued forth up to the altar.  His eyes dark, lifeless 
pools.  Kara struggles against her bonds.
          
          KARA
     Danny!!!

Loomis lurches forward.  Halted by massive, restraining hands.

CATWALK

Tommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip, looking down upon the 
evil ritual.  Startled by the SOUND of rusted chains.  Pulleys CRANKING.  
The Shape's cell being opened.

CEREMONIAL ROOM

The Shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward.  Strangely calm.  
Hypnotized.  Looming above Kara.  She lets out a SCREAM of unbridled terror 
as he raises a gleaming dagger.

Wynn stands behind Danny.  Places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft.
Above the baby.
          
          WYNN
     Strong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon 
     thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.  Let thy 
     Darkness descend on your son. Danny.  Lord of the Dead.

Danny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the SCREAMING 
infant.  Wynn speaks in the ominous WHISPERING VOICE:
          
          WYNN
        (continuing)
     Kill for him, Danny ... Kill for him.

Kara cries, appealing to the boy inside of Michael.
          
          KARA
     Michael, please.  You can make him stop.  You remember, 
     don't you?

The Shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask.  Listening.  
Reminded of his mother.
          
          KARA
        (continuing)
     Remember what he did to you that night. What his voice told 
     you to do.  You can stop it, Michael.  Stop the voice 
     forever.

Danny's eyes flash like fire.  The CHANTING is insidious.
          
          WYNN
     Kill him, Danny.  Kill him!
          
          KARA
     Danny, don't listen!  The voice isn't real!

Danny turns sharply, seeing his mother.  Suddenly terrified.
          
          WYNN
     Kill him, Danny!  You feel the rage inside!  You are Thorn!

Suddenly Danny drops the dagger.  Wynn flies at him, SCREAMING like an 
enraged beast.  The Shape raises its dagger and plunges it -- into Wynn!

Wynn's eyes go wide with shock.  The Shape lurches empathetically.  Wynn 
staggers, yanks the blade from his stomach.

RAPID-FIRE GUNSHOTS rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage 
of bullets from above.  Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering,
retreating into the tunnels.

Loomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the 
dagger.

Kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by GUNFIRE.  The 
altar decimated.  Candles falling.  Setting the room ablaze.

Wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk.  Wooden girders CRASH 
down from the ceiling.  Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle.

The Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet.  Slowly.  Painfully.  Flames 
lapping at its back.

Loomis crawls toward the rifle.  Grabs it.  Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny, 
a dagger at his throat.  Pulling him away.
          
          LOOMIS
     No!!!
          
          WYNN
     Stay away, Sam.
          
          LOOMIS
     Leave the boy.  Take me.

Loomis slowly places the rifle down in front of Wynn.  Surrendering himself.

Tommy drags himself toward Kara and the baby.  Paralyzed with horror as they try to 
anticipate Wynn's move.
          
          WYNN
        (smiles trenchantly)
     Good-bye, Dr. Loomis.

Loomis turns.  Gasps in startled reflex.  The Shape rises up behind him, 
swiping the dagger across his chest!

Wynn retreats and flies through a doorway with Danny.
          
          DANNY
     Mommy!!!
          
          KARA
     Danny!!!

Tommy and Kara race across the flame-engulfed room, reaching the door just 
as it SLAMS shut.  Cutting them off.

The Shape, the trail of flames growing on its back, hurls Loomis over the 
crushed altar.

Tommy sees Loomis writhing on the floor, about to go for him when --

The Shape turns on them!  Tommy stands in front of Kara and the baby, 
backing away, propelling them out into the tunnels.

The Shape walks forward in fevered pursuit, all but consumed by fire.

TUNNELS

Tommy, Kara and Danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze.

LOOMIS

painfully crawls away.
          
          LOOMIS
     Die, Michael.  In the name of God, die!

END OF TUNNEL

Tommy, Kara and Danny reach the tunnel end.  Kara pounds frantically on the 
elevator panel.  A DEAFENING ROAR -- the SOUND of fire as the Shape sweeps 
toward them.

THE SHAPE

glides steadily through the tunnels.  A walking pillar of flame.  Undaunted.  
Unstoppable.  Hell-spawned.

END OF TUNNEL

Finally the doors open.  Kara and Tommy barrel inside.  Mashing buttons until 
the doors close -- a millisecond before the Shape reaches them.

INT. ELEVATOR

Kara cradles the baby.  Tommy waits anxiously as the old elevator MOANS and 
GRINDS toward ground level.  The doors open.

INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR

They barrel off the elevator and race down a long corridor.
          
          TOMMY
     This way!

Tommy leads her toward an exit sign.  Behind them, the elevator doors close. 
The indicator light shows it moving down.

They reach a dead end.  The row of coded security cages.
          
          KARA
     What now?!
          
          TOMMY
        (realization)
     Wait a minute ...

He reaches into his pocket -- withdrawing Wynn's key card!

Suddenly the elevator doors open.  FIRE GUSTS.  The Shape emerges, totally 
engulfed in flame.  The emergency sprinklers are activated.  Dousing the 
flames as it walks after them.

Tommy panics, runs the key card.  The gate BUZZES open.  They run through.  
The Shape's hands lurch through the bars, missing Kara by inches.

They race toward the next gate.  The gate behind them opens, and the Shape 
walks through!

Tommy runs the card again.  The gate BUZZES.  They slam it -- one step 
ahead of the Shape.

The third and final gate.  Tommy tries the card.  Nothing!
          
          KARA
     Come on!
          
          TOMMY
        (tries it again)
     It's not working!

The Shape moves through the last gate.  Inside the cage with them!
          
          TOMMY
        (continuing)
     Someone's controlling it!

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE (SAME)

Standing behind his computer, observing them on the security monitors, Dr. 
Wynn jams the card's access code.  Then he grabs his satchel and strides 
quickly out of the office.  Pulling Danny with him.

On the screens, we can SEE the Shape approaching.  Kara's SCREAM can almost 
be heard on the silent monitor.

INT. SECURITY CAGE (SAME)

Kara SCREAMS as the Shape rakes Tommy against the cage.  Kara cowers in the 
corner, protecting the baby.

EXT. SANITARIUM - FIELD - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn races with Danny across the field toward the waiting helicopter.  
Getting ready for take-off as they duck inside.

INT. SECURITY CAGE

The Shape slams Tommy's head against the bars; he slumps to the floor.  Then 
turns its murderous attention on Kara and the baby.

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE

A hand reaches into the top desk drawer, removes the .357 and FIRES an entire 
round into the security console.  Destroying it.

The man holding the gun is Loomis.

INT. SECURITY CAGE

The door BUZZES open.  Kara drags Tommy and the baby out.  Slamming the door 
shut on the Shape.  Trapping it inside.

The Shape lurches against the bars in wild paroxysms.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD

Tommy comes to as he races with Kara and the baby across the windswept field.  
Suddenly they stop dead, watching in horror as the helicopter lifts off.

Kara stands paralyzed with shock, looking skyward.  The helicopter disappears 
into the gloom-filled night.

Tommy drags Kara in another direction.  A vehicle parked nearby.  The white 
van.

INT. VAN (SAME)

Kara lifts the baby inside.  Tommy flops down in the driver's seat.  Face 
bruised and bloody.  A key in the ignition.

Kara holds Jamie's baby.  Tears falling.
          
          KARA
     How will we ever find him?

Tommy's gaze terrifies her.  He starts the engine and tears off toward the 
sanitarium gate.

Kara looks down at the baby, then stares numbly forward.

In the back of the van, we can SEE the the Shape's white mask.  Glowing in 
the darkness.  Emerging.

Kara and Tommy drive on, unaware.  And that, for now, is how we leave them.
               
                    FADE OUT.
