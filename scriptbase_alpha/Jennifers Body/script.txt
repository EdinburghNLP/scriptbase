          INT. LEECH LAKE WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI, 17, sits on her hospital bed in
          pajamas. She's a plain-faced girl with a haunted
          expression. As she stares out the window, she winds
          colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a
          "god's eye."
          
          Out a single window, we see an imposing nine-foot
          SECURITY FENCE.
          
          Next to Needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered
          casually on the floor. There are letters, packages, even
          creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans."
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Every day, I get letters. I think
                    I get more letters than Santa
                    Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil
                    combined. I'm kind of the shit.
          
          RAYMUNDO, a counselor raps on the door and sticks his
          head in cautiously.
          
                                  RAYMUNDO
                    Rec time in five minutes, Needy.

                    Grassy-ass, Raymundo.
          
          Needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional
          gym uniform. As she slips off her pajamas, we can see a
          series of puffy, slash-like SCARS on her body.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Sometimes the letters are from
                    people who say they're praying for
                    me. They tell me everything will
                    be okay if I just accept Jesus
                    Christ into my heart. I say the
                    words, but nothing ever happens.
                    Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off
                    the cross.
          
          She glances sadly at a PHOTO OF A BOY on her dresser. She
          touches the frame wistfully, her eyes full of remorse.

                    Occasionally I get presents from
                    starfuckers who saw my picture in
                    the paper and want to marry me or
                    something. They think they can
                    take me away from all this.

                    Like I'd really date some
                    perverted Chester with a hard-on
                    for jailbait. I might be insane,
                    but I'm not desperate.
          
          We see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in
          from guys. They line the mirror, grinning at us. There's
          even a DICK SHOT tucked in there.
          
          Needy pulls on her threadbare uniform T-shirt. It hangs
          down to her knees, covering her shorts.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    A lot of people ask me if I'm
                    sorry I did it.
          
          Needy picks up a paper cup of COLORFUL PILLS on her
          dresser, dumps the meds into her mouth, and dry-swallows
          them.

                    I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.
          
          She saunters out of the room in her GYM UNIFORM and BUNNY
          SLIPPERS.
          
          
          INT. LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL GYMNASIUM - MORNING
          
          Several badminton courts are set up in the gym. As an
          intense OPERATIC ARIA plays over the public address
          system, the FEMALE PATIENTS enthusiastically--almost
          violently--whack at the flying shuttlecocks.
          
          The patients appear to be varying levels of crazy. A
          TOOTHLESS WOMAN grins as she dives with her racket,
          clipping her partner in the leg. In the corner, one
          forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another
          hurls her racket against the wall again and again.
          Counselors look on approvingly, despite how miserable
          their charges appear. In the background, a few sulking
          patients jump rope.
          
          Needy enters the gym unnoticed, padding along in her
          bunny slippers.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Welcome to the Mental Olympics.
                    They're big on recreation here.
                    Supposedly it helps us vent our
                    aggressions. We've traded in our
                    hatchets for rackets, our Drain-O
                    bombs for double dutch.

                    action when they're fully
                    conscious.
          
          We see a GIRL swinging a jump rope who has a ladder of
          fresh bandages on her arms and legs.
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    Me? I'm just trying to stay
                    invisible.
          
          Nelly shuffles over to a tetherball and takes a furious
          WHACK at it.
          
          INT. LEECH LAKE CAFETERIA - ONE HOUR LATER
          The freshly showered PATIENTS assemble for breakfast.
          They grab trays and settle into noisy cliques. Needy
          selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line
          and sits down, alone.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Personally, I think they're trying
                    to wear us out. Keep us sluggish
                    so there won't be an uprising.
                    Well, those J.V. tactics won't
                    work against me. I'm a kicker. K-I-
                    C-K-E-R. It even says so on my
                    chart.
          
          We briefly cut to Needy's chart, on some doctor's
          clipboard. We see her name: ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI and a
          few brief details about FIRST DEGREE MURDER and GRANDIOSE
          NOTIONS. Beneath that, we see a triple-highlighted
          warning in bright ink: KICKER.
          A NUTRITIONIST with a clipboard approaches Needy casually
          and eyes her breakfast plate.
          
                                  NUTRITIONIST
                    Just one Toastem, huh?

                       I like Toastems.
                                     NUTRITIONIST
                       That's good. But I'm not sure a
                       Toastem can provide you with
                       sufficient energy for your day.
                       I'd recommend more complex
                       carbohydrates...

          Needy scrambles to her feet and delivers a sudden,
          powerful ROUNDHOUSE KICK to the nutritionist's face.
                                  NEEDY
                    I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHUT THE
                    FUCK UP!
          
          The nutritionist is KNOCKED OFF HER FEET-- as if she's
          been kicked by a far mightier creature than Needy-- and
          collapses, clutching her bleeding nose. We see that the
          bone has SNAPPED.
          The patients shriek. Chaos. As Needy is restrained by
          staff members, she thrashes like a trapped fish.
          Needy snorts up a killer LOOGIE and hocks it at the prone
          nutritionist. The glob nails her in the eye.
          
          It takes four STAFF MEMBERS to haul Needy away as she
          hollers in protest.
          
          The nutritionist curls up on the floor, cupping her
          bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds
          her. She spits out a TOOTH.
          
          INT. "THE HOLE" - SAME
          Needy is tossed into seclusion. Her hair is wild and her
          face is wet with tears. The heavy door slams behind her,
          leaving only a shaft of light.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I wasn't always this cracked. I
                    used to be normal-- well, as
                    normal as any girl under the
                    influence of teenage hormones. But
                    after the killings began, I
                    started to feel, I don't know...
                    loose around the edges or
                    something. I was coming undone
                    like those jeans I made in Home
                    Ec. Falling to pieces like Patsy
                    Cline. Shredded like moo-shu pork.
                    Dead inside.
          Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract SHAPES
          in the darkness. Grinning skulls. Faces drained of life,
          half eaten. Grimaces of terror.
          Suddenly, soft music   is piped into "the hole," ostensibly
          to calm the patients   in solitary. Needy shudders and
          recoils at the sound   of it. It's a CHEESY ROCK BALLAD
          that we'll soon hear   again...

          Needy plugs her ears as if it physically hurts her to
          listen to the song. She curls up in the corner and steels
          herself for solitary confinement.

          EXT. DEVIL'S KETTLE, MN - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)
          Devil's Kettle is a quiet farming community, surrounded
          by dense woods and mirrored lakes. It's the kind of town
          that has one high school, one pizza joint, and one
          stoplight.
          
          On an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that
          reads "WELCOME TO DEVIL'S KETTLE- Pop. 7,036. Come See
          What's Cookin'!"
                                  NEEDY
                    This is where it all went down.
                    "Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, I
                    know, but the place just is named
                    after a dumb waterfall.
          
          
          EXT. THE FALLS - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)
          We see the titular falls, surprisingly powerful, gushing
          over a rock face.

                    Well technically, it's two

                    it empties into a river basin. But
                    the other one goes into a hole.
                    And it doesn't come out. The
                    scientist guys can't explain it.
                    They've dropped all kinds of
                    things down there--bouncy balls,
                    red dye, radioactive slime-- but
                    nothing ever surfaces.

          The sprawling ranch house is dark from the outside except
          for a single FIRST FLOOR WINDOW-- Jennifer's-- still
          illuminated.
          There's a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the
          backyard. We're definitely in deep north country.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I've probably spent years of my
                    life in this house. Hundreds of
                    sleepovers, thousands of aimless
                    homework sessions, a million phone
                    calls. I've climbed through
                    Jennifer's window so many times.
                    But tonight, only one of us is
                    going to come out.
          
          INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - SAME
          JENNIFER CHECK lies on her bed, fidgeting as she watches
          TV. She's a girl of 16 with LONG, MATTED HAIR and a thin,
          frail body. Her features are gorgeous, but she looks sick
          and haggard. She picks at her skin with yellowed,
          Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock
          of hair.
          Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH
          FLAGS and underwear.
          
          An `80s HORROR MOVIE flickers on the TV. Jennifer half-
          watches, distracted.

                    Jennifer didn't always look this
                    rough. Actually, she was the
                    prettiest girl in Devil's Kettle
                    when she wasn't so...hungry.
          
          Some recent photos on a corkboard reveal that Jennifer
          was indeed BEAUTIFUL AND CURVY.

                    She hadn't fed in weeks.
          
          Jennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly.
          We see the OUTSIDE of the house again. It's dark and
          silent, but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs.
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          Jennifer turns her attention back to the TV.
          Suddenly, we see NEEDY'S FACE pop up against the window,
          white and startling. Before Jennifer notices, the face
          disappears.
          Outside the house, the bushes rustle. Needy is crouched
          below the window. We hear the pulsing of her HEART as if
          via ultrasound. It's a wet, rhythmic sound: Sploish,
          sploish, sploish.
          
          Inside, Jennifer stretches and shuts off the TV. She
          turns out the light. A beat of silence.
          Then, the sound of cracking near the window.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Huh?
          Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and
          brandishing a HAMMER. She takes a SWING at Jennifer's
          head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically
          in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster.
          Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES
          Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her.
                                  NEEDY
                    You'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh?
                    You killed Chip! You goddamned
                    monster! You...ZOMBITCH!
          
          Jennifer struggles to fight off Needy in the darkness.
          Her clawlike fingernails rake Needy's back and arms.
          
          Needy pulls a BOX CUTTER out of her waistband and flicks
          it open like a switchblade. Kshink!
                                  JENNIFER

                    boxes.
          She takes a swipe at Jennifer's CROTCH. Jennifer
          instinctively CLUTCHES herself and rears up in defense.
          We see Jennifer's mouth come down on Needy's neck. Needy
          shrieks as if BITTEN, but continues to strangle Jennifer,
          straddling her and bearing down.

          Jennifer's T-shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her
          breasts. For a moment, her eyes meet Needy's and she
          grins. It's as if she has control over Needy for a split
          second, sexual control...
          Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifer's body left and right
          with the box-cutter, marking a gory, oozing "X" on her
          torso.

          Jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and
          disbelief. She looks back up at Needy. A beat of silence.
          Suddenly, THE GIRLS' BODIES LEVITATE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE
          CEILING. They wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne
          heap, their figures entwined. Their bodies FALL,
          collapsing back onto the bed with a thud.
          
          Needy raises the box-cutter and plunges it into
          Jennifer's HEART. Blood GEYSERS from the wound.

          Suddenly, the room is flooded with BRIGHT LIGHT,
          revealing a Needy straddling Jennifer's MUTLIATED BODY.
          Jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle.
          MRS. CHECK, a middle-aged woman in bad sleepwear and a
          worse perm rushes into the bedroom.
                                  MRS. CHECK
                    Jennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my
                    God! Oh my God!
          She pulls Needy off her daughter. Jennifer rolls over,
          gasping and bleeding.

          Flag Team Quarterly, splashing the model with fresh gore.

          vomits blood, and DIES.
          Mrs. Check SCREAMS. Needy SMILES.
          
          EXT. JENNIFER CHECK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
          Three police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and
          lights engaged. OFFICER ROMAN DUDA, 22, a muscular young
          COP, jogs authoritatively toward the house. He shakes his

          with blood.
          Officer Duda starts the ignition. His partner, a hard-

          pushed back to accommodate a huge round pouf of

          Sure enough, the band is playing "Land of a Thousand

          picking up their flags for a choreographed stunt.
          
          Jennifer steps forward in her flag team uniform,

          INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE - 8:45 A.M.
          Needy is standing in a small, dingy bathroom, trying on
          different configurations of clothing.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    "Wear something cool" meant
                    something very specific in
                    Jennifer-speak. It meant I
                    couldn't look like a nerd, but I
                    couldn't upstage her either. I
                    could expose my stomach, but never
                    cleavage. Tits were her trademark.
          
          Needy wiggles her jeans a bit lower, exposing her
          childishly round tummy. She walks out of the bathroom
          into her bedroom, a frilly pink hell complete with canopy
          bed.
          CHIP DOVE is sitting on the bed, looking lost in all that
          pink. He raises an eyebrow at Needy's abdomen.
                                  CHIP
                    Those jeans are hella low. I can
                    almost see your front butt.

          INT. THE CAROUSEL - NIGHT
          THE CAROUSEL is a run-down tavern at the edge of town,
          the kind with NASCAR posters, wobbly chairs and strands
          of plastic pennants crisscrossing the ceiling. It's a
          busy night and the bar is teeming with locals.
          A bartender sells a CASE OF BEER to a customer and passes
          it over the bar.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Chip was right. The Carousel is
                    definitely not a club. Clubs are
                    for attractive people in populous
                    urban areas. Clubs have DJs and
                    champagne and separate bathrooms
                    for guys and girls. All we have is
                    a broken jukebox, a few domestic
                    taps and the Sticker Toilet.

          BACK ON NEEDY:
          Needy and Jennifer enter the bar. Every guy in the joint
          stares at Jennifer, who snaps her "MINOR" wristband
          distastefully.

          Jennifer pulls out a pack of Camel Wides and lights one
          awkwardly. Needy notices AHMET FROM INDIA, a FOREIGN
          EXCHANGE STUDENT, standing by himself away from the

          A group of skinny INDIE ROCK BOYS are setting up their
          equipment on a pathetically tiny stage-- it's more like a
          dais. The LEAD SINGER has intense, spooky eyes, nearly
          obscured by a shock of hair. The locals, mostly good ol'
          boys, eye the band suspiciously.

          his Fender Jaguar from its gig bag. He notices her
          staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips.

          Needy shrugs free of Jennifer's grasp and follows her
          reluctantly across the room.
          
          The lead singer of Soft Shoulder, NIKOLAI WOLF, is
          already striding forward to meet them at the lip of the

          Needy moves self-consciously into a nearby corner, not
          wanting to continue the conversation with Nikolai alone.
          A LOCAL plugs a Loretta Lynn tune into the jukebox, with
          a challenging stare at the band. A DRUNK COUPLE begins
          two-stepping in front of the stage.
          Nikolai walks up to the guitar player, DIRK, and pulls
          him aside. Needy pricks up her ears and listens.

          Nikolai is already ignoring him.
          Needy, alarmed, emerges from her hiding place and
          discreetly rushes over to the bar where Jennifer is
          arguing with a jealous-looking Roman. He shakes his head
          in disgust and leaves the bar.
          Jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious PATRIOTIC
          THEMED DRINK. She laughs when she sees Needy's concerned

                    too?
                                  NEEDY
                    Those guys are rank, Jen. Just
                    forget about it.

                    I think the singer wants me.
                                  NEEDY
                    Only because he thinks you're a
                    virgin. I heard them talking.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Yeah, right! I'm not even a
                    backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to
                    Roman. By the way, that hurts. I
                    couldn't even go to flags the next
                    day. I had to stay home and sit on
                    a bag of frozen peas.
                                  NEEDY

                                  JENNIFER
                    Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I
                    can do innocent. I'll be Little
                    Miss Fucking Sunshine.
                                  NEEDY
                    He's way too old for you.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Don't cock-block me, Needy.
          
          Piercing FEEDBACK signals the beginning of the set.
          Nikolai takes the mic and smiles broadly.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Good evening, Devil's Lake.
          Someone in the back shouts "Devil's Kettle!"
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. Anyway, we're Soft
                    Shoulder. And we just want to make
                    you happy.
          He WINKS at Jennifer.
          The band launch into the same intense, soaring song we
          heard in the COP CAR and the HOLE. Jennifer's eyes never
          leave Nikolai's. She's hypnotized, clinging to Needy's
          arm. Even the locals look charmed.
          Suddenly, a lick of FLAME appears on the wood paneling
          next to the stage. Needy is the first to notice. As she
          watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses.

          CONTINUED: (7)
          
          The flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to
          blaze uncontrollably. People SCREAM and scatter. Someone
          ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the
          fire.
          Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. He and Chas
          exchange glances. The BASS PLAYER pitches his guitar
          aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons
          his kit. Nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he
          watches from the stage...is he smiling?
          CHAOS. Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once,
          causing a stampede. A woman's clothes and hair CATCH FIRE
          and she falls to her knees. We see a BEAM fall from the
          roof, nearly killing AHMET FROM INDIA.
          Jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state.
          
                                  NEEDY
                         (to Jennifer)
                    I know where to go!
          Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the
          tiny BATHROOM. Choking on smoke, they climb onto the
          Sticker Toilet (which now sports a giant SOFT SHOULDER
          sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the
          BATHROOM WINDOW. Hundreds are still trapped inside,
          screaming.
          
          EXT. THE CAROUSEL- CONTINUOUS
          Jennifer collapses in Needy's arms, coughing. Needy hugs
          her fiercely, almost romantically. She cups Jennifer's
          flushed face and looks into her eyes.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                         (DAZED)
                    It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on
                    fire. Oh God, I'm burning!
          
                                  NEEDY
                    You're okay, I promise. You got
                    burned worse when you wore that
                    tin-foil bikini to the beach.
                    Everything's fine.
          Suddenly, a HAND clamps onto Jennifer's shoulder. Both
          girls jump. It's Nikolai, his forehead creased with false
          concern.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Are you girls all right?

          Needy is less than thrilled to see him.
                                  NEEDY
                    We're great. Maybe you should try
                    to find your band?
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Those guys? They were the first
                    ones out the door. Ran for the van
                    like a bunch of Marys. Frankly,
                    I'm ashamed of them.
          Needy narrows her eyes suspiciously.
          Muffled SCREAMS rise up from the flame-engulfed building.
          Jennifer covers her ears and cowers, sweat rolling down
          her face.
          
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    God, it feels like hell out here.
                    Come and hang with us in the van
                    for a while, just until they hose
                    this place down.
          
                                     JENNIFER
                    Okay...okay...
          She slumps against Nikolai's chest.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    You're in shock. Here, drink this.
                    You'll feel better.
          He smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of PEACH SCHNAPPS
          from his coat and holds it to Jennifer's lips. She swigs
          it cooperatively, dribbling down her chin.
          
          Needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence.
                                  NEEDY
                    Aren't you a little freaked out
                    about this? What about all your
                    stuff? It's probably melting, and
                    when you get to the next stop
                    you'll have to do like, a crappy
                    acoustic set! Nobody likes that.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    We'll be able to afford new gear
                    soon enough. I have a feeling
                    we're gonna blow up.

                    Needy, let's go to the van.
                                  NEEDY
                    Why? Why should we? We have the
                    Malibu. Let's just get out of
                    here. We can go to El Ojo and get
                    Northwoods Nachos with extra
                    Badger Sauce! Please? I'm
                    starving.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Needy, stop it. Just stop it!
          She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN, which
          is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar.
          Needy staggers after them slowly, watching.
          Behind Needy, the bar EXPLODES. Screams. Flames. Silence.
          Needy doesn't even look back as she watches Jennifer get
          into the van. Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes.
          
          Nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van,
          revealing his slick, muscled white torso.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I watched her get into that van
                    and I knew something awful was
                    going to happen. But for some
                    reason, I felt drawn toward them.
                    Toward him. He was pale and
                    twisted and evil, like this
                    petrified tree I saw when I was a
                    kid.
          
          EXT. PETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL PARK - (FLASHBACK)
          We see LITTLE NEEDY, about five years old, staring up at
          a petrified tree in the darkness, horrified yet
          compelled. The tree seems to stoop forward, cracking...
          
          BACK ON NEEDY:
          Needy's face is fixed in the same haunted expression.
          Nikolai turns to look at her, his teeth bared in a
          vicious smile.
          Needy turns and sprints off in the opposite direction,
          away from the van and the fire.
          
                                                               29.

          Needy stumbles into her bedroom, overwhelmed. Her clothes
          are smoke damaged and her cheeks are sooty.
          She grabs her cheap, taped-up cell phone and dials CHIP's
          number shakily.

                    Everyone else was trying to use
                    the door. It was like a stampede.
                    The people who fainted got run
                    over and you could hear their
                    bones breaking.

          Jennifer is standing in the dark hallway, looking ghostly
          pale and smiling. Her clothes are tattered and stained--
          her entire front is soaked in blood. Her makeup is
          smeared, and her eyes are bruised and sunken like a
          zombie's. She looks HORRIFYING, especially with that
          ghastly, clownish grin.
          
                                     NEEDY
                    Um, Jennifer?
          Jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood-
          tinged teeth.

                    What happened?
          Utter silence. Then a dripping sound. Needy looks down
          and sees large drops of blood spattering the linoleum.
          Jennifer continues to smile, staring directly at Needy.

                    J-Jen?
          
          Jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee SCREAM, wailing at
          the top of her lungs. She vomits a torrent of evil-
          looking black bile all over herself and Needy and
          staggers wildly down the hallway.
          
          The bloody black bile hits the wall, splashing a framed
          school portrait of Needy. Needy screams and watches in
          horror as it slides down the wall.
          The bile has hundred of tiny SPINES sticking out of it,
          like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by
          itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the
          corners. It's truly revolting.
          Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her
          mouth.
          Jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to
          jagged, insane laughter.
          Needy tries to run, but Jennifer grabs her and THROWS her
          against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her.
          Jennifer slowly, tantalizingly brushes her face against
          Needy's hair, her earlobe. Needy doesn't move a muscle.
          Jennifer's hand slides up Needy's ribcage. She presses
          her lips against Needy's carotid artery.
          We hear Needy's blood pumping, swishing.

                    Are you scared?
          Needy nods.
          Jennifer parts her lips. Then suddenly, she stops and
          PULLS AWAY, pushing Needy to the floor. Jennifer bolts
          out the front door and takes off running down the street.
          Needy is motionless for a moment, then stumbles toward
          the doorway.

          But she's long gone.
          
          INT. KETTLE HIGH - THE NEXT MORNING
          Moments before the first morning bell. Needy is sitting
          at her desk in English class, still visibly bruised from
          her scuffle with Jennifer the night before. She looks
          like she hasn't slept a wink.
          The mood is quiet and somber-- kids whisper about the
          fire and gather in groups.

                    I heard Needy and Jennifer were
                    there and they had to fight their
                    way out with a machete.
          
                                  OTHER GIRL
                    Look, she's not even moving.

                    It's called Post Traumatic Stress
                    Disorder...
          Suddenly, a figure steps in front of Needy. It's
          JENNIFER, looking absolutely gorgeous-- and remarkably
          unscathed. She smiles brightly at Needy as if nothing
          happened the night before.
                                  JENNIFER

                    go out that window, but I'm fine.

                    You do have a tendency to
                    overreact. Remember at Girl Scout
                    camp when you thought there was an
                    earthquake and it was really just
                    two guys with a ghetto blaster?

                    A lot of people died, Jennifer.
                    They burned to death, or they
                    choked, or they just got trampled.
                    More than half of the people there
                    didn't make it out. It's like, all
                    over the news. National news. Kids
                    are dead. Parents are dead.

          She looks down at her hands. There's DRIED BLOOD under
          her fingernails.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Her blood was still under my
                    nails. See, I'd been up all night
                    scrubbing the carnage off the
                    linoleum.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (FRONT ENTRY) - DAWN (FLASHBACK)
          We see Needy on her hands and knees in the eerie blue
          light of dawn, sobbing as she diligently scrubs blood and
          bile off the floor with a dirty sponge. The black, spiny
          vomit repulses her, and she gags.
          
          She reaches for a Swiffer WetJet mop and pulls the
          trigger. No solution comes out. She curses, hysterical
          and sleep-deprived.

                    look like total gaylords.
          Needy raises her hands desperately to Jennifer, spreading
          her fingers to display her filthy fingernails.

                    I'm sure those of you who made it
                    here today have all heard the
                    news. It's a dark day for Devil's
                    Kettle, a day we can never, ever
                    forget.
          A single, stifled sob rises from the class. Needy glances
          around the room and sees students fighting back tears. A
          huge JOCK weeps openly, tears spattering his swimsuit-
          model decorated notebook. Jennifer smirks, barely able to
          contain her laughter.

                    The administration here has
                    decided that today will be a
                    unstructured day of support and
                    remembrance. We've lost nine
                    precious students-- including
                    Ahmet from India-- several
                    parents, and a teacher, Ms.
                    Parrish.
          He fights back tears.
                                  JENNIFER
                    No way! Parrish ate shit?
          
          Needy shushes her, appalled.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI
                    This tragedy is obviously beyond
                    anything we can measure. More than
                    ever, we need to band together and
                    draw strength from each other.
          Mr. Wroblewski painstakingly retrieves a tissue from his
          pocket with his robotic hand and dabs at his face.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)

          EXT. KETTLE HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS
          JONAS KOZELLE, the JOCK we saw sobbing earlier, is
          standing at the deserted football field.

          CONTINUED:
          It's a gray, overcast fall day and the wind whistles
          eerily through the trees. The football is set back a good
          a distance from the school, and Jonas is all alone.
          In the distance, a tiny figure slowly approaches, It
          starts a dot on the horizon. As it draws closer, we see
          it's JENNIFER. Her bright, lipsticked grin is eerie and
          unmistakable.
          Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder,
          indifferent.
          A few seconds later, he glances again. Strangely,
          Jennifer ISN'T THERE.
          Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonas's left side, startling
          him.
          
                                     JENNIFER

                    I'm crazy-sorry about your
                    profound loss. You are crying
                    about Craig, right?
          
                                  JONAS
                    He was my best friend.
          Jennifer puts her arm around him sympathetically.
                                  JENNIFER
                    I know. I was close to him too.
                    You know, I was there last night
                    in that horrible place. I saw
                    Craig a few minutes before the
                    fire broke out.
                                     JONAS

                                  JENNIFER
                    Yeah. I was probably the last
                    person to talk to him. Like, ever.
                    Literally.
                                  JONAS

                    actually. And do you know what he
                    said? He said you were like a
                    brother to him. Not a bro. An
                    actual brother.
          
          Jonas's lip trembles as he unsuccessfully fights back
          tears. Jennifer cuddles closer to him.

                    Forget it. It's too intense.
                                  JONAS
                    What? Please, Jen, you've gotta
                    tell me!
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Well, he said he always thought
                    you and me would make a totally
                    bangin' couple. Isn't that so
                    weird?
          
                                  JONAS
                    He said bangin'?
          Jennifer reaches for Jonas's hand and slides it slowly up
          her shirt, placing it on her left breast.
          
                                  JENNIFER

                    We'll help each other get through
                    this nightmare. It's what Craig
                    would have wanted.
          Jonas nods dumbly, brainwashed. Jennifer leads him away
          from the field, toward the WOODS bordering the school
          campus. They vanish into the woods. In the distance, we
          see the FALLS rushing into the lake.

          Jennifer and Jonas are in the woods. Jennifer efficiently
          whips off her top and bra and begins kissing Jonas
          hungrily. As Jonas touches her, he recoils.
                                  JONAS
                    You feel so warm. Why are you so

          She pulls off Jonas' shirt and digs her nails into his
          arms, kissing him with renewed ferocity.
          
          The woods are dead silent. A few squirrels approach the
          clearing, and Jonas watches them warily with one open eye
          as Jennifer kisses him. Then a deer wanders into the
          clearing. Then a fox. The animals pause in their tracks
          and watch, motionless. It's an eerie, unnatural tableau.
          
          Animals continue to gather.

          He gestures to the ANIMALS, who are watching, still as
          statues. A few crows alight on a nearby tree.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Mm-hmm. They're waiting.

          Jennifer unzips Jonas's jeans and smiles, reaching down
          and working him with her hand. Jonas moans, still eyeing
          the animals.

                    Don't worry. You're going to see

                    No.
          She smiles and shakes her head.
          Jonas jerks back, creeped out. He tries to pull away from
          Jennifer, but she's too strong. She PINS him to the tree.
          We see her jaw begin to UNHINGE, like some horrible
          snake. Her eyes cloud over with blood...

          A horrible SCREAM of agony rises from the woods. Mr.
          Wroblewski is exiting the school, briefcase in hand. He
          stops in his tracks when he hears the scream. He shakes
          his head sadly.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI
                         (to himself)
                    God, they're feeling so much pain.
          Another scream, this time weaker.
          
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)
                    Let it all out, kids.
          He heads for his Ford Festiva, then pauses as if thinking
          better of it. Something isn't right. He puts his keys
          back in his pocket and walks toward the woods to
          investigate.

          Needy is preparing herself a fried bologna sandwich in
          the kitchen. Needy's ALBINO FERRET chases a ball across
          the cracked floor.
          Needy scrapes the sandwich out of the skillet and takes a
          bite.

                    You want some, Greedo?
          She tuns on the kitchen radio and is surprised to hear a
          very familiar song: "Through the Trees," by Soft
          Shoulder.
          Suddenly, she pauses, a look of UNEASE and even FEAR
          crossing her face. She stops and braces herself against
          the counter, her KNEES SHAKING. Something isn't right.
          She drops the sandwich. Greedo goes straight for it.

                    Something's wrong...
          As Needy sinks to her knees, she stares straight ahead at
          the REFRIGERATOR. A photo magnet of JENNIFER leers back
          at her.
          
          She closes her eyes. A brief, near-subliminal FLASH of
          the carnage in the woods...
          
          The song ends, snapping Needy out of her reverie.

                    That was Soft Shoulder, the local
                    band who became the unlikely
                    heroes of the tragedy in Devil's
                    Kettle last night. Eyewitnesses
                    say the boys helped numerous
                    people escape the inferno, risking
                    their own lives in the process.

          Mr. Wroblewski ventures into the woods, heading toward
          the clearing. At first, we can only hear mysterious
          sounds-- scratching and smacking. Birds and animals are
          closely gathered in a circle.
          
          Suddenly, Mr. Wroblewski clutches his arm and gags,
          realizing the animals are feeding on a huge CARCASS.
          A BADGER looks up, its snout soaked in blood.
          Mr. Wroblewski begins to scream. The animals scatter.

          A glimpse of the CORPSE: It's Jonas, of course. His
          entire torso has been torn open, exposing his ribs and
          guts. Blood and viscera everywhere, INTESTINES strewn
          about the forest floor like party streamers.

          Needy is seated at the kitchen table. She accidentally
          drops the remains of her sandwich on the floor, where the
          ferret quickly pillages it.

          Needy's mom, ANTONIA "TONI" LESNICKI, has quietly entered

          EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - EARLY EVENING
          A hysterical SCREAM pierces the twilight.
          The sun has begun to set. An ambulance and four police
          cars have pulled up near the woods, which are cordoned
          off with yellow police tape. Near the woods, JONAS'S
          PARENTS are crying. His MOTHER screams and begins beating
          the ground with her fists.
          A stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance.
          OFFICER WARZAK exits one of the police cruisers. Her
          signature giant poofy bangs are in full effect.
          She rushes to comfort Jonas's bereaved mother.
                                  OFFICER WARZAK
                    We will get the man that did this
                    to your son. You hear me? We'll

                                  JONAS'S DAD
                    I'll get him myself! I will! You
                    hear me, you bastard? I'll cut off
                    your nutsack and nail it to my
                    door! Like one of those lion
                    doorknockers rich folks got!

          EXT. ACROSS THE LAKE - CONTINUOUS
          The sound of Jonas's parents screaming carries across the
          lake. The water is eerily calm.
          
          Suddenly, a HEAD breaks the surface of the lake. It's
          Jennifer, gliding through the water. She looks calm and
          serene.
          The SCREAMING continues across the lake. The sirens,
          shouting and chaos contrast sharply with this peaceful
          scene.
          Jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the
          pier, naked and dripping wet. She runs her tongue over
          her teeth briefly and nonchalantly picks something out
          from between her two front teeth, like she's just
          finished a delicious rib dinner.
          Jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her
          clothes, which are neatly folded on the pier.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Once she's dressed, she walks off into the woods, as if
          nothing out of the ordinary has happened.

          Jennifer's hair is still wet from the lake, but she's
          changed into shorts and a tank top. Music blasts from her
          stereo. She admires herself in the mirror, popping her
          ass.

          hard with the pin without flinching. Blood spurts from
          the wound.

          Jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed. She wipes the
          blood away-- the wound has magically DISAPPEARED.

          panicked and sweaty in his living room. In the

          EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - FOURTEEN MINUTES LATER
          The park is dark and tree-lined and appears to be a
          popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of Devil's
          Kettle. The abandoned sand volleyball pits are full of
          couples making out. Needy runs past them skittishly.
          As she ascends a grassy hill, CHIP is revealed,
          silhouetted against a backdrop of twirling police lights.
          Needy squints at the lights, sees CHIP's house in the

          The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reads:

                       make us seem crazy.
                                     NEEDY
                       Oh.
          Mr. Wroblewski clears his throat, annoyed by their
          talking.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI
                    ...As I was saying, Needy and
                    Jennifer, I finally have some good
                    news to share with all of you. The
                    members of the rock group Soft
                    Shoulder have decided to extend a
                    helping hand to our community.
          A ripple of excitement in the room. A girl seated in the
          front row is wearing a Soft Shoulder T-SHIRT.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)
                    As you know, their song "Through
                    the Trees" has become our
                    unofficial anthem of unity and
                    healing. So, they've decided to
                    release it as a benefit single.

                    loss.

          She looks around for support, finding none.

          face Needy angrily.

          Needy and Jennifer slowly head toward their respective

                    the bass be any lower in the mix?

          COLIN GRAY, the punk/goth boy we met earlier, approaches
          Jennifer nervously as she exits the classroom.
          Needy drops behind them, eavesdropping.

          Colin fidgets awkwardly.
          
                                  COLIN
                    Well, we've been having a lot of
                    fun in class, you and I, and I
                    just thought maybe we could go to
                    a movie or something. There's a
                    midnight showing of Rocky Horror
                    at the Bijou next weekend...

          He turns to walk down the hallway, dejected. Jennifer
          watches him leave.

          EXT. CAMERFORD STREET - NIGHT
          
          Colin Gray drives down the street in a big old boat of a
          classic car. He's blasting punk music on an iPod that's
          been rigged to the ancient AM radio.
          Colin holds up his CELL PHONE to re-read the directions
          Jennifer texted him.
          The street is extremely dark and silent, occupied only by
          a new townhouse development. The identical units still
          appear to be under construction. There aren't even any
          streetlights. The plastic sheeting over the windows flaps
          eerily in the breeze.
          Colin's brow furrows in confusion-- it doesn't even look
          like anyone lives here yet. He checks the phone display
          again.
          CLOSE ON PHONE:
          The TEXT MESSAGE reads:
          "trn lft on camerford and your there. first house on rt.
          1004 camerford. C-ya! xoxo jen"
          
          Sure enough, the house number is 1004. Colin throws the
          car into park and walks up to the porch. He looks up and
          notices a glow coming from an upstairs window,

          CONTINUED:
          
          Colin presses the doorbell. Nothing happens-- the house
          isn't wired for electricity yet.

          Colin enters the house tentatively. It's dark, vacant,

          coming from upstairs.
          
                                     COLIN
                       Yo?
          He stumbles over a stray 2 x 4. There are piles of
          sawdust and building materials everywhere-- the house is
          definitely still under construction. Colin looks
          confused.
          A MOUSE skitters over his sneakers.
                                  COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Jennifer? Anyone there?
          The music upstairs grows slightly louder in response.
          
          Colin squares his shoulders and heads slowly up the
          creaking stairs.
          
                                                                  62.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - SAME
          Needy has eased off her top to reveal an endearingly
          plain white bra, complete with center bow. CHIP, also
          shirtless, cops a feel.
          He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fluorescent
          orange CONDOM. Needy looks at the wrapper.

                    It's supposed to make it feel good
                    for the girl.

          INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - CONTINUOUS
          Colin follows the music into an empty bedroom. The dark
          room is filled with blazing candles melting and pooling
          into bizarre shapes. A single BLANKET is spread out on
          the floor. Colin shivers.
          Behind him, in the doorway, Jennifer appears, her smiling
          face hellishly aglow.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                    You made it.
                                  COLIN
                    What's going on? This isn't really
                    your house, is it?
                                  JENNIFER
                    No baby. This is our house, just
                    for you and me. We can play Mommy
                    and Daddy.
          Colin is totally dumbstruck.
                                  COLIN
                    Do you even know my last name?
                                  JENNIFER
                    Silly. I've been sending you
                    signals all year. Couldn't you
                    tell? You give me such a wettie.

          She starts KISSING Colin on the neck. We can see
          confusion-- and fear-- in his eyes.
          
          INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - SAME
          Chip fumbles below his waist, obviously struggling with
          the condom. Needy leans forward for a closer look.
                                  NEEDY
                    Oh. It's got little bumps on it. I
                    can hardly wait.
          
          INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME
          Jennifer grips Colin's face in her hands and forcibly
          kisses him on the mouth. Colin succumbs, but stiffly.
          We hear a SCRATCHING noise. Colin pulls away
          instinctively and sees MICE and ROACHES emerging from the
          walls, skittering over surfaces.
                                    COLIN
                    Jennifer...
          
          Jennifer looks over her shoulder and giggles.
                                  JENNIFER
                    You scared? I thought boys like
                    you were into vermin.
          
          She unbuttons his jeans. They fall noisily to the floor--
          they're the baggy Hot Topic kind with chains and buckles
          galore.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Nice hardware, Ace.
          
          Colin into Jennifer's eyes. There's something horrible
          about her face...like she's become almost corpselike.
                                  COLIN

                    Oh, don't you dare pass out! I
                    need you to be conscious.
                                    COLIN
                    I gotta go...

                    I need you frightened.
          Colin tries to jerk away, but Jennifer easily disengages
          his arm from its socket. A sickeningly moist SNAP. Colin
          cries out in pain.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    I need you hopeless.
          She slams him to the ground and mounts him. Her jaw
          unhinges, opening her mouth to a horrifying, inhuman
          degree. Her teeth are razor-sharp and grotesquely
          crowded, like they belong to some horribly deformed dog.
          She descends on him, feeding ravenously.
          
          We see their shadows against the wall: Jennifer lunging
          hungrily, blood spraying up from Colin's jugular. We can
          hear him screaming and gargling on his own blood.
          
          INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          CHIP is doggedly pumping away on top of Needy, his eyes
          closed in concentration. Needy's vacant eyes are suddenly
          brimming with tears.

                       What? Am I hurting you?
          Needy starts weeping.

                       Am I too big?
          Tears roll down Needy's cheeks. She begins moaning, then
          SCREAMING at that top of her lungs.
          
          She hallucinates liquid seeping through the walls, blood
          and lymph oozing in at the corners and windows. Then the
          infamous spiny black bile...
          Pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness. Skulls,
          jesters, demons, death. It's the worst acid trip
          imaginable.
          Needy rubs her eyes frantically and continues to scream.

          CHIP immediately rolls off Needy, concerned. He grabs her
          and tries to shake some sense into her.

                    Needy! What's wrong?
          Needy continues to shriek hysterically, her voice growing
          ragged.

          We can still hear Colin making inhuman sounds of pain. We

          unspeakable.
          
          INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          Needy clutches her throat, hyperventilating. She stands
          up and struggles to get dressed. Her breath rasps. Chip
          is freaking out.

          Colin's thrashing limbs finally go limp. Jennifer is
          hunched over his remains like a jackal scooping blood
          into her mouth with cupped hands.
          We see his eyes, flecked with blood, pupils dilated. A
          white MOUSE crawls over his face.

          pulls his knees up to his chest, vulnerable.
          
          EXT. CHIP'S STREET - SAME
          Needy runs toward her mom's CAR, a beat-up Kia parked on
          the curb.
          She climbs into the car and starts the ignition,
          trembling and crying.
          
          She pulls out onto the street and guns it. She swings a
          hard left. The streets are all almost identical, lined by
          working-class homes.
          She turns on the radio. The song is, of course, "Through
          the Trees" by Soft Shoulder. She pounds the dashboard,
          hysterical.

          Needy seizes the wheel drives recklessly down a dark,
          tree-lined street. Then, she sees something bright emerge
          from the shadows. Her eyes widen...
          It's JENNIFER, creeping toward the curb like an animal.
          She's pale in the moonlight. The entire lower half of her
          face is covered in blood, like a ghoulish beard of gore.
          She flashes a huge, deranged, toothy SMILE at Needy.
          
          Needy screams and SWERVES. The car fishtails out of
          control and slides into a ditch.
          Needy slams her foot onto the accelerator, trying to get
          out of the trench. She glances desperately out the side
          window. Jennifer is gone.
          Panting, Needy tries to accelerate again.

          Suddenly, Jennifer appears from out of nowhere and SLAMS
          her body against the windshield, her long limbs splayed
          like an insect's. The windshield SHATTERS. Jennifer grins
          at Needy through the cracking glass.
          Needy screams again, puts the pedal to the floor, and
          manages to rear up out of the ditch. Jennifer's body
          tumbles off the car as Needy goes roaring down the
          street.

          No reply. Needy braces herself against the kitchen
          counter and bawls. She falls to her knees and curls up on
          the floor, exhausted.
          
          Her eyes drift shut.

                    though.
          
                                  LITTLE JENNIFER
                    We're sisters now, you know.
          
          Needy nods.
          
                                  LITTLE JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Don't tell my mom about this.
                    She'll make me get a shot.
          
                                  NEEDY
                    I never tell on you.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - (BACK TO REALITY)
          Needy WAKES UP in a cold sweat, gasping. She's still on
          the kitchen floor. She peels herself up off the floor,
          disoriented.
          
                                                               69.
          
          
          
          
          INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - CONTINUOUS
          Needy trudges into her dark bedroom. She strips off her
          clothes and stumbles into bed.
                                  JENNIFER'S VOICE
                    What's up, Monistat?
          
          Needy flicks on her bedside lamp, petrified. Jennifer is
          curled up in bed beside her, reclining casually. She's
          freshly showered and wearing one of Needy's dorky T-
          shirts.
          Needy screams at the top of her lungs and leaps out of
          bed, pulling the covers with her.
                                  JENNIFER
                    God, enough screaming already.
                    You're such a cliche.
                                  NEEDY
                    Get out!
                                  JENNIFER
                    But we always share your bed when
                    we have slumber parties.
          She winks conspiratorially at Needy.
          
                                  NEEDY
                    What the fuck is happening?
                                  JENNIFER
                    Whoa. I have never heard you drop
                    the F-bomb before. What's buggin'?
          
                                  NEEDY
                    I saw you! I saw you! The

                    Buh-buh-buh. Slow down, tardy
                    slip. You sound like a sped.
                                  NEEDY
                    I'm calling the police.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Go ahead, narc me out. I've got
                    the cops in my back pocket. I'm
                    fucking a cadet, remember?

                                  JENNIFER
                    I want to explain some things to
                    you. You've already seen too much
                    and besides-- best friends don't
                    keep secrets. Right?
          Needy nods, terrified.
                                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                       Remember the night of the fire?
                                     NEEDY
                       Yeah, it rings a bell.
                                     JENNIFER
                       Well, I got pretty messed up. I
                       almost died. You know those guys
                       in Soft Shoulder? Totally evil.
                       They're basically agents of Satan
                       with awesome haircuts. I figured
                       that out as soon as I got into
                       their molester van.
          
          INT. SOFT SHOULDER'S VAN (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
          
          Jennifer is crouched in the back of the van. None of the
          band members are speaking. Nikolai Wolf drives down a
          gravel road, away from the fire site and deep into the
          woods.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Guys? Where are we going?
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Shut your mouth, object.

                    Nikolai...
          
          Jennifer looks around the van, wide-eyed. There's glow-in-
          the-dark Satanic imagery painted all over the walls:
          goats heads, pentagrams, and strange coded writing. She
          sees a few books sliding around on the floor: "Spells and
          Incantations," "Summoning the Beast," and a copy of the
          Black Mass.
          
          Jennifer springs to her feet and tries to escape out the
          side door. MICK, the drummer, grabs her ankles, taking
          her down.

                                  NIKOLAI
                    You wish.
          
          Jennifer struggles again, but Mick holds her down.
          
                                  MICK
                         (to band members)
                    Hey guys? Do we even know if she's
                    a virgin?
          
          A GLINT OF HOPE in Jennifer's eyes. Maybe if she lies she
          can save herself.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Yes...yes! Of course I'm a virgin!
                    I've never done sex ever. I don't
                    even know how. So maybe you should
                    find some other girl who does.
                    Know how.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Told you, Dirk. You owe me a beer.

                         (PREOCCUPIED)
                    Sure, man.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST CLEARING (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
          
          The van rumbles down an uneven forest path, deep into the
          woods. They arrive at the real Devil's Kettle-- roaring,
          ominous waterfalls. There's a crude stone altar
          illuminated by moonlight.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT
          Needy is still cowering on her bedroom floor, captivated
          by the tale in progress. Jennifer is reclining in the bed
          with a relaxed, supernatural glow.
                                  NEEDY
                    What did they do to you?
                                  JENNIFER
                    Just let me finish. So they drove
                    all the way out to the falls. I
                    tried to figure out an escape, but
                    it was so dark out there...
          
                                                                 72.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. THE FALLS (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
          
          The door of the van slides open. Nikolai pulls Jennifer
          out of the van and hustles her into the clearing. He
          looks up into the sky.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    We got a waxing moon. Perfection.
          
                                  MICK
                    You're the man, Wolf.
          
          The four band members surround Jennifer, looking
          statuesque in their sexy rock n' roll ensembles.
          
          Without warning, Nikolai hauls off and KICKS Jennifer.
          She yelps and falls onto her back on the dirt.
          
          Dirk looks apprehensive.
          
                                  DIRK
                    I don't know if we should go
                    through with this.

                    you want to be a huge suicidal
                    loser?

                    Then grow a pair and fetch me the
                    ritual! God.
          
          Dirk obediently heads over to the van. He pushes the
          intimidating-looking magical books aside and retrieves a
          single folded piece of computer paper.
          
                                     MICK
                    That's it?
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    What? I found it on Google.
          
          He unfolds the piece of paper and clears his throat.

          The guys have dragged Jennifer onto the makeshift altar
          and are holding her down. She struggles and screams, but
          Dirk slaps her again.

                                  NIKOLAI
                    That's fascinating.
          
          Dirk and Mick exchange nervous glances.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Please let me go. I'll do
                    anything. Anything you want.
          
          Nikolai examines her with an appraising eye.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    I only hump nines and tens. You're
                    a seven at best, even with the
                    chicken cutlets.
          
          He reaches into Jennifer's bra and casually pulls out a
          GEL BREAST ENHANCER, tossing it aside.
          
          Jennifer rears up and SPITS in his artfully rumpled hair.
          Nikolai smooths his `do, enraged.
          
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    I'm gonna carve you like a

                    with the Beast himself?
          
          He wiggles his menacingly pointy fingers in her face.

                    and whaddya know? Satan delivered!
                    We went from college radio to

                         (LOUDLY)
                    Start chanting, boys.
          
          The group begins chanting jibberish in unison. Jennifer
          struggles, watching as their eyes go hollow and black.
          
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    With deepest malice, we deliver
                    this virgin unto thee.
          
          He unsheathes a huge, gleaming knife and raises it Psycho-
          style, admiring his reflection in the blade.
          
                                  DIRK
                    Dude, that is a hot murder weapon!
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    It's a bowie knife.
          
                                   DIRK
                    Bowie. Nice.
          
          Snickering, Nikolai begins to sing "Starman" by David
          Bowie. The group joins in merrily.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    "There's a starman waiting in the
                    sky..."
          
                                  BAND
                    "He'd really like to meet us, but
                    he thinks he'd blow our minds..."

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          As the group sings, Nikolai brings the knife down with a
          grin. We hear Jennifer SCREAMING, sounds of violence and
          clothes ripping as Nikolai relentlessly beats her and
          stabs her, his face contorting demonically. The band
          continues to sing, their voices carrying over the trees.
          
          Nikolai walks over to where the "devil side" of the falls
          rushes into a black hole. He drops the murder weapon
          into the churning water, smiling.

          Needy's expression is both incredulous and horrified.
          Jennifer is totally matter-of-fact. She picks at her
          nails with a wooden cuticle stick from Needy's night
          stand.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Being tortured would make most
                    girls black out or something. But
                    I'm so hard core, I was with them
                    the whole time. I could feel them
                    gutting me Under my ribs, up into
                    my belly, then right through my
                    heart.
                                  NEEDY
                    They...killed you.

                    I'm here, aren't I?
          She shakes her head, annoyed with Needy.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    I mean, yeah. They went Benihana
                    on my ass. It should have killed
                    me. But for some reason, it
                    didn't.

                    Whatever. Anyway, I don't really
                    remember what happened after that.
                    I just-- woke up a few hours later
                    and found my way back, somehow.
          
                                                                  76.

          We see Jennifer staggering down the street, battered,
          mutilated and bloody. She spits a few TEETH onto the
          curb, clutching her chest. We see her wander toward
          Needy's house...

                    I couldn't bring myself to hurt
                    you. I mean, I'm a really good
                    friend. But I felt so hungry. I
                    had to do something.
          
          EXT. SECLUDED STREET (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
          
          Jennifer is wandering down a rural road in a daze. She
          hears a faint COUGH. Jennifer stops and sees a hunched
          FIGURE walking down the opposite side of the street. It's
          AHMET FROM INDIA, the foreign student. He's covered in
          soot and looks traumatized.
          
          Jennifer takes a step. Ahmet takes a step. Jennifer
          stops. Ahmet stops.
          
          Their eyes meet. Jennifer crosses the street. Ahmet
          stares at her, frightened. Jennifer addresses him in a
          quiet, gravelly voice.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Ahmet. You made it out.
          
          Ahmet coughs.

                    Are you lost?
          
          Ahmet NODS.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Does your host family know you're
                    alive?
          
          Ahmet shakes his head.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Does anyone know you're alive?

          Ahmet shakes his head again.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Come with me. We'll sort this out.
          
          She takes Ahmet's hand. As her BLOODY NAILS dig into his
          wrist, his eyes widen.
          
          
          INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT
                                  JENNIFER
                    Ever since then, I just somehow
                    knew what I needed to do to be
                    strong. And when I'm full--like I
                    am right now--I'm like, immortal!
                    I can do stuff like this.
          Jennifer jams the CUTICLE STICK into her own forearm and
          drags it through her flesh. Needy screams and covers her
          mouth.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    No biggie. Watch.
          She pulls out the stick. The wound seals over instantly.
          Needy gasps and touches Jennifer's unmarked arm.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    That's some X-Men shit, right?
                                  NEEDY
                    What do you mean, "when you're
                    full"?
                                  JENNIFER
                    You know. Full. Like full of tasty
                    morsels.
          Needy shakes her head, not comprehending.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Forget it. You'd probably tell on
                    me anyway. Not that anyone would
                    believe you. You always think the
                    world is coming to an end.
                                  NEEDY
                    What about my mom's Kia? Why did
                    you attack me out there? Why were
                    you covered in blood? You didn't
                    even look human.
          Jennifer rolls her eyes.

                    Especially Chip. I think he's

                    Come on. Let me stay the night.
                    We can play "boyfriend/girlfriend"
                    like we used to.
          She smiles seductively.
          
          Needy crawls further away from her, shivering.
          Jennifer rolls her eyes and gets out of bed. She walks
          over to the second-story window and cranks it open.
          
                                  NEEDY
                    What are you doing?
                                  JENNIFER
                    You said to leave. So I'm outtie-
                    5000.
          
          She climbs onto the windowsill. Needy watches, confused.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    See you at school.
          She LEAPS gracefully out the window.
          Needy watches in stunned silence for a few moments. Then
          she creeps over to the window and looks out. Nothing
          there but the wind. Jennifer's gone.
          
          EXT. OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL BLOOD CEMETERY - DAY
          We're in a small Catholic cemetery. A small, neat gravel
          path runs through the stately old monuments into a small
          valley where a funeral is taking place.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Faint moaning and sobbing can be heard. Then, a
          procession of 6 or 7 GOTH/EMO KIDS appears on the crest
          of the hill. They move forward into the cemetery,
          flamboyantly dressed in black capes, chains, cloaks, neon
          hairpieces, fishnets, mesh, 18-hole combat boots, etc.
          These are Colin Gray's friends.
          
          One girl scatters blood-red rose petals dramatically on
          the path as she stumbles along, weeping.
          At the bottom of the hill, Colin Gray's very conservative-
          looking family stands next to the fresh grave, surrounded
          by sympathetic mourners. NEEDY stands near the back,
          looking shell-shocked. There are also a few press
          photographers snapping photos, and of course, a Catholic
          priest.
                                  PRIEST
                    We gather here today to celebrate
                    the life of Colin Gray, who was
                    plucked from the prime of...
          The priest and family are momentarily distracted by the
          motley crew of Goths descending on the funeral. The
          priest clears his throat disapprovingly.

          A GOTH BOY runs up to the grave and drops to his belly.

                    Colin. Fly into the firmament.
          She lights a bundle of SAGE and waves it in the air.
          Colin's father gags, appalled.

                    Is it cool if we camp here for a
                    few days? We want to commune with
                    his corpse. He was our spooky

                    with Jennifer Check the night he
                    was killed?
          
          She says "Jennifer Check" as if it were the most
          disgusting name imaginable. Needy covers her face.
                                  GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)
                    Because Jennifer Check is a social

                    thinks she's so special just
                    because she's popular and and is
                    what "society" considers
                    "attractive." But she's not
                    sincere. She's about as emo as a
                    breast implant! And she listens to
                    Jessica Simpson and shops at
                    Hollister. And I just know Colin
                    would never go out with someone
                    like that, and I just need
                    confirmation. From you. So did he?

                    him over to watch Aquamarine.

          She throws herself to the ground, crying and pounding the

          Colin Gray's mother buries her head in her hands and
          begins weeping. Mr. Gray attempts to comfort her.

                                   MRS. GRAY
                    By the time they found Colin in
                    that godforsaken house, he looked
                    like lasagna with teeth. I'd know--
                    I had to identify the remains. My
                    boy's not in the realm of the
                    undead. He's not flying around in
                    the firmament with magical wings
                    of flame. He's in an overpriced
                    rosewood box that's headed six
                    feet downtown.
          She kicks the coffin to illustrate.

          EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - DAY
          Two girls are hanging an homemade banner on the fence
          surrounding the football field. It says "TURNABOUT DANCE
          OCTOBER 5 -- TICKETS ON SALE."
          Needy walks briskly toward school, huddled in her parka.
          She looks totally fucked up, like she hasn't slept in
          days. There are hollows beneath her eyes.

                    They did a big memorial assembly
                    for Colin at school, and we had to
                    watch another presentation about
                    curfews and the buddy system and
                    how to deal with grief. But nobody
                    seemed to care anymore. Sorrow was
                    last week's emotion.
          
          We see Jennifer a few yards away, talking and laughing
          with some other flag team members.

                    Jennifer and I hadn't spoken since
                    our encounter in my room.
                    Actually, I hadn't really spoken
                    to anyone. I was busy with
                    research. Paranormal research.
          Needy gazes off into the distance with bloodshot eyes. As
          she stares at Jennifer, she see has a series of brief,
          gruesome HALLUCINATIONS:
          Jennifer as a grinning death mask. Jennifer as a corpse,
          the lower half of her face rotted away. Jennifer as a
          harlequin monster. Needy hears the rush of her own blood,
          the barely audible buzzing of flies...
          Chip jogs up next to her, jolting her out of her reverie.

          Needy and Chip walk to an alley behind the school.
          Melting snow drips off the eaves.
          Needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it. It's
          full of copies from the library and Internet printouts.
          The spine reads "JENNIFER RESEARCH"

                    How about magenta? You're
                    definitely a winter. My mom says
                    winters should wear regal jewel
                    tones like magenta. Or possibly
                    teal.

          EVENING
          A group of student council kids are putting the finishing
          touches on the dance decorations. The theme is "Through
          the Trees" and there are papier mache trees everywhere.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM - EVENING
          Needy stands in front of a full-length mirror, wearing a
          big `80s-style magenta prom dress. It sags on her flat
          chest and looks ridiculous.

          Greedo the ferret circles her ankles.
          Toni, Needy's mom, appears behind her with a curling
          iron.

                    like a fashion model. I always
                    thought you looked like Cindy
                    Crawford.
          She gently takes off Needy's glasses.

                    time. She's even got a mole like
                    you, except hers is on her face.
          She takes a section of Needy's hair and wraps it around
          the curling iron. Smoke rises.

          Needy stares at herself in the mirror. Despite Toni's
          best efforts, Needy looks like the walking dead.
          
          INT. CHIP'S HOUSE - EVENING
          Chip is standing in underwear and black dress socks,
          taking his suit out of the closet. Suddenly, there's a
          loud KNOCK on the door.

                    I'm in underpants, Mom!
          We hear the voice of CHIP'S MOM through the door.

                    sicko out there who likes boys.

          Needy is fully dressed and garishly made up. Toni holds a
          digital camera at arm's length and takes a shot of the
          two of them together.
          The mother/daughter photo looks ghastly. Toni's eyes are
          closed and Needy pouts miserably.

          The gym is decorated to look like an enchanted forest. A
          large banner reads "Through the Trees- Turnabout Dance"
          There are streamers and balloons everywhere in sickly
          shades of green and purple.
          
          A DJ plays badly-mixed pop music.
          Couples drift into the gym. The GOTH KIDS who were at
          Colin Gray's grave travel in a pack, sulking.
          The goth girl who loved Colin wanders through the
          decorations and pops every balloon she passes with a pin.
          As she pops them, she narrates dramatically.

                    Everything I once believed in.
          Another GOTH GIRL, looking exasperated, grabs a balloon,
          shoves it under her babydoll dress and pops it.
                                   GOTH GIRL #2

          She rapidly shoves another one under her dress and pops
          it again, smirking.
                                  GOTH GIRL #2 (CONT'D)

          The girls glare at each other.
          
          Needy walks in, looking small and apprehensive in her bad
          `80s dress. She looks around for Chip, but he's not there
          yet. A few mean kids point at her dress and snicker.
          Needy ladles some juice into a paper cup and leans
          against the wall, waiting anxiously for her Prince
          Charming.
          
                                                                  91.

          Chip is cutting through the park on his way to the dance.
          He whistles to himself.
          Across the park, he sees a STRAY DOG trotting toward him.
          The dog pants aggressively. CHIP tries to smile, but
          looks uncomfortable.
          A few SQUIRRELS emerge from the trees, gazing curiously
          at him.
          
          INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS
          Couples are beginning to grind against each other on the
          dance floor. Needy watches them longingly. She checks her
          Mickey Mouse watch.
          
          EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS
          Chip picks up the pace, jogging down the path. In the
          distance behind him we can barely make out Jennifer's
          form. She looks more spectral then we've ever seen her.
          
          Chip speeds up instinctively.
          Suddenly, Jennifer's about ten paces closer.
          Then she's closer again, as if she can fold space and
          time. She's ethereal, flickering.
          CHIP turns to look over his shoulder.
          
          INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS
          The music fades out and there's a squeal of feedback from
          the sound system. Mr. Wroblewski walks onto the stage in
          a bad suit. He awkwardly picks up the mic with his one
          good hand and pats it with his robotic one.

                    Can I have everyone's attention
                    please?
          The students turn to look at him, annoyed by the
          distraction.

                    But the real treat is yet to come.
                    It's happening right about now,
                    this treat of which I speak. We
                    have some very special guests
                    tonight. They were kind enough to
                    take a break from their sold-out
                    national tour and play our dance
                    for free.
          
          Needy gags on her juice.

          CHIP makes an incoherent noise and jumps as Jennifer
          appears, improbably, right in front of him. She's wearing
          a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect.

                    wanted to go too far, so I left

          EXT. MURPHY POOL - SAME
          Murphy Pool is even eerier from the inside. The fenced-in
          deck area is littered with garbage, abandoned pool
          furniture and graffiti. Someone has spray painted the
          word "HOPELESS" on a wall.
          CHIP shivers and looks around nervously.
          
          Jennifer nonchalantly unzips her dress and shimmies out
          of it, revealing her bra and panties.

                    Never, Trevor. I'm hot like magma.
          She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to
          climb down the ladder on the side. The pool is full of
          filthy, freezing water.

                    The water looks disgusting.
                                  JENNIFER
                    It's not so bad.

                    both lost a close friend.
          CHIP nods sadly.

                    again. Make all this madness go
                    away.
          Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees.
          He leans in and kisses Jennifer, who's still clinging to
          the ladder.
          The sound of buzzing flies grows louder.
          Suddenly, Jennifer opens her eyes. She hooks her arm
          around Chip's neck and lunges backward. They tumble off
          the ladder, into the pool. Chip SCREAMS.
          
          INT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS
          Needy runs into the park and scans the dark horizon. Her
          bare feet are bloody from running and her face is shiny
          with sweat.

          A terrified SCREAM in the distance.
          Needy whips around, hikes up her skirt and starts running
          toward Murphy Pool.
          
          She reaches the fence and starts climbing it. She slips
          and cuts her hand on a broken link.
          CHIP screams again on the other side of the fence.

          She flings herself over the top of the fence, her body
          slamming against the concrete pool deck. Her ARM snaps.
          It's a compound fracture, the bone thrusting through the
          flesh of her arm as she screams.
          
          INT. MURPHY POOL - CONTINUOUS
          Needy staggers toward the pool, which is surrounded by an
          extraterrestrial glow. Chip's moaning is almost
          unbearable. Needy stares into the abyss and claps her
          hands over her mouth.
          
          Jennifer is waist deep in the DIRTY WATER, flinging Chip
          against the wall like a rag doll. He's still conscious,
          but his skin on his chest has been RIPPED OFF to expose
          his ribs. Jennifer is CHEWING happily.
          Chip looks at Needy, his face a mask of agony.

          Jennifer begins gnawing on Chip's neck, so engaged in the
          task that she doesn't notice Needy.
          Needy climbs up on the diving board and crosses herself.

          Jennifer looks up with demonic, bloodshot eyes just as
          Needy leaps off the diving board.
          Needy lands on Jennifer's shoulders, taking her out. She
          wraps her legs around Jennifer's neck and drags her under
          the water.
          Jennifer emerges. Needy grabs her by the hair and girly-
          slaps her furiously across the face. Then she spots the
          PEPPER SPRAY lying by the side of the pool. She grabs it
          and sprays it in Jennifer's eyes. Jennifer shrieks and
          vomits NASTY, SPINY GORE all over Needy and Chip.

          Jennifer ROCKETS straight up into the air like a goddess,

          is corpselike. She's drenched from head to toe in the

          Her voice is now an unearthly growl. In the background,

          eight-foot handle off the pool deck.

          Chip suddenly stumbles in front of Needy and holds the
          HANDLE of the POOL SKIMMER in front of them like a spear.
          As Jennifer flies forward at demonic speed, she IMPALES

                    I'm gonna call for help.
          
          She reaches into Chip's pocket and pulls out his beat-up
          cell phone. She wipes off the prickly ooze with her hand.
          
                                  CHIP

                    Oh yeah. You're right.
          
          Needy dials to no avail. The phone is hopelessly clogged
          with ooze. She knocks it against the deck.
                                  NEEDY
                    It's not working. It's full of

          Chip begins gagging and coughing. He rolls onto his back,
          his eyelids fluttering.

                    glowing halo of light around them,

          Needy begins to sob hoarsely.

          Chip's eyes close. His face relaxes. He's gone.
          Needy wails at the top of her lungs. She rests her head
          against his mutilated chest, oblivious to the blood and
          bone.
          
          INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
          The dance is in full swing and students are slow-dancing.
          Girls rest their heads against boys' chests, only under
          far less macabre circumstances than Needy and CHIP's
          deathbed tableau.
          Soft Shoulder are still playing onstage, their guitars
          chiming melodically.

          EXT. C0RVALLIS HIGH CAMPUS- CONTINUOUS
          Illuminated by lamp light, Needy limps toward the gym
          entrance. She's completely covered in demon-goo. Her face
          is bloody, her hair is full of blood and guts, and her
          BROKEN ARM looks gruesome.
          In the background, yet another oblivious COUPLE are
          making out.
          
          Needy stops to stare at them, her gaze calm but obviously
          insane. They break apart and stare back at her.
                                     GIRL

          Needy bends over, casually holds one nostril closed, and
          does a "farmer blow." A bloody clot flies out of her
          nose.
          The guy takes a good look at Needy and blinks, startled.

                    were a Germanic tribe that settled
                    in Rome? They didn't wear black.
                    They wore regular linen tunics. I

                    that.
          
          The couple have already resumed making out.
          Needy rolls her eyes, turns away, and continues limping
          into the gym.
          
          INT. GYM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Needy enters the gym and slams the door shut behind her.
          People ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage.
          They're too busy slow dancing and laughing in their
          respective cliques.
          She looks up at the stage, where Soft Shoulder are
          playing an insufferably long coda.
          
          Nikolai noodles through a guitar solo, then looks up and
          sees Needy looking directly at him, her eyes full of
          hate.
          Nikolai gulps nervously and elbows Dirk.
          
          Needy points to her eyes with two fingers, then points at
          Nikolai, as if to say, Gotcha. She looks completely
          possessed.

                    Look at her.
          Dirk takes one look at Needy's face and takes off his
          guitar. Nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave
          the stage. The music stops abruptly. The kids in the gym
          murmur and complain, confused.

          Needy tries to follow them. She limps blindly toward the

          By now the band is disappearing out the side door of the
          gym.

                    an explanation for the "substance"
                    in the pool, so they chose not to
                    mention it to the press. In fact,

                    wasn't a very cooperative student.

          Needy is crouched outside Jennifer's window, hiding in
          the shrubbery. She looks almost feral, with wide eyes and
          a hungry expression.
          Through the window, we see Jennifer sitting at a vanity
          and combing her hair, oblivious to the intruder in her
          yard.

                    night. Waiting.
          We see Jennifer putting the comb down and examining her
          hair with a appraising eye.

          EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          We're seeing a FLASHBACK of the night Needy slaughtered
          Jennifer.
          Needy plunging through the window. Jennifer thrashing.
          The blood. The struggle. The levitation. The arrival of
          the police.

                    Even in her last moments of life,
                    she somehow managed to be cooler
                    than me.
          
          We see, for a moment, Jennifer's sly, challenging smile
          as Needy raises the boxcutter to slash her. That
          signature look of mastery and control.

          We see Jennifer's mother holding her again, screaming,
          though all we hear is SILENCE and STATIC. Sure enough,
          Jennifer's bleeding body seems to be artfully, sensually
          draped in her mother's arms. She almost seems to be
          SMIRKING at us.
          
          INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT
          We're back in solitary confinement, where Needy has been
          narrating the whole sordid tale. She hasn't moved a
          muscle since beginning her story. Only a single shaft of
          moonlight illuminates the room.
          
          An orderly shoves DINNER through a slot in the door. It's
          a pile of mystery meat. Needy wrinkes her nose.

                    Lesnicki is anymore. I'm a
                    different person now. A person who
                    uses curse words and kicks
                    orderlies and and sees things that
                    aren't there. A very bad, very
                    damaged person.
          
          Needy reaches up and distractedly pulls back the neckline

                    For instance, most occult scholars
                    don't know this, but if you're
                    bitten by a demon--and you live--
                    you just might absorb some of the
                    demon's abilities.
          In the moonlight, we see Needy still has a infected-
          looking BITEMARK near her shoulder. She scratches it,
          wincing.
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    You just might get lucky for once
                    in your miserable life.
          
          PULL BACK to reveal that Needy, still cross-legged is
          HOVERING five feet off the floor. Effortlessly.
          With visible concentration, she slowly flies up toward a
          narrow WINDOW positioned up near the ceiling. To anyone
          with normal abilities, it would be impossible to access.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Needy reaches the window, gazes at it for a moment, then
          SMASHES it with surprising strength.
          
          EXT. LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL - FIVE MINUTES LATER
          Needy strolls across the grounds in her bunny slippers.
          She heads confidently toward the SECURITY FENCE and
          passes through it after casually mangling the bars. Only
          a Needy-shaped hole remains.
          
          EXT. COUNTY ROAD 9 - TEN MINUTES LATER
          Needy is striding purposefully down a dark country road.
          The hospital recedes in the background.
          A few RACCOONS gather by the side of the road, watching
          Needy as she walks past.
          
          A PICKUP TRUCK whizzes by with its windows rolled down.
          "Through the Trees" blasts from the radio.
          Needy begins to sing, a lopsided grin on her face.
          
                                  NEEDY
                         (SINGING)
                    "Through the trees, I will find
                    you. Heal the ruins left inside
                    you..."
          
          EXT. MURPHY POOL - NIGHT
          
          Devil's Kettle citizens are gathered around Murphy Pool,
          crying. It's a CANDLELIGHT MEMORIAL for Chip. Their faces
          are weary and sorrowful. Photos of Chip have been
          arranged around the edge of the fence. We see a picture
          of CHIP AND NEEDY on the end.
          Someone has brought a CD player, and the mourners sing
          along, their voices soaring.
                                  VIGIL ATTENDEES
                         (SINGING)
                    "...And the stars will remind you,
                    we'll meet again..."
          
          EXT. COUNTY ROAD 9 - CONTINUOUS
          Needy holds her thumb aloft as she walks down the remote
          country highway.

                    "...We'll meet again."
          A small creek emptying into a stream   runs parallel to the
          road. Needy seems something glinting   at the mouth of the
          creek and stoops to pick it up. It's   Nikolai's BOWIE
          KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's   Kettle, never to be
          seen again.
          Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband.
          A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road. Needy sticks
          her thumb out again.
          The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver,
          a grizzled older man, rolls down the window. He eyes
          Needy lasciviously.
          
                                  OLD MAN
                    Where you looking to go, young
                    lady?
                                  NEEDY
                    East, toward Madison.
                                     OLD MAN
                       East, huh? Guess I'm headed that
                       way. But I'm gonna need you to pay
                       me in ass, gas or grass. Got that?
                       No free rides in this wagon.
                                     NEEDY
                       I don't have any money or drugs,
                       so you'll have to settle for ass.
          
                                     OLD MAN
                       Fair enough. Hop in my chariot.
          Needy gratefully hurries into the driver's seat.
                                     OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                       So why you headed East?
                                     NEEDY
                       I'm following this rock band.
                                     OLD MAN
                       Huh. Must be a hell of a group.
                                     NEEDY
                       Tonight's gonna be their last

          Needy smiles blithely and pops the clear Lifesaver into
          her mouth.
          The station wagon pulls off. As it sputters off into the
          distance, we see a road sign that reads, ironically, SOFT
          SHOULDER.
          
          We hear the song on the radio end, segueing into the DJ's
          bumper.
                                   RADIO DJ
                    What a song. Thought we'd play
                    that one in honor of Soft
                    Shoulder. They're playing in
                    Madison tonight. Should be a night
                    to remember...
          The DJ's voice fades out as the car vanishes into the
          horizon.
          
          
                                   THE END
