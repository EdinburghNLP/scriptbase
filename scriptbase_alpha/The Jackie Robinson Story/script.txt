EFFECT

In complete silence the silhouetted grey shadow of a baseball 
player at bat fills the screen. The background is a tone of 
black. The player stands motionless for a few seconds and 
then commences waggling his bat as if preparing to hit. Since 
he is a right handed hitter he stands front to audience and 
watching for the ball to come from his left. Slowly he ends 
his waggling by pulling his bat way back, stands thus posed 
a moment... then swings hard.

Instantly we hear the familiar crack of bat against ball. 
Almost simultaneously there is the roar of a baseball crowd, 
our music comes in, and our picture title, THE JACKIE ROBINSON 
STORY, hits the screen. Now, as subtitles appear, they show 
against a continuation of other baseball scenes in silhouette: 
a figure running, sliding, jumping for a high ball, throwing, 
etc. With the end of the titles we

                                   DISSOLVE:

STOCK SHOTS

Professional baseball scenes vintage of 1919: crowds in parks, 
flying pennants, action on the diamond.

CLOSEUP

On one of the park pennants we read the inscription: WORLD 
SERIES, 1919. CINCINNATI VS. CHICAGO.

STOCK SHOTS

We continue the stock shots now, perhaps even showing closeups 
of such baseball immortals as mentioned by our narrator (a 
phantom voice never identified) whom we now hear.

          NARRATOR
     In 1919 American professional 
     baseball, slowed down by World War 
     I, was picking up speed again. It 
     had its Babe Ruth who was astounding 
     the country by hitting 29 homers for 
     Boston, its Ty Cobb then winding up 
     a Hall of Fame career by leading the 
     American League in hitting with a 
     .384 average, Ty's great contemporary 
     in Cleveland, Tris Speaker, its great 
     pitchers, Walter Johnson, Burleigh 
     Grimes, Herb Pennock... And, down in 
     Georgia, it had something else... 
     coming up. Name? Jackie Robinson. 
     Race? Negro. Occupation? Infant in 
     his mother's arms.

GEORGIA 'CROPPER COUNTRY PANORAMIC (STOCK)

DRAB, FLAT ROAD LONG SHOT

Into the scene, far distance, moves a rude, mule-drawn wagon.

THE WAGON FULL SHOT

Holding the reins is an old Negro in well-worn, farmhand 
clothes. Beside him on the seat and holding a sleeping baby 
in her arms is a Negro woman, about thirty. She is dressed 
in the best that a poor woman of her time and place might be 
able to afford -- a store suit, but re-tailored to fit, and 
neatly pressed. Between them sits a two year old girl, also 
in her starched best. Behind, standing and sitting amidst 
some cheap suitcases, are three other children, two boys and 
a girl, from four to ten years of age.

SAME - CLOSER

The cry of a far-off train whistle comes to the group. The 
mother shifts about in an expression of nervousness and 
glances back at the children behind her. The whistle has 
caused excitement among them. The oldest girl leans forward 
to her mother eagerly, apparently wondering about the train.

GIRL - MOTHER CLOSE SHOT

The mind of the mother is too pre-occupied to permit her to 
give the girl more than a fleeting smile and then she turns 
back.

          NARRATOR
     In the family history of every living 
     American, except for the American 
     Indian, there is the story of 
     migration and settling and re-
     settling. Either the American himself, 
     or an ancestor, had to travel to get 
     where that American is today. Jackie 
     Robinson was raised in Pasadena, 
     California. This is how his mother, 
     a widow, brought him and his brothers 
     and sisters out of Georgia.

THE WAGON LONG SHOT

The old man is whipping up his mules to hurry them along.

DOUBLE SEAT IN DAY COACH - NIGHT MEDIUM SHOT

The mother and her brood are asleep. She is against the 
window, the baby still in her arms, and her head fallen back 
against the headrest. Alongside her is curled the two-year 
old girl. Half-sitting, half-slumped against each other on 
the seat opposite are the next two youngest children, and 
lying on blankets on the floor between the seats is cramped 
the oldest child. Once, as the narrator talks, the mother 
opens her eyes slowly, looks her children over, makes a slight 
re-adjustment of position here and there among them, then 
lets her head fall back again.

                                   DISSOLVE:

ESTABLISHING SHOT - RAILROAD STATION - PASADENA CALIFORNIA - 
DAY - (STOCK)

A taxi in front of the station takes on Mrs. Robinson and 
her children. The driver helps with their luggage and then 
pulls away from the station. Except for music, the scene is 
silent.

INT. TAXI - (PROCESS)

Mrs. Robinson and the children in the taxi as they look out 
at the scene. (Stock shots of Pasadena's business sections, 
then of the residential area are to be inter-cut.)

WASHINGTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY MEDIUM SHOT - AS FROM 
TAXICAB

As children leave school, trooping out noisily and happily. 
Among the children are several Negroes.

INT. TAXI - (PROCESS)

The children and the mother gaze intently as they note Negro 
pupils among the white children. Then they gaze at each other 
as if it is something hard to believe.

CLOSE ON TWO OF THE CHILDREN - (PROCESS)

As they turn their heads to continue looking at the school 
even though the taxi is now some distance past it.

TAXI DRIVING INTO NEGRO DISTRICT

As CAMERA FOLLOWS TAXI, we see that we are now in a low-priced 
area of homes, stores, etc.

          NARRATOR
     They had never seen anything like 
     the city that was to be their new 
     home. They looked and wondered and 
     the mother told herself that sooner 
     or later they would be well, if 
     humbly, settled there... And -- in 
     time -- they were... and very 
     humbly...

As narration fades, we

STREET SCENE LONG

A nine year old colored boy is running towards the Robinson 
home in high excitement. He is carrying a fielder's glove at 
which he has to glance every other second though he is in 
full flight.

          NARRATOR
          (talking through the 
          following scenes as 
          well)
     This isn't Jackie -- but when he was 
     nine, and the family couldn't afford 
     to get him a baseball glove, this is 
     how his mother helped him make a 
     necessary adjustment to life. Jackie 
     had found an old, dilapidated glove...

ROBINSON HOME MED. SHOT

The kid leaps up the stairs and into the house.

ROBINSON KITCHEN MED. SHOT

The kid slides into the kitchen, holding the glove out to 
Mrs. Robinson who is turning around from the gas range, and 
talks to her eagerly.

MRS. ROBINSON CLOSEUP

She takes the glove, examines it, and has to smile. It is 
badly frayed, the side stitching burst in a number of places, 
and padding extruding. Nevertheless, she nods and turns 
away...

KITCHEN MED. SHOT

Mrs. Robinson taking a sewing kit out of a drawer, the kid 
hopping around just in back of her and getting his head in 
her way. She goes to table, sits down, and commences threading 
a needle.

MRS. ROBINSON AND BOY CLOSE

She starts to take the first stitch. He asks her something 
anxiously. She nods reassuringly and his face lights up with 
a heart-wide grin.

                                   DISSOLVE:

STREET SCENE - DAY MED. SHOT

The same boy stands at a street corner, a bunch of newspapers 
at his feet, a dozen or so more under his arm, selling papers, 
both to car patrons and to pedestrians.

          NARRATOR
     Between work and school Jackie, like 
     this boy, didn't have all the time 
     in the world to play...

The boy turns his back to camera as he sells a newspaper and 
we see the glove sticking partially out of his back pocket.

          NARRATOR
     ...but he always kept his glove 
     handy...

EXT. EMPTY PLAY LOT LONG SHOT

Running onto an empty lot where several other boys are playing 
ball in a make-shift game, is Jackie. One of the boys bats 
out a fly and Jackie scoots after it.

(NOTE: The following shots, illustrating narrator's talk, 
are quick, almost montage views, taken against any studio 
backgrounds already up and available. They are all angled to 
keep face of boy unrecognizable... and as shots progress boy 
gets bigger to indicate his growth.)

Boy delivering package to woman who opens door.

          NARRATOR
          (against above)
     All the things that boys find to do 
     when they have to work through their 
     schoolhood years, Jackie did...

ESTABLISHING SHOT - ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - (STOCK)

Track events in progress. Students and fans watching.

          NARRATOR
     ...yet he managed to make time for 
     sports as well.

BROAD JUMP PIT LONG SHOT - (STOCK)

We get a bare flash of a young Negro lad in track suit taking 
his run and launching into a broad jump.

          NARRATOR
     This still isn't Jackie, but when he 
     attended Pasadena Junior College he 
     led in all sports, broke the National 
     Junior College running broad jump 
     record with a leap of 25 feet, six 
     inches -- a record set a few years 
     earlier by his own brother, Mack!

AERIAL SHOT - LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL COLISEUM - DAY FOOTBALL

A PLAY - (STOCK)

MED. LONG SHOT THE PLAYERS - (STOCK)

As signals are called and a runner gets the ball. (From this 
distance we can't recognize any player or distinguish actual 
numbers on their uniforms.)

MED. SHOT

The player with the ball breaks through the opposing team's 
line and dashes for the sidelines and toward camera.

          NARRATOR
     But this -- IS -- Jackie Robinson...

As player nears camera we recognize him as Jackie. Over scene 
is HEARD roar of the crowd. CAMERA HOLDS as Jackie runs into 
a CLOSE SHOT, then past camera.

          NARRATOR
     ...playing football for the University 
     of California at Los Angeles where 
     he had won an athletic scholarship.

STOCK SHOT LONG

Any shot of a player crossing into end zone for a touchdown, 
as opposing players trail after him... this, apparently, 
being the end of Jackie's run.

THE CROWD LONG

They are cheering.

FOOTBALL EXCERPTS - (STOCK) MONTAGE

These should be actual shots of Jackie in action against 
various college teams during his UCLA days. (During these we 
should work in a studio CLOSEUP or two to let us take a good 
look at the man.) Each of the shots is identified by the 
narrator as follows:

          NARRATOR
     Against Southern California!

          NARRATOR
     Against Oregon!

          NARRATOR
     Against Stanford! Etc.

COLISEUM STANDS MEDIUM

We see small section of student body watching game. Seated 
with two white girl companions is an attractive Negro girl 
(Rae). After joining crowd in a cheer one of the white girls 
turns to Rae.

          WHITE GIRL
     Jackie sure can run! How does it 
     feel to see your future husband going 
     wild down there?

          RAE
          (acting taken aback)
     Future husband? You're faster than 
     he is! He hasn't got that far yet.

          WHITE GIRL
          (waving hand derisively)
     Now don't pretend, Rae! We know.
          (turning to other 
          white girl)
     Don't we, Claire?

As other nods --

          WHITE GIRL
     So don't pretend, Rae!

Rae laughs but is a little embarrassed at being kidded about 
it. The white girl sees this and pats Rae's face, as you 
will to a child you are fond of, to indicate she meant no 
harm.

FOOTBALL FIELD LONG SHOT

Another quick shot of action on the field, with crowd roaring, 
as we

                                        SLOWLY DISSOLVE:

EXTERIOR MED. SHOT

Our shot takes in the tailgate of a furniture truck backed 
close to a warehouse-like entrance or loading platform. A 
tablet on wall of warehouse reading EMPIRE STORAGE COMPANY 
helps identify scene. A Negro of about fifty, strongly built, 
stands on truck tailgate waiting. Jackie, head hidden under 
huge club chair which he is carrying, walks into scene from 
warehouse.

          NARRATOR
     It wasn't all touchdowns and cheers, 
     however. There was also work...

Jackie swings chair to truck where older man grabs it.

          JACKIE
          (wiping perspiration)
     That's the last one, Jake.

Jake settles chair down, leans against it.

          JAKE
     I saw you play yesterday.

          JACKIE
          (pleased)
     Yeah? Like the game?

          JAKE
          (judiciously)
     It was good. You was good. But what's 
     the use if you got to do this kind 
     of work? I didn't have to go to no 
     college to get this job.

          JACKIE
          (smiling, after pause)
     You see, Jake, you're smarter than I 
     am.

Jake studies Jackie a moment, and then, with a slow, knowing 
smile, lifts chair up and disappears into truck with it.

EXT. UCLA CAMPUS PANORAMIC - (STOCK)

General shot campus showing college buildings b.g. and 
students either wandering around or lounging on ground.

          NARRATOR
     And there was always studying to be 
     done.

TREE TRUNK CLOSE

Jackie sitting with back propped against tree reading book.

          RAE'S VOICE
     Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

Jackie looks up as Rae enters scene. He would get up but she 
slips down beside him before he can get started.

          RAE
     Stay put. I was held up by Claire 
     King. She just wanted to talk.

          JACKIE
          (indicating his book)
     That's okay. I can use all the time 
     I can get for this.

          RAE
          (pretending affront)
     Oh. Then I'll go.

Jackie instantly tosses book over one shoulder and takes one 
of Rae's hands in his so she can't get away.

          JACKIE
     Did you say something?

          RAE
          (pretending alarm)
     Your book! What about your book?

          JACKIE
     What about you?

Rae has to break down and smile and they are looking at each 
other as we

Rae wincing as voices, o.s., yell:

          VOICES
     Jackie's down! Wow! They sure got 
     him that time!

A white girl sitting with a boy friend in front of Rae 
comments:

          GIRL
          (indignantly)
     They sure pile on to him!

          BOY
          (brutally)
     What do you think? Who wouldn't if 
     they had a chance to slug...

The girl pokes him and indicates with her eyes that Rae is 
seated right behind them. The boy looks back at Rae, then at 
his girl again with a non-committal shrug.

LONG SHOT - THE FIELD - RAE'S ANGLE

As the players finally unpile. However, the ball-carrier 
lies there and two or three of his own teammates rush toward 
him.

QUICK CUT - RAE - ALARMED CLOSE SHOT - THE FIELD

Jackie on ground, ball under him, two or three players trying 
to help him to his feet. While they do so, the trainer rushes 
into scene to help them. CAMERA HOLDS as the trainer and 
another player help Jackie off the field. Over scene comes a 
cheer from the crowd, glad that Jackie isn't seriously hurt. 
However, he does have a decided limp.

CLOSEUP - RAE

She looks greatly relieved.

MED. SHOT - JACKIE, TRAINER AND PLAYER

As they walk toward camera, then past camera, on their way 
to dressing room, o.s.

MED. CLOSE - AT ENTRANCE TO DRESSING ROOMS

As Jackie, the trainer and another player walk into scene 
and enter the dressing room. All are quiet, and over scene 
we HEAR roar of the fans again.

INT. DRESSING ROOMS - DAY FULL SHOT

Lights are on, there is a doctor's bag on one of the rub-
down tables, a dozen or so uniforms tossed on various chairs 
and on the floor near the lockers. The trainer and player 
help Jackie up onto a table and pull his jersey off. Jackie 
winces.

TRAINING TABLE TWO SHOT

          TRAINER
          (talking as he works)
     Hurt much?

          JACKIE
     Yes.

          TRAINER
     Hip's badly bruised.

The player who helped Jackie off the field comes into shot. 
He is angry.

          PLAYER
     I don't know what's wrong with those 
     guys giving it to Jackie like that. 
     Just because he's...

          TRAINER
          (curtly)
     Hold it! I knew before the game they 
     were out to watch Jackie close. The 
     trainer on their team told me. But 
     it was because of his playing ability 
     and nothing else.

          PLAYER
     Oh.

          TRAINER
     You better get back to the bench.
          (to Jackie)
     I wasn't kidding about that either, 
     Jackie. They had respect for you out 
     there. Plenty.

JACKIE CLOSEUP

Jackie mulls over the trainer's words.

          JACKIE
     Thanks, Dick. It's nice to know.

          TRAINER
          (pleasantly)
     Say, Jackie. How's your brother Mack? 
     I remember him when he went to the 
     University of Oregon... and when he 
     ran in the Olympics overseas. One of 
     the finest athletes I ever met.

          JACKIE
          (after pause)
     Oh, Mack? He's fine. Fine, thank 
     you.

FRONT STEPS ROBINSON HOME MEDIUM

Jackie and Rae are sitting quietly on the steps. Mrs. Robinson 
comes out door just as Jackie slips his body down one step 
and lays his head against Rae's shoulder. Mrs. Robinson, who 
has some knitting in her hand, goes to a chair in a dark 
corner of the porch.

JACKIE - RAE CLOSE

          RAE
     Still in some pain, aren't you? I 
     think football is a wild game. I 
     don't think I like it.

          JACKIE
          (shifting in discomfort)
     I don't myself right now.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     I think it's disgusting... young men 
     battering each other... no better 
     than just plain old bulls.

Jackie gives Rae an amused side glance at this, then shrugs.

          JACKIE
     Well, it won't last much longer.

          RAE
     Why? What are you going to do?

          JACKIE
     Oh... something. This isn't getting 
     me anywhere. I mean... this isn't 
     getting us anywhere.

He shifts about to look directly at Rae with a smile.

          JACKIE
     And that's serious!

          RAE
          (embarrassed)
     Oh-h!

She pushes his head around and away from her.

MRS. ROBINSON CLOSE

She sees this byplay and her face softens in a smile. Quietly 
she gathers up her knitting and gets up.

FRONT STEPS MEDIUM

Mrs. Robinson enters house. Jackie hears the door closing 
and looks around. Then he smiles down at Rae who smiles back 
in understanding.

JACKIE - RAE CLOSE

          RAE
     She's cute.

          JACKIE
     Yeah...

          RAE
     What did you mean, Jackie? About 
     your going to do something?

JACKIE CLOSEUP

          JACKIE
          (his face serious)
     Oh... I mean I'm too big to be just 
     ornamental... Keeps Mom and Mack 
     hustling to pay my way... I've got 
     to start in being real useful...

DISSOLVE:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT MED. SHOT - JACKIE

He is in bed, unable to sleep. He has a school book on a 
table beside the bed; a small lamp is burning. He picks up 
the book and studies it for a few moments, but his heart 
isn't in it. A clock on the table shows that it is three 
o'clock in the morning. Jackie sighs deeply, then slowly 
starts climbing out of bed, still careful of his hip.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT MEDIUM - JACKIE

Standing by the gas range Jackie pours hot coffee into a 
vacuum lunch bottle. Two sandwiches are on a piece of paper. 
He corks the bottle and is wrapping up the sandwiches when 
we hear Mrs. Robinson's voice.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Who is that? You, Jackie?

          JACKIE
     Yes, mom.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
          (alarmed)
     You sick?

          JACKIE
     No. Just couldn't sleep. I'm going 
     out to see Mack. Want to talk to him 
     anyway.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
     Can't it wait till morning? It's 
     three o'clock.

          JACKIE
     I know. But I won't be long. I know 
     where to find him.

          MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
          (fading off)
     Three o'clock! My! My! What a thing 
     to do... what a thing to do...

EXT. PASADENA STREET SCENE - NIGHT LONG

Jackie walking along Colorado Avenue, or similar business 
street, deserted and lonely at this hour except for a street 
cleaner in the distance. Jackie carries the lunch package in 
one hand, much as he would a football. Sandwich and vacuum 
bottle are wrapped in the same, tight package.

TRUCKING

Jackie approaching street cleaner who, however, does not 
hear him because of the noise of his heavy broom and the 
fact that parked cars separate the two men.

JACKIE AND CAR MEDIUM

Jackie has reached car. He stops a second and we hear the 
street cleaner's broom being pushed over the concrete. Jackie 
takes a few more steps, bringing him past the car. He stops 
and turns in the direction of the street cleaner.

          JACKIE
          (knowing it will be a 
          surprise)
     Hello, Mack.

MACK MEDIUM

We see that Mack, Jackie's older brother by three years, and 
former University of Oregon track star, is the street cleaner. 
He is in the loose uniform of the town's sanitation corps 
and is startled by Jackie's words and appearance, then grins.

          MACK
     What the... what are you doing here 
     at this hour? Schoolboys should be 
     in bed.

JACKIE - MACK

          JACKIE
     Yeah. I couldn't sleep so I fixed 
     you some lunch. Here...!

He throws the package like a forward pass and Mack, shifting 
broom to crook of his elbow, snags it expertly.

          MACK
          (dropping his broom)
     Man oh man -- I can use some... Hope 
     you figured I was a bit hungry...

He is obviously very pleased.

          JACKIE
          (chuckling)
     You bet. Coffee, too.

          MACK
          (indicating curb)
     Now you're talking. Let's sit down 
     and take it easy for a while...

Mack opens the package, takes a sandwich and offers one to 
Jackie. Jackie shakes his head.

          MACK
          (takes a bite)
     Anything bothering you?

          JACKIE
     Yeah. I want to quit college. Right 
     after the basketball season... when 
     my scholarship is up.

Mack almost chokes on his first bite.

          JACKIE
          (pounding Mack's back)
     Take it easy, boy. I don't want to 
     lose you now.
          (getting serious)
     You know Mom. She sees me as a doctor, 
     minister or lawyer, perhaps. I'd 
     like to please her but it just isn't 
     in me...

          MACK
     Yeah. I know.

          JACKIE
          (continuing his thought)
     It would mean years more in school -- 
     and the way I feel, I'd rather work 
     at getting some kind of a sport job -- 
     an assistant coach -- or a trainer -- 
     something like that... But I can't 
     figure out which to aim at... Coaching 
     jobs are darn hard to get...

          MACK
          (thoughtfully)
     All I can say, Jackie, is that you 
     ought to stay in college as long as 
     you can -- try to graduate -- and 
     keep at sports as hard as you can. 
     Something might turn up... and as 
     far as education goes -- it'll do 
     you good...

Then, noticing the trash he has been sweeping, he smiles.

          MACK
     How much good -- I'm not saying.

Jackie nods. Neither of them is at all bitter about it. It 
is just accepted.

          JACKIE
     Sure... I know... But I've got to go 
     to work. I want to marry Rae. School's 
     one thing -- but you and Mom can't 
     support me in marriage.

During the scene, Mack has continued to eat and now he opens 
the thermos of coffee. Jackie shakes his head that he doesn't 
want any and Mack pours himself a cup. As he starts to drink, 
a convertible filled with young people drives in sight, the 
youngsters singing a football victory song. Jackie and Mack 
watch it drive by. Banners and streamers hang from the car -- 
all showing UCLA insignia.

Mack grins at Jackie.

          MACK
     Funny place for a football hero to 
     be sitting at this time of night...

Jackie grins back at him.

          JACKIE
     Funny job you've got for a university 
     man...

He kicks at the pile of debris near them. Mack grins back at 
him, sighs.

          MACK
          (philosophically)
     That's the way it is...

They sit in silence for a moment and CAMERA PULLS BACK and 
draws away from them, their figures small against the long, 
lonely, dark street...

FADE IN:

EXT. UCLA CAMPUS - NIGHT ESTABLISHING

EXT. GYM - NIGHT ENTRANCE

A student about to enter calls to another student passing 
by.

          STUDENT
     Hey, Jerry! Going to watch basketball 
     practice?

The passing student shakes his head and points to some books 
he is carrying to indicate he has to study.

INT. GYM FULL SHOT

A practice session is on, the players just passing the ball 
around and shooting baskets. At the sidelines stands an 
assistant coach.

JACKIE MED. SHOT

We see him run to the basket, get the ball on a pass, and 
shoot. Catching the ball as it comes through the net he slings 
it far upcourt.

ASSISTANT COACH MEDIUM

          COACH
          (calling out)
     All right, fellows. Let's work out 
     in teams.

GYM LONG SHOT

The players break up into two teams and take position for 
the start of a game.

JACKIE AND PLAYER CLOSE

Jackie and the player opposing him stand together waiting 
for the opening whistle to sound.

          PLAYER
     That true, Jackie, about your quitting 
     at the end of the basketball season?

As Jackie nods --

          PLAYER
     Not even going out for baseball again?

          JACKIE
     No, I'm not.

          PLAYER
     Don't you like baseball?

          JACKIE
     Can't afford to like it!

          PLAYER
     Why not?

          JACKIE
     Ever hear of a Negro in organized 
     ball?

GAME LONG

We see a few seconds of game skirmish, and follow Jackie 
down the court in a rush towards the basket which he 
ultimately shoots.

JACKIE AND PLAYER CLOSE

They are both panting a little now as they line up against 
each other again.

          PLAYER
          (smiling)
     Well, don't think I'll miss you. 
     I'll make the first team after you're 
     gone.

          JACKIE
          (with friendly dig 
          into player's ribs)
     Well, I'll miss you. You kept me 
     stepping.

The other player pulls his fist back as if to sock Jackie.

          PLAYER
     Get out! Kept you stepping! I didn't 
     have a chance!

They are both grinning as the whistle sounds and they jump 
into play again.

BASKETBALL GAMES - (STOCK) MONTAGE

We see Jackie in action against other college teams during 
the basketball season, and over each separate game appears a 
title identifying the particular rival college involved in 
the shot. After final shot we

                                   DISSOLVE:

EXT. STUDY HALL LONG

A group of students on the steps of one of the campus 
buildings are reading the college paper which is held by one 
of them.

GROUP MEDIUM

One of the students is reading aloud.

          STUDENT
     "UCLA loses four-letter athlete. 
     Jackie Robinson leaving school."

          SECOND STUDENT
     He wasn't kidding.

          THIRD STUDENT
     Gee, that boy's gonna leave a hole 
     behind him hard to fill. How come?

One of the other students rubs forefinger against thumb in 
the "money sign."

          STUDENT
     Economics, my boy. A man must live 
     before he can play. And in order to 
     live...

He makes the money sign again as we cut go:

INT. DRESSING ROOM MEDIUM

Jackie is taking his stuff from his locker and packing it in 
a small bag. The trainer we met in the football sequences 
and a student are standing by. Jackie is explaining something 
to them.

          JACKIE
     ...Coming out of Junior College to 
     UCLA, the way I did, I only had a 
     two-year scholarship to fit my 
     athletic eligibility. Well... the 
     scholarship is over.

          TRAINER
     Isn't there any way you can stay on?

          JACKIE
     My mother is 63 years old. She's 
     worked as housekeeper, maid, cook, 
     laundress, janitress and selling 
     yard goods in a store to keep us 
     kids going.

          TRAINER
     She wanted to do it. She must not 
     want to see you give up now.

          JACKIE
     Yes, she'd work for the next ten 
     years if I stayed in school...

          TRAINER
     Well?

          JACKIE
     Can't take a chance. I can't expect 
     more future than Mack... and with 
     all his college he wasn't able to 
     get anything worth while. That's not 
     worth ten more years of work for my 
     mother.

His packing finished, Jackie shakes hands with both men.

          JACKIE
     Luck to you, and I'll take the same.

          TRAINER AND STUDENT
          (ad lib)
     All the luck in the world. You'll 
     make out all right, Jackie.

As Jackie exits the trainer turns to the student.

          TRAINER
     Somehow it doesn't make sense. The 
     only four-letter man we've had at 
     UCLA in ten years. High basketball 
     scorer for us in both years he was 
     here. On top of that he's as fine a 
     baseball player as I have ever seen... 
     and it don't mean a thing. He's 
     walking out of here without anything 
     ahead of him except a couple of games 
     of pro-football signed up.

          STUDENT
     Maybe he can have a career in 
     professional football.

          TRAINER
          (shaking his head)
     Baseball is his game.

          STUDENT
     He tells everyone he doesn't care 
     about baseball.

          TRAINER
          (with a short smile)
     Yeah... I know. What else is he going 
     to say?

INT. ROBINSON HOME CLOSEUP

A pair of hands counting a roll of paper money, each bill 
being slapped down on a table.

CAMERA MOVES BACK to reveal Jackie standing up and counting 
the money in front of his mother who is seated at the table. 
She seems puzzled as she looks at the bills and then up at 
him.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What's that, Jackie?

          JACKIE
          (still counting)
     Money. Remember, Mom?

She gives him a warning glance not to joke with her.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What is that, Jackie?

          JACKIE
          (in mollifying tone)
     Okay. Okay, Mom. It's an advance 
     payment for playing professional 
     football. I'm signed up to play for 
     Honolulu.

He tidies up the bills and leaves them in front of her as he 
sits down.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     But I don't like for you to play 
     football. Is that why you quit 
     college?

          JACKIE
     No, Mom. I'm going there just to 
     play a few games. They came to me 
     when they heard I was going to quit. 
     We can use the money till I get what 
     I want. So I took it.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Honolulu's far away.

          JACKIE
     I'll be there and back inside of two 
     months.

She is troubled as she looks at the money and then up at 
Jackie again. He shrugs.

          JACKIE
     And then, maybe, I'll have some 
     answers to all the letters I've been 
     writing for a coaching job.

When she still doesn't reply he smiles and reaches out to 
pat her folded hands reassuringly.

          JACKIE
     It'll be all right, Mom. Just give 
     me a little time and you'll be proud 
     of me.

She looks directly at him.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I was proud of you when you went to 
     college.

          JACKIE
          (gravely)
     I know. But... I didn't feel proud 
     of myself.

EXT. ROBINSON HOME - NIGHT FULL SHOT

Jackie and Rae are sitting on the front steps, apparently 
having reached a pause in their conversation which has left 
them both looking a little troubled.

DOLLY SHOT

CAMERA MOVES IN as we hear:

          JACKIE
     ...May take us a little longer this 
     way but it means a better start...

As she nods mechanically --

          JACKIE
     When it does... uh...
          (in sudden disgust)
     Oh... maybe you're right. Maybe I'm 
     just going around in circles.

Rae turns to him quickly in sudden compunction.

          RAE
     Jackie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to 
     act so cold to the idea. I'm not 
     even listening because... because I 
     just don't want you to go away.

As he tries to talk --

          RAE
     No. I know you have to do something 
     like this to get a start. I know... 
     but that doesn't make me like it.

          JACKIE
          (taking her hand)
     All right. And I am going around in 
     circles. I don't know how to beat 
     that. But Rae... there's one thing I 
     want you to be sure of...

As she nods --

          JACKIE
     Every circle comes right back to 
     you.

As her face lights up --

          JACKIE
     And all I'm worrying about is getting 
     around fast enough!

They smile at each other and then Rae leans her head back 
against Jackie's chest. They stay like this, both gazing 
off, when she speaks again.

          RAE
          (slowly)
     I have to take my post-graduate 
     nursing course in a hospital. I think 
     I can get in Bellevue in New York. 
     That's where I'll be...

          JACKIE
          (frowning)
     But why so far...

          RAE
          (turning to face him)
     That's where I'll be when you're 
     ready. It's better that way. Something 
     for me to do. You're more free...

They study each other's faces.

          JACKIE
     All right.

INT. SHIPBOARD CABIN - (PROCESS) CLOSE

A corner of a cabin. Jackie is typing away at a small table 
next to a porthole through which we can see a mid-ocean 
horizon rising and falling with the roll of the ship. Next 
to him is a small pile of letters already written. The distant 
clang of ship's bells is HEARD.

TYPEWRITER CLOSEUP

We can see that the letter is printed "S.S. LURLINE - HONOLULU 
BOUND." Under it he has typed the following heading and 
salutation:

"Mr. W.J. Jeffrey Athletic Director Overton College Overton, 
Calif."

And that he is tapping out the first few lines of his letter 
which begins as follows:

"Dear Mr. Jeffrey:

In application for an athletic coaching, or assistant 
coaching, appointment at Overton, I would like to submit the 
following qualifications..."

EXT. ROBINSON HOME - DAY MED. SHOT - JACKIE

He is walking up to the house, carrying a suitcase in each 
hand. CAMERA HOLDS as he reaches front door.

EXT. FRONT DOOR CLOSE - JACKIE

He lowers suitcases and knocks at the door as he finds it 
locked. He waits a moment, gets no answer, then finds his 
own key and unlocks the door.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY MED. SHOT

As Jackie enters, places his bags on the floor and closes 
the door behind him. He stands there for a moment, then goes 
toward a table where there are several pieces of mail.

JACKIE AT TABLE MED. CLOSE

He picks up the dozen or so letters and finds that four of 
them are for him. He sits down, opens and reads them, one by 
one. We do not see the first two which he crumples up and 
drops into a wastebasket. The third one he re-reads and thinks 
about for a moment, then places it to one side. The fourth 
he reads and crumples again and discards with the others. 
Then he rises and walks back and forth as he thinks. After a 
moment he stands at the living room window and stares out 
silently.

CLOSE - JACKIE

He stares out of the window, then sees something, turns and 
heads for the front door.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY MED. SHOT

Mrs. Robinson is walking up toward the house, carrying two 
large sacks of groceries. Jackie hurries to meet her, greeting 
her and taking the packages at the same time, even as they 
embrace.

          JACKIE
     Hello, Mom...

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (happy to see him)
     I was hoping you'd be here -- your 
     telegram came just a little while 
     ago so I went out to get some 
     things...

He knows that she intended to get some extra-special food 
for a homecoming dinner.

MED. CLOSE AT KITCHEN DOOR

As they enter kitchen to put down the packages.

     Not a scratch. Got a sore arm though -- 
     from writing letters...

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (as she follows him 
          in)
     Letters? Some letters came for you.

She comes back into the living room, heads for the table 
where Jackie picked up his mail. As Jackie reenters:

          MRS. ROBINSON
     I put them here...

          JACKIE
     I read them...

She turns to him, hoping that he will have some good news. 
He smiles at her, then moves over and picks up the letter he 
saved and hands it to her.

     What's this National Youth 
     Association...?

          JACKIE
     It's something the Government set up 
     to help underprivileged children --- 
     they get all sorts of training ---

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (hopefully)
     ...And they want you to be an athletic 
     instructor?

          JACKIE
     Looks that way... Anyway, I'm taking 
     it before they change their minds...

Mrs. Robinson looks at the letter again, then back at Jackie.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     ...Pennsylvania...
          (with a smile)
     You'll be near Rae, anyway...

She moves to the sofa and sits down as she talks.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Maybe you can be there when she 
     graduates -- or whatever it is -- 
     from the hospital...

          JACKIE
          (nodding)
     Yeah.

     So even if we don't have a doctor in 
     the family, we'll have a registered 
     nurse, anyway...

     Why not write her and let her know...?

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY FULL SHOT

This is a room in the nurses' quarters of a large hospital. 
Everything white, clean, uncrowded. Rae, in graduate nurse's 
uniform, is seated at a desk reading a letter. On the desk 
is a picture of Jackie -- in civilian clothes. There is a 
box of stationery, ink, pen, etc., on the table in addition 
to several books.

CLOSE - RAE READING LETTER

She shakes her head, smiling a bit, but with a bit of sadness.

INSERT PORTION OF LETTER

"...I'm enjoying my work with the kids and the Association 
has been fine to me. I'll be leaving it soon, though, as the 
Army has called. But at least, I can stop worrying about the 
future for awhile..."

BACK TO SCENE

Rae folds the letter and smiles in sad contemplation as we 
hear her thinking voice paraphrase Jackie's last sentence:

          RAE'S VOICE
     He can stop worrying now that he's 
     in the Army...

We know that she will really start worrying. She glances at 
the framed photograph of him. As we look at it, Jackie's 
clothes change into the uniform of an Army Private.

ARMY POST - (STOCK) MONTAGE

If obtainable we will show quick scenes of Jackie's army 
life as he supervises various athletic activities.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY RAE'S DESK

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal another Negro officer with Jackie. 
This man sits on a bunk -- both are dressed in their uniforms. 
Jackie moves to a chest and takes some clothes and stuffs 
them into the Army bag. Then he takes a photo of Rae off the 
wall and packs that in the suitcase. The last thing he removes 
from the chest is a fielder's baseball glove.

          ROOMMATE
     What you going to do with that?

CLOSEUP - SAME BAG

As Jackie's reaches into it and comes out with the glove. 
There is a burst of laughter as CAMERA PULLS BACK to show 
that Jackie is home and unpacking his bag in front of Rae, 
Mrs. Robinson and Mack, all three of whom are laughing.

          RAE
     Just like you. First thing one sees 
     when you unpack is a baseball glove... 
     or a pair of spiked shoes...

Jackie draws himself up a little stiffish and addresses Rae 
in formal tones.

          JACKIE
     And when have you ever seen me unpack 
     before, Miss Isum?

          RAE
          (embarrassed in front 
          of Mrs. Robinson and 
          Mack)
     I didn't mean that I had ever seen 
     you... why, Jackie! What do you...
          (whirling about)
     Well, if that's to be your attitude!

She flounces from room and Jackie motions to his mother and 
Mack as he prepares to follow.

          JACKIE
     Excuse me. I have to effect a... 
     a... a rapprochement, I think they 
     call it.

He hurries after Rae while Mrs. Robinson looks after him and 
then turns to Mack to ask with suspicion edging her voice:

          MRS. ROBINSON
     What's he mean by that... that 
     rapproche -- that stuff?

          MACK

     Search me. We didn't bother with 
     that kind of stuff when I went to 
     college.

EXT. WAREHOUSE MED. SHOT

Same scene as Scene 43. Jake is standing on back of truck 
maneuvering a settee onto its legs when Jackie walks into 
the scene and smiles up at him.

          JACKIE
     H'ya, Jake.

          JAKE
     You been out of the Army a long time 
     now, Jackie. Ain't got yourself a 
     good coaching job yet?

          JACKIE
     Not quite.

          JAKE
          (grunting)
     Still writing letters, eh?

          JACKIE
     Yes. But if I don't get an answer 
     soon I'll be back here looking for 
     my old job.

          JAKE
     I hope that don't happen, son. But 
     if it does... I can sure use you.
          (changing tone)
     Why don't you go to them coaching 
     places in person instead of writing 
     them letters?

          JACKIE
     You mean why don't I spend fifty 
     dollars train fare instead of a three 
     cent stamp?

          JAKE
          (laughing)
     Yeah... I ain't got all the brains 
     in the world.
          (laughing louder)
     I wouldn't even want to prove I got 
     my share!

The two are laughing, with Jake sounding off in wild whoops, 
when Mack's voice is heard, o.s.

          MACK'S VOICE
          (calling)
     Jackie!

They stop laughing and turn around as Mack runs into scene 
carrying a letter which he hands to Jackie.

          MACK
          (excited)
     It just came.

Jackie tears letter open.

JACKIE CLOSEUP

He is reading letter.

MACK AND JAKE MEDIUM

          MACK
          (to Jake)
     It's from the Kansas City Monarchs. 
     It can only be one thing... an offer.

          JAKE
     Who are they?

          MACK
          (surprised)
     Never heard of the Kansas City 
     Monarchs? It's a professional baseball 
     team.

          JAKE
     But I thought professional teams 
     don't want us.

          MACK
     It's an all-colored team.

          GROUP
     Jackie looks up and Mack can't wait.

          MACK
     Well?

          JACKIE
          (a little dazed)
     A hundred dollars a week... to play 
     shortstop.

Jake jumps from truck and is so intrigued he takes letter 
from Jackie to puzzle over it himself.

          JACKIE
          (puzzled)
     And I didn't even write them. How 
     did they know?

          MACK
     Oh, they knew about you from UCLA 
     and some of the pro games you played 
     at Brookside. They must have scouted 
     you.

          JAKE
          (handing letter back 
          to Jackie)
     Here. That's what it says... a hundred 
     a week.
          (studying furniture 
          on truck)
     Just pushing a little old baseball 
     around. Maybe there's something to 
     that college stuff after all.

PLATE HOSPITAL CLOSEUP

INT. DRUG STORE CLOSE

Just a table in a corner at which sit Jackie and Rae, the 
latter in white uniform of a nurse, and with Coca Cola bottles 
and glasses before them. An air of sadness seems to have 
overcome both of them.

          RAE
          (thoughtfully)
     Well... you've got to take it. I 
     don't see what else you can do.

          JACKIE
          (in same mood)
     Yeah... and if I can stay with the 
     Monarchs a couple of years I should 
     be able to save up a little money.
          (looking at her)
     Maybe even enough...
          (hopefully)
     Maybe when I know I'm set there, 
     then...?

She nods, but not with any particular enthusiasm. Jackie 
notes this and nods slowly in agreement with her reaction.

          JACKIE
     I don't blame you. Gee... a couple 
     more years. Why don't we set a wedding 
     date for about 1960 and have it over 
     with?

Rae doesn't think it is funny, even if it wasn't meant to 
be. She stands up and looks at her wristwatch.

          RAE
     I don't know about 1960, but in five 
     minutes I'm due back in the ward.

Jackie gets up and puts some coins on the table.

          JACKIE
     And tomorrow I'm due in Kansas City.

They stand looking at each other, both with blank faces, 
unable to fathom either how to solve their problem or what 
lies ahead of this new development as we

                         "MONARCHS vs. CLEVELAND"

o.s., we HEAR crowd noises.

EXT. BALLPARK - DAY FROM HIGH ANGLE

The playing field. A game is in progress.

WIDE ANGLE SHOT - THE STANDS

A fair-sized audience, practically all colored.

EXT. DUGOUT TWO SHOT

Jackie, in uniform, is sitting in a corner of dugout alongside 
an older man, apparently the manager.

          MANAGER
     This being your first game I was 
     going to hold you out a couple of 
     innings but maybe you want to take a 
     lick at bat now?
          (nodding to batter)
     Follow Joe.

          JACKIE
          (rising)
     Okay.

As Jackie starts away --

          MANAGER
     And look! Uh... we give them a show 
     out there, Jackie. If you make an 
     out, act mad. If you think you get a 
     bad call on a ball, talk it up. They 
     like that here.

Jackie considers this, nods, and then walks away quietly. 
The manager shakes his head as if doubtful that Jackie can 
come through on this order.

SIDELINES MEDIUM

Jackie, bat in hand, moves "on deck" and squats, waiting his 
turn.

BATTER

A Monarch player waggling bat viciously as if daring pitcher 
to throw one in the groove.

UMPIRE BEHIND BAT

Holding a "two-three" count up with his fingers.

PITCHER

Gazing contemptuously towards batter, winding up and throwing.

BATTER

Striking out with a tremendous swing, he yells in fury and 
starts pounding the ground with his bat in anger.

SIDELINES MEDIUM

As Jackie moves to plate he passes the retired batter. The 
latter is still gesticulating angrily, but as he passes Jackie 
he winks at him and we know it is all an act for the fans.

GRANDSTAND - (STOCK)

As loudspeaker announcement is heard:

          ANNOUNCER
     Now batting for Kansas City Monarchs 
     in place of Rumley -- Jackie Robinson!

PLATE CLOSE

Jackie takes his stance. The catcher squats and begins talking 
it up.

          CATCHER
          (calling to pitcher)
     This is a new boy, Bill. Take it 
     real easy with him. Don't discourage 
     the new boy. Nice and easy! Nice and 
     easy!

As the catcher is talking Jackie turns and nods to him as if 
grateful for the expected gentle treatment.

PITCHER CLOSE

He acts interested in what catcher is telling him, then nods 
as if in gentlemanly agreement with the policy of treating a 
new man with consideration. He begins his windup slowly but 
when he finally whips the ball it is with everything he's 
got.

PLATE CLOSE

The ball streaks past Jackie's head so closely that he has 
to fall to ground to avoid getting beaned. As he gets up, 
acting fully bewildered, the catcher runs to him and helps 
him dust his clothes, simulating deep concern. Jackie gazes 
at catcher, and then at pitcher, with great suspicion.

GRANDSTAND SMALL SECTION

The spectators are enjoying this byplay hugely.

PLATE CLOSE

Jackie waiting and showing determination to hit. He swings 
and hits... but doesn't run.

GRANDSTAND ROOF LONG

The ball going high over the stands and onto the roof.

PITCHER

A new ball is thrown to him. He begins his windup and throws.

PLATE CLOSE

Jackie swings and misses, so hard that he is carried several 
feet from plate and ends up facing stands. He acts angry, 
pulls his bat back of him with one hand and looks as if he 
is going to sling it into the seats.

For a moment he stands thus, wrestling with himself almost, 
as if trying to control his temper. There is a roar of 
excitement from the spectators, and then Jackie lets the bat 
down. Lowering his head in deep dejection he starts walking 
back to the dugout. The crowd's yelling now turns to laughter.

DUGOUT MEDIUM

As Jackie steps in to resume his seat next to manager.

          MANAGER
          (enthusiastic)
     That was great, Jackie! Fine stuff! 
     They loved it.

As Jackie nods --

          MANAGER
     But, of course, you know...

As Jackie looks up --

          MANAGER
     You're also supposed to get a hit 
     once in a while

JACKIE CLOSEUP

He casts an amused look at manager from under his eyebrows.

          JACKIE
     Make up your mind.

                                   DISSOLVE:

INFIELD LONG

The Monarch batter hits a pop fly and the side is retired. 
The Monarch team, including Jackie who goes to shortstop, 
takes the field. The infielders snap up ground balls thrown 
by first base and we get our first glimpse of Jackie in action 
as a fielder.

JACKIE MONTAGE

Various shots of Jackie in action as a shortstop; picking up 
a ground ball and shooting it to first, covering second and 
throwing to first for a double play, backing up the third 
baseman on a hot grounder and recovering when the latter 
boots one.

SCOREBOARD CLOSE

A series of ciphers show three innings have been played. In 
the fourth inning slot the figure "1" appears for each team, 
and then further ciphers appear up to the beginning of the 
ninth inning.

INFIELD LONG

The Monarchs come running in, including Jackie who goes to 
the bat rack.

JACKIE CLOSE

He selects a bat and heads for the plate.

SAME - CLOSER JACKIE AT PLATE

Jackie first takes a strike, then cuts at the next pitch and 
lines a double into the field. The crowd yells.

FULL SHOT - THE FIELD

As Jackie runs, then slides into second just in time to beat 
the pitch from the outfield. He gets up and dusts himself 
off as the second baseman, ball in hand, grins at him.

          SECOND BASEMAN
     About time you started hitting, boy.

Jackie grins and the second baseman returns the ball to the 
pitcher. As he throws, Jackie suddenly lights out for third 
and catches the pitcher flatfooted, not expecting such a 
daring play. The crowd roars as Jackie slides safely into 
third.

CLOSEUP - PITCHER

Looking disgusted with himself.

CLOSE SHOT - JACKIE ON THIRD

Grinning to himself. He obviously loves the sport and enjoys 
a spectacular play. He takes a long lead, teasing the pitcher.

FULL SHOT - THE FIELD

The next batter flies to the infield and Jackie gets back to 
base in time. The shortstop holds the ball for a moment, 
then satisfied that Jackie is holding the bag, tosses to the 
pitcher. The moment the ball leaves his hand, Jackie has 
started for home. By the time the pitcher catches the ball 
and relays it to the catcher, Jackie is sliding in safe at 
home plate. The crowd roars approval of his daring base-
running.

MED. SHOT - AT DUGOUT

As Jackie returns. Several players grin and ad lib their 
approval of the way he has handled himself. As the game 
continues, one of the players, Slim, moves close to Jackie 
and starts a conversation.

          SLIM
     Good going. You ought to sleep well 
     tonight.

          JACKIE
     I generally sleep pretty good.

          SLIM
     On a bus?

          JACKIE
          (thoughtfully)
     That's right. I forgot we travel by 
     bus.

          SLIM
     Make four hundred mile jumps between 
     games. Only chance we ever get to 
     hit a bed is in a two or three game 
     series.

          JACKIE
     Not so good.

          SLIM
     It ain't de luxe, brother!

INT. BUS FULL

In the dim illumination we can see the players, a few asleep, 
most sprawled out and listening to a major league night game 
broadcast.

BUS SECTION CLOSE

Slim has a portable radio on his lap. Jackie is in seat behind 
him.

          RADIO ANNOUNCER
     It's two and two on Greenberg as 
     Feller winds up... and it's ball 
     three...

HIGH-PITCHED WAIL FROM REAR OF BUS

Shut off that radio! I want to sleep.

          SLIM
     Quiet, Leander! That's Hank Greenberg 
     at bat.
          (to Jackie)
     That Leander! He sleeps all day out 
     in right field.

          LEANDER
     I don't care if it's Duke Ellington! 
     I want to sleep.

          SLIM
          (to radio)
     Come on, Hank. Wait it out... 'less 
     it's good.

          RADIO ANNOUNCER
     There's the windup again... and 
     Greenberg SWINGS at a high one and 
     he's out!

There is a general murmur of disgust from all in the bus.

          SLIM
          (provoked)
     What he bite on that for?
          (snapping off radio)
     Ah-h... that's the game!

There is a lull as everyone settles back with closed eyes. 
Then the plaintive voice of Leander is heard again.

          LEANDER
     Hey-y-y!

          SLIM
          (angrily)
     What you want now, Leander? I turned 
     the radio off. Go to sleep.

          LEANDER
     I ain't sleepy no more. I'm hungry.

ANOTHER BUS SECTION CLOSE

Several players open up their eyes and consider this. They 
look at each other and seem to indicate Leander has something.

DRIVER

The bus driver looks back and then at the manager who occupies 
a front seat.

SLIM CLOSE

          SLIM
     Hungry? Why you...
          (on second thought)
     Hungry...
          (looking back at Jackie)
     How about you?

Jackie compresses his lips and nods as if it isn't a bad 
idea at all. Almost immediately other players pick up 
Leander's word and we hear them.

          PLAYERS
          (ad lib)
     Yeah... hungry. I can eat. About 
     time... gotta get out of here anyway. 
     I'm for it!

DRIVER CLOSE

He checks manager who nods in agreement. Driver nods back 
and peers ahead.

EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE - OVER DRIVER'S SHOULDER AND THROUGH BUS 
WINDSHIELD

We see a forlorn-looking combination filling station and 
lunch room, with several cars parked around.

          DRIVER
          (over shoulder)
     Don't look too bad...

INT. BUS FULL SHOT

As the players, full of good humor, move around in their 
seats, trying to see the lunch room.

EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE MED. SHOT

As the bus pulls in and to a stop.

FULL SHOT - IN BUS

The players, Jackie included, peering through the bus windows, 
studying the almost deserted roadside cafe.

          DRIVER
          (at them all)
     Whose turn? Let's not waste time...

The players look at each other and finally Slim gets to his 
feet. He combs his hair and brushes at his clothes, trying 
to look as presentable as possible. The others watch him as 
he leaves the bus.

EXT. CAFE AND BUS FULL SHOT

Slim starts toward the cafe. He hesitates at the door for a 
moment, then enters.

INT. ROADSIDE CAFE FULL SHOT

A plain eating spot with one long counter, usual coffee urns, 
and wall aperture through which the chef can be seen in the 
kitchen. Three male patrons are seated together halfway down 
from the door, and the counterman, about thirty, is leaning 
against the wall talking to them as Slim enters. The four 
look towards Slim without any welcome and wait till he 
approaches.

          SLIM
          (nodding)
     Sixteen of us... in the bus outside. 
     How's chances of getting a late 
     dinner?

COUNTERMAN - PATRONS MED. CLOSE

The patrons look to the counterman to see what his reply 
will be. He notes their stare and then folds his arms.

          COUNTERMAN
     I'm all alone here. Afraid I couldn't 
     handle you.

The three patrons now swing their stare on Slim.

SLIM CLOSE

He seems not surprised and is ready with his next question.

          SLIM
     How about sandwiches? Could you have 
     the chef make some up for us?

COUNTERMAN CLOSE

He seems to be considering this but before he can answer an 
offstage voice is heard:

          VOICE
     How many of you?

KITCHEN WINDOW CLOSE

The chef, a rugged, elderly fellow is looking through the 
window.

SLIM MEDIUM

          SLIM
     Sixteen.

CHEF CLOSE

          CHEF
     Make you about sixteen beefs, sixteen 
     ham and eggs. That be all right?

CHEF - SLIM MEDIUM

Slim walks to chef as he replies.

          SLIM
     Swell. Some fried potatoes on the 
     side, chef?

          CHEF
          (disappearing)
     Yup.
          (o.s.)
     Take about twenty minutes.

The counterman walks into scene and stoops under counter to 
get a roll of paper containers.

          COUNTERMAN
          (a bit sulky)
     Coffee for everybody?

          SLIM
     Yeah... but don't pour it until the 
     sandwiches are ready, please... so 
     the coffee will be hot.

          COUNTERMAN
     Just getting it ready, Bud. Just 
     getting it ready.

          SLIM
     Thanks.

He indicates outside with his thumb.

          SLIM
     You suppose we could wash up a bit?

The counterman sneaks a quick look towards window but the 
chef is apparently too busy to hear this. He turns back to 
Slim.

          COUNTERMAN
     Sorry. It's out of order.

SLIM MEDIUM

His face is expressionless.

          SLIM
     Oh... Thanks. Then we'll go up the 
     road and be back in fifteen minutes.

SLIM - COUNTERMAN MEDIUM

          COUNTERMAN
     Have to leave a deposit on the 
     sandwiches in that case.

          SLIM
          (reaching into pocket)
     Sure.

EXT. BUS - LUNCH ROOM LONG

Slim leaves lunch room and walks slowly to bus.

INT. BUS MEDIUM

Shooting towards front entrance as Slim climbs aboard.

          SLIM
     They're feeding us. That's all. I 
     told them we're goin' up the line a 
     bit.

Without another word the driver starts the motor up.

EXT. BUS - ROAD FULL

The bus starts up the highway.

EXT. BUS - HIGHWAY LONG

We see the bus coming to a stop alongside a wooded section. 
The door opens and the players straggle out. One by one they 
disappear from sight as they walk into the woods and bushes --

Any sort of corridor in which Rae, in hospital uniform, meets 
another colored nurse. Rae carries medical tray.

          OTHER NURSE
     'Morning, Rae. I read about your

     great for months. He write you?

          RAE
     Yes. He's doing well. Except he 
     doesn't like the traveling.

          OTHER NURSE
     Well, tell him to give it up and 
     come back here and get a job.

          RAE
          (with slight smile)
     I sure feel like it.

          OTHER NURSE
     That's the time to write.

INT. BALL PARK - DAY FULL SHOT

A fair-sized crowd, players warming up on the field, but the 
game hasn't started.

EXT. DUGOUT - PLAYERS MED. SHOT

Several players stand near the dugout, throwing balls back 
and forth. Taking it easy as they warm up. Since most of 
them are watching those players on the field, we realize 
that the Chicago players are those practicing; the Monarchs 
are waiting for their turn.

EXT. DUGOUT DIFFERENT ANGLE

Jackie and Slim enter the dugout from clubroom runway and 
notice Bill Piedmont, a pitcher, sitting alone, somewhat 
disconsolately. Jackie and Slim settle down on each side of 
Bill.

          SLIM
     What's the matter with you? Didn't 
     you pitch and win yesterday?

          JACKIE
     That's right. You were hot.

          BILL
     Yeah... but there's no future to it.

          SLIM
     What'ya mean?

          BILL
          (to Jackie)
     How much does a twenty game win 
     pitcher get paid in the major league?

          JACKIE
     I don't know. Thirty thousand up, 
     maybe.

          BILL
     That's right. And I've won thirty so 
     far... and I'll get more.

          SLIM
     And you ain't getting any thirty 
     thousand.

          BILL
          (staring at Slim)
     Funny boy.

          JACKIE
     Think you could do as well in the 
     majors?

          BILL
     No. Not any thirty or more. But I'd 
     sure come close to twenty...

          JACKIE
     I think so.

          BILL
          (getting up)
     And maybe be able to save a few 
     dollars for when my arm goes...

He walks off. Slim watches him and turns to Jackie.

     He's right. We're all in the same 
     boat. Get enough to get by -- but 
     nothing to put by.

SLIM - JACKIE TWO SHOT

Slim gets up.

          SLIM
     Well...

He doesn't finish but walks out on field leaving Jackie alone. 
Jackie sits thinking and we can hear Slim's words echoing in 
his mind...

          SLIM
          (echo box)
     ...enough to get by -- but nothing 
     to put by...

Someone calls Jackie and he snaps out of his reverie and 
runs onto field.

EXT. FIELD FULL

Centering on Jackie at shortstop as play begins. We HEAR the 
crack of a bat and Jackie shoots over to his left to make a 
pickup and throw out to first. It is a neat, fast play.

                                   DISSOLVE:

PLATE CLOSE

Jackie stepping up to bat.

RADIO ANNOUNCER CLOSE

We see him talking into his mike.

          ANNOUNCER
     Jackie Robinson up again. He got a 
     hit once and walked once. Let's see 
     what he does now.

PLATE CLOSE

The ball flashes by Jackie, low. He makes no move.

ANNOUNCER CLOSE

          ANNOUNCER
     Ball one. Too low.

PLATE

Jackie waggling his bat, drawing it back... but failing to 
swing as the ball comes by low again.

          UMPIRE'S VOICE
     Ball two!

PITCHER CLOSE

He is plainly nettled as he receives ball, gets catcher's 
sign, and winds up.

PLATE MEDIUM

From behind catcher. We see Jackie poised to hit, the ball 
coming... and Jackie merely lifts his elbows to let ball 
come through.

          UMPIRE
     Ball!

ANNOUNCER CLOSE

He is laughing.

          ANNOUNCER
     Jackie is not biting. They've got 
     the wrong man. It's ball three now 
     and the pitcher's on the spot.

PITCHER CLOSE

He wipes sweat from brow. Winds up and --

PLATE MEDIUM

The ball comes by and without waiting for the umpire's call 
Jackie tosses his bat aside and makes for first.

ANNOUNCER

Laughing again.

          ANNOUNCER
     Ball four and Jackie walks again. 
     He's got eyes, that boy.

INFIELD FULL

With the first baseman in the act of tossing the ball back 
to the pitcher -- the ball still in mid-air -- Jackie is off 
on a dash to second. The pitcher is rattled, fumbles 
momentarily, and then gets off a high throw. Jackie is safe 
on a long, hooked slide.

                                   DISSOLVE:

EXT. DUGOUT MEDIUM

Monarch players are tumbling into the dugout from the field, 
ad libbing about winning a tough game.

EXT. SIDELINES FULL

We see Jackie loping along towards dugout. Suddenly his name 
is called and he looks towards the boxes.

          SUKEFORTH
     Oh, Robinson! Can I see you a minute?

Jackie pauses, then veers toward the box seats.

BOX SEAT MEDIUM

Sukeforth is standing as Jackie enters the scene. Sukeforth 
extends his hand and Jackie takes it... wondering and perhaps 
a little suspicious that he may be dealing with a crank.

          SUKEFORTH
     My name is Clyde Sukeforth. I'm with 
     Branch Rickey... of the Brooklyn 
     Dodgers...

Jackie neither changes expression nor acknowledges this in 
any way. Sukeforth climbs out of box onto field and takes 
Jackie's arm.

          SUKEFORTH
     I'll walk up to the dressing room 
     with you. Talk to you there.

They start off, Jackie still wondering.

INT. DRESSING ROOM DOOR MEDIUM

Stopping outside the dressing room door, Sukeforth begins 
talking again. Several Monarch players, including Slim, walk 
by and look at them curiously.

          SUKEFORTH
     Branch Rickey wants to see you.

          JACKIE
     What for?

          SUKEFORTH
     Frankly, I don't know. Can you leave 
     for Brooklyn tonight with me?

Jackie is taken aback by this, then, after studying Sukeforth, 
he suddenly nods his head.

          JACKIE
     Sure.

          SUKEFORTH
          (pleased)
     Great! I'm at the Palmer House. I'll 
     arrange for our railroad tickets and 
     suppose you phone me at the Palmer 
     at seven?

          JACKIE
     I'll do that, Mr. Sukeforth.

They shake hands and Sukeforth leaves. Jackie stands looking 
after him a moment, his head shaking in wonder. Then he enters 
dressing room.

INT. DRESSING ROOM MEDIUM

Jackie reaches his locker and starts pulling his shirt off. 
Slim enters scene accompanied by Bill, the pitcher.

          SLIM
     Who was that white man, Jackie? A 
     friend of yours?

          JACKIE
     Nope. Said he was a scout for the 
     Brooklyn Dodgers. Said Branch Rickey 
     wants to see me.

          SLIM
          (nudging Bill)
     S'matter? You owe Rickey some money 
     or something?

          BILL
     Yeah... what does Mr. Rickey want to 
     see you about?

          JACKIE
          (smiling)
     He didn't say. Just wants to see me. 
     Maybe to see if I've got two heads 
     or something.

          SLIM
     What'd you say?

          JACKIE
     He's getting the train tickets and 
     I'm to phone him at seven at his 
     hotel.

          SLIM
     Better hurry up and pack. We'll miss 
     you.

          JACKIE
          (laughing)
     You don't think I'm crazy, do you?

Slim and Bill join in the laughter and Bill lets his hand 
fall on Jackie's shoulders.

          BILL
     You'll find a lot of these cranks 
     showing up. I don't know what makes 
     'em do it. Last year I was signed to 
     pitch for the Giants, Senators and 
     Cincinnati.

          SLIM
     But none of us have ever been signed 
     for Brooklyn yet. That's a new one. 
     You ought to take Bill and me out 
     and show us a good time on the 
     strength of that.

          JACKIE
     On the strength of that I'm going to 
     have dinner and go home to bed. It's 
     been four days since we had a bed to 
     sleep in and I'm going to get a 
     nightful of it.

          BILL
     You got something there...

                                   FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT MED. SHOT - JACKIE

He is in bed, sound asleep, when a knock is heard at the 
door. Jackie rolls over a bit, paying no attention.

CLOSER - JACKIE

As he lifts his head sleepily when the knocking continues, 
louder this time.

          JACKIE
     Who is it?

There is silence for a moment, then a dry, angry voice is 
heard.

          MAN'S VOICE
     Robinson? Clyde Sukeforth.

CLOSE UP - JACKIE

He appears stunned, is completely motionless for a moment, 
then snaps on the bedside lamp. The room is illuminated for 
the first time and we see that it is a cheap one, poorly 
furnished. On the dresser is a framed picture of Rae.

          JACKIE
          (fully awake)
     Just a second!

He gets out of bed, in his pajamas, and hurries to open the 
door. From his expression he still isn't sure what to expect.

MED. SHOT - AT DOOR

As Jackie opens it and an annoyed-looking Sukeforth enters. 
They stare at each other for a moment.

          SUKEFORTH
          (angrily)
     What are you trying to pull, Robinson?

He moves into the room, angrily continuing to berate Jackie.

          SUKEFORTH
     Playing hard to get or something...? 
     Or just trying to make a fool out of 
     me? Acting like a smart guy... making 
     me miss my train...
          (disgusted)
     I should have taken it and not come 
     here...

TWO SHOT - FAVORING JACKIE

He is growing indignant at this treatment from a man he is 
not sure of. He controls his temper, but nevertheless makes 
himself plain.

          JACKIE
     Just a minute, Mr. Sukeforth -- if 
     that's your name... I don't know you 
     and you don't know me...

Sukeforth looks at him sharply. Jackie hesitates, then 
continues.

          JACKIE
     ...If Mr. Rickey did send you to see 
     me, then I've made a big mistake -- 
     and I'm sorry...

Sukeforth doesn't understand for a moment. Then, angrily, he 
reaches into his pocket, brings out his wallet and gives 
Jackie a card.

INSERT CARD IN JACKIE'S HAND

BACK TO SCENE

Jackie looks up from the card, puzzled.

          JACKIE
     It's still hard to believe... A lot 
     of fellows come to the game and... 
     you know.

          SUKEFORTH
          (getting Jackie's 
          reasoning)
     Oh... You thought I was giving you 
     the business! I should have thought 
     of that...

Jackie relaxes a bit and waits for Sukeforth to continue.

          SUKEFORTH
          (smiling)
     When Mr. Rickey told me to come out 
     here and talk to you, I didn't think 
     I was hearing right myself... but 
     here I am...

He looks around the room, then back to Jackie.

          JACKIE
     And you said you don't know why he 
     wants to see me.

          SUKEFORTH
          (no longer angry)
     I don't...
          (thoughtfully)
     Unless...

          JACKIE
          (urging him on)
     After all, there's no chance for me 
     in major league baseball.

As Sukeforth nods in agreement --

          JACKIE
     So... what...

          SUKEFORTH
     The only thing I can think of... and 
     I've got no right to suggest it... 
     just between us...

          JACKIE
     Yes?

          SUKEFORTH
     There's talk about an all-Negro 
     football team being started by Mr. 
     Rickey... the Brown Dodgers...

          JACKIE
     Oh... so that's it. Football.

          SUKEFORTH
     I don't know. But he wants to see 
     you and he's paying your fare... 
     both ways if you come back... What 
     do you say... yes or no?

Jackie looks around the room, plainly at a loss.

          SUKEFORTH
     You'll just have to make up your 
     mind, quick. I can't tell you any 
     more. I don't know any more.

          JACKIE
     I... Okay.

          SUKEFORTH
     Fine. Let's pack. We leave in an 
     hour.

                                   FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

ESTABLISHING SHOT - NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY - (STOCK)

EBBETTS FIELD - BROOKLYN - DAY - (STOCK)

A game is on.

INT. BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY MED. SHOT

Jackie and Sukeforth round a corner and walk down the hall 
toward camera. CAMERA PULLS BACK and PANS to a doorway on 
which is printed:

                    BROOKLYN BASEBALL CLUB, INC.

               Branch Rickey, President.

CAMERA HOLDS as Jackie and Sukeforth walk up to the door. 
Sukeforth opens it without knocking and leads Jackie inside.

INT. RECEPTION ROOM - DAY FULL SHOT

An attractive secretary sits at a desk. Two doors lead into 
adjoining offices. On the walls are signed, framed photographs 
of some of the old and new Dodgers.

          SECRETARY
     Hello, Mr. Sukeforth... Mr. Rickey 
     is expecting you.

Sukeforth leads the way to a door marked "MR. RICKEY." He 
opens it and motions Jackie to step in first.

INT. RICKEY'S OFFICE - DAY LONG

On Rickey, as he looks up towards camera from his desk in a 
good-sized, well-furnished office, decorated with additional 
pictures of baseball notables -- officials as well as players.

          RICKEY
          (heartily)
     Hello, Clyde! Got your man, eh?

He stands up, warm of face and manner, but we can tell from 
the look in his eyes that he is making a quick and keen study 
of Jackie.

          RICKEY
     Come in, Jackie. I'm very glad to 
     see you.

DESK AREA SIDE SHOT

As Sukeforth and Jackie come up to desk.

          JACKIE
     How do you do, Mr. Rickey.

          SUKEFORTH
     Yes, this is Jackie Robinson... and 
     it looked for a while as if I wasn't 
     going to get him here.

          RICKEY
          (to Jackie)
     Sit down, won't you?
          (to Sukeforth)
     Oh, no?
          (to Jackie)
     How come? Don't like Brooklyn?

JACKIE CLOSE

As he takes a chair.

          JACKIE
     I've got nothing against Brooklyn. 
     But... uh... on the Monarchs we get 
     all kinds of men who show up and 
     talk big about signing us up for 
     this and that. It's a kind of a gag.

RICKEY - JACKIE TWO SHOT

          RICKEY
     Oh, sure! Sure! Sure! But didn't 
     Clyde show you his credentials?

          JACKIE
     Yes... we got together finally.

          RICKEY
     Well, that's the main thing... And 
     now...

          JACKIE
     Yes, sir?

          RICKEY
     You're wondering, naturally, why I 
     sent for you.

          JACKIE
     More than wondering, Mr. Rickey. I'm 
     most curious. Although... I sort of 
     figured it out for myself...

          RICKEY
          (a bit surprised)
     You did?

          JACKIE
     Well, I know you're starting an all-
     colored football team.

          RICKEY
     Oh! Yes! Yes! We are thinking about 
     that. But... that's not what I want 
     you for.
          (quietly; after pause)
     Jackie, I want you for baseball.

JACKIE - SUKEFORTH CLOSE TWO SHOT

Jackie is bewildered. He looks towards Sukeforth as if for 
help in understanding but Sukeforth's expression is just as 
puzzled. Then Jackie turns back and his face hardens a bit.

          JACKIE
     You said that as if you were talking 
     about organized baseball, Mr. Rickey. 
     But I'm a Negro. There are none of 
     us in big league ball. I don't 
     understand...

DESK - THREE SHOT

          RICKEY
     Why I should want to put a Negro 
     into baseball?

          JACKIE
     Yes.

          RICKEY
          (nodding)
     I'm going to tell you...
          (to Sukeforth)
     And you, Clyde.
          (looking off)
     Because I am going to have to tell 
     many people.

Jackie and Sukeforth consult each other with another glance 
as Rickey falls silent a moment.

RICKEY CLOSEUP

Leaning forward to Jackie.

          RICKEY
     I have been looking for someone like 
     you -- an intelligent, educated, 
     good Negro ballplayer -- for some 
     time. I needed a man whose character 
     was well regarded and whose background 
     was unblemished. As far as we can 
     find out, you are such a man. You 
     might as well know now... we've done 
     a lot of checking up on you. I can 
     tell you your life story from Georgia 
     to where you are sitting now. It may 
     be that you will be the first Negro 
     in organized baseball.

JACKIE CLOSEUP

He is flabbergasted and, at the same time, beginning to feel 
an excitement which he cannot well hide. But he is also 
puzzled, and his hand goes to his chest, indicating himself, 
as he manages to get out one word...

          JACKIE
     But...

DESK AREA THREE SHOT

As Rickey stands up and shoots a finger out at Jackie as if 
guessing what is on his mind.

          RICKEY
     Why you? Let's get this straight so 
     we can all understand it. It's too 
     important for anyone to have a false 
     impression. People are going to shoot 
     at us... we must know where we stand. 
     I didn't call you here because I 
     want to do something for you, or for 
     your race, or for the Brooklyn Ball 
     Club. I want to do something for all 
     of us... All of us Americans.

Rickey turns and gazes out of the window.

EXT. EBBETTS FIELD - (STOCK) FROM RICKEY'S WINDOW

The park is crowded with fans. (The Brooklyn Ball Club offices 
are not near Ebbetts Field; they are in downtown Brooklyn. 
But the liberty we take is not offensive and should not be 
objectionable to anyone.)

          RICKEY'S VOICE
     ...For years I have seen and watched 
     Americans together in the grandstands 
     and bleachers of our country's ball 
     parks... Negroes, whites of all 
     nationalities...

BASEBALL CROWDS - ANY PARK - (STOCK) MONTAGE

Selected to illustrate Rickey's continued speech. (Great 
care should be taken here as the proper scenes can lend 
pointed and heartwarming emphasis to this important, key 
scene. We see Negroes and Whites laughing together, growing 
tense together, gulping with relief as some emergency is 
met. We may have a group CLOSEUP which might include (this 
may have to be staged) an American executive type, a Negro 
and a Jew, suddenly all filled with heartbreak or dismay as 
a hometown hero has apparently struck out, or some other bad 
break has ensued. In no case need we show what they are 
watching. The faces of the crowds can express the typical 
emotional situations that come up in any game.)

          RICKEY'S VOICE
     ...Italians, Irish, Swedes, Jews, 
     Germans, Chinese, Russians, Japanese, 
     Czechs... and I have marveled at 
     their fellowship, their cheers, 
     laughter, disappointments, enthusiasm, 
     all as one... and all made so by the 
     magic of a sport they all loved and 
     appreciated equally. And I couldn't 
     help ask myself a question... a long 
     time ago... and hundreds of times 
     since -- If Americans can find such 
     a common meeting ground in a game... 
     the game of baseball... If they can 
     play together like this... why can't 
     they live together like this... in 
     the game of life?

OFFICE MED.

Over heads of Jackie and Sukeforth towards Rickey still 
looking out of window. He turns back and finishes quietly.

          RICKEY
     And... I know they can... and maybe 
     baseball can show the way... because 
     baseball is wholly and peculiarly 
     American.

JACKIE CLOSEUP

He is looking at Rickey with new eyes.

RICKEY CLOSEUP

          RICKEY
     That's why I called you here, Jackie. 
     Do you want to get in on it? Because 
     it starts with you!

JACKIE - SUKEFORTH TWO SHOT

Sukeforth looks to see what Jackie's answer will be, and 
Jackie begins nodding slowly, and replies, not as if he is 
talking to Rickey, but as if he is asking questions of 
himself... because this is serious.

          JACKIE
     If I'm strong enough. If I should be 
     the one on whom this all depends.

When Rickey remains silent --

          JACKIE
     I can try. For all I've got.

RICKEY - JACKIE TWO SHOT

          RICKEY
          (simply)
     That should be enough. But I want 
     you to know exactly what you are 
     getting into. I'll do my part. You 
     mustn't let me, or all of us, down. 
     Jackie, we can't start you with 
     Brooklyn. It wouldn't be fair to 
     both of us. We don't know if you're 
     major league or not.

JACKIE CLOSEUP

He nods. He agrees.

          RICKEY
     We'll let you try out for Montreal, 
     one of our farm teams, and later 
     hope you make Brooklyn. But aside 
     from that, if and when we announce 
     you for even Montreal... do you know 
     what's going to happen? The papers? 
     People? Other players? Other clubs? 
     The reaction in the south?

JACKIE CLOSEUP

He nods.

RICKEY CLOSEUP

          RICKEY
     And if we get over that and you 
     actually start with Montreal -- Will 
     you stand what you're going to have 
     to go through? The razzing... the 
     cruel, unfair razzing that every 
     player gets, and the special razzing, 
     the special name-calling you're going 
     to get. Can you stand it?

JACKIE CLOSEUP

He nods.

RICKEY CLOSEUP

          RICKEY
     Are you sure? Because...
          (face grim)
     You're not going to be able to fight 
     back... no matter what the offense.
          (emphasis)
     ...No matter what the offense! Do 
     you understand?

DESK THREE SHOT

Both Rickey and Sukeforth wait for Jackie's reply. Finally 
it comes.

          JACKIE
     Can you use a ballplayer who hasn't 
     the spirit... to fight back?

RICKEY CLOSEUP

It's a poser. He rubs his face, his chin, and practically 
his entire head. Eventually he finds an answer.

          RICKEY
     That's what's going to make your job 
     so tough. No! I want a fighter every 
     time. I want a man in there for 
     everything he's got! But... you'll 
     have to take it... not fight back... 
     and yet, do it so that somehow it's 
     no discredit to you... so that somehow 
     the crowd will sense it's not 
     cowardice that is stopping you but 
     something deeper. If, and when, you 
     can put that over... your troubles 
     are over. No player will bother you, 
     no man will unfairly attack you by 
     name or epithet, when you have 
     established that with the baseball 
     public. Because the very core of 
     Americans is fair play... once they 
     have felt the true situation involved.

RICKEY - JACKIE TWO SHOT

Rickey stands up. Jackie follows.

          RICKEY
     Jackie, I know from your background 
     that you've been spiked and beaned 
     in baseball, you've been clipped and 
     two-way tackled in football, you've 
     been banged around on the street. 
     That's what you face now. And you 
     don't dare yell copper... or fight 
     back. You don't dare because more 
     than you... much more than just you... 
     hangs in the balance.
          (extending his hand)
     Take a day to think it over. And 
     think it over!

They shake. In the background, Sukeforth enters the scene 
looking a little dazed at what has happened, in fact, blowing 
off steam.

INT. ROBINSON HOME - LIVING ROOM FULL

Mrs. Robinson at table knitting as Mack enters in his street-
cleaning uniform, carrying lunch pail.

          MACK
     I'm going, Mom. See you in the 
     morning.

The telephone rings and Mack goes to it. Mrs. Robinson 
watches.

          MACK
          (into phone)
     Hello... Yes, yes...

We hear the jangle of heavy coins coming from the receiver 
as Mack turns to his mother in surprise.

          MACK
     It's Jackie, Mom. He's calling from 
     New York.

Also surprised, and a bit perturbed, she gets up and joins 
Mack.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     New York? What's he doin' there?

          MACK
          (into phone)
     Hello... Yeah, Jackie, it's me, Mack. 
     What are you...? Huh?... The 
     Dodgers?... The Dodgers!... Yeah... 
     Yeah... Yeah...

Mrs. Robinson stands quietly waiting, but we can tell she is 
dying to know what it is all about. But Mack is listening. 
Then he finally talks again to Jackie.

          MACK
     Yes, she's right here, Jackie. Just 
     a minute, I'll tell her.
          (turning to mother)
     Listen, Mom. Jackie's got a chance 
     to try out for Montreal -- baseball -- 
     and maybe go with the Brooklyn 
     baseball team afterwards. He'll be 
     the first Negro in real baseball. 
     But he has to promise that no matter 
     what kind of trouble happens -- and 
     there'll be trouble --

          MRS. ROBINSON
          (cutting in)
     Will he get hurt?

          MACK
     Oh, not actually... but it could be 
     nasty... you know. But he's got to 
     promise not to fight back no matter 
     what happens to him and he don't 
     know if he can trust himself to take 
     it. Feels he'll feel like only half 
     a man. And if things go wrong on his 
     account it might be the end of Negroes 
     in baseball. He doesn't know what to 
     do...

Mrs. Robinson reaches for the phone but Mack holds it away 
and seems surprised at what appears to be a quick decision 
on her part.

          MACK
     What are you going to tell him?

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Let me have the phone, Mack.

He gives it to her. She clears her throat and then begins...

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Jackie...?

INT. PHONE BOOTH CLOSE

Jackie talking into a pay station phone.

          JACKIE
     Hello, Mom! Mack tell you? What do 
     you think, Mom...?
          (surprised)
     What? What?
          (laughing)
     Yeah... I feel all right. Yeah, I'm 
     sure. I feel swell... But what 
     about...?

MRS. ROBINSON CLOSE

          MRS. ROBINSON
     We can't advise you, son. You have 
     to talk to somebody with better 
     judgment. Somebody in New York you 
     can sit down with...

JACKIE IN PHONE BOOTH CLOSE

          JACKIE
     But I don't know anybody in New 
     York...

MRS. ROBINSON

          MRS. ROBINSON
     Yes, you do, son. In Harlem there 
     are churches and good men at the 
     head of them. Find one. Tell him. 
     And listen. It means as much to him 
     as it does to you and all of us.

JACKIE

          JACKIE
          (thinking)
     Yeah... maybe you're right, Mom. 
     That does sound good.

ROBINSON HOME MEDIUM

          MRS. ROBINSON
     ...and take good care of yourself 
     and let us know... What?... No, we 
     won't tell anyone until you let us 
     know... Yes, just Rae. Good-bye.

She hangs up and turns from phone to Mack.

          MACK
          (impressed)
     That was good, Mom. How'd you happen 
     to think he could go to some church 
     and talk to a minister?

She sits down and takes up her knitting again.

          MRS. ROBINSON
     He needed help and it just naturally 
     came to me he could go to church.

EXT. HARLEM CHURCH - NIGHT FULL

INT. RECTORY - NIGHT TWO SHOT

Jackie and an elderly minister are seated, both silent, 
serious and thoughtful. Jackie seems to be waiting for an 
opinion from the minister. The latter finally stands up and 
Jackie follows suit.

          MINISTER
          (nodding)
     I understand. It's quite a problem.
          (changing tone)
     Do you have time for a little walk, 
     Mr. Robinson?

          JACKIE
          (puzzled)
     A walk? Well... surely, if you like.

          MINISTER
          (reaching for hat)
     Let's take one.

HARLEM - (STOCK) EFFECT SEQUENCE

This scene, which is one of the most important in the picture, 
will depend almost entirely on footage available, editorial 
selection of scenes, and technical handling. We see Harlem 
at night and get the feeling of humanity so congested, and 
sometimes so suppressed, that it overruns its boundaries 
both physically and emotionally. Yet there is also the music 
and laughter of Harlem, and the spirit of a people not to be 
overcome. Song and violence, rowdy kids and sober elders, 
church and saloon, and always the streets crowded, the 
buildings giving an appearance of being stuffed. Intercut in 
these scenes are the minister and Jackie, so that they appear 
to be looking on and absorbing what they see. Occasionally 
the minister will glance at Jackie to make sure he is taking 
it all in. Occasionally he will explain what is going on... 
and the dialogue for this is to be written when the proper 
scenes are selected.

EXT. THE CHURCH - NIGHT FULL

Jackie and the minister have arrived back at the church and 
stand there.

JACKIE - MINISTER MED. CLOSE

          MINISTER
     That's your people.

As Jackie nods:

          MINISTER
     I know that if you don't make good... 
     it may hurt us. But...
          (shrugging)
     ...we always can take hurt, if there 
     is the chance to benefit.

          JACKIE
     That means I take the chance.

          MINISTER
          (nodding)
     We all take the chance. The Lord has 
     appointed you one of the rising men 
     of your race. And we've got to be a 
     rising people.

The minister looks at him. Jackie nods. He keeps nodding as 
we cut to:

MONTAGE

A series of newspaper headlines -- front page --

DODGERS SIGN NEGRO PLAYER!

Jackie Robinson sent to Montreal Royals

NEGRO BREAKS INTO BIG LEAGUE BALL!

Baseball world in furore!

Down in the body of one of the newspaper stories is the 
following paragraph:

INSERT NEWS STORY PARAGRAPH

"In the meanwhile, there has been no comment from Jackie 
Robinson, who, having returned to his home in Pasadena, is 
preparing to marry Miss Rae Isum, a schooldays sweetheart."

RADIO STUDIO - ANNOUNCER CLOSE

An announcer is standing at a mike, reading from a script he 
holds:

          ANNOUNCER
     When Branch Rickey announced that 
     Jackie Robinson had been signed and 
     would play for the Montreal farm 
     club there was plenty of excitement. 
     Almost everybody had something to 
     say about it -- and what's more -- 
     they said it!...

ANNOUNCER AGAIN CLOSE

          ANNOUNCER
          (continuing)
     ...The talk came from high places in 
     baseball as well -- with many a club 
     owner declaring that they wouldn't 
     stand for it. But there it was. What 
     would they do about it? It is 
     something we won't know until the 
     season starts in a few weeks in 
     Florida...

ROBINSON HOME STEPS - NIGHT TWO SHOT

Jackie and Rae are sitting together.

          RAE
          (doubtfully)
     You're sure you want me to come to 
     Florida with you? I've never been 
     south.

          JACKIE
          (nodding)
     I'm sure. I'm very sure. Not afraid, 
     are you?... because of all this fuss 
     in the papers? I've never been south 
     either, since babyhood.

          RAE
     A little. But that's not why I wonder 
     about coming. I just don't want to 
     be in your way. You'll be busy with 
     all that spring training... people 
     wanting to talk to you.

          JACKIE
          (laughing softly)
     Who'll want to talk to me? They talk 
     about me... but not to me much. If 
     you aren't there I'll just be alone 
     once I'm off the field.

          RAE
     Is that the way you figure it?

          JACKIE
          (smiling)
     Why... Dem's the conditions that 
     prevail... like Jimmy Durante says.

          RAE
          (with sidelong glance)
     Well... if dem's the conditions, 
     I'll see what I can do.

We cut as Jackie, pleased, starts to put his arm around her.

          JACKIE
     Yes?

          NEGRO
          (to Rae)
     And Mrs. Robinson?

          JACKIE
     That's right.

          NEGRO
     My name is Gaines. I am an attorney 
     in town. A group of us heard you 
     were due here for spring training. 
     We thought you might not have made 
     arrangements for a place to stay.

          JACKIE
     Why... we were going to find a 
     hotel...

          GAINES
     There is no suitable hotel, Mr. 
     Robinson. That's why we talked it 
     over. I'd be pleased to have you 
     stop at my home while you are here 
     as our guests. Such as it is, it is 
     the only place available.

          JACKIE
          (puzzled, looking at 
          Rae)
     That's very kind of you... but... 
     why... we don't want to impose...

          GAINES
     Not at all. You are a very important 
     man to us. It will be our pleasure, 
     I assure you.

Jackie studies Gaines a moment and then understands. He 
extends his hand and both men shake.

          JACKIE
          (simply)
     Thank you.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY FULL

A car pulls up outside a comfortable looking frame house. 
The three, Gains, Jackie and Rae, get out, the two men 
dividing the bags between them, and walk towards house. As 
they get near the door, it opens and a dignified colored 
woman steps out and smiles a welcome. From a distance we see 
the introductions made and the group passes inside.

                                   DISSOLVE:

DODGERS' TRAINING FIELD - (STOCK) PANORAMIC

A general view of the training field with about fifty-odd 
players tossing the ball around.

GAINES' CAR - (PROCESS)

We see Jackie and Gaines in car as it comes to stop near 
field which forms the b.g. Jackie, carrying small zipper 
bag, emerges from car, waves thanks to Gaines, and starts 
away.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY FULL

Jackie is buttoning up his uniform and nearly a dozen 
reporters, most of them white, are shooting questions at 
him. Several have notebooks in their hands and are writing 
down his answers.

          REPORTER
     ...Think you're good enough to make 
     the Dodgers?

          JACKIE
     Don't know if I'm good enough to 
     make the Montreal team -- so I'm not 
     even thinking about the Dodgers...

          2ND REPORTER
          (curiously)
     What'll you do if a pitcher tries to 
     bean you?

          JACKIE
          (grins)
     Same as you would. Duck.

The other reporters grin.

          3RD REPORTER
     You hope to be a Dodger sometime, 
     don't you?

          JACKIE
          (seriously)
     Sure -- provided I'm good enough...

          4TH REPORTER
     What about the other players? You 
     think there'll be any trouble?

          JACKIE
          (looking up)
     Trouble?

          2ND REPORTER
          (interrupting)
     He means -- do you expect to get 
     along with the other guys --- Suppose 
     something happens -- then what? How'll 
     it affect you...?

Jackie doesn't answer for a moment. Then:

          JACKIE
          (sincerely)
     That's too tough for me to answer. 
     All I can say is that I'm going to 
     do my best -- as a player and on and 
     off the field... How it'll turn out -- 
     I don't know any more than you do...

A few start writing this down and now the trainer moves up 
in front of Jackie.

          TRAINER
     Sorry, boys -- but you'll have to 
     continue this later -- right now 
     Robinson's due on the field...

The reporters understand and several move to follow Jackie 
as he and the trainer exit.

EXT. DUGOUT - DAY MED. SHOT

As Jackie, the trainer, and several reporters come up out of 
it and stand there for a moment.

EXT. PLAYING FIELD - FULL SHOT - THEIR ANGLE

Showing ballplayers, some batting, fielding, throwing balls, 
etc. o.s., we hear the trainer's voice:

          TRAINER'S VOICE
     Oh, Mr. Hopper!

At the call, a tall, greying man in his fifties, in uniform, 
turns around and walks toward Jackie and others, including 
camera.

MED. SHOT - JACKIE, TRAINER, REPORTERS

As Mr. Hopper walks into scene and up to them.

          TRAINER
     Jackie -- this is Mr. Hopper -- 
     Manager of the Montreal Royals -- 
     Mr. Hopper -- Jackie Robinson...

They both nod and shake hands. Hopper is a hard man to figure 
out. His accent is Southern -- his attitude calm and quiet.

          REPORTER
     Got a few minutes for us, Mr. 
     Hopper...?

          HOPPER
     Certainly -- but let me get Jackie 
     out there first...

He starts moving toward the field as he speaks and Jackie 
follows him. Then they both stop and look out toward the 
playing field.

MED. SHOT - FROM THEIR ANGLE

Almost every player on the field is looking in their 
direction, curious about Jackie.

TWO SHOT - HOPPER AND JACKIE

As Hopper moves forward again. Jackie is a bit nervous and 
we can tell that Hopper knows how he feels, but there are no 
words.

PANNING - HOPPER AND JACKIE

As they move down the first base line toward a player who is 
tossing a ball with two other men who are standing as a pair 
some distance away.

          HOPPER
          (calling out)
     Boys... this is Jackie Robinson.
          (to Jackie)
     That's Harker, Billings and Piletti. 
     Catch with them a while.

The players and Jackie nod. Hopper turns away and Jackie 
joins Harker who is the lone player, with Billings and Piletti 
some sixty feet away.

THE FOUR

We ANGLE SEVERAL SHOTS while the following routine takes 
place. Piletti throws the ball to Harker who is alongside 
Jackie. Harker throws it back to Billings. Billings should 
throw now to Jackie -- instead he also throws to Harker. 
They keep this up a while, with Piletti and Billings never 
throwing to Jackie, just to Harker, and as it goes on and 
the white men realize they have committed themselves to this 
insult, their faces sharpen, the atmosphere becomes a little 
tense as indicated by the quick glances they shoot each other 
and the way they avoid even looking at Jackie. It is his 
first crisis, a childish one, perhaps, but nevertheless 
serious. He stands quietly, his face betraying nothing, but 
his eyes just following the ball.

CLOSEUP - JACKIE

As he studies their faces, his eyes following the ball in 
flight. He hopes they might be kidding him.

QUICK CUTS - CLOSEUPS - THREE PLAYERS' FACES FROM JACKIE'S 
ANGLE

Their faces serious. It is not a gag.

CLOSEUP - JACKIE

Looking out toward other players on field.

THE PLAYING FIELD FULL SHOT - JACKIE'S ANGLE

Several players, including Clay Hopper, who has turned around, 
are watching with interest, paying no attention to their own 
practice.

MED. CLOSEUP - JACKIE

He is troubled, not knowing what to do, but realizing that 
he must do something -- yet nothing that will offend the 
three players who are still ignoring him. He studies them 
again.

PANNING SHOT - THE THREE

CAMERA STUDIES their faces for a brief moment. We even feel 
that they are sorry they have done what they have, but they 
don't know how to get out of it without one of them turning 
"chicken."

CLOSEUP - JACKIE

He takes a breath and moves a step closer to Harker.

THE FOUR

Piletti throws again.

JACKIE - HARKER CLOSE

The ball is again intended for Harker but Jackie leans over 
and casually gathers it in in a graceful catch. Before there 
can be any reaction he has the ball on its way back to 
Billings.

BILLINGS - PILETTI

Billings is so unnerved by the whole incident that he fumbles 
the ball and has to walk after it.

JACKIE - HARKER CLOSE

Jackie turns after throw to find Harker looking at him almost 
gratefully. Harker nods in commendation.

          HARKER
     Glad you did that. I don't know how 
     the heck we got into it.

THE FOUR

Billings has recovered ball and is so confused by the whole 
episode that, instead of throwing it back to Harker, who is 
extending a glove up in the air as a sign, he throws it to 
Jackie instead. Harker watches and looks back at Billings. 
Then he calls out in pretended indignation.

          HARKER
     Oh, great! Now you're leaving me out 
     of it! Oh, fine!

The four of them have to laugh now and as we cut away Harker 
is begging Jackie for the ball.

          HARKER
     Here... let me get a chance to throw 
     once in a while!

HOPPER CLOSE

His face inscrutable, he turns and studies the faces of the 
other ballplayers who have been watching the incident. They, 
too, are smiling. Thoughtfully, he walks away.

EXT. GAINES HOME FULL

We can see two women seated on the porch.

EXT. PORCH CLOSE

Rae and Mrs. Gaines are talking.

          MRS. GAINES
     You're sure you don't want to walk 
     into town?

          RAE
          (hesitantly)
     Well... not yet.

          MRS. GAINES
          (pleasantly)
     All right.
          (studying Rae)
     You're not nervous about it, are 
     you? Afraid down here?

          RAE
     Uh... to tell you the truth, I 
     wouldn't be comfortable. I've never 
     been south and I'm afraid I wouldn't 
     know how to act. You probably don't 
     understand but... when one isn't 
     accustomed to... well, sort of 
     deferring... or whatever it is down 
     here...
          (helplessly)
     I'm afraid I'm not clear. Perhaps if 
     you explained. I worry about making 
     a mistake and getting Jackie into 
     trouble.

          MRS. GAINES
          (gently)
     I understand. Of course I do. But it 
     really isn't as bad as reported. 
     Some of what you hear is true... a 
     lot exaggerated. We live our own 
     lives... and as long as we live our 
     own lives we are not bothered. Most 
     of the white people understand our 
     position and are helping, bit by 
     bit, to make things better, easier. 
     We've got to show respect for all of 
     them -- whether we respect them or 
     not. Always say Mister or Mrs. -- 
     never use first names, even if they 
     ask you to.
          (she smiles)
     None of those are hard to do, really. 
     You do defer, but even that isn't 
     hard -- once you get used to it.

          RAE
     In what way?

          MRS. GAINES
     Every way. In stores, say, don't try 
     to get waited on until you're the 
     only one left -- and give way even 
     if you're first and they come in 
     later... Never, of course, try or 
     expect to mix --- and as long as 
     they come first in everything -- 
     you'll get along all right...

Rae is thoughtful for a moment.

          RAE
     Tell me -- why are you living here -- 
     instead of up North...

          MRS. GAINES
     To tell you the truth, I like it 
     down here. Even so... I like it down 
     here. If I left... it would be like 
     running away from home. I couldn't 
     do that.

          RAE
          (thoughtfully)
     I like it, too. It feels like home... 
     and yet...

          MRS. GAINES
     And yet it's strange.

          RAE
     Yes. Strange. Almost... mysterious.

Mrs. Haines nods in understanding. The two sit silently as:

EFFECT

We get a synoptic impression of activities: Jackie training, 
a class being instructed in base sliding, Jackie, Rae, Mr. 
and Mrs. Gaines around a card table at home, and, at the 
end, a shot showing a group of white Floridians standing in 
silence, watching Jackie taking part in a scrub game.

GAINES' PORCH - DAY MEDIUM

Jackie emerges and Rae comes as far as screen door.

          JACKIE
     I'll be right home after practice.

Rae nods as Jackie waves and starts to run down the walk.

GAINES' HOME FULL

A car pulls up and Gaines gets out just as Jackie comes down 
the walk.

GAINES CLOSEUP

His face is serious as he looks towards Jackie.

GAINES - JACKIE

As Jackie comes up to him.

          JACKIE
     Hello, Mr. Gaines. I was just on my 
     way to the field.

Gaines puts his hand on Jackie's shoulder.

          GAINES
     Not this morning, Jackie.

          JACKIE
     Not this... Uh? What do you mean?

          GAINES
     Come up on the porch. I had a call 
     from Mr. Rickey. I'll tell you what 
     he said.

PORCH MEDIUM

Rae is still standing. Mr. Gaines offers her a chair, then 
nods to Jackie to take one, and seats himself.

          GAINES
     The town has put a stop to mixed 
     ball playing.

          JACKIE
          (after pause)
     You mean... on account of me?

          GAINES
     Yes.

Jackie looks at Rae... then back at Gaines.

          JACKIE
     Then... you mean I'm through? Is 
     that what he said?

          GAINES
     By no means! Mr. Rickey isn't giving 
     up that easy. You're to train in 
     another town.

          JACKIE
          (puzzled)
     By myself? I don't get it.

          GAINES
     Oh, no. With the others. Mr. Rickey's 
     answer to the town was to decide to 
     move the whole Brooklyn organization 
     out of here to another town. Not 
     far. You'll still stay here with us.

          JACKIE
          (staggered)
     And I... I'm the cause of all that?

          MR. GAINES
          (gently)
     Don't hold yourself cheap, Jackie. 
     Mr. Rickey thinks that you, and what 
     you stand for, is worth it.

INT. BALL PARK - DAY FULL SHOT

Training session on. A few dozen players on the field, 
catching, throwing, batting, etc. Jackie is playing shortstop.

MED. SHOT - THE FIELD FOCUSED ON PITCHER AND BATTER

A batter misses the first pitch, then connects on the second 
and runs for first. Jackie scoops up the ball but makes a 
very bad throw to first -- and the batter is safe.

MED. CLOSE - JACKIE

Looking disgusted with himself, then flexes his right arm a 
few times as he moves back into position.

EXT. DUGOUT - DAY GROUP SHOT - RICKEY AND TWO REPORTERS

They are watching practice.

FULL SHOT - THE FIELD OVER RICKEY AND REPORTERS

As they watch batting practice. Another batter hits a grounder 
to Jackie. This time he muffs the ball and it goes into the 
outfield.

GROUP SHOT - RICKEY AND REPORTERS

The cynical reporter grimaces at Jackie's performance.

          REPORTER
     From what I've heard, you had a good 
     ballplayer in Robinson. But from 
     what I've seen -- you've wasted your 
     time --
          (dryly)
     and mine, too...

The other two reporters show nothing. Rickey isn't bothered.

          RICKEY
          (to cynic)
     Could be... but I don't think so...
          (turns around and 
          calls o.s., to trainer)
     Pete -- tell Robinson I want him at 
     first base...

MED. SHOT TO INCLUDE RICKEY, REPORTERS, TRAINER

As the trainer nods to Mr. Rickey and trots out on the field. 
As he leaves, the first reporter turns to Rickey curiously.

          1ST REPORTER
     He ever played first?

          RICKEY
     Not that I know of...

          1ST REPORTER
     Then why...

          RICKEY
          (interrupting)
     Because he's been trying so hard 
     he's thrown his arm out... it won't 
     be so hard on him at first...

The reporters think about this, but the cynic isn't impressed.

          2ND REPORTER
     Just how bad is his arm, Mr. Rickey?

          RICKEY
     From what I've heard, he can't even 
     comb his own hair...

          1ST REPORTER
     ...and you're keeping him out 
     there...?

          RICKEY
     Sure.

The trainer comes back.

          RICKEY
          (to trainer)
     How long before his arm...?

          TRAINER
     A week will bring it around...

Rickey thinks about it, then turns to the reporters, looking 
directly at the cynic.

          RICKEY
     I suggest that you catch our first 
     exhibition game -- two weeks from 
     today...

          1ST REPORTER
     Here?

          RICKEY
     No -- Jacksonville...

          2ND REPORTER
     I'll be there...

                                   QUICK FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXT. BALLPARK - DAY - (STOCK)

Over scene is title: JACKSONVILLE.

EXT. PARK ENTRANCE - DAY FULL SHOT

Fans milling around box-office. A few reading sign on box-
office.

INSERT SIGN

          "GAME CANCELLED"

The authority for the cancellation is partially covered so 
that we do not have to blame anybody.

BACK TO SCENE

A few disgruntled fans muttering in disappointment.

EXT. PLAYERS' ENTRANCE - DAY MED. SHOT - AT GATE

It is padlocked and a policeman stands in front of it. As 
scene opens, a dozen or so ballplayers, in business or sports 
clothes instead of uniform, are walking into scene and up to 
gate. Jackie is among them.

SAME - CLOSER

The trainer moves up toward the cop as the players ask him 
to open the gates.

          PLAYER
          (smiling)
     How's about opening up?

          POLICEMAN
     Not today, I'm afraid...

The players do not know what's wrong. The trainer moves up 
to the policeman.

          TRAINER
     What's the matter?

          POLICEMAN
     Orders.

          TRAINER
          (bothered)
     Why not? Whose orders?

          POLICEMAN
     Well -- there's a statute on the 
     books that says white and colored 
     can't compete against each other -- 
     even in sports...

The trainer looks as though he's about to explode and so do 
some of his players. Jackie looks upset. The trainer shrugs 
helplessly and motions toward the players to leave.

          TRAINER
     Let's go...

They start back and CAMERA PANS them to sidewalk where they 
start walking o.s.

EXT. SIDEWALK MED. SHOT

As the 2nd Reporter and the cynic meet the players.

          2ND REPORTER
          (to trainer)
     Pete -- what's...

          TRAINER
          (disgusted)
     Cancelled -- usual reason...

          CYNIC
          (not bothered)
     Think you'll ever play a game down 
     here?

          TRAINER
          (holding his temper)
     We'll play all right...

He shoulders on past the reporters and the players follow 
him... As they walk o.s. we

                                   DISSOLVE:

EXT. BALL PARK - DAY

CAMERA reveals ball park's name:

               DELAND PARK

               Jersey City vs. Montreal Royals

INT. BALL PARK - DAY FULL SHOT

A few players warming up. A few hundred fans in stands and 
more entering. Most of the ball players are around the 
dugouts, all of them in uniform.

EXT. DUGOUT MED. SHOT

Branch Rickey and Clay Hopper are standing in conference 
near the dugout. Players, including Jackie, in b.g.

          RICKEY
     ...and I want you to use him -- 
     trouble or not...

          HOPPER
          (nodding)
     Okay.
          (turning)
     Hey -- Robinson!

Jackie comes up to them from b.g. Waits for them to speak to 
him.

          RICKEY
     Jackie -- I want you to play second 
     today...
          (looking at Jackie's 
          arm)
     Arm working all right?

          JACKIE
     Yes.

          RICKEY
          (seriously)
     Give it all you've got today...

          JACKIE
     I will, Mr. Rickey...

Rickey motions for him to join his teammates and he does so. 
Rickey is thoughtful for a moment.

          RICKEY
     I'm going to stay for awhile -- just 
     in case.

          HOPPER
          (nodding)
     It'll probably take some time -- 
     after they find out Robinson's in 
     the game...

They walk away, talking about the situation.

EXT. BALLPARK - DAY FULL SHOT - GAME IN PROGRESS

Scoreboard reads: 1 to 1 -- 2nd Inning. Fans seem to be 
enjoying the game. The batter scores an out and the teams 
change sides as we HOLD. The Royals are coming to bat.

EXT. PLAYERS BENCH DUGOUT IN B.G.

A player selects a bat and moves to take up his position at 
the plate as the pitcher and catcher warm up. Hopper motions 
to Jackie who steps forward and picks out his own bat.

          HOPPER
     Okay?

          JACKIE
          (nodding)
     Anything special?

          HOPPER
     No -- use your own judgment...

Jackie nods again, swings his bat, and moves up to the "on 
deck" spot. As he does so, the first batter gets a hit and 
races toward first.

EXT. PLAYING FIELD

As the batter reaches first safely and Jackie moves up into 
the batter's box.

EXT. BOX SEAT - DAY MED. CLOSE - RICKEY

He is watching game. Two reporters, the cynic included, sit 
with Rickey.

MED. SHOT - JACKIE AT PLATE RICKEY'S ANGLE

The first pitch is a called strike. The second is a ball. 
The third is a ball. Fourth a strike. Fifth a ball. Sixth a 
ball and Jackie walks.

          RICKEY'S VOICE
     Watch him... See that stance -- see 
     how he hugs the plate... He's hard 
     to pitch to -- he'll walk at least 
     one for four...

SPECIAL SEQUENCE

At this point we go into a special sequence which must be 
worked out at time of shooting between Jackie and the 
director. It is designed as a demonstration of what makes a 
good ball player as illustrated by Jackie... with Rickey 
commenting on him for the benefit of the two reporters. The 
action is not confined to any one inning but spreads over 
the entire game in montaged scenes that take in his hitting, 
funning and fielding. It should end up a memorable sequence 
for all who play or enjoy baseball and believe, usually 
wrongly, that they know all its tricks, embracing not only 
physical skill but headwork as well. When it is over the 
entire audience must have a knowledge and appreciation of 
what makes Jackie Robinson the player he is... and, 
furthermore, a better knowledge of baseball itself.

RICKEY - REPORTERS

Hopper enters scene.

          HOPPER
     Can I see you alone a moment, Mr. 
     Rickey?

Rickey smells trouble. He makes his excuses to reporters, 
who also sense something in the air, and walks off with 
Hopper.

RICKEY - HOPPER CLOSE

          HOPPER
     We've just got word. Police are on 
     the way. Mixed playing again.

          RICKEY
     Better get him off the field, Clay... 
     no use making it worse...

MED. SHOT - TO INCLUDE HOPPER

He nods at Rickey and heads back toward dugout.

EXT. DUGOUT MED. SHOT

As Hopper walks up to players' bench. Jackie and the players 
look up at him.

          HOPPER
     Sorry, Jackie -- but you'd better 
     leave the park for awhile... The old 
     trouble. See you in the dressing 
     room.

Jackie gets up and slowly walks down into the dugout and 
towards dressing rooms. The other players are silent, yet, 
we feel, resentful about this unfair situation Jackie has to 
buck constantly.

INT. DRESSING ROOM MED. CLOSE - JACKIE

He starts pulling off his uniform and the trainer walks into 
scene. Jackie is definitely unhappy.

          TRAINER
          (disgustedly)
     Same old thing. Same old thing!

          JACKIE
     Yeah, Pete. Thanks for looking at it 
     my way but I bet you fellows are fed 
     up with all the trouble I've caused. 
     All the jumping around, cancelled 
     games... ruction in the air.

          PETE
          (squarely)
     Yes, it's been a lot of fuss. But 
     that's the game. We're getting paid 
     for it. Not our business to squawk.

          JACKIE
          (sighing)
     It's the game... but I'll never get 
     to play it, I'm afraid. I've got a 
     hunch that maybe Mr. Rickey has 
     enough, too... and maybe I'll be 
     back with the Kansas City Monarchs 
     in a few days... if they'll take me.

Pete is about to reply when the sound of a door opening makes 
them both turn towards the entrance.

DRESSING ROOM DOOR LONG

Rickey and Hopper are entering. They walk purposely and Rickey 
beckons with his finger.

          RICKEY
     Pete... better go out on the field 
     and take a look at Hugh's hand. He 
     caught one on the knuckles.

JACKIE - PETE MEDIUM

As Rickey and Hopper enter scene.

          PETE
          (leaving)
     Right.

          RICKEY
          (to Jackie)
     And you...

          JACKIE
     Yes, Mr. Rickey. You going to give 
     it to me now?

          RICKEY
     Give you what?

          JACKIE
     My walking papers. You must be caught 
     up with all this melodramatic stuff... 
     police chasing the team all the time.

          RICKEY
     Oh.
          (winking at Hopper)
     Yeah. Never had such excitement in 
     years.
          (back to Jackie)
     I'll give it to you. Jackie... you 
     are now officially a Montreal Royal. 
     You have made the team. Okay?

Jackie, who has been sitting a bit dejectedly, straightens 
up slowly and looks from one to the other. His face is filled 
more with wonder than anything else.

          JACKIE
          (unbelievingly)
     You're still with me!

As Hopper nods --

          RICKEY
     Still with you.

          JACKIE
          (shaking head)
     And I was ready to give up!

He seems lost in thought, his gaze directed at a far corner 
of the room, as Rickey gives him a farewell pat on the 
shoulder and exits. Jackie doesn't even look up. Then Hopper 
is standing over him.

          HOPPER
     All right, Jackie?

          JACKIE
          (waking up)
     Yes, Mr. Hopper.

          HOPPER
     Think I've got even better news for 
     you.

          JACKIE
          (brows knitting)
     Better?

          HOPPER
     For you. You can pack up. We head 
     north tomorrow... for Jersey City 
     and our first game of the season.

GAINES HOME DINNER TABLE

With his wife and Jackie and Rae seated before him, Mr. Gaines 
rises to propose a toast.

          MRS. GAINES
     It is safe to say, Jackie, that this 
     drink is not the only one to be raised 
     in your honor tonight. It is safe to 
     say that hundreds of thousands of 
     our people are doing the same. You 
     have opened another door formerly 
     locked to us by intolerance. It is a 
     milestone... I speak for a great 
     many when I say... thank you... thank 
     you...

The Gaineses and Rae drink, but when Jackie, embarrassed, 
tries to take his glass, Rae puts her hand on it, laughingly, 
and stops him.

          RAE
     You're not supposed to drink now. 
     You don't drink, anyway.

          JACKIE
          (grinning)
     I forgot...

He is seated at desk, reading from his notes.

          COMMENTATOR
     ...This was an unusual day in 
     organized baseball, ladies and 
     gentlemen. For the first time, a 
     Negro player was presented to the 
     public. And for his first time, a 
     Negro made his appearance in the big 
     time, his every instinct telling him 
     the crowd might not be friendly at 
     all. But whatever the feeling of the 
     crowd before they saw Jackie Robinson 
     today... they forgot it. Because he 
     made them think of one thing... and 
     one thing only... baseball! And what 
     baseball! Few will forget what they 
     saw... I can see it yet...

                                   DISSOLVE:

PLATE JACKIE AT BAT

He is waggling his bat.

INFIELD

Runners on first and second waiting to go.

THE STANDS

The fans are silent, watchful.

PITCHER

He winds up and throws.

JACKIE

He takes a ball.

PITCHER

Another throw.

JACKIE

Swings and fouls off. Waiting. Another ball. Another ball.

PITCHER

Winding up.

JACKIE

A called strike.

SCOREBOARD

Shows two strikes and three balls.

STANDS

Crowds tense.

PITCHER

Checking runners, then winding up and throwing.

JACKIE

Swinging and connecting as a roar comes from the crowd.

OUTFIELD

Outfielder starting to run, then stopping as he realizes 
ball will clear fence easily.

RADIO STUDIO COMMENTATOR

          COMMENTATOR
     ...But a lot of players hit home 
     runs. He gave them more baseball 
     than that. He gave them real baseball. 
     When next he came to bat there were 
     yells for another homerun. Jackie 
     didn't hit a homerun. He showed the 
     crowd something brand new... how to 
     score on a bunt!

PLATE LONG

ANGLING from third or left field to take in most of infield, 
including home plate and first base. Jackie bunts towards 
third and beats the throw to first.

SECOND - FIRST BASE LONG

Shooting from left field side of second along the line to 
first base and taking in pitcher. Jackie is taking a long 
lead off first as pitcher gets ready to throw. With the pitch 
he is off for second, running towards us.

PLATE CLOSE

Catcher receives pitch and whips throw to second.

SECOND - FIRST BASE LONG

Continuation of former shot showing Jackie going into slide 
and beating throw to second.

PITCHER CLOSE

Receives ball from second baseman in disgust and turns around 
towards plate. Only once, before throwing, does he turn around 
to eye Jackie, then he starts his windup. The second he goes 
into it there is a roar from the crowd and we can tell from 
the frantic look that comes into the pitcher's eyes that he 
knows what is happening -- Jackie must be off again... this 
time for third! But it is, of course, too late for him to do 
anything but finish his throw.

THIRD BASE LINE

Jackie racing along.

CATCHER

Reaching high for a bad throw, then whipping ball.

THIRD BASE

Jackie sliding in under throw.

STANDS

The crowd yelling and laughing at this continued larceny on 
Jackie's part.

PITCHER

Receiving throw from third baseman and tucking glove under 
arm to wipe his brow and glare towards Jackie.

THIRD

Jackie dusting himself off as third baseman looks on coldly.

PITCHER

Ready to throw. He checks Jackie and starts windup.

THIRD

Shooting to show both Jackie and the pitcher, the latter in 
the b.g. With the downswing of the pitcher's arm, Jackie is 
off and the crowd roars again. But after a half dozen stops 
Jackie stops suddenly and dashes back to third, just beating 
a try from the catcher to stop him.

INFIELD

Taking in Jackie and the pitcher, the former dancing away 
from third distractingly and the latter plainly worried by 
Jackie's tactics and snapping a couple of throws to third in 
an effort to trap him off base. Finally, the pitcher begins 
his windup and immediately Jackie is off for third. With the 
yell from the crowd the pitcher stops in mid-windup to make 
a quick throw to third again. Again Jackie has stopped and 
is on his way back to third but the umpire there waves him 
away and signals that he may go on to home.

          UMPIRE
     Pitcher's balk. You can score.

INFIELD

The pitcher comes running over to umpire to protest but 
realizes after a few words that he plainly made a balk and 
has no chance. He walks back to mound dejectedly.

STANDS

Crowd roaring.

DUGOUT

Jackie tumbling in as pleased teammates slap him on the back.

RADIO STUDIO COMMENTATOR

          COMMENTATOR
     ...Before that game was over Jackie 
     had hit safely four times and scored 
     four times, with the aid of two stolen 
     bases and two pitcher's balks! Yes, 
     ladies and gentlemen, that was how 
     the first day went for the first 
     Negro in organized baseball. They 
     probably won't all go that well... 
     there may still be trouble... But we 
     have an indication that Jackie 
     Robinson has what it takes... to 
     take hold of the public's heart!

BALL PARK PAN OR GENERAL VIEW

A game is in progress.

PLATE MED. CLOSE

Jackie takes a strike.

          VOICE
          (calling)
     Hey, dare, big boy! What you-all 
     doin' on a white man's field?

Jackie turns head briefly in direction of ground boxes where 
voice, mimicking a thick southern accent, is coming from.

LOWER BOX

A thick-necked toughie is doing the yelling. He continues, 
in a manner which he calculates will tickle those around 
him. Next to him is another man who bends over to fumble 
with something at his feet.

          THICK-NECK
     Better get your carcass out'a there 
     before you get rode out!

The other man comes up with a black cat around whose neck a 
length of strong twine has been attached. The man throws the 
cat onto the field.

JACKIE CLOSE

He hears a yell of laughter from some of the crowd and looks 
around.

JACKIE LONG

Shooting from behind him towards box where cat is being made 
to run back and forth along box, and where Thick-Neck is 
yelling again, ostensibly about the cat, but while looking 
at Jackie.

          THICK-NECK
     Get that black --

A laugh from his companion drowns out the next word.

          THICK-NECK
     -- off the field. Get him off the 
     field!

STANDS SECTION CLOSE

We can see that a number of fans are not impressed with this 
type of humor.

PITCHER LONG

Smiling at the byplay, he winds up just as Jackie turns 
towards him.

JACKIE LONG

We can see the cat business going on in the b.g. as Jackie 
pulls his bat back, swings and connects.

OUTFIELD LONG

As ball falls safe for a texas leaguer, Jackie going on to 
second.

GROUND BOX

Attendant has appeared and makes the two men lift the cat 
back with them in the box.

INFIELD

Shooting from center field and taking in Jackie on second 
and the next man at bat. We see the pitcher throw and the 
batter hitting a long single on which Jackie easily goes 
around third to home. As Jackie turns to go back to the 
visiting team's dugout his path brings him near the ground 
box seat where the cat has been sat on the box rail.

GROUND BOX

As Jackie passes and the man holding the cat holds it up to 
Jackie and jeers.

          MAN
     Here's a brother of yours, Jackie. 
     Why don't you take him along? He 
     wants to get into baseball, too.

Jackie veers suddenly towards box and man falls back in alarm. 
But Jackie makes no menacing motion. Instead he picks up the 
cat and starts unloosening the twine as he walks away.

JACKIE TRUCKING

We walk with Jackie as he gets the twine loose, holds the 
cat close and pets him comfortingly.

STANDS

The fans watching in silence as Jackie, walking with cat 
below, steps into dugout. Suddenly someone applauds. It is 
taken up and soon the entire park is echoing with the 
handclapping.

DUGOUT CLOSE

Jackie sitting in the shadows, his hand still fondly petting 
the cat.

EFFECT

background which includes a series of quick shots showing 
Jackie playing, crowds cheering, an occasional jeering fan.

          COMMENTATOR
     ...With the baseball season almost 
     over, Jackie Robinson has proved 
     himself one of the standout players 
     in the International League. In his 
     home town, Montreal, he is a hero. 
     To the great majority of fans in 
     other International League towns, he 
     is also a favorite. There's no doubt 
     of it. Jackie has made good here... 
     but the biggest hurdle is ahead of 
     him... the major league. The 
     opposition is strengthening. There 
     are going to be fireworks!

MONTREAL - (STOCK)

There are stock shots available of the riotous scenes when 
the Montreal Royals won the International League pennant in 
1946 and the crowd went wild over Jackie, riding him around 
on their shoulders.

GAINES HOME LONG

Gaines and his wife emerge on porch just as postman comes up 
the walk.

PORCH MED. CLOSE

Gaines accepts letter from postman who exits after they 
exchange greetings. He opens letter and begins to read while 
Mrs. Gaines turns to go back into house.

          GAINES
     Just a minute, Clara. This is from 
     Jackie Robinson.

          MRS. GAINES
     Oh. Is he coming back here?

          GAINES
     No. That's why he writes. He's on 
     his way to Cuba. That's where Brooklyn 
     and Montreal will train this year.

          MRS. GAINES
          (eagerly)
     Does he think he can go with Brooklyn?

          GAINES
          (smiling)
     He says all he has to do is beat two 
     hundred other men trying for the 
     team.

          MRS. GAINES
          (face falling)
     Oh.

          GAINES
     That's all right. He has to show he 
     is able. The important thing is...
          (significantly)
     ...he has nothing else against him. 
     He, and all of us, have come that 
     far, anyway.

He folds letter slowly and thoughtfully as she pats his arm 
understandingly.

          MRS. GAINES
     Yes. Yes.

HAVANA - (STOCK) AERIAL

A legend reads: "HAVANA, CUBA."

HAVANA STADIUM

The Montreal team is working out in the field preparatory to 
playing a game, with the ball being whipped out around the 
infield. Jackie is playing second.

BROOKLYN DUGOUT MED. CLOSE

Just close enough so we can read the insignia on the uniforms 
of the players and know that it is the Brooklyn team which 
will oppose Montreal.

INFIELD FULL

Shooting from second towards home plate we see a trainer cup 
his hands to his mouth as if to yell.

          TRAINER
          (yelling)
     Robinson! Mr. Rickey wants to see 
     you!

INFIELD REVERSE SHOT

Jackie waves acknowledgement and then starts trotting in.

SIDELINE MEDIUM

Rickey is standing alone, holding a first baseman's glove. 
As Jackie enters scene Rickey nods and flips the glove to 
Jackie who catches it but looks puzzled.

          JACKIE
     For me? This is a first baseman's 
     glove.

          RICKEY
     That's right. I want you to use it.

          JACKIE
     I don't get it. Not play second, you 
     mean? Mr. Rickey, I don't like first 
     base. I'm not a first baseman. I did 
     well at second last year.

          RICKEY
     Jackie, your team begins a seven 
     game practice series against Brooklyn 
     today. I want you to play first. I 
     want you to play like you've never 
     played before. Last year at Montreal 
     doesn't mean a thing. This is it. 
     This is where you decide whether 
     Brooklyn wants you... and by Brooklyn 
     I don't mean me -- I mean the Brooklyn 
     players. I want you to run them 
     ragged, on the bases, in the field, 
     at bat. Run wild. Steal their pants 
     off. They know they are definitely 
     weak at first. They want to win the 
     pennant. Make them wonder if their 
     chances wouldn't be better if they 
     had you. If they wonder loud enough... 
     I'll get you for them.

Jackie still has a fielder's glove on his hand. Slowly he 
shakes it off and puts the first baseman's glove on instead. 
He seems to have forgotten that Rickey is there. He pounds 
his fist into the pocket of the glove thoughtfully and then, 
without another word, still deeply preoccupied apparently, 
walks off. Rickey's gaze follows him.

BASEBALL SERIES MONTAGE

Jackie awkwardly scrambling for one in the dirt at first and 
barely recovering to make the out. Jackie hitting. Jackie 
racing in for a bunt, turning to find no one at first, and 
then racing the runner to the bag for the out. After which 
he mops his brow wearily. Jackie running the bases, stealing 
into a base, beating a pitcher's throw to trap him, teasing 
the pitcher, teasing again, then away on a run. Jackie 
hitting. Jackie hitting again. Jackie walking.

And again hitting as we

INT. SMALL OFFICE MEDIUM

Clyde Sukeforth is at a desk working away with a pencil at 
some figuring. Nearby stands Rickey waiting. Clyde makes a 
final notation, tosses the pencil away and shakes his head 
unbelievingly.

          RICKEY
     Well?

          SUKEFORTH
     I've never seen anything like it 
     before. His fielding was only fair, 
     as you know. He was new to first 
     base. But, at bat!... For the seven-
     game series Jackie stole seven bases 
     and hit .625!

          RICKEY
          (thoughtfully)
     Pretty good. Pretty good.

Clyde is amazed at this conservatism, and his face is a study 
as Rickey nods and walks away.

Jackie at a small desk, writing. His voice is heard telling 
us some of the words he is putting down.

          JACKIE'S VOICE
     ...Training is over, Rae. I've had 
     no word yet. We fly to New York 
     tomorrow to play exhibition games 
     against Brooklyn on April 9th and 
     10th. The tenth is the last day before 
     the official season begins so if I 
     don't hear by then... I know I'm 
     cooked. They say that some of the 
     Dodgers didn't want me...

Simply two wicker chairs against a palm trunk or tropical 
plant of any suitable type for a background. Rickey and Hopper 
are seated and talking.

          RICKEY
          (concerned)
     It's a tough problem. Most of the 
     players see his value, a few don't. 
     That still leaves a Dodger team 
     divided against itself. I don't want 
     that.

          HOPPER
     No... unless you could take a chance 
     that they would all come around when 
     they see that Jackie is helping them 
     towards a common cause -- the pennant.

          RICKEY
          (thinking)
     I don't know... I don't know.

          ANNOUNCER
     Well, here is Jackie Robinson up 
     again in the last exhibition game 
     before the start of the official 
     National League season. Jackie has 
     had two chances to show whether Rickey 
     is wrong in not signing him for 
     Brooklyn -- and failed to get a hit 
     both times. Let's see what he does 
     now with a man on first to bring in.

MONTREAL DUGOUT

They are watching Jackie keenly when another player jumps 
into the dugout excitedly and says something to some of the 
players. The others hear his words and turn to him in great 
interest, forgetting about Jackie.

PITCHER

Winding up and throwing.

JACKIE

Swinging and hitting.

INFIELD

Angling to show that Jackie has hit into an easy double play, 
so easy that he stops running about two-thirds of the way to 
first and turns to lope back to the Montreal dugout.

RADIO ANNOUNCER CLOSE

          ANNOUNCER
     That wasn't so hot. An easy double 
     play. It's hard to believe after the 
     sensational reports of Jackie's 
     playing in Cuba. Well, everybody has 
     a bad day and I imagine he is feeling 
     pretty blue now as he runs towards 
     his dugout...
          (puzzled)
     No! He isn't sad at all... He's 
     smiling.
          (excitedly)
     Wait a moment! Something's going on 
     at the Montreal dugout. All his 
     teammates are running out to greet 
     him as they would a hero! What in...

Jackie is leaning over Rickey's desk and signing his contract 
while Rickey looks on. When Jackie finishes, Rickey puts out 
his hand and they shake.

          RICKEY
     My congratulations, Jackie. The going 
     is still going to be tough. But I 
     can trust you now to take what comes 
     and not lose your head until you win 
     the National League players over 
     like you did in the International 
     League.

          JACKIE
     You can trust me, Mr. Rickey. I can't 
     afford to fail. My career is no longer 
     a personal one, as you know...

          RICKEY
     I know.

MONTAGE

Against a background which illustrates the tough time Jackie 
had in the National League his first season -- getting spiked, 
ducking baseballs, being given the "hip" in his baserunning -- 
we see newspaper stories headed variously:

               ROBINSON SPIKED AGAIN YESTERDAY

PLAYERS DENY ANTI-ROBINSON PLOT, SAY ROUGHNESS ACCIDENTAL

                              ROBINSON CALM IN NIGHT GAME FRACAS

Whatever the scenes, Jackie is shown as quietly accepting 
whatever happens and standing clear while his teammates defend 
him. The news stories are dated to show the progression of 
the summer months during the 1947 season, or else we might 
show the calendar months being stripped off one by one.

Part of the same effect is the following headline:

                HOLD JACKIE ROBINSON NIGHT AT EBBETTS FIELD!

Here we insert stock shots showing Jackie out in the field 
receiving the Cadillac car, television set, etc., with his 
mother and Rae also present at the ceremonies in his honor.

Winchell, etc.).

          ANNOUNCER
     Today, ladies and gentleman, near 
     the close of the 1949 baseball season, 
     a great National League player, and 
     outstanding American citizen, is on 
     his way to Washington. His name is 
     Jackie Robinson. He isn't going there 
     to play ball. But he is going to 
     talk about how an American patriot 
     plays ball with the country that 
     extends him the right to fight for 
     freedom. He has been asked to discuss 
     the patriotism of the American 
     Negro... before the members of the 
     Un-American Activities Committee.

INT. COMMITTEE ROOM - (STOCK)

We show those scenes of Jackie in which he is beginning the 
selected excerpts given below.

          JACKIE
     You can put me down as an expert on 
     being a colored American, with thirty 
     years of experience at it. And just 
     like any other colored person with 
     sense enough to look around him and 
     understand what he sees, I know that 
     life in these United States can be 
     mighty tough for people who are a 
     little different from the majority -- 
     in their skin, color or the way they 
     worship their God, or the way they 
     spell their names. I'm not fooled 
     because I've had a chance open to 
     very few Negro Americans. It's true 
     that I've been the laboratory specimen 
     in a great change in organized 
     baseball. I'm proud that I've made 
     good on my assignment to the point 
     where other colored players will 
     find it easier to enter the game and 
     go to the top. But I'm very well 
     aware that even this limited job 
     isn't finished. As I see it there 
     has been a terrific lot of 
     misunderstanding on this subject of 
     communism among Negroes in this 
     country, and it's bound to hurt my 
     people's cause unless it's cleared 
     up. I understand that there are some 
     few Negroes who are members of the 
     Communist party, and in event of war 
     with Russia they would probably act 
     just as any other Communists would. 
     So would members of other minority 
     and majority groups... Most Negroes -- 
     and Italians and Irish and Jews and 
     Swedes and Slavs and other Americans -- 
     would act just as all these groups 
     did in the last war. They'd do their 
     best to help their country stay out 
     of war; if unsuccessful, they'd do 
     their best to help their country win 
     the war -- against Russia or any 
     other enemy that threatened us... I 
     can't speak for any fifteen million 
     people any more than any other one 
     person can, but I know that I've got 
     too much invested for my wife and 
     child and myself in the future of 
     this country, and I and other 
     Americans of many races and faiths 
     have too much invested in our 
     country's welfare, for any of us to 
     throw it away. I am a religious man. 
     Therefore, I cherish America where I 
     am free to worship as I please, a 
     privilege which some countries do 
     not give. And I suspect that 999 out 
     of almost any 1,000 colored Americans 
     you meet will tell you the same thing. 
     But that doesn't mean that we're 
     going to stop fighting race 
     discrimination in this country until 
     we've got it licked. It means that 
     we're going to fight it all the harder 
     because our stake in the future is 
     so big. We can win our fight without 
     the Communists and we don't want 
     their help...

INTERCUT into speech are scenes of typical Negro life, both 
impoverished and comparatively affluent, selected to best 
illustrate his particular words at the moment. There is a 
CLOSEUP of Jackie as he reaches his final words. As he speaks 
them we cut to:
