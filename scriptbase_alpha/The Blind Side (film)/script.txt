          1 OVER BLACK... 1
          A distinctly SOUTHERN VOICE...

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          There's a moment of orderly silence
          before a football play begins.
          Players are in position, linemen
          are frozen, and anything's
          possible. Then, like a traffic
          accident, stuff begins to randomly
          collide. From the snap of the ball
          to the snap of the first bone is
          closer to four seconds than five.

          2 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD/GAME FOOTAGE - NIGHT 2

           We're watching footage of the 1985 Redskins/Giants Monday
           Night Football game. Lots of angles, faces, knuckles as the
           two teams line up, Redskins on offense, for the snap of the
           ball. As the play begins --

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the
          Redskins quarterback, takes the
          snap and hands off to his running
          back.
          JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps
          forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann.
          The footage PAUSES AND PLAYS like a coach breaking down film.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Two Mississippi. It's a trick play,
          a flea flicker, and the running
          back tosses the ball back to the
          quarterback.
          HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has
          the ball back and races toward him. Theismann steps up and
          to the side and Carson flies past.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Three Mississippi. Up to now the
          play's been defined by what the
          quarterback sees. It's about to be
          defined by what he doesn't.
          LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins
          lineman trying to block him.

                         2 CONTINUED: 2
          The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses.
          Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann.
          The image FREEZES.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor
          is the best defensive player in the
          NFL and has been from the time he
          stepped onto the field as a rookie.
          The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes
          Theismann's body.
          PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating.
          TAYLOR pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          He will also change the game of
          football as we know it.
          WE ARE WATCHING the MNF feed and hear the ANNOUNCER'S VOICES.

          FRANK GIFFORD (V.0.)
          Again, we'll look at it with the
          reverse angle one more time. And I
          suggest if your stomach is weak you
          just don't watch.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          Joe Theissman never played another
          down of football.

          LEIGH ANNE'S. VOICE
          Now, y'all would guess that more
          often than not the highest paid
          player on an NFL team is the
          quarterback.
          The camera finds MATT HASSELBECK, Seattle's quarterback.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          And you'd be right. What you
          probably don't know is that more
          often than not the second highest
          paid player is, thanks to Lawrence
          Taylor, a left tackle.
          The camera goes to WALTER JONES, Seattle's left tackle.

          Because, as every housewife knows,
          the first check you write is for
          the mortgage and the second is for
          the insurance. The left tackle's
          job is to protect the quarterback
          from what he can't see coming. To
          protect his blind side.

          4 SERIES OF SHOTS 4
           "Famous" left tackles - Jonathan Ogden, Orlando Pace, Andre
          Gurode. Then we SEE SHOTS of their hands, feet, waists,
          etc., corresponding with ---

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          The ideal left tackle is big, but a
          lot of people are big. He is wide
          in the butt and massive in the
          thighs. He has long arms, giant
          hands and feet as quick as a
          hiccup.

          EXT. WEST MEMPHIS -- DAY 5

          A street anchored by project housing and littered with broken
          down cars and ne'er-do-wells. Lots of folks out, milling
          about, but our focus is on A TEENAGER in the distance, moving
          TOWARD US in SLO-MO while everyone else is at normal speed.
          He's extremely large, six and a half feet, but he carefully
          steps instead of strutting. His name is MICHAEL OHER.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          This is a rare and expensive
          combination the need for which can
          be traced to that Monday night game
          and Lawrence. Taylor. For on that
          day he not only altered Joe
          Theismann's life, but mine as well.
          As Michael continues toward us he begins to go OUT OF FOCUS --

          INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.O.)
          Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here?

          Yes. To investigate. I'm here to
          investigate your odd...
          predicament.

          6 INT. NONDESCRIPT ROOM - DAY 6

          Looks like a government office. Not much more than a desk on
          either side of which sit INVESTIGATOR GRANGER, an African-
          American woman in a business suit, and Michael Oher. Michael
          slumps a bit, eyes the ground and rubs his hands on his knees
          - a nervous trait of his.

                         GRANGER
          Do you find it odd? Your
          predicament?

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          Michael?...

                         MICHAEL
          Iono [I don't know]...
          Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out
          files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever
          trouble Michael is in.
          She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him
          out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window,
          rubs his knees some more.

                         MICHAEL (CONT'D)
          Can I... can I leave now?

                         GRANGER

                         (WITH FINALITY)
          No. You can't.

          joints, all of which Michael's eyes take in.

          10 EXT. EAST MEMPHIS - INT/EXT TAURUS - DAY (LATER) 10

          We've gone from slums to nice neighborhoods - fathers and
          sons play baseball, kids tend lemonade stands, sprinklers
          keep the grass emerald green.
          Michael's face tells us he's never seen anything like this.

          BERT COTTON, football coach, cleans off his desk, ready to
          leave for the day. Big Tony knocks at the door.

          Mike doesn't answer, just takes it all in. Steven sees and
          opens a container filled to the brim with balls - footballs,
          basketballs, four square balls.

          her deathbed, that I would get
          Steven outta public and into a
          church school.

                         COTTON
          I appreciate that but I'm not
          involved with admissions.

          What sport does he play?

          Classes start in a week. It'd have

          Michael dribbles the ball between his legs, behind his back
          and jumps high, slamming the ball through the hoop. Big men
          aren't supposed to move like this.

          We're not sure exactly how old he
          is due to lack of records. He has
          a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th
          percentile. He's been enrolled in
          seven different institutions,
          including a gap of eighteen months
          around the age of ten when he
          apparently didn't attend school at
          all. He repeated first grade as
          well as second, there's no record
          of attendance in third, and in
          fourth grade --

                         COTTON
          So they moved him ahead without
          going to third grade. That says
          something.

          MRS. SMITH

                         (IGNORING COTTON)
          His attendance records are abysmal
          and his grade point average begins
          with a zero. Zero-point-six-
          Silence around the room. MRS. BOSWELL, a board member and
          science teacher, looks to the others.

          MRS. BOSWELL
          Everyone passed him along - gave
          him D's so they could hand their
          problem off to the next school.

          Brave kid.
          (off their confusion)
          For wanting to come here. For
          wanting a quality education. An
          education denied him by the poor
          quality of the schools he's
          attended. Most kids with his
          background wouldn't come within two
          hundred miles of this place.

          MRS. SMITH
          Coach Cotton, we understand your
          interest in the young man's
          athletic abilities.

                         SANDSTROM
          He wouldn't be able to play until
          he got his grades up anyway.

          He points to the crest on the wall. Beneath it: "NEIGHBORLY,

                         COTTON (CONT'D)
          Christian. We either take that
          seriously or we paint over it. You
          don't admit Michael Oher for
          sports, you admit him because it's
          the right thing to do.
          Their faces announce that he's made a point.

          17 EXT. WINGATE - DAY 17

          First day of class. Students, mostly blonde-haired and blue-
          eyed, wearing crisply laundered Abercrombie and Fitch, carry
          their backpacks through the school's arch and converse with
          friends they haven't seen over the summer.
          Michael ENTERS FRAME. Fills it up in fact. He stares at the
          arch. Beneath the school name we read "WITH MEN THIS IS.
          POSSIBLE, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE". Michael takes a
          deep breath and enters. He carries his "school bag" - a
          plastic grocery sack.

          18 EXT. WINGATE - CAMPUS - DAY 18

          Just as before, Michael moves at A DIFFERENT SPEED than those
          around him. Makes sense because he is different. Not only
          the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants
          and T-shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to
          the fact that he doesn't belong here.
          Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a
          wide, cautious berth. He's noticed and ogled by everyone.

          19 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 19

          It's Mrs. Boswell's biology class and she's writing on the
          board in front of a full classroom when Michael enters. He
          pauses and all eyes go to him. Mrs. Boswell does her best to
          stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him. Then...

          MRS. BOSWELL
          Class, this is Mike Oher and he's
          new here so I expect you all to
          make him feel welcome.
          (with a warm smile)
          Mike, take any empty seat.

          She urges him with a nod. Michael walks back and sits in the
          corner, looking terrified. He barely fits in the seat.
          Mrs. Boswell hands out a stack of papers to each row. As
          students pass them back to others...

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
          This is a quiz based on the
          information you learned last year
          in your science curriculum.

                         (OVER GROANS)
          Don't worry. It won't be graded. I
          just want to see how much of the
          information we need to hit again. 

                          
          Just answer whatever you know.
          The student in front of Michael hands a sheet back to him and
          eyes the size of his feet.
          The students start to work while Michael stares at the sheet
          like it's written in Greek. Mrs. Boswell watches him for a

          A bell RINGS and kids leave classrooms.

          21 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 21 

          Michael sits alone while Mrs. Boswell collects the last of
          the papers. She walks over to Michael, looks down at his
          sheet. Nothing filled in, just his name scrawled at the top.
          She tries to decide how to deal with this then opts for --

          MRS. BOSWELL
          It's okay.

                         MICHAEL
          Can I leave now?
          She nods and watches him stand and walk away. She glances
          down at the sheet, turns it over and sees...
          A DRAWING on the back - a boat on an ocean. On the boat is a
          single, stick figure person. It's sweet but looks like a
          third grader drew it.

          Michael lies on a tattered sofa. The lights are out but
          Michael's eyes are open, staring at the light emanating from
          beneath a closed bedroom door. We hear voices...

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S)
          Why he gotta always stay here?

          BIG TONY'S VOICE (0.S)

          School is out. Steven walks up to Michael...

          Hey, Big Mike, um... my Pops'
          girlfriend... she don't really want

          Big Tony's Taurus pulls into the lot.

          A girl's volleyball game is in progress in the bg. As
          latecomers move en masse for entry into the gym, a small

          Leigh Anne's husband SEAN TUOHY, handsome, confidant, and
          their 10-year-old son, SJ, sit, watching the game.
          During a time out, Sean eyes the crowd, sees something odd.
          In the upper corner of the gym sits Michael, by himself,
          rubbing his knees. Others around him, all white, have moved
          away. He's a very large island in the lily white gym.

                         COTTON
          You could tell that by looking at
          him?

                         SEAN -
           I didn't grow up all that different
           from him. At public school they

                          
          give you free lunch, Bert. And
          when food is finite, you'd be
          surprised how much time you can
          spend thinking about it..

          29 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 29 

          Mrs. Boswell distributes a test to the class.

          MRS. BOSWELL
          You'll have one hour. If you
          finish early put it on my desk and
          sit quietly.
          She looks at the class as they begin to work, then sees
          Michael just staring at his test. She sighs, makes a
          decision, rises and walks over.

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT`D)
          Mike, come with me.

          30 INT. WINGATE - SMALL ADJACENT ROOM - DAY 30 

          Filled with supplies and a small desk. Mrs. Boswell points
          and he sits.

          MRS. BOSWELL
          You can take the test back here
          away from everybody else. I'll sit

                          
          in there so if there's anything you
          don't understand you can ask.

          Michael's eyes go to the page in front of him. He rubs his
          hands on his knees and stares. Mrs. Boswell waits a beat
          then scoots her chair over next to him.

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
          Mike, how about I ask the questions
          and you tell me the answers or as
          much as you know.
          She looks at his hands - huge next to hers - then reads:

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
          Protozoans are classified based on:
          a) how they get their food, b) how
          they reproduce, c) how they move,
          or d) both a and c.
          Michael just stares. After a long moment

                         MICHAEL
          Iono...

          MRS. BOSWELL
          Just try. Ask questions if you
          don't understand.
          But still Michael stares at the page. The look on her face
          says she's about to give up when
          He lifts his eyes to her and points to --
          -- the question on the test - specifically to the word
          "classified".

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
          "Classified". It means how things
          are grouped together.

                         MICHAEL
          Like our "class"?

          MRS. BOSWELL
          Exactly. This science course is
          classified based on what grade
          y'all are in. Eleventh.
          Michael nods understanding.

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
          Okay, Mike, you ready to answer the
          question?

          Same group of teachers. Mrs. Boswell bursts through the
          door, holding the test.

          MRS. BOSWELL
          He knows it!

                         BOB
          Who knows it and what does he know?

          MRS. BOSWELL
          The material. Michael Oher. I
          gave him this test verbally.
          She holds up the test -- marked with a large red "C".

                         APRIL
          On how big a curve?

          MRS. BOSWELL
          He's been listening the whole time.
          It's amazing what he's absorbed.
          And, trust me, he's listening to
          you, too. Okay, so his reading
          level is low and he has no idea how
          to learn in a classroom, but...
          (makes her point)
          I'm not saying he's going to pass
          but Big Mike is not stupid.

          32 EXT. WINGATE - CAMPUS - DAY 32 

          School is out and Michael walks among the kids of all shapes
          and sizes. Two little Kindergarten girls'try and swing
          themselves. Michael stops nearby, watching them.

                         MICHAEL
          They're stuck, not sure if they should talk to this
          "stranger". They jump off the swings and run away.

                         SI (OS)
          Smile at 'em.
          Michael turns to see Si nearby, watching him.

          It lets them know you're their
          friend. Did you know that even
          little kids born blind smile?
          They've never seen anyone do it
          before but they smile anyway. So
          it's universal. That's why it
          works. Not that you should fake it
          or anything... You're Big Mike,
          right?
          Sean holds. out a fist for Mike to "knock" and the two walk
          toward the school entrance.

                         SJ (CONT'D)
          I'm Sean, but everyone calls me Si --
          that's for Sean Junior because my
          father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy.
          He was a basketball star at Ole
          Miss, point guard, and now he owns
          like a million Taco Bells.
          Leigh Anne's car pulls up to the pick up/drop off and Si
          starts toward it.

          Michael and Sandstrom sit on a bench.

                         SANDSTROM 
          Mike, I just got a call from
          someone at the police department.
          (off Michael's look)
          Do you remember the story in the
          papers awhile back about the man
          who fell off an overpass?
          (Michael shakes his head)
          No one knew who he was and they're
          not sure if he jumped, or if... at
          any rate he passed away.
          Sandstrom struggles with how to say the words. 

                         SANDSTROM (CONT'D) 
          Mike, the man... was your father.
          Michael takes this in. without showing emotion.

                         SANDSTROM (CONT'D) 
          They've been looking for someone to
          notify and came across your name on
          our registry. I'm really sorry,
          son.

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          Were you close?

          When did you last see him?

          Iono.

                         SANDSTROM
          I'll try and find out where he's
          buried. Maybe we could go visit?
          Michael nods, then rises and walks away.

          36 EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY (LATER) 36

           Michael sits at a bus stop with his bag, rises as a bus stops

           Pretty seedy. Michael walks to a sink in the back, opens his 
          plastic sack, pulls out an extra T-shirt and starts to wash
          it.
          A WOMAN, the only other patron, reads a magazine. When he
          turns to look at her, she becomes quite nervous. She sets
          down the magazine and walks outside.
          It seems Michael was expecting this because as soon as she
          leaves he takes his wet T-shirt, wrings it-out, walks to her
          dryer and tosses the shirt inside to dry with her things.

          39 EXT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT (LATER) 39 

          Michael sits in the corner, his head resting against the

          this car a month and you don't know
          how to turn on the heat?!

          Si, don't let this go to your head
          but I thought you were very
          convincing in the role of... uh...

                         SI
          Indian Number Three. I tried out
          for the Chief but they gave it to
          Andy Sung. I can't be sure but I
          think there was some multi-cultural
          bias thing working.

                         SEAN
          Or maybe they just thought he'd
          make a better Chief.

                         SI
          Dad, he's like Chinese.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          And you're Irish. If you weren't
          the Chief how come you got the
          headdress?
          Si hesitates a bit before --

                         SI
          Dad, I'm gonna need a few more of
          those free Quesadilla tickets.

          a mansion. Hell, it IS a mansion.

          48 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 48

          Collins, in her pjs, talks on the phone while watching TV and
          listening to the stereo. She wears a tangerine cleansing
          masque on her face. When the family enters behind her --

                         COLLINS
          How'd the dork do in the play?
          She turns to see... Sean, Leigh Anne, SJ in headdress and
          Big Mike.

                         COLLINS (CONT'D)
          Um... okay...

          49 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 49

          Leigh Anne lays out pillows, sheets, blankets on the couch.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I'd give you the guest bedroom but
          it's full of sample boxes. And the
          sectional in the family room slides
          apart when you sleep on it. At
          least that's what Sean says.

                         MICHAEL 
          Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the couch? 

                         LEIGH ANNE 
          Only when he's bad. There's a
          powder room right there and we're
          upstairs if you need us.
          The two share a look, then...

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Sleep tight, honey.
          She leaves. Michael is dumbfounded, stares at everything in
          the room, then sits on the couch.

                         SJ
          Psst...
          SJ is in the doorway to the kitchen.

                         SJ (CONT'D)
          If you can't sleep, my room is the
          first one at the top of the back
          stairs. I got X-Box, Madden,
          everything.

          Michael nods then smiles. SJ smiles back, gives a thumbs up
          and disappears. Michael's eyes go to a coffee table book

          They lie in bed, awake.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Was this a bad idea?

                         SEAN
          What?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Don't lie there and pretend you're
          not thinking the same thing as me.

                         SEAN
          Fine, tell me what you're thinking
          so I can know what's supposed to be
          on my mind.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          How well do you know Big Mike?

                         SEAN
          In case you haven't noticed he
          doesn't have much to say. What's
          the big deal? It's just one night.
          (after a beat)
          It is just one night, right?..
          Leigh Anne?...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Do you think he'll steal anything?

                         SEAN
          I guess we'll know in. the morning.
          He rolls over to go to sleep. Leigh Anne just sits, stares.

          51 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY 51

          Leigh Anne finishes teasing her hair. Sean rides an exercise
          bike. Before she leaves the room...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          If you hear a scream call the
          insurance adjustor.

          52 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - COLLINS' BEDROOM - DAY 52

          Leigh Anne enters Collins' bedroom. Very "teenage girl" but
          a mess - clothes everywhere. Leigh Anne opens the curtains
          throwing light into the room.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Up and at 'em.
          Collins groans. Leigh Anne picks up a few pieces of clothes.
          on her way out and groans at the mess. We stay with her as
          she re-enters the hallway, walks and opens the door to --

          53 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SJ'S BEDROOM - DAY 53

          Just as messy but not all clothes. Leigh Anne almost trips
          on a series of wires connecting games to a large screen TV.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Sean Junior!
          She opens the shades.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Clean this place up before you come
          downstairs. You hear me?
          Si crawls out of bed and Leigh Anne exits the room and starts
          down the stairs, almost afraid of what she'll find.

          54 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 54

           Leigh Anne stops, stares --
          The couch is totally back to normal and the sheets, blankets
          and pillows are neatly stacked in almost military precision.
          No sign of Michael.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Mike? Big Mike?!
          Nothing. She hears a DOG BARKING in the neighborhood and
          moves to the window to look out.

          55 EXT. TUOHY HOUSE - DAY 55

          Michael, plastic sack in hand, walks away. Leigh Anne exits
          the front door, spots Michael and tries to catch up.

                         LEIGH ANNE

          Where are you going?

          Iono.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Are you spending Thanksgiving with
          your family?
          Michael shakes his head.

          Leigh. Anne carves turkey onto a tray and takes it into...

          57 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM -- DAY 57

          Leigh Anne sets the turkey on a serving table alongside the
          rest of the Tuohy Thanksgiving feast.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Come and get it!
          Sean sits at the TV,"watching an Ole Miss football game,
          while SJ plays.video games on another. Collins chats on her
          cell. Michael sits off to the side, taking it all in.

                         SEAN
          SJ, Ole Miss is about to score!

                         SI
          Which means they're about to
          fumble.
          They all shuffle over, grab plates, start piling on food.
          Sean loads his plate and heads back to the couch.

                         SEAN
          Looks great, hon.
          Collins plate is pretty delicately apportioned.

                         COLLINS
          I see a lot of starch.
          SJ jams turkey into a roll and lathers on cranberry sauce -
          creating an easy to eat sandwich. He walks away.

          Michael stares - he's never seen so much food. Leigh Anne
          hands him a plate. He gingerly puts a slice of.turkey on it.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          As much as you want.

                         (WALKS AWAY)
          Oh, the potato salad!
          With no one watching him, Michael shoves two rolls into his
          pants pocket and finishes filling his plate.
          Leigh Anne reenters to see Michael sitting at the dining room
          table, alone, not touching his plate.
          Her eyes go to the rest of her family, shoving down food and
          playing games. She makes a decision, grabs the remote and
          turns off the TVs.

          58 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 58

          The entire family sits at the table. Rockwell would be proud.

                         SI
          Why are we eating in here?
          Leigh Anne holds out her hands.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Shall we say grace?
          The Tuohy family plus Michael hold hands.
          Collins stares at her tiny hand intertwined with Michael's.
          As Leigh Anne prays Michael tries to emulate behavior without
          closing his eyes, taking it all in...

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Heavenly Father. We thank you for
          all your many blessings on this
          family. We thank you for bringing
          us a new friend. And we ask that
          you look after. us in this holiday
          season and never let us forget just
          how very fortunate we are. Amen.
          A chorus of Amens and they all dig in. Michael is unsure at
          first how to correctly use the silverware. He picks up the
          fork and Leigh Anne nods, "that's right". She eyes Michael's
          stained shirt.

          shirt in a plastic bag does not a
          wardrobe make.

           Okay, fine, let's go get 'em. Just
           tell me where I'm going.
           No answer. Frustrated, she pulls the car over to the curb
          and puts it in park.

          Tell me everything I need to know
          about you.

          easy way - or we can do it the hard

          An expansive beehive of rotting housing. It's the place we
          saw when we first laid eyes on Michael and nothing's changed.
          Leigh Anne's car stops at one of the complexes.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          This is where your mother lives?
          He nods and she opens her door.

          Okay, let's go.
          He forcefully reaches across her and closes the door,
          catching her off guard.

          Don't get out of the car.
          Michael gets out on his side and takes care to push the lock
          before he closes the door.
          She watches as he walks toward the structure, then notices
          several of the local ne'er-do-wells eyeing her. she locks
          the doors again, just for luck.

          The obvious leader, ALTON, eyes him.

                         ALTON
          Big Mike! Where you been?!
          Michael ignores, keeps walking.

          And who's that fine piece o' thing
          driving you around?
          One of Alton's minions, DAVID, sits nearby. Michael sees
          him, nods.

                         MICHAEL
          Hey, David.
          David, a little embarrassed to be with Alton, nods back.

          Michael arrives at an apartment and stops, taken aback. On
          the door is an EVICTION NOTICE and padlock.
          He reads from the eviction for several seconds.
          An Addict down the way fires up and slumps into bliss.

          With Leigh Anne's car in the bg., Michael, hidden from view

          we've seen from-him.

          She watches as Michael approaches the building with nothing
          in his hands, and makes his way back to the car. She unlocks
          it and he crawls inside. After a pregnant moment...

          She wadn't home.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          That's good to know. Thank you.
          As they start to walk, Leigh Anne reaches up and takes
          Michael's arm. He holds it out for her.

          65 INT. BIG AND TALL SHOP - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 65

          An AFRICAN AMERICAN SALESMAN directs Leigh Anne and Michael.

                         SALESMAN
          Everything I got to fit him will be
          -right here.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          This is it? If this is all you got
          why's it say "Big and Tall" on the
          sign?

                         SALESMAN
          Big and Tall. You need "Bigger and
          Taller".
          He walks away. She starts to pore through the small rack.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Anything you like?

                         (HE SHRUGS)
          The one thing I know about shopping
          is that if you don't absolutely
          love it in the store, you won't
          wear it. The store is where you
          like it best.

          And before you choose something
          think about yourself wearing it and
          ask yourself: Is this me?

                          
          She finds one shirt, holds it out.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) 

                          
          What about this?

                          
          He shakes his head, "no".

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

                         (ANOTHER SHIRT)
          This isn't atrocious.

          He shakes his head again. After a beat he points.
          almost laughs.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          This one? This is the one you
          like?
          He nods, completely sure.

          66 EXT. WINGATE - DAY 66 

          Drop off area. Leigh Anne's car pulls up and SJ, Collins and
          Michael get out.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Have a great day. Learn something!
          They say a few good-byes, get out and walk toward the arch.
          Only then do we see what Michael is wearing: a GARGANTUAN

          ORANGE AND MAROON STRIPED RUGBY SHIRT.
          Leigh Anne shakes her head, watching him walk away. A car
          behind her HONKS. She checks the rear view mirror --

          67 INT. TONY RESTAURANT - DAY 67

          Ladies who lunch. The right sort doing their thing. Leigh
          Anne sits at a table with three friends, BETH, ELAINE and
          SHERRY. They sip on lemon water and nibble at salads.

          back.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Any of y'all spent much time on the
          other side of town?

                         ELAINE
          On the freeway.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Alabama Street... Hurt Village.

                         BETH
          Hurt Village -- that sounds like a
          threat.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          You're not far off.

                         SHERRY
          It would "hurt" me to go there.

                         ELAINE
          It would certainly hurt your
          reputation to go there.

                         BETH
          (tongue in cheek)
          I'm actually from there but didn't

          - building ugly, low cost housing.
          I mean how could you be creative if
          you lived there? It's stifling.

                         ELAINE
          Did you know that black men were
          employed at a higher rate before
          those programs? It's a fact.

                         BETH
          They're not "black", Elaine. The
          term du jour is African-American.

                         ELAINE
          And what if they're from Jamaica,
          or like Bermuda.

                         SHERRY
          Then they're BerMUDian-Americans.
          They all cringe and laugh.

                         ELAINE
          So, why are you asking about the
          projects, Leigh.Anne? Another one
          of your charities?

                         BETH
          A project for the projects. That's
          catchy. Money would raise itself.
          (off their laughs)
          Don't laugh. Count me in, Leigh
          Anne.

          Do you want to stay here, Michael?
          He keeps working.

          for awhile... longer... I'll try
          and find some time to figure out a
          bedroom for you.
          He stops, turns to her. She walks over, examines the
          structure of the couch. It sags a bit.

          I mean, look at this, you've
          practically ruined a.ten thousand
          dollar couch.

          Mrs. Smith (from the admissions meeting) sits with her.

          MRS. SMITH
          Sean wrote that in last week. We

          ones listed weren't in service.

          What's this?

          MRS. SMITH
          The state makes schools measure for

          Doesn't look promising. Spatial
          relations - third percentile..
          Ability to learn - fifth
          percentile.

          What?

                         SJ
          Enough with the rugby shirts. You
          look like a giant bumble bee.
          Collins walks by with friends and glances but ignores them.

                         GIRL STUDENT
          Who's the big guy hanging around
          with your little brother?

                         MICHAEL
          Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't have to
          go to work?

                         SEAN
          Hey, hey now. I'm working even
          when I'm not working.

                         MICHAEL
          What do y'all do with the leftover
          food? At the restaurant?,

                         SEAN
          Well, we have to throw some of it
          away. What's already been cooked.

                         MICHAEL
          That's too bad.

                         SEAN
          Yeah, I'd rather sell it.

          Seems like you could give it away
          or something? You should check
          into that, Daddy.
          Leigh Anne and Sean share a look and a smile.

                         SEAN
          All right, I will.

                         MICHAEL
          Why ain't we eatin' at one of yours
          tonight?

                         SEAN

          occasion.

                         SJ
          What?

                         SEAN
          I talked to Coach Cotton today.
          Michael's grades improved enough
          that he can do spring'training for
          football in March.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Isn't that great?

                         SI
          Oh, man, you are gonna crush some
          people!
          Michael almost smiles, a little unsure.

          83 EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 83

          Sean's car pulls up to the valet. As the family gets out
          Leigh Anne notices a bookstore next door and starts for it.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I've got a design book I need to
          get. Sean, go check on our
          reservation.

                         SEAN
          They'll seat us when we walk in the

          dinner.

          They might be closed by then.

                         COLLINS
          I need some new magazines.
          SJ shrugs and joins the girls, as does Michael. Sean watches
          as his family deserts him.

          84 INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT 84

          Leigh Anne finds the book she's looking for and walks through
          the stacks looking for her kids, plus Michael. She finds
          them all together in the children's section, laughing.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Come on, your dad's already PO'ed.
          Collins holds up a book. Sendak's WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE.

                         COLLINS
          Remember this one, Mom? You read
          it to us like a thousand times.
          She softens, walks over, takes the book.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          "And he gnashed his terrible teeth
          and roared his terrible roar.-

          He holds up THE STORY OF FERDINAND.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Yeah, me too.
          Leigh Anne sees Michael left out, but interested.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Michael, your Mama ever read either
          one of those to you?
          He just stares at her, the answer obvious.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          No one ever...

          The Tuohy family exits and waits for the valet.

                         SEAN
          Now that was a good steak.

                         COLLINS
          Thanks, Daddy.

                         MICHAEL
          Thanks.

                         SEAN
          You're welcome.
          As the car pulls up everyone walks toward it except Michael
          who notices something else --
          AT THE SIDE DOOR: A BUSBOY steps outside for a smoke.
          Michael absently walks over.

          SEAN (CONT`D)
          Michael?...
          Leigh Anne touches Sean's arm, silencing him. They watch as --
          Michael greets the busboy. They stand a few feet apart
          talking. They nod at each other and after a few seconds --
          They hug.
          Leigh Ann is amazed. She's never seen affection in Michael.

          As they drive home.

                         LEIGH ANNE

          He's my brother.
          Complete silence in the car. Leigh Anne finally breaks it --

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Well, I'd like to meet him someday.
          Would that be okay with you?

                         MICHAEL
          I don't know where he stays.

          A strange sight. Leigh Anne, SJ and Michael all sit on
          Michael's huge futon as Leigh Anne reads THE STORY OF

                         LEIGH ANNE
          "...and his name was Ferdinand.
          All the other little bulls he lived
          with would run and jump and butt
          their heads together, but not

          next to him and kisses the back of his neck.

          Oh...

          You sent me these measurements for

          Leigh Anne sits at a table with her lunch buddies. They're

          I say just make it official and
          adopt him.
          Big laughs at the "crazy" idea.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          He'll be eighteen in a few months.
          (off their confusion)
          So, I mean it wouldn't make much
          sense to legally adopt him, right?
          They realize she's thought about it and stop laughing. After
          an awkward beat of silence...

          now, Elaine, and to make matters
          worse you were at the funeral. You

          At school. They're juvenile.

          And what do the juvenile kids say?

                         COLLINS
          It's really not worth repeating.
          And don't worry about SJ - he loves

          Collins is sitting with her friends, laughing and whispering.
          She notices Michael enter and walk to a table with a book.
          He sits alone while every other table is full.
          Collins sighs, makes up her mind and stands with her books.

          They are aghast when they see Collins set down her books
          across from Michael and sit.

          AT MICHAEL'S TABLE
          Michael is confused. She looks at him and shakes her head.

                         COLLINS
          Quit looking at me like that. I
          mean, we study together at home.
          Eyes in the library are on the pair as they start to read.

          in the nearby stands.
          Michael carries four blocking dummies to the center of the

          Michael is lined up at defensive tackle. The offense breaks
          the huddle and Michael just stands there. He notices the
          other defensive linemen get in a stance and kind of squats a
          bit. When the ball is snapped he just holds his hands out,
          keeping the blocker from getting close to his body.
          The running back races right past him and into the secondary.
          THE WHISTLE BLOWS and Cotton races up to Michael.

                         COTTON
          Okay, Mike, you fought off the
          block but you've got to shuck him
          and make the tackle. You got it?

          Michael gets down in a his stance and when the ball is
          snapped he gets under the blocker and lifts him up like WWF.
          The quarterback goes back to pass and sees Michael lumbering
          toward him with the lineman on his shoulders.
          The Quarterback's eyes go wide and he races out of the pocket
          and throws and incomplete pass. ANOTHER WHISTLE.

          Shuck the blocker, Mike!

          expecting you to be a star football
          player. You don't want to let them

          What about Dad and Mom?
          (off Michael's look)
          'Cause you see, in our family,
          everyone's an athlete. Dad was a
          basketball star, Collins plays
          volleyball and runs track. Me, as
          you know, I do it all and Mom,...
          well, Mom was a cheerleader, which
          doesn't exactly count but don't
          tell her I said that.

          SERIES OF SHOTS - DIFFERENT DAYS:
           SJ holds a blocking dummy and Michael fires out, hitting
          the dummy and sending Si flying.
           Michael does ten yard "back and forths" as Si times him.
           Michael does push ups as SJ lowers himself to count.
           Michael does crab crawls.
           WIDE - SJ runs Michael through his workout. He blows his
          whistle and Michael collapses on the ground - dead tired.

          Michael stands nearby.

          I hear "Mrs. Tuohy" I look over my
          shoulder for my mother--in-law. Call
          me Leigh Anne or Mama or almost
          anything else.

          Driver's license.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Why do you need a driver's license

          Leigh Anne and Michael sit across from a DMV EMPLOYEE typing
          on her computer. Leigh Anne holds out her driver's license.

          Is this his address as well?

                         LEIGH ANNE

          Someone we barely know.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          And that's another thing. We have
          to find out more about his past.

                         SEAN
          He won't talk about it. He's like
          an onion; you have to peel it a
          layer at a time.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Not if you use a knife. What if we
          sent him to a child psychologist?

          talk about his childhood like he's
          Woody Allen or something? Michael's
          gift is his ability to forget.
          He's mad at no one and doesn't
          really care what happened in the
          past.
          This puts her on her heels.

          I've been waiting for over an hour

                         RONALD
          There's very little on Michael.
          Most of his files have been lost.

          What is in there?

                         RONALD
          A few case notes.
          (holds one sheet up)
          This one describes an incident
          where officers forcibly removed
          Michael and six half-siblings from
          Denise Oher's care when Michael was
          seven. Quite a scene evidently.
          They had to split up the kids. And
          it's far from the worst.

                         RONALD
          At least a dozen, probably more.
          With her drug arrest record my
          guess would be she can't even
          remember.
          Leigh Anne absorbs this.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          We'd need her permission though,
          .right?

                         RONALD
          No. Michael is a ward of the
          state. Just apply and get a Judge
          to sign off on it.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          So you would give him away without
          even telling his mother?

          room. There are sleeping pallets on the floor and empty wine
          and beer bottles strewn around.

          DENISE OHER (O.S.)
          How is my boy, how's Big Mike?

                         LEIGH ANNE

                         (CALLS OUT)
          He's fine. He's doing well.
          (after a beat)
          When did you move from the other
          building?

           Denise emerges from the back of the apartment, adjusting a
          wig on her head, making herself "presentable."

                         DENISE OHER
          Awhile back. This is temporary.
          Friends let me stay here.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          When did you last see Michael?

                         DENISE OHER
          Iono. We might have some wine in
          the kitchen, if...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          No, no that's very kind but...

                         DENISE OHER
          How many foster kids you got living
          with you?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Oh, I'm not a foster parent to
          Michael. We were just helping him
          out.

                         DENISE OHER
          State don't pay you nothing?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          No.

                         DENISE OHER
          And he lives with you?
          (Leigh Anne nods)
          And you feed him?.

                         (ANOTHER NOD)
          Buy him clothes, too?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          When I can find them in his size.

                         DENISE OHER
          You a fine Christian lady.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I try to be.

                         DENISE OHER
          This is all real nice what you're
          doing, but don't be surprised if
          one day you wake up and he gone.

          What do you mean?

                         DENISE OHER
          He's a "runner". That's what the
          state called him after they took
          him from me.
          (off her look)
          Every foster home they sent him to,
          he'd slip out the window at night
          and come looking for me. No matter
          where I was that boy would come
          find me, take care of me.

                         (AN EXPLANATION)
          I've had some . health problems.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Mrs. Oher, was Michael born under a
          different name?
          Denise tries to remember. After a few seconds...

                         DENISE OHER
          Proctor. That was his Daddy's last
          name.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Where is he, the father, if you
          don't mind me asking?

                         DENISE OHER
          Ain't. seen him since he left.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          And when was that?

                         DENISE OHER
          Week after Mike was born.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Do you have Michael's birth
          certificate?
          Denise sighs, looks around at the mess, shakes her head. And
          then, unexpectedly, starts to cry softly.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          It's okay, Mrs. Oher.. I'll figure
          it out.
          Leigh Anne walks over, kneels and takes Denise's hands.

           LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          You'll always be Michael's Mama.
          Would you like to see him?

                         DENISE OHER
          No... Not this way.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          People lose birth certificates.
          It's nothing to be ashamed of.

                         DENISE OHER
          It's Williams.
          (off Leigh Anne's look)
          His last name's Williams. Couldn't
          even remember who the boy's father
          is.
          Leigh Anne bites her lip'and puts her arms around Denise, who
          hugs back.

          110 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 110

          The entire Tuohy family sits with Michael at the table.

                         SEAN
          Michael, we have something to ask
          you.

                         MICHAEL
          What?

                         SEAN
          Leigh. Anne and I would like to
          become your legal guardians.

                         MICHAEL
          What's that mean?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Well, what it means is, we want to
          know if you'd like to be a part of
          this family?
          Michael looks to a grinning SJ, to Collins who nods and
          smiles, then to Leigh Anne...

                         MICHAEL
          I kinda thought I already was.

          Leigh Anne feels a wave of emotion, nods to him, then races
          away to go and gather herself.

          Michael looks to Sean for an explanation. Sean shrugs
          can't explain her to you."

          111 A CAMERA FLASH (IN DMV OFFICE) 111

          112 EXT. TUOHY HOUSE - DAY

          Michael, blindfolded, is led outside by the entire family.
          When Leigh Anne pulls if off, Michael gasps at the sight of -
          A NEW TRUCK in the driveway.

                         SEAN
          Is that the one you wanted?
          He just stands there, staring. Sean hands him the keys.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          Well, hell, take it for a spin.
          (off Michael's look)
          Go on.

                         SI
          Can I go, too?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          okay, but Michael?...
          (off his look)
          Be careful.
          Michael smiles and he and SJ get inside the truck.

                         COLLINS
          He wanted a truck?!

                         SEAN
          Michael thinks he's a redneck.

           Students seated, including Michael, listen to Bob, who stands 
           at the front of the classroom. 

                         BOB
          You are now seniors.
          Congratulations. But with that 
          distinction comes responsibility.
          This will be one of your tougher
          courses because my job is to
          prepare you, at least most of you,
          for the rigors of college Freshman
          English. You are each holding a 
          class study guide which details
          assignments. I won't remind you
          what is due and when. Read the
          materials and come prepared. At
          the end of the year you will each
          choose one of our literature
          assignments and present a written
          dissection of the piece.
          The faces in the classroom tell us this is a tough course.

          Dozens of.condiment jars and bottles are lined up on the
          table. SJ has the football playbook open and is explaining
          formations to Michael.

                         SI
          See, you're the ketchup, here at
          Left Tackle. On the weakside.

                         MICHAEL
          I'm not that weak, SJ.

                         SI
          it just means there are more
          blockers on the other side. It's a
          compliment, really.

                         MICHAEL
          A compliment for a condiment.

                         SJ

          Good one.
          (back to work)
          So the first play is simple.
          "Gap." It just means you block
          whoever is in front of you, or the
          person on your inside shoulder if
          you're not covered by a defender.
          (points to condiments)
          I'll be the running back and you
          show me what you're supposed to do.
          Ready... . Hike!
          SJ, using both hands, moves Cayenne pepper back a bit, then
          "hands off" to Cinnamon who "runs" toward Michael (Ketchup).
          Michael moves the bottle forward, pushing back Mustard, then
          Relish, as well as toppling a bottle of Vanilla Extract.

          A massive traffic jam. Leigh Anne pulls her car right onto

           LEIGH ANNE AND PARAMEDIC - MINUTES LATER

                          
           While the paramedics attend to an obviously fine SJ, Leigh 
           Anne and a FIREMAN eye the deflated airbag.

                          

                         FIREMAN
          An airbag deploys at 200 miles per
          hour. Your son's too small to sit
          in the front seat.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          He's okay, though, right?

                          

                         FIREMAN
          Busted lip, some facial bruising.

                          
          When an airbag strikes a child his
          size it usually means a fractured
          face, a broken neck or worse. It's
          almost like the airbag started at
          him then changed direction.
          Defective or something. Very, very
          lucky.
          Leigh Anne nods thanks and looks to Michael, still on the
          curb, eyes on the ground. She walks over, kneels down.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Michael, it wasn't your fault. It
          could have happened to anybody..
          He doesn't look up. She almost gasps when she notices --
          HIS ARM - red, bleeding, a large burn from the wrist all the
          way up to the sleeve, which is also singed.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Michael, your arm... what happened?
          He looks up and into her eyes...

                         MICHAEL
          I stopped it.

           SJ sits in the stands videotaping -- [NOTE: We integrate SJ's
          video with live action].
          ON THE FIELD: Michael skips to the line and gets down in his 
          stance. On the snap Michael pushes the tackle, JAY COLLIS,
          who rolls, gets by Michael and makes the tackle.

                         SI
          Michael does better when he can see
          what he's supposed to be doing.

          ON THE FIELD
          The quarterback drops back to pass. Michael backpedals. When
          the Defender tries. to go around him, Michael grabs him.with
          one big paw and throws him to the ground. A WHISTLE BLOWS.

                         COTTON
          Holding - left tackle!
          He gets right in Michael's face, grabs his jersey.

                         COTTON (CONT'D)
          You can only grab in here -- at the
          tits, you got it?! You grab out
          here or here, we're gonna get
          flagged and I'm gonna get pissed.
          Leigh Anne grimaces, shakes her head.

                         NEXT PLAY
          At the snap of the ball Michael tries to pass protect, pushes
          the Defender who tries left, right, then slides past Michael
          and sacks the quarterback.

                         COTTON (CONT'D)

          Well at least he'll look good
          coming off the bus. The other team

          You can thank me later.
          Bert just watches as Leigh Anne walks straight to the huddle
          and pulls Michael aside. The other players turn to watch.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Do you remember just after we met,
          and we went to that horrible part
          of town to buy you those dreadful
          clothes?

                         (HE NODS)
          And I was a little scared and you
          told me not to worry, that you had
          my back?. Do you remember that?

                         MICHAEL
          Yes ma'am.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          If anyone tried to get to me you
          would have stopped them, right?

                         (HE NODS)
          And when you and Si were in that
          car wreck, what did you do to that
          airbag?

                         MICHAEL
          I stopped it.
          Leigh Anne points to the offense.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          This team is your family. And you
          have to protect them --
          (points to defense)
          --from those guys.
          She walks over and grabs the QB, pulls him out.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Tony is your quarterback. You
          protect his blindside.

          She grabs BOBBY, a short stump of a running back.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          oomaloompah here is your tailback.
          When you look at him think of SJ
          and how you'd never let anything or
          anyone hurt him. Do you understand
          me?

                         MICHAEL
          What about Mr. Tuohy and Collins?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I suppose they can be on the team,
          too. Are you going to protect the
          family, Michael?

                          
          He nods. She nods back and walks away, past Bert Cotton.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Yelling at him won't help. He
          doesn't trust men. In his
          experience they pretend to care
          about you 'til they disappear.
          Cotton chuckles.. She walks over and sits next to SJ, who has
          the video camera in his lap.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          You're gonna wanna get this.

          INTERCUT VIDEO AND LIVE ACTION:
           At the snap Michael drives the defender into the dirt.
           Michael drops back, knocks down one defender, then takes
          on another while Tony completes a pass.
           On a sweep to his side, Michael pushes three defenders
          away, clearing an alley for Bobby to blast through.

                         COTTON
          On the schedule it says this is a
          home game but don't be deceived,
          gentlemen. Three fourths of the
          people in the stands are here from
          Milford. They'll be loud and rowdy
          and a lot of 'em drunk. Keep your
          helmets on 'til you're on the
          sidelines. I don't want anyone
          getting beaned with a whiskey
          bottle.

          Oh, one more thing. The reason

          As the Wingate Crusaders exit the dressing room they find
          themselves next to the Milford Lions ready to take the field.
          The cocky Milford players eye the Crusaders.

          Hey, Crusaders, y'all gonna turn

          Coach Cotton raises a hand and the team moves forward to

          Milford fans look down and jeer, toss sodas at them.

          The ball is kicked off and Bobby, the Crusaders tailback
          takes it in at the five yard line. He makes one player miss
          then is dragged down by a swarm of defenders at the twenty.

                         COTTON
          Let's go 0!
           The offense runs onto the field and huddles. The Milford
           defense waits, slapping each other and building to a frenzy.
          Number 66 from before is the defensive end on Michael's side.
          Wingate breaks huddle and #66 sees him.

          Wingate breaks huddle and as they get into their stances #66
          calls a switch. He moves inside and the linebacker moves
          outside. Michael looks at the move, confused.

                          
          Hut! Tony, the Wingate QB starts to drop back but hands off
          the ball on a draw to BOBBY, the Oompaloompah.
          Michael, unsure which player to block, just stands there
          while they both crush Bobby.
          The Milford players high five and both give Michael a
          shoulder as they pass him.

          NEXT PLAY - BALL SNAPS
          Michael hits #66 square in the numbers, putting him on his
          heels. But he's quick as a cat and jumps to bat down a pass.

          The crusaders offense leaves the field. #66 follows behind
          Michael, taunting him.

          66 laughs and struts away. Cotton goes straight to the ref.

          Cotton takes a deep breath, then turns to Michael, who has
          been beside him the whole time.

                         COTTON
          Look, son, 66 is quick, so just
          focus on his belt buckle.

          ON THE FIELD
          The Crusaders have the ball at the twenty. They break from
          the huddle, get over the ball and the play starts. It's a
          sweep left and Michael pulls to lead for Bobby. 66 fends off
          Michael and keeps moving, forcing a pileup near the sideline.
          Michael and Bobby are at the bottom of the pile.
          66 extricates himself from the pile and gives Michael a
          little kick as a cherry on top.

           forward. We've never seen him so quick, neither has 66 who
           dips a hip to keep from being plowed over. The ploy rights
          66 but the damage isn't over as Michael now has him "in the
           fit" grabbing his jersey, "between the tits." --
          Bobby races through the hole and into the secondary --
          Michael keeps pushing 66 back, picking up speed until 66 is
          airborne save every third step of Michael's when he touches a
          toe to the ground like a ballerina --
          Bobby cuts to the sideline --
          Michael is running full speed with 66 now and he keeps going

          Michael chucks 66 into the air. 66 hits the fence hard and
           lands in a heap. Michael turns and walks back to the field.

          Michael looks at him and 66's eyes go straight to the dirt.

          Leigh Anne arrives to see a group of coaches, all wearing
          shirts and hats emblazoned with school logos. They chat and
          watch as the Wingate football team finishes calisthenics.
          One ASSISTANT COACH, from. Southern Miss, sees Fulmer racing
          up.

          SOUTHERN MISS COACH
          Shoot, man, Fulmer's here. I might
          as well go home.
          Fulmer smiles at the assembled coaches, shakes a few-hands.

          Drove all the way from Knoxville to
          come see for myself.

          Bert cotton walks over, shakes Fulmer's hand, leaving the
          other coaches shaking their heads.

          Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor.

                         FULMER
          Coach Cotton I been keeping an eye
          on your program. Y'all doing a
          fine job down here. Wouldn't be a
          bit surprised to see you coaching
          at the next level real soon.
          Cotton's smile tells us he'd like that a lot.

          Is that him? Is that O'Hair?

          An Equipment manager lays out a plank and Jay Collis sighs
          and lines up, one foot on either side of the board. Michael
          slowly moves into position opposite him.
          The coaches all inch closer and crane their necks to see.
          Leigh Anne is now right in the middle of them. Fulmer gives
          her a look that says,,"Who the hell are you?"
          Cotton blows his whistle, Michael fires out and it's over in

          The coaches are frozen - as if they've witnessed a miracle.

          Then, all at once, the coaches pull out their cell phones and
          start poking digits and jabbering: "You won't believe it!"
          "You gotta see this!" "He's a freak of nature!"
          The Clemson coach strides away.

          Did you know that to be eligible
          for a Division One scholarship
          Michael's gonna need a 2.5 GPA?

                         SEAN
          Really?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          His ACT is low and I don't see him
          doing any better if he retakes it.

                         SEAN
          What's his GPA now?

                         LEIGH ANNE

          1.76.

                         SEAN
          Not bad really, when you consider
          where he started.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          He needs to make A's this year.
          (off Sean's laugh)
          I'm serious. And that might not
          even be enough.

                         SEAN
          So he goes to Junior College.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Most inner city kids that go to JC
          drop out in a year. His shot at
          the pros would go out the window.

          They won't recruit until they hire

          matters unless he makes his grades.

          must be SJ. I hear you have quite
          a jump shot, young man.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Nick, why don't you and Michael go
          into the living room to talk.

                         MICHAEL
          Can SJ come?

          Absolutely. I'll recruit the both
          of you.
          As they walk away, Collins approaches...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I find him extremely handsome.

          Michael and SJ sit across from Saban.

                         SABAN
          So, as soon as possible we'd like
          to get you down to Baton Rouge.
          We've got a great thing going,
          Michael and we plan on winning a
          bunch more National Championships.
          Whattaya' say, will you commit to a
          visit?
          Michael turns to SJ, who raises his hand.

                         SI
          Can I ask a question?

                         SABAN
          Sure.

                         SJ
          My brother and me are very close.
          I'm worried that if he goes off to
          school I won't see him so...

                         SABAN
          Go on.

                         SI
          I guess I was just wondering how
          much access I'd have to him.
          Saban smiles at the kid's moxie.

                         SABAN
          Tell you what, SJ. Michael comes
          to LSU I'll get you an all-access
          pass. How's that sound?

                         SJ
          Sounds good.

          Have you decided yet, Michael?

          No, Miss Sue.

                         MISS SUE
          But you like Tennessee?
          (off his nod)
          It's a good school. Not at the
          academic level of Ole Miss but they
          do have an outstanding science
          department. You know one of the
          things they're famous for?
          (he shakes his head)
          They work with the FBI to study the
          effects of the soil on decomposing
          body parts.
          Michael is a bit lost.

          MISS SUE (CONT'D)
          When they find a body the police
          want to know how long they've been
          dead. The fine department at
          Tennessee helps them. They have
          lots of body parts - arms, legs,
          hands - from hospitals and medical
          schools. Do you know where they
          store them?
          (Michael shakes his head)
          Right underneath the football
          field.
          Michael's eyes widen a bit.

          MISS SUE (CONT'D)
          So, while it's fine and dandy to
          have 100,000 fans cheering for you,
          the bodies you should be worried
          about are right underneath the
          turf. Set to poke up through the
          ground and grab you.
          She raises a clawed hand (think "CARRIE") to make her point.
          Michael is completely freaked out by this.

          MISS SUE (CONT'D)
          But it's your decision where you
          play football. Don't let me
          influence you.

          Congrats on gettin' hired, Coach.

                         ED ORGERON
          Thank yew, Ma'am. Ole Miss is my
          dream job.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Coach 0, you're coming a little
          late to the party but we're diehard
          Rebels so I'm gonna give you a
          frickin' road map, okay?

                         ED ORGERON
          Yes 'm.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          LSU is out. Everybody knows
          Saban's going to the NFL. So when
          he comes for his visit to Ole Miss,
          don't take him to some titty bar
          and give him tequila shots. He'll
          have nightmares for weeks. Feed
          him Italian - he likes Fettucine
          Alfredo - take him to a movie - but
          not Chainsaw massacre because he'll
          just cover his eyes - and put him
          to bed by ten. You got it?

                         ED ORGERON
          Yes'm. What about Tennessee?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          It breaks my heart but they're
          still in the hunt. Fulmer offered
          SJ a sweet deal.

          aroun' you. Make your parents

          ED ORGERON (CONT'D)
          And for you, Si, here's what I can
          do. At Ole Miss we have The Grove
          by the stadium. And the team walks
          it before the game, surrounded by
          thousands of fans. It's a sacred
          ritual. And I'm in front.

                         SI
          ("that's it?")
          Seen it a thousand times.

                         ED ORGERON
          Ever seen it from the front of the
          line? Next year, you and me --
          leading the team.

                         SI
          Tennessee offered to let me run on
          the field and flip the coin.

                         ED ORGERON
          I'll throw in a sideline pass.

          Right now Michael's doing C minus,
          D plus work. His best chance at
          improving is with the written essay
          at the end of the year. It counts
          for a third of his grade.

          Miss Sue works with Michael at the table.

                         MISS SUE
          Why not write about "Great
          Expectations"? You're a lot like
          Pip. He was poor, an orphan and
          someone sort of found him. You
          should be able to relate to that.
          Michael shrugs. Sean is nearby, watching NBA basketball.

          MISS SUE (CONT'D)
          Fine, let's go through the reading
          list. But you have to pick one,
          Michael.
          (reading from list)
          "Pygmalion"... "A Tale of Two
          Cities"... "The Charge of the
          Light Brigade"...

                         SEAN

                         SEAN
          "All in the valley of Death rode
          the six hundred". They call LSU's
          stadium Death Valley because of
          this story. Alfred, Lord Tennyson
          is writing about Ole Miss-LSU.

                         MICHAEL
          You're kidding?

                         SEAN
          No. It's a great story.

                         MISS SUE
          It's a poem.

                         SEAN
          "Forward the Light Brigade!"
          That's like the offense. "Charge

          end zone. "Into the Valley of
          Death rode the six hundred."

          Yeah.

                         MICHAEL
          That's really, really sad.

                         SEAN
          I think you just found something to
          write about.
          Michael opens his notebook, picks up a pen.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          Courage is a hard thing to figure.
          You can have courage based on a
          dumb idea or a mistake, but you're
          not supposed to question adults, or
          your coach, or your teacher because
          they make the rules. Maybe they
          know best but maybe they don't.

          SERIES OF REPEATED SHOTS:

          168 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - REPEATED SHOT - DAY 168

          Michael moves through the tough crowd.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          It all depends on who you are,
          where you come from. Didn't at
          least one of the six hundred guys
          think about giving up and joining
          with the other side? I mean,
          Valley of Death, that's pretty
          salty stuff.

          169 EXT. WINGATE - REPEATED SHOT - DAY 169 

          Michael walks under the arch for the first time.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          That's why courage is tricky.
          Should you always do what others
          tell you to do? Sometimes you
          might not even know why you're
          doing something. I mean, any fool
          can have courage.

          170 INT. LAUNDROMAT - REPEATED SHOT - NIGHT 170

          Michael leans against the wall and tries to sleep.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          But honor, that's the real reason
          you either do something or you
          don't. It's who you are and maybe
          who you want to be. If you die
          trying for something important then
          you have both honor and courage and
          that's pretty good.

          171 INT. WINGATE - BOB'S LITERATURE CLASS - DAY 171 

          Bob sits at his desk, reading Michael's. essay. As he turns
          to the last page...

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          I think that's what the writer was
          saying. That you should try for
          courage and hope for honor. And
          maybe even pray that the people
          telling you what. to do have some,
          too.
          Bob, visibly moved, sets down the essay and smiles.

          Graduation day and Sean sits beside an empty seat in the

          aisle, a big smile on her face. she pushes down the row and

                          
          plops down in the seat next to him.

                         SEAN

          Michael's final GPA. Got it off
          Paul's computer. He did it, Sean.
          He did it!

                          
          Sean grins, then...

                         SEAN

          Even though no one is supposed to clap, a spontaneous round
          of APPLAUSE gives Michael pause as he accepts his diploma.

                          
          Projected behind him is a picture of the cutest African-

          Michael?

          close, looks him in the eye. 

                         SEAN
          I want you to know something.
          You'n me, okay?

                         (BEAT)
          I never believed you could do this.
          But you did. And I'm as proud of
          you as I am ashamed of myself. I
          should know better. I'll never
          doubt you again, Michael.
          Michael smiles, nods, gives Leigh Anne a little hug then raps 
          knuckles with Si and high fives Collins.

          You'll be living in Deaton Hall --
          here. You'll have a meal plan and
          you'll go to Johnson commons to
          eat.

          Johnson Commons has all you can eat
          self-serve ice cream.

                         MICHAEL
          As much as you want?

                         SEAN
          Yep, that's how Mama put on her
          freshman ten.
          Leigh Anne rolls up a pamphlet and whacks him hard on her way
          to answer a RINGING PHONE.

                         LEIGH ANNE
           Hello... This is Mrs. Tuohy...
           As she listens she gives Sean a look - "This isn't good".

          They just want to ask you a few

          hide, Michael.

          Sits Investigator Granger in the room we've seen before. She
          rises, professional, but not smiling.

                         GRANGER
          Mrs. Tuohy? Mr. Oher? My name is
          Jocelyn Granger and I'm the
          Assistant Director of Enforcement
          for the NCAA.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Please call me Leigh Anne.
          Leigh Anne shakes her hand and she and Michael move to the
          chairs.

                         GRANGER
          Mrs. Tuohy, I'd prefer to speak
          with Michael alone.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          How long will this take?

                         GRANGER
          Awhile.
          Michael starts rubbing his knees, nervous as hell.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Michael, I'll be outside.
          Leigh Anne pecks his cheek and exits, giving Michael one last
          look before she leaves.

          186 EXT. BUILDING - DAY 186

          Leigh Anne sits on a bench, talking on the phone.

          I've got a bad feeling about this,
          Sean. This broad is tough. Oh,.
          Susie's on the other line.

                         (CLICKS OVER)
          Hey... . what does the client
          want?... But that's tacky... You
          know what, fine, if she wants her
          living room to look like a bordello
          make it happen.
          She hangs up, checks her watch and looks toward the building.

          Your parents are friends with Coach
          Bert Cotton, correct?

                         MICHAEL
          Coach is a good guy.

                         GRANGER
          Were you aware that Coach Cotton is
          accepting a job at Ole Miss?
          (Michael shakes his head)
          And that this job offer came after
          you signed with them?
          (no response from Michael)
          Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian
          went to Ole Miss.

                         MICHAEL
          He played basketball.

                         GRANGER
          And Mrs. Tuohy attended Ole Miss as
          well.

                         MICHAEL
          She was a cheerleader.

                         GRANGER
          Is it safe to say that Ole Miss is
          their favorite school?

                         (MICHAEL NODS)
          Do they like any other
          Universities?

                         (MICHAEL SHRUGS)
          What about, say Tennessee?

                         MICHAEL
          They can't stand Tennessee.

                         GRANGER
          So they wouldn't be happy if you
          chose to play football there?

                         MICHAEL
          No.

                         GRANGER

          Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.

                         (MICHAEL NODS)
          Did Miss Sue try to persuade you to
          attend Ole Miss?

                         (MICHAEL NODS)
          Did you know that the Tuohys make
          generous donations to Ole Miss?
          That even Miss Sue makes donations?
          That the:Tuohy's have a condo in
          Oxford so they can attend as many
          athletic events as possible? That,
          in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy
          are by our definition "boosters."

                         MICHAEL
          What's that mean?

                         GRANGER
          A booster is someone with an
          abnormal interest in a school's
          sports. Someone who-contributes
          financially to the University's
          athletic program.
          Michael doesn't answer, just keeps rubbing his knees. Then
          comes the part we've heard before...'

          a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in.
          She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him
          out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window,
          rubs his knees some more.

          It's the first time we've ever heard Michael raise his voice.
          It echoes in the room. Granger lets it die before she leans

          that boosters from lots of schools
          in the south will become legal
          guardians for young athletes
          without means and funnel them to
          their Alma Maters.
          Michael still doesn't get it, shakes his head.

                         GRANGER (CONT'D)
          I'm not saying I believe it and I'm
          not saying I don't, but there are
          many people involved with this case
          who would argue that the Tuohys
          took you in, fed you, clothed you,
          paid for your private education --

                         MICHAEL
          (almost to himself)
          No...no...no...

                         GRANGER
          -- bought you a car and paid for a
          tutor all as part of a plan to
          insure that you played football for
          the University of Mississippi.
          Now Michael understands. He stares at the floor for a long
          time then quickly stands and makes for the door.

                         GRANGER (CONT'D)
          Michael, we're not finished.
          But he's gone.

          188 EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY 188

          Leigh Anne sees Michael exit the building. Once he's outside
          he moves in circles, gesticulating and talking to himself.
          Leigh Anne races over --

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Michael, what's wrong?
          He looks at her, glares really; upset.

                         MICHAEL
          Why'd you do it?

           What?

                         MICHAEL
          All along you wanted me to go to
          Ole Miss.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Well, of course, but...

                         MICHAEL
          Why did you do this for me?!

                         LEIGH ANNE
          What?

                         MICHAEL
          Everything! Was it for you or was
          it for me? Was it so I would go to
          school where you wanted?! Was it
          so I would do what you wanted?!

                         LEIGH ANNE
          No, Michael...

                         MICHAEL
          (points to building)
          That's what she thinks! Is she
          right?!
          (her own words)
          Don't you dare lie to me!
          Leigh Anne digests this, takes a breath...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Michael, look... I can see where,
          where some people might...
          Her inability, for the first time, to articulate, hits
          Michael in the face.

                         MICHAEL
          I'm not stupid!
          He turns and walks away.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Michael?!
          But she doesn't move, just watches him go.

          Well if he comes by there let me

          Text him SJ.

                         SEAN
          Keep it light. Tell him you're
          gonna take his truck for a spin if
          he doesn't get in touch.
          SJ starts texting. Leigh Anne and Sean stare at each other.

          Sean sits in bed and Leigh Anne paces.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I should have followed him.

                         SEAN
          You had no way of knowing he'd
          disappear.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Was he right?
          (off Sean's look)
          What he said about us?

                         SEAN
          Leigh Anne, be sensible. We gave
          clothes to a boy who had one pair
          of shorts. We gave him a bed. To
          hell with the NCAA, I'd do it again
          tomorrow.

          What about the rest of it - all the
          stuff we did to make sure he got a
          scholarship? A scholarship to Ole
          Miss.

                         SEAN
          He could go wherever he wanted, he
          knew that.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Did he? Did you ask him? 'Cause I
          know for sure I never did.
          Sean considers this, then beckons.

                         SEAN
          Come here, honey.
          She moves to him. He puts his arm around her, kisses her
          forehead.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Am I a good person?
          (off his look)
          Not a joke. Not rhetorical.

                         SEAN
          You're the best person I know.
          Everything you do, you do for
          others.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Why is that?

                         SEAN
          (with a smile)
          I have not a clue. You obviously
          get some sick satisfaction from it.
          She looks at him. There's truth in his words.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Sean... what if he never comes
          back?

          191 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - NIGHT 191

          Michael makes his way toward Building "C", passing some of
          the same faces we've seen before.

                         ALTON
          That you Big Mike? Get your ass in
          here.

                         MICHAEL
          I'm looking for Moms.

                         ALTON
          Your Mama? Oh, I seen Dee Dee
          around. She usually stop by for a
          taste around this time. Tell you
          what, I'll get you a forty and
          we'll chop it up 'til she get here.

          193 INT. HURT VILLAGE - ALTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 193

          Shitty but with good electronics. There are maybe eight
          people in the apartment - partying, drinking, getting high.
          Michael steps inside. Alton points to a chair. A stoned out
          couple smokes on the adjacent couch.
          Next to them an INFANT cries in a broken down crib. In the
          other corner of the room sits David, the young man we met
          before. Michael nods and David nods back. Alton hands
          Michael a beer.

                         ALTON
          It's good to see you, Big Mike.
          You lookin' fit. I heard you
          playin' some ball.

                         MICHAEL
          Yeah.

                         ALTON
          But you know that rich kid football
          ain't like the public school
          league. People packing knives in
          their socks. Back in the day I was
          a quarterback. You knew that,
          right? At MLK.

          You still playing ball over at the

          JC?

          Naw.

          He with me now! I'll open a spot
          for you, too.

                         DAVID
          Got tired of going to class. Always
          somebody tellin' me what to do.

                         ALTON
          Turn it up, bitch!
          David jumps up and cranks the volume on a RAP SONG until the
          beat is bouncing off the walls. Michael sips the beer; rubs
          his knees.

                         ALTON (CONT'D)
          You stayin' to the other side of
          town, that's what Dee Dee said.
          Said you got a new Mama. She fine,
          too. I seen her when she come to
          see Dee Dee.

                         MICHAEL
          She came here?

                         ALTON
          She got any other kids? She got a
          daughter?

                         (MICHAEL NODS)
          You tap that?
          Michael sets down the beer, rises to leave.

                         ALTON (CONT'D)
          Where you going? Sit down. I
          wanna hear about your fine white
          sister. 'Cause I like me some
          mommy/daughter.

          Michael shoves him hard. Alton unprepared for the force,
          flies back against the wall. On the ground he reaches in his
          belt for his gun, but just as he gets it out --
          Michael slaps it away. He picks up Alton and throws him
          across the room. The party comes unhinged as Michael grabs
          Alton, holds him against the wall with one hand while
          pounding him with the other. Blood flies from Alton's face -
          eighteen years of subdued rage coming out in seconds.
          TWO OTHER GUYS grab Michael from behind and one --

          STICKS A GUN IN MICHAEL'S TEMPLE
          Michael screams like a banshee, spins, grabs them and tackles
          them over the couch. An errant round FIRES into the ceiling.
          A table flies and the crib smashes.
          Michael looks to David, frozen in the corner, then over to
          the SCREAMING child on the floor.
          He grabs his head and heaves, trying to make it all stop -
          the music, the screams, the crying. The shots PULSE to the
          music and. are INTERCUT WITH:

          But you tell him I'll be seeing him
          around. You tell him he'll get his.

          get me?

          202 EXT. CURB - DAY 202

          Leigh Anne sits on the curb with Michael.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I'd imagine the last thing anybody
          at Hurt Village wants is cops
          snooping around.
          (after a beat)
          I swore I'd never ask but... how'd 
          you make it out of there, Michael? 

                         MICHAEL
          When I was little and something
          awful was happening, my Mama would
          tell me to close my eyes.

          She was tryin' to keep me from
          seeing her do drugs or other bad
          things. And she'd say, "keep 'em
          closed till I say so." And then
          when she was finished or the bad
          things were over she'd say, "now
          when I count to three, you open
          your eyes and the past is gone, the
          world is a good place, and it's all
          gonna be okay."

                         LEIGH ANNE 
          You closed your eyes. 
          He nods. She shakes her head, amazed at the kid. They stare 
          out at the street, then...

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          You know, when I was driving all
          over Kingdom Come looking for you I
          just kept thinking about one thing.

                         (BEAT)
          Ferdinand the bull. Everyone
          assumed because he was big that he
          wanted to fight in the ring. But
          he just wanted to sit under a tree
          and smell the flowers.
          (right at him)
          I know I should have asked this a
          long time ago but do you even wanna
          play football? I mean, do you even
          like it?'
          Michael considers this. 

                         MICHAEL
          I'm pretty good at it.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Yeah, you are.

                         (A BEAT)
          Sean and I have been talking and
          Michael, if you're gonna accept a
          football scholarship we think it
          should be from Tennessee.
          (off his look)
          And I promise you I will be at
          every game cheering for you.

                         MICHAEL
          Every game?

                         (CONTINUED)

          But I will not wear that gaudy
          orange of theirs because it's not
          in my color wheel.

                         MICHAEL
          You want me to go to Tennessee?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I want you to go wherever you want.
          It's your decision, Michael. It's
          your life.

                         MICHAEL 
          What if I wanted to flip burgers? 
          She takes this in, swallows hard and 

                         LEIGH ANNE 
          Your decision; your life.
          Michael smiles. 

                         MICHAEL
          Okay.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Okay, what?

          203 INT. NONDESCRIPT GOVERNMENT-LOOKING ROOM - DAY 203

           Michael is at another session with Jocelyn Granger. 

                         MICHAEL
          I'm sorry I left the other day.

                         GRANGER
          You were pretty upset.

                         MICHAEL
          You ask a lot of questions.

                         GRANGER
          I'm trying to get to the bottom of
          this.

                         MICHAEL
          But all the questions you asked
          were about why everybody else
          wanted me to go to Ole Miss.

          Okay...

                         MICHAEL
          You asked about everybody but me.
          You never asked why I wanted to go
          there.

                         GRANGER
          Alright, fine, Michael... why do
          you want to go to Ole Miss?

                         MICHAEL
          It's where my family goes to
          school. It's where they've always
          gone to school.
          Granger considers this, stares at Michael, then almost, just
          almost, smiles.

          Cars are unloaded as parents and siblings move their kids
          into the dorm. Tearful good-byes and lots of picture taking.
          Leigh Anne and.Sean walk from the dorm toward the car, giving
          last words of advice. SJ and.Collins are there, too. 

                         LEIGH ANNE
          College is going to be a different
          experience for you. There are lots
          of distractions.

                         SEAN
          Just have fun.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          There'll always be some nimrod in
          the dorm who wants to play video
          games all night, or goof off on the
          internet.

                         SEAN
          You're gonna have a great time. I
          know I did.

          You'll spend lots of time at
          practice which means you have to be
          very dedicated to your studies.

          MISS SUE (O.S.)
          Relax, Mama.
          Miss Sue walks up carrying papers.

          MISS SUE (CONT'D)
          Just got back from the library
          where I reserved a private cubicle
          for the semester.
          (hands sheets to Michael)
          Here's your class schedule and our
          study hall hours.
          She reaches in her purse for her keys.

          MISS SUE (CONT'D)
          Now, if y'all don't mind I'm gonna
          go move into my new apartment. 
          She walks away.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Thank you, Miss Sue.

          Leigh Anne notices their looks.

          Michael Oher, you listen to me. I
          want you to enjoy yourself but you
          need to know that if you get a girl
          pregnant out of wedlock I will
          climb in the car, drive here to
          Oxford and cut off your penis.

                         SI

          Leigh Anne gives Sean a look that says, "let's get on the
          road." Sean offers a hand; Michael shakes it. Collins high
          fives him. SJ offers a fist; Michael knocks it.
          Leigh Anne, tearing up, nods and gives Michael a quick hug.

          Thank you, Mama.
          Overwhelmed, she turns for the car with a little wave.

          The 78'll be a parking lot. We
          should go.
          She gets inside and closes the door for privacy.
          Sean, SJ, Collins and Michael stand there, watching her cry.

                         MICHAEL
          Why does she always do that?

                         SEAN
          She's an onion, Michael. You have
          to peel her one layer at a time.
          Michael walks over to the car, knocks on the window. She
          rolls it down, dabbing tears from her eyes.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          What?
