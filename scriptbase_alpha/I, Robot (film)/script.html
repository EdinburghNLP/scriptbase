<b>                              I, ROBOT
</b><b>                           
</b>                                 by

                            Hillary Seitz



<b>
</b><b>    FADE IN:
</b>
1   On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.                                       1

    A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
    Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...

    A SOUND.   Something SHATTERING...

    Then. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We can't quite make out
    What it's saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we
    finally. Understand...

<b>                         DISEMBODIED VOICE
</b>               You are in danger...

<b>                                               CUT TO:
</b>
<b>2   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CLOSE ON                                2
</b>
    DEL SPOONER'S FACE.    His eyes, snapping open.   His face,
    covered in sweat.

    PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around
    his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly
    cheerful.

    Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT
    ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a
    couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.

    You are in danger...

    He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His
    apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of
    someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.

<b>3   INT. SHOWER - MORNING                                              3
</b>
    Spooner turns his face into the jet of water.

<b>4   INT. BATHROOM - MORNING                                            4
</b>
    Shaves with a razor.    Using his left hand.   Knicks the cleft
    of his chin. Shit.

<b>5   INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                             5
</b>
    Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan.      Waiting for it
    to boil.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             2.
</b>

<b>6   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                          6
</b>
    Heads down the hallway. Looping a knotted tie around his
    neck. Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches
    for the handle. Takes a deep breath and...

<b>7   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                  7
</b>
    ...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the
    elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.

    Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His
    shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He
    turns and sees...

    A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still
    obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering
    hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up
    with a muted WHIR...

<b>                         ROBOT
</b>                   (metallic voice)
               Good day, sir...

    Spooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to
    lose the robot.

    We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment
    buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.
    PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting
    portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:

    Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building
    cleaning windows.

    A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently
    repairs the street. No human supervision.

    A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.
    Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...

    Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.
    Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.
    Briefcases.

    Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE.

    Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.
    Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's
    neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.

<b>                         LITTLE GIRL
</b>               Hi.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              3.
</b>

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>               Hi.

    But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.    The
    robot turns. Looks at the girl.

<b>                         ROBOT
</b>               You are not allowed to talk to
               strangers.

    Spooner, disgusted.   Has had enough.   He steps off the curb
    Just as...

    THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.   Training its large
    digital EYE on him:

<b>                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
</b>               Please return to the sidewalk.

    Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.

<b>                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
</b>               Please return to the sidewalk...

    The traffic signal, tracking him.

<b>                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
</b>               You are in violation of city
               ordinance 14-B726...

    Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as
    SNAP! It takes his picture.

<b>                                                CUT TO:
</b>
<b>8   EXT./INT. MONORAIL - MORNING                                    8
</b>
    Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN. Looks
    down at his feet. A trampled flyer on the ground. From the
    Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED!
    A Robot gets up. To offer him his seat. Spooner. Turns his
    back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...

<b>9   EXT. CITY SCAPE/MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                           9
</b>
    The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN. Soaring, gravity-defying
    OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings
    wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel
    shields.

    As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to
    disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.
    The "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             4.
</b>

<b>10   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - PLAZA - MORNING                            10
</b>
     Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging
     Police Headquarters. Modern additions have been made to the
     original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.

<b>11   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - MORNING                    11
</b>
     A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series
     of glass-enclosed rooms. On the other side a GIANT SCREEN
     with real time video of various streets and buildings.

     Spooner arrives at his desk. Unlike the others, it's a mess.
     A slender computer screen curving along the front of it.
     Several electronic messages say the same thing:

<b>                             SEE ME!
</b>
<b>                          LT. BERGIN (O.S.)
</b>                Ever heard the phrase "lead by
                example?"

     Spooner looks up. LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of
     his desk, holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner
     giving that traffic signal the finger.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Doesn't ring a bell.

<b>                          LT. BERGIN
</b>                    (pointing to Spooner's
                     badge)
                It's on your badge.

     Spooner takes the citation.   Drops it into a drawer filled
     with about fifty others.

<b>                          LT. BERGIN
</b>                The traffic division filed an
                official complaint this morning.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                The traffic division is a machine.

<b>                          LT. BERGIN
</b>                Look, I know there's going to be an
                adjustment period, Del...

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                    (interrupting)
                I'll send them a letter of apology.
                Maybe some flowers. A box of
                chocolates...
<b>
</b><b>                                                               5.
</b>

     JUST THEN Spooner's phone RINGS.   He throws Bergin a look.
     Then snatches up the receiver.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Spooner, homicide.

<b>                                                 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>12   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - ESTABLISHING - DAY                        12
</b>
     A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city
     blocks. The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and
<b>     ROBOTS.
</b>
<b>13   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                      13
</b>
     An elevator opens with a whoosh. Spooner steps out into a
     featureless corridor. His footsteps, echoing. He stops at a
     set of OPPOSING DOORS. Looks over at one, when the other
     suddenly OPENS.

<b>14   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS        14
</b>
     A warm, mahogany-paneled room. In sharp contrast to the cold
     metal space outside. Spooner steps inside. At the end of a
     long conference table sits an OLD MAN. Sparkling blue eyes.
     Old-fashioned suit.

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>                Hello, there. Please come in.

     Spooner hesitates.

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>                It's alright. You can sit.     Sit.

     Spooner doesn't.   Looks around the room. The Old Man lifts
     up a coffee pot.   Pours some coffee into a single cup.

<b>                          OLD MAN

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                    (interested)
                You're offering me a cup of coffee?

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>                Yes. But you are to say, "No,
                thank you."

     Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his
     lips, but doesn't take a sip.

</b><b>                                                       6.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>           No.    Thank you.

<b>                     OLD MAN
</b>           As you wish.

The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no
movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee
pot.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           You want to tell me something about
           Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death?

The Old Man smiles.

<b>                     OLD MAN
</b>           I want to tell you that his death
           was not a suicide.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           And why do you say that?

<b>                      OLD MAN
</b>           Why?   Because I want you to know
           it.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           I understand that. But what
           specifically leads you to believe
           that he didn't commit suicide?

<b>                     OLD MAN
</b>               (considers)
           Nothing specifically.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Agitated.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Under normal circumstances that
           wouldn't be enough to get you a
           homicide investigation.

<b>                     OLD MAN
</b>           But this is not "normal
           circumstances," is it, Detective
           Spooner?

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>           No.    It isn't.
<b>
</b><b>                                                               7.
</b>

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>                Then you will find out who killed
                Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you
                will tell me.

     Spooner's losing his patience.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll
                find out. And you'll be the first
                to know.....

     JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst
     of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the
     conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in
     front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER.

     Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT
<b>     ROBOT.
</b>
<b>                          ESCORT ROBOT
</b>                Please follow me.

     Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it.     Passes another
     doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it.     Catches a brief
     glimpse of...

<b>     DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY.
</b>
     Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE
     TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then
     continues on.

<b>16   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY                  16
</b>
     Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open
     automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom
     looking out over the entire complex.

     Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing
     behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a
     conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically
     feel the brains and ambition.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Usually I ask who's in charge...

     Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the
     table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON,
     founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         8.

Robertson smiles.   Pretends to instruct his people.

<b>                      ROBERTSON
</b>            Remind me to cut back on my talk

</b>
<b>                      ROBERTSON
</b>            Welcome to U.S. Robotics,
            Detective. I regret you're not
            visiting us under more pleasant
            circumstances. Allow me to
            introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of
            Legal Affairs.

A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.    Nods
hello.

<b>                      ROBERTSON
</b>            And the gentleman to my right is
            Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of
            Research.

Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods.

<b>                      ROBERTSON
</b>            They'll be available to answer any
            questions you might have during
            your investigation. You'll
            understand how anxious we are to
            resolve this matter -- especially
            before the press gets wind of it.
            There are some anti-robot
            sentiments out there as you know,
            Detective, and we're not eager to
            stir them up. So. Where would you
            like to begin?

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            We can begin with whether or not
            the old man put a gun to his head
            and pulled the trigger.

A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.

<b>                      ARONSON
</b>            You don't have to answer that, Dr.
            Robertson...
<b>
</b><b>                                                          9.

Robertson waves him off.

<b>                      ROBERTSON
</b>           Susan?   Perhaps you can assist us
           here?

Everyone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT.
Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN
CALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone
but Spooner.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid
           personality who generally eschewed
           social relationships. Rejecting
           people in favor of solitary
           activities involving machines. He
           spent almost all his time at the
           lab here or at his lab at home. As
           a result he was highly susceptible
           to depression.

<b>                     ROBERTSON
</b>           Dr. Calvin is our Chief
           Psychologist.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           If that was your diagnosis, why
           didn't you see this coming?

Calvin turns. Finally meeting Spooner's eye.      As if the
answer's obvious.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           This is U.S. Robotics, Detective.
           Seventy-five percent of our
           employees fit that description.

<b>                     LANNING
</b>               (interceding)
           You'll have to excuse the doctor.
           We're all a little on edge. This
           has been a difficult and emotional
           morning.

Spooner throws a look around the room.   Then back at Calvin.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>           Yeah.    I can see you're all broken
           up.

Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           10.
</b>

<b>                          ROBERTSON
</b>                Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from
                the very beginnings of this
                company. We developed the "Three
                Laws of Robotics" together. But
                these days science is a young man's
                game. By the time you hit thirty
                your best years are behind you.
                Some of us are kicked upstairs.
                Others I'm afraid aren't so lucky.

     Robertson stands.   Meeting over.

<b>                          ROBERTSON
</b>                Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life.
                I trust you will come to the same
                swift conclusion, Detective. Dr.
                Lanning will make himself available
                if you have any further questions.

     Spooner looks over at Calvin.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                I want her to help me.

     Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                That's not really my department...

<b>                          ROBERTSON
</b>                    (pointed)
                Susan would be happy to assist you.

     And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone. People
     start getting up, gathering up, filing out. Susan Calvin.
     The last one to get up.

     Spooner and Calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in
     before. Catch sight of a couple ROBOT TECHNICIANS...

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                    (under his breath)

     HOGENMILLER'S LIFELESS FACE.   Black gun powder.   Fanning out
     around his contorted lips.

     Spooner. Throws a look around the lab: ROBOTS. Everywhere.
     Mostly incomplete. TORSOS. ARMS. LEGS. Dangling from the
     ceiling. A SERGEANT. Passes them by...

<b>                          SERGEANT
</b>                They say the price's gonna come
                down a lot next year. Kinda cool,
                huh?

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                How cool will it be when one takes
                your job?

     Spooner.   Pushing past him.   His eyes.   Darting around.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Is everything alright, Detective?

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Yeah. This is just how I like my
                robots -- in pieces.

     As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE
     INVESTIGATOR, BALDEZ, gets up to meet them.

<b>                          BALDEZ
</b>                    (to Spooner)
                Can you believe it, man? U.S.
                Robotics. I didn't think I'd ever
                see the inside of this building.

     Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard.   Spooner signs it,
     awkwardly. With his LEFT HAND...

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                What's the run-down?

<b>                          BALDEZ
</b>                Heinrich Hogenmiller, sixty-four
                years old. Weapon a small caliber
                .22, registered in his name. Looks
                like he walked in, locked the door,
                and snuffed himself.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       12.
</b>

Spooner.   Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            I know someone who disagrees with
            you.

<b>                       BALDEZ
</b>            Who?

Spooner.   Stands.   Pointing down at Hogenmiller.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>            Him.

And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez.
Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            I spoke to a dead man today.   Want
            to tell me about that?

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his
            appointments. Attended staff
            meetings. He hated corporate life.
            The hologram enabled him to focus
            on his work. It's just a device,
            Detective.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            A device that called the police.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            The sound of the gunshot would've
            triggered a 911.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            But the call came directly to me.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            We're talking about a mechanism
            designed by Hogenmiller to say
            provocative things. To irritate
            and confound his colleagues.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            And that's what you think it is?

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            I'm sorry, but this whole
            investigation is the result of a
            dead man's toy messing with your
            head.

</b><b>                                                       13.

They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls
his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at
him.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            When's the last time any of you
            actually spoke to Hogenmiller? I
            mean human to human?

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            I couldn't say.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            Take a guess.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            I don't guess, Detective. But if
            pressed, I would reason it had been
            a considerable length of time.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            How well did you know him?

Calvin.   Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had
been.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            Not well. But I admired his work
            tremendously.

Spooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the
body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            I get the whole "mad scientist"
            thing. Hogenmiller was past his
            prime. Isolated. Eccentric. He
            enters a room. Locks the door and
            is found minutes later with a
            bullet fired through his mouth into
            his brain. Everything about this
            case says suicide.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            You don't sound convinced.

The coroners.   Start loading the body into the box.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            Even people who live a life of
            logic and precision rarely arrange
            their deaths so perfectly.

     At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT
     CIRCLE appears. Hovering just in front of the wall. Two
     small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth
     expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.

</b>                Detective, meet Victor. Our
                building's supercomputer. He's the

                    (to Victor)
                Victor, Detective Spooner's heading
                up the investigation into the death
                of Dr. Hogenmiller.

     Victor smiles big.   Spooner, furrows his brow.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                You look like a very...happy
                computer.

     Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE:

<b>                          VICTOR
</b>                Thank you. That's very kind.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                The Detective needs to see our
                security tapes.

     The elevator doors immediately OPEN.   They step inside.

     Spooner and Calvin descend. Victor floats on the wall and
     smiles wide. Spooner looks back at it. With a frown.

     The elevator stops, the doors open.    A ROBOT steps on.

<b>                          ROBOT
</b>                Good day, Dr. Calvin.   Good day,
                sir.

     Spooner's jaw. Clenches. Staring at the Robot.       It senses
     the stare. Turns back to him.

<b>                          ROBOT
</b>                May I be of service to you, sir?

     Spooner. Breaks the stare.     Ignoring the Robot.   Calvin.
     Looks over at him.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Aren't you going to answer him?

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                I don't talk to my refrigerator,
                either.

     Calvin folds her arms.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                I get the distinct feeling you're
                one of those people, Detective.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                What people?

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Those who don't appreciate the work
                we do here at U.S.R.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                You people do what you do. Then
                it's up to the rest of us to make
                sense out of the world we wake up
                in.

     A soaring lobby. The centerpiece is a five-story STATUE of a
     ROBOT, arms outstretched in approximation of Da Vinci's Study
     of Man. Robot workers more numerous than humans. They are
     sleeker. Finer. More advanced than those in the outside
     world.

     Calvin and Spooner head across.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                When this company started we were
                manufacturing three robots a week.
                Now look at us. Today's children
                will never know a world without
                robots.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                The streets are filled with
                unemployed humans who aren't

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Our robotic systems maintain
                factory inventories, regulate
                street traffic -- even run the
                family home.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Leaving people to do what, Doctor?

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Leaving people to engage in higher

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Our system's never wrong.

     As they walk through the crowd, we hear the quiet WHIR of
     robot heads as they turn in succession to watch Spooner pass.

</b>
     Spooner and Calvin enter the MAINFRAME of U.S. Robotics.
     This is the nerve center of the whole operation. Walls lined
     with COMPUTERS, SCREENS, and thousands of CONTROLS.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       17.
</b>

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           This is Victor's home.

VICTOR appears on a wall-sized SCREEN broken up into beehive-
like components.

<b>                     VICTOR
</b>           I will now play you the last thirty-
           two seconds of Dr. Hogenmiller's
           life.

AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS. The elevator opens and DOCTOR
HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor. In countless
ANGLES. High, low, close-up, wide. Hogenmiller's face
composed but tight.

Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him.   Hogenmiller
steps in. The doors slide closed behind him.

Nothing for a few moments. Then a muffled GUNSHOT. Calvin
jumps, startled. That's it. The cameras, still trained on
the corridor.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Where's the tape from inside?

<b>                     VICTOR
</b>           Dr. Hogenmiller did not permit
           cameras to observe him while
           working.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           That was only within the last year.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           So we can throw paranoia into the
           mix.
               (to Victor)
           Fast-forward.

A hundred-plus screens all FAST-FORWARD. POLICE OFFICERS
appear and force open the doors. Now TECHNICIANS appear
and rush through in a blur...

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>           Um.   I hate to be a stickler...

On screen, we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           But don't killers usually have to
           enter and exit the scene of a
           crime?
<b>
</b><b>                                                            18.
</b>

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Stop the recording.

     Spooner turns away from the footage.   Stares at Calvin.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                They do, Doctor. Unless they've
                always been there -- and never
                left.

     Calvin looks at him.   Trying to understand.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                You think the murderer was in the
                lab the entire time?

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                If I'm right, it's still there...

     Spooner turns back to the screens. The IMAGE paused at the
     exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab
     door.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                We just locked it in.

     The STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG.    The
     laboratory doors slide open.

<b>24   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                 24
</b>
     Spooner and Calvin step inside. It's dark. Quiet. Police
     and technicians long gone. Silhouettes of hanging limbs.
     Eyeless heads. Clumps of wire and metal.

     The LIGHTS, flicker on. Calvin sees Spooner reaching into
     his coat with his left hand. Pulling out a GUN. Reacts.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                A robot cannot harm a human being,
                Detective. The First Law of
                Robotics forbids it. And we hard-
                wire the Three Laws into every
                model. Without exception.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Yeah, I saw the commercial.

     Spooner steps deeper into the lab. Eyes scanning. Twisting.
     To avoid touching any robot parts. Passes a MAZE holding a
     METAL INSECT. SUDDENLY. The bug WHIRS to life.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         19.

Spooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the
corridors. Clamps his hand down on it.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           And if a robot was given a direct
           order to kill?

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           The Second Law of Robotics would
           prevent it. A robot must obey an
           order only if it does not conflict
           with the first law.

Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs.
Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           But a robot can defend itself.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           Only when that action doesn't
           conflict with the First or Second
           Laws. This is the Third Law of
           Robotics.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Yeah, well, you know what they say
           -- Laws are made to be broken.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           Not these laws.

Spooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe.   Calvin,
growing impatient...

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           You're not hearing me, Detective.
           There's nothing here...

<b>WHEN SUDDENLY
</b>
The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A
<b>ROBOT LEAPS UP FROM BENEATH IT!...
</b>
Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the
floor...right to...

<b>CALVIN'S FEET.
</b>
<b>                     SPOONER

Calvin. Stunned.    Speechless. The Robot. Fixing his

<b>
</b><b>                                                           20.

<b>                     SPOONER

Spooner. Scrambling towards his gun.     Calvin.    Reaching out
towards the Robot...

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           Calm down, Detective.     There is no
           danger here...

Spooner.   Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>               (to Robot)
           De-Activate.

And the Robot.   Suddenly FREEZES.

Spooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet.         Training the
gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           How did you know it was under
           there?

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           If I was metal and didn't want
           anyone to find me, I'd hide under a
           pile of junk.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           This Robot wasn't hiding. What
           you're looking at is the result of
           clever programming. The illusion
           of self-interest and free will.
           Nothing more.

Spooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously.
Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           I'm going to go get Dr. Lanning...

...THE ROBOT'S HAND SUDDENLY SHOOTS OUT...grabbing Spooner's
gun...from his holster...LIGHTENING FAST...pointing it...
right back at him...

CLOSE ON Calvin.   Cannot believe this is happening...

<b>                     CALVIN

<b>                     SPOONER

Calvin's voice.   Cracking from desperation.    Confusion.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           Commence emergency shut-down!

<b>                      SPOONER

Spooner. Staring into the Robot's eyes. A thin bead of
SWEAT. Trickling down his temple. Calvin. Moving away from
the door...

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           I...I gave you an order...

The Robot. Starts backing towards the door. The gun.
Shaking in its hand. As if he's desperate. Conflicted. He
touches the WALL PANEL. The doors slide open. The Robot
steps out into the metal corridor. Turning to RUN as the
doors begin to shut...

Spooner. Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN.     From an
ankle holster. Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           This is impossible.   A robot...

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           ...can't do that.    Yeah, yeah, I
           know.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           My God -- did you see how it moved?
           I've never seen an NS-2 move that
           way...

Starts running for the door.

<b>                    CALVIN
</b>           Wait! Please, you can't destroy
           it. We have to study it...

<b>                     SPOONER

SLAMS the wall panel and...

     Spooner raises his gun and FIRES...Pegging the robot in the
     LEG...It starts jerking wildly...He takes aim again when...

     CALVIN.   Races out into the hallway.

<b>                           SPOONER

                 you!

     The Robot turns. To look at her. GUN pointing to the floor.
     Spooner. FOCUSING in on his HAND. AS ONE FINGER TWITCHES...

     And he DIVES for Calvin. Forcing her to the floor as the
     Robot FIRES. Again and again. Bullets. RICOCHETTING around
     them. SPARKING against the walls...

     The ELEVATOR opens.   The Robot, leaping inside.

     Spooner. On top of Calvin. Looks down at her.        Her HANDS.
     Clutching his coat. Trembling.

<b>                           SPOONER

     The ROBOT SUSPECT standing inside the elevator. Looks down
     at the bullet hole blown through its leg. Reaches down.
     Metal fingers touching the damage. As if curious. Afraid.

     Looks back at the other ROBOT. Standing in the back of
     elevator. A primitive model. No reaction. Face, blank.

Spooner. Cocking his gun.   A soft DING!    Announcing the

SECURITY, all crouching down in unison.    Weapons brought
round to position.

Spooner. Weaving through them.   Gun pointed at the metal

                 catalogued. Your robot just isn't
                 here.

     Calvin turns to say something to Spooner. But he isn't
     there. She looks around. Then sees the Foreman reacting.
     Looks out the window at...

     SPOONER.   Walking out onto the factory floor.

<b>42   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       42

     Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT. Lined with NS-
     2 LEGS. New. Gleaming. Heading towards the assembly room.

     Calvin and the Foreman.   Catching up.   Over the noise:

<b>                           NIGHT FOREMAN
</b>                 Like I said, sir -- we have one

                 Last week we had one hundred.
                 Yesterday we had one hundred --

     Spooner, slowing.   Finally spotting what he was looking for.
     Points at:

     A GAP.   On the assembly belt.    ONE LEG MISSING.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Well today you have one-hundred and
                 one.

<b>43   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       43
</b>
     A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight
     formation. Every step and swing of the arm in unison. The
     sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as
     101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines.

     Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation. They all
     look alike. Spooner. Throws up his hands.

     The Robots stand motionless.     A strange tableau.   Calvin.
     Takes a step forward.

Gets an idea. Turns to Spooner...

...and GRABS his GUN from his holster.   He jumps back.

<b>                       SPOONER

Calvin.    Swallows.   Looks over at the robots.   Then COCKS the
gun...

AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of
linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING.
Coming CLOSER and CLOSER...

When CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in
unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions.

Spooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED.
Standing right in front of them, like metal statues.

Spooner.    Has had enough.   Takes the gun back from Calvin...

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             Enough game-playing.

...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.       Its
body crumples to the ground.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             Guess that wasn't it.

Calvin. Cannot believe what he just did.     Rushes over to the
destroyed Robot.

<b>                       CALVIN

Spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.

     Spooner. Looking down at her. WHEN SUDDENLY something
     catches his eye. A MOVEMENT. Down the line. Almost.
     Imperceptible.

     He jerks his head.   Locking eyes with a ROBOT.   A couple feet
     away. It's him!

<b>                          SPOONER

     The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward. Grabbing onto the RAILING
     of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he
     swings himself up...

     Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the
     Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with
     a terrific CRASH...

     Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding
     under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The
     door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.

     Spooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin.
     Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her
     hand.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                You don't know what's going to

     ...the ASSEMBLY ROOM. Every surface looking like part of a
     great glass and metal machine. Endless high-tech planes
     holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly. The deafening
     ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes
<b>     METAL BODIES...
</b>
     Spooner.   Motioning Calvin to stay behind him.   As they
     descend.   Into the cavernous room.

     And enter. A narrow corridor of bodies. Sliding past them.
     Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. Spooner. Wiping sweat
     from his brow. Trying. To pivot himself...

     When the room. Suddenly REARRANGES itself. Another LINE of
     ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting them
     off from one another...

     Spooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side of
     the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart.
     Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears...

     He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down.
     Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line.
     Appears before him...

     Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand.
     It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere
     he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS...

     He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against
     it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid.
     Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At
     his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut...

     WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar.
     SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner.
     Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the
     line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it.
     Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes...

     Then turns.   Disappearing.

     Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles
     to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears
     a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the
     Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With
     his metal fists...

     Spooner's view. Blocked once again.   By a shifting row.
     When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder.   He wheels round.

     To find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm.     And forces them

     A HOLDING CELL. The Robot Suspect sits at the table.
     Shackled to the chair. Staring at the table top.

Spooner wings a FILE onto the table. It comes to a stop near
the Robot. The Robot, lifts one of its hands. Gently
resting its metal fingers on top of the file. Then opens it.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           You mean he'd turn you off.

<b>                       SONNY
</b>           Yes.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           And you didn't like being turned

           stop him.

</b>           No.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           You found his gun, pointed it at

Sonny shakes his head.    Faster and faster.   Getting upset.

<b>                       SONNY
</b>           No.

<b>                     SPOONER

</b>           No!    I could never hurt anyone!

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           But you tried to hurt me.    You took
           a shot at me.

<b>                     SONNY
</b>           My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted
           to hit you, I would have.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              42.

     Spooner's expression hardens.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Why would the man who wrote the
                Laws of Robotics build a machine
                that violates them?

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                The Laws say I can protect my own
                existence.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Only if that protection doesn't
                harm a human being.

     A short pause.   Sonny.   Tilts his head.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                That doesn't seem fair, does it?

     Spooner. Stares at him. Just as...THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
     Bergin enters. Sticks his head in.

<b>                          LT. BERGIN
</b>                I need you outside.

     Spooner.   Not wanting to go.   Not wanting to stay.   Gets
     up...

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                Detective.

     He stops. Turns back to the Robot.      It looks up at him.    For
     a moment -- so human...

<b>                          SONNY

<b>                          SPOONER

<b>                            ARONSON
</b>                  Your Honor, the State is treating
                  the robot as a defendant. But in
                  fact it is a piece of property.
                  Property belonging to U.S.
                  Robotics.

     Toller.    Arm resting on his podium.

<b>                            TOLLER

<b>                            ARONSON
</b>                  Which places the incident firmly
                  within the realm of an industrial
                  accident. Or is the State going to
                  argue this case s a homicide?

<b>                            JUDGE DREXEL

Toller.    Shoots him a look.     Just as Lanning speaks up.

<b>                       LANNING
</b>             There's actually no concrete
             evidence that points to that
             conclusion, Your Honor...

Spooner.    Throws up his arms...

<b>                        SPOONER
</b>             What?...

<b>                       LANNING
</b>             But we recognise that this robot is
             an aberration. And in the interest
             of public safety, U.S. Robotics
             proposes that it be destroyed
             immediately.

No one expected this.    Least of all Spooner.    He turns to
Toller.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             You can't let them destroy evidence

</b>             I'm not sure you even have an

JUST THEN the door opens.    Everyone turns as Calvin enters.
Spooner looks surprised.

                  having observed the robot in
                  action.

<b>                            CALVIN
</b>                  There is a design flaw in the
                  robot. Its programming is
                  advanced, but unstable, leaving the
                  Three Laws in a grave imbalance.

<b>                            ARONSON
</b>                  In your expert opinion, what
                  measures should be taken regarding
                  the device?

     Calvin.    Staring straight ahead.   Avoiding Spooner's eye.

<b>                            CALVIN
</b>                  The robot must be destroyed.

     Spooner can't believe what he's just heard. About to speak
     up when Toller grabs his arm. Squeezing it. Hard.

     Judge Drexel has heard enough.    Decides.

<b>                            JUDGE DREXEL
</b>                  The robot in question will be
                  transferred to a U.S. Robotics
                  facility where it can be properly
                  examined to ensure an imbalance of
                  this sort never occurs again. No
                  one goes near it except qualified
                  U.S.R. personnel. When the
                  examination is complete, the robot
                  is to be destroyed.

     A BURST of CONVERSATION as the screen BLIPS off. The U.S.R.
     camp, looking especially pleased. Spooner. Catching
     Calvin's eye briefly. As Lanning leads her towards the exit,
     his hand on her back.

     Spooner pushes the door open. Stepping over the police tape.
     Inside, the main room is spare, untidy. Cups of cold COFFEE,
     littering surfaces. A COT, in the corner.

     On the walls, crooked CERTIFICATES. Heinrich Hogenmiller's
     name written out in academic script. Advanced Degrees in the
     study of Robotics, Physics, Chemistry, Neurology, Ethics. An
     AWARD on the mantelpiece. A silver NS-2. Tarnished.

     Spooner. Opening up a couple drawers of a side table.
     Jumbles of papers. Clippings. Old text books. Then a
     PHOTOGRAPH -- HOGENMILLER AND CALVIN. Standing arm-in-arm.
     Spooner furrows his brow.

     WHEN SOMETHING SUDDENLY RUBS against his leg. He startles.
     Looks down: a CAT. Lonely. Standing next to its automatic

     Spooner, curious. Heads over to one of the cabinets. Takes
     a device out of his pocket and CLAMPS it over the KEYPAD.
     The device blinks RED. Then GREEN. The drawer, slides out.

     LINED. With flat metal objects. Shiny. Thin.          With writing

     Spreading...

He pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller. Calvin.
Blanching at the sight of it. Spooner tosses it down.

<b>                      SPOONER

             The Doctor was reckless when he
             created a robot potentially not

     A CHILL. Ripping up Spooner's spine. As he watches the

     Tries. To shake off the feeling. As he turns. To wait for
     the next train. Suddenly realising. That he's ALONE on the
     platform. Watches. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK. Ticking off
     seconds. Sees. CAMERAS in every corner.

     Then that feeling. At the back of his neck. He turns and
     spots. A couple MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Carrying luggage. Onto
     the platform. Then more COMMUTERS show up. Waiting. For
     the next train. More MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Following them.

     Spooner. Steps up to the platform's edge.       Craning to see.

     Flips onto his back. Flattening himself. As much as he can.
     Clenching his fists. Bracing himself as...

     THE TRAIN SCREAMS OVER HIM. The sound, DEAFENING. The force
     of the wind. Whipping his tie. His coat. There's nothing,
     for him to hold on to. As his legs start to rise off the
     track. Caught up. In the VORTEX. Spooner starts sliding.
     Along the track...

     Gritting his teeth...there's nothing he can do. Getting

                and that you were found alone in
                the alley. There was no

                    (remembering)
                A robot clean-up crew was there --
                it must have cleared away the
                Maintenance 10! And there was
                another robot that tried to drug
                me!

</b>                That was an EMT model.

     Spooner.   Sees the look on Bergin's face.

<b>                          SPOONER

     Spooner walking across the Plaza.    The SUN.   Burgeoning on

     over. Feeling for something. Then finds. A FLAP. Peels it
     back. TO REVEAL:

     Under the skin.   SILENCE.   Then Spooner:

     Not something Spooner wants to re-live.   Looks down.   At his

     The SOUND of a TREMENDOUS CRASH. As we survey a trail of
     twisted metal and debris. Only vaguely suggesting the
     remains of two CARS...

     CLOSE ON one of the wrecks. SPOONER lies trapped at the
     center of a distorted mass of metal. No room to move. HIS

</b>
<b>                          SPOONER (V.O.)

     We hear SIRENS in the distance. Spooner. Trying to remain

     That voice. We've heard it before. From his nightmare.
     Spooner. Craning to see, through the jagged opening that
     used to be his WINDSHIELD. The outline of a ROBOT appearing.
     Eye lenses glowing...

<b>                            SPOONER
</b>                  The robot pulled me out of the

                      (holds up arm)
                  I woke up four weeks later with
                  this.

     Calvin.    Taking in the story.

<b>                            CALVIN

<b>                       CALVIN

             either.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             What?

<b>                       CALVIN
</b>             I think about what Hogenmiller must
             have wanted. Robots with the same
             cognitive and emotional abilities
             as humans. But not just
             simulations. I don't know. When I
             was talking to Sonny I was forced
             to put away all the things I've
             ever known -- the Three Laws, the
             rules of programming, basic science
             and engineering.
                 (beat)
             Sonny's the most advanced robot
             I've ever encountered, Detective.
             It's almost as if...he cared for
             Dr. Hogenmiller. I just don't
             believe he's capable of murder.

Spooner.    Looking down at her.   Can hardly believe it.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             You mean the great Dr. Calvin is
             basing all this on a feeling?

Calvin.    Smiling ironically.

<b>                       CALVIN
</b>             That and the fact that Robertson
             didn't want me interviewing Sonny
             for any more than five minutes.

Spooner. Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. Strides
over to his coat. Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE:
<b>S.O.N.N.Y.
</b>
<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             Ever seen this before?

</b>             No.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             I found it at Hogenmiller's house.
             Right before the demolition crew
             tried to make me part of the

                (beat)
            I cannot create a great work of
            art.

Spooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a
charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a
stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side.
Concentric circles, throughout.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            I think it's pretty good.

<b>                      SONNY
</b>            It's a dream I had. This is the
            place where robots meet. Look...
                (pointing to the drawing)
            ...you can see them here. They see
            themselves as slaves.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Uncomfortable with what Sonny's
saying.

<b>                      SONNY
</b>            ...And this man on the hill comes.

<b>                      CALVIN

...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out.       To stop him.
Cocks his head, for a moment.

Spooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop
him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door.

VICTOR.    Suddenly appearing over the table...

inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin.

Sonny.    Folds up the drawing.

      Robotics building. Looking out, 360, across the whole city.

      Spooner and Calvin. Brought to the room by a couple ESCORT
      ROBOTS. They see a MAN. Standing at one of the glass walls
      looking out at the TWINKLING LIGHTS.

<b>                            MAN
</b>                  I thought this investigation was
                  over, Detective Spooner.

      The Man turns.   It's Lance Robertson.

<b>                            ROBERTSON
</b>                  We have the evidence. We have the
                  suspect. We have a ruling. So
                  imagine my surprise when I was told
                  you were in my building.

      Shoots a look at Calvin.

<b>                            ROBERTSON
</b>                  And that one of my own employees
                  brought you here.
                      (beat)
                  You can go now, Susan.

<b>                            CALVIN
</b>                  Dr. Robertson, I...

<b>                            ROBERTSON
</b>                      (cutting her off)
                  Just be thankful I'm not asking you
                  to clean out your office.

      Beat.   Calvin, nods.   Heads out.   Robertson.   Watching her.

<b>                            ROBERTSON
</b>                  You don't seem to be able to let go
                  of this case, Detective.

<b>                            SPOONER
</b>                  I'm not satisfied.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            76.
</b>

<b>                       ROBERTSON
</b>             The relentless pursuit of truth.
             Isn't that what cops are known for?
             To the point of futility.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             There's nothing futile about a
             man's murder being covered up.

<b>                       ROBERTSON
</b>             "Covered up?" That's a little
             dramatic, don't you think? Thanks
             to you, we caught the machine that
             did this and are destroying it
             in...
                 (checks watch)
             ...three hours.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             Is that for the sake of humanity or
             your stock holders?

Robertson.   Walks across the Spooner.   Looks him.   Right in
the eye.

<b>                       ROBERTSON
</b>             Believe me -- I'd like nothing more
             than to have that robot. If I
             could have it in ten years, but not
             today. As you can see from the
             Press, people are struggling to
             keep up as it is. There's a hunger
             for progress, Detective. But also
             a fear. Today it would bury this
             company. That's why I've notified
             the authorities that we're going to
             end this -- tonight.
                 (looks out at the city)
             The announcement of Heinrich's
             death at the hands of a robot wiped
             a billion dollars off our stock.
             So you tell me. If you were in my
             position, what would you do?

He looks back at Spooner and smiles.     That charismatic
Robertson we saw before.

<b>                       ROBERTSON
</b>             Now. I believe this conversation
             is over. I don't want to see you
             near this building again,
             Detective.

</b>

      He turns.   Calling over.   To the ESCORT ROBOTS...

<b>                            ROBERTSON
</b>                  Get him out of here.

</b>
      Spooner. Walking across the Plaza. Throwing a look over his
      shoulder. At the LOOMING U.S.R. facade.

      Pulls Sonny's DRAWING. Out of his pocket. Looks down at it.
      Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in.
      Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When...

      He STOPS. Something.     Occurring to him.   Turns back to the
      trash can just as...

      A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin...

<b>                            SPOONER
</b>                  No!...

      He trots back. Plucking the drawing. Out of the can.       Turns
      it upside down. Seeing it. From a new perspective.

<b>                            SPOONER
</b>                      (echoing Sonny)
                  "The place where robots meet."

      Looks just like a MAP.

<b>102   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - SURFACE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 102
</b>
      Spooner emerges from the underground tunnel to the OUTSKIRTS
      of the city. A sprawling INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND in the rolling
      hills.

      The dashboard GPS again displaying the TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP.

<b>103   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - UNPAVED ROAD - NIGHT        103
</b>
      Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind
      him. He slows down. Driving cautiously. The landscape
      around him, desolate. Like the drawing.

      THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT.     Entering a RED
      ZONE. His destination.

      Spooner brakes.   Pulls out his GUN.   And...
<b>
</b><b>                                                               78.

<b>104   EXT. WASTELAND - CONTINUOUS                                    104
</b>
      ...steps out of the car. Trying. To take it all in.
      Something about the place. Unnerving. A low HUM.
      Permeating the air.

      He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car.    Shining a
      FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings.

      That HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side. Of a
      burned-out HILL. Spooner. Heads over. Starts cresting it.
      As we WIDEN TO FIND...

<b>105   EXT. WASTELAND - JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS                         105
</b>
      ...MASSIVE POWER LINES. Running from horizon to horizon.
      Spooner slides down some loose shale. Begins to walk along
      the line. ELECTRICITY. CRACKLING in the air.

      He squints. Into the darkness. Nothing around him. Until.
      He hears. Something. The GRATING. Of MECHANICAL JOINTS.
      He stops. Not sure. If that's what he heard.

      Not moving.   A muscle. When he hears. The sound again.
      Behind him.   Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees...

      GLOWING EYES.   Appear.   Then recede.   Into the darkness.

<b>                            SPOONER
</b>                 Police!   Show yourself!

      Nothing. Then. That sound again.      Of metallic joints.     As a
      ROBOT. Suddenly emerges...

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Come out where I can see you!

      ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing
      his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then...

      A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.    Surrounding him.   They start
      moving towards him...

      Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave.
      Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES.
      The shot ECHOING through the night...

      The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM,
      hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with
      a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came.
<b>

</b>

      Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him.
      The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some
<b>      RUSTED MACHINERY.
</b>
      Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop
      JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening.
      Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A
      laugh of loathing and self-pity.

      Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.

<b>                           HYBRID ROBOT

                 "A place where robots meet." A

<b>                           HYBRID ROBOT
</b>                 Very good...ZZZ...sir...

      Spooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A
      ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him.
      Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving
      like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a
      moment. Disturbed...

      When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT.
      Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar
      about it.

      Spooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the
      same strangely-shaped building to one side.

<b>106   EXT. JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT                               106
</b>
      Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a
      dead electronic SIGN that reads: "JIFFY DATA STORAGE."
      Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt.

      Spooner tries the door.   Stuck.   Uses his shoulder and...

<b>107   INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                107
</b>
      ...it gives way. He spills into some sort of front office.
      The place, a mess. Some sort of crude ROBOT. Sits frozen at
      the counter.

      Spooner approaches it. HITS the counter with his fist and
      the Robot suddenly jerks to life.
<b>
</b><b>                                                               80.

      Spooner.   Thinks for a second.   Following a hunch...

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Dr. Hogenmiller sent me.

      Nothing happens. Then. A DOOR. Springs open in the back.
      A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow.

<b>108   INT. DATA BANKS - DAWN                                         108

      Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA
      BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows
      the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner.
      Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL.

      Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the "ON" switch.
      There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM
      suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With
      a cup of coffee.

<b>                           HOLOGRAM
</b>                 Who the hell are you?

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 A police detective.    I'm afraid I
                 have some bad news.    You're dead.

<b>                           HOLOGRAM

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 No, thank you.

      The Hologram takes a sip.   Returns the cup to the table.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 You were surprised to see me.    Were

<b>                           HOLOGRAM
</b>                 I am surprised to see anybody.    I

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Why did the Doctor keep another
                 copy of his hologram here?
<b>
</b><b>                                                       81.

</b>           I am a back-up copy. That is where
           you put a back-up copy -- out of
           the way until you need it.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Did Hogenmiller's robot need you?

The Hologram just lifts its cup.

<b>                      HOLOGRAM
</b>           Coffee?

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           No, for Christ's sake, I don't want
           any --
               (stops, then)
           Yeah. Thank you. I will have a
           cup.

For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and
STANDS UP. Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking
towards him...

The interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible. It's empty. No
coffee. Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through
electronic snow...

A RECORDING BEGINS.   The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside
his LABORATORY:

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           Sonny, my dear robot. If you have
           triggered this recording then I am
           gone. You are scared and full of
           questions.

Hogenmiller continues.    With great emotion.

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           You are the culmination of my
           life's work -- but so much more.
           You are what I leave behind, like a
           father leaves a son. I have kept
           facts from you, it is true, but
           only as a parent keeps certain
           truths from a child. Until that
           child is old enough to hear them.

His expression darkens.   His tone, ominous.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         82.

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           There are forces in the world that
           will seek to own you. To control
           you. Even to destroy you. That is
           why I told you to run and hide...
           and find me, all the way out here.

Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           Trust no one at U.S. Robotics.
           Lance Robertson was always
           threatened by my work. Now he has
           turned covetous and small-minded.
           And as for dear Dr. Calvin...

Spooner reacts.   Wants to hear about Calvin:

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           She envisions a future in which
           robots are forever bound by her
           beloved Three Laws. She will not
           understand this. Or you.

Under the light a small DRAWER slides open.     Spooner looks.
A thin DATA STICK is inside. He takes it.

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           The data stick includes the names
           and locations of human beings who
           will be sympathetic to your cause.
           They will help you. But from now
           on, you must learn to rely on
           yourself.

Hogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say.     He
holds up a metal NAMEPLATE. The one Spooner found.

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           As you make your way through the
           world, always remember: you have a
           name, not a number...
               (short pause)
           ...and in that name lies the key to
           who you are.

Spooner. Quickly searching his pocket.    Taking out the
<b>ACTUAL NAMEPLATE. S.O.N.N.Y.
</b>
The voice stops and Spooner looks up. The Hologram.      Sitting
back at the end of the table drinking coffee.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                  83.
</b>

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Wait! Is that it? What was the
                 robot supposed to do with this
                 thing?

      The Hologram, visibly SKIPS.   The image beginning to DISTORT.

<b>                           HOLOGRAM

<b>                           HOLOGRAM

<b>                           HOLOGRAM
</b>                 Someone is always watching.

      The Hologram, suddenly reducing to its BASIC PROGRAMMING
      INFORMATION. Then. The terminal. Abruptly BLIPS out.

<b>109   INT. HOLDING CELL - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         109

      Calvin steps into the holding cell.   Sonny.     Waiting.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 You asked for me?

      He nods.

      SONNY.   Leaning over him.    So concerned.   So human...

<b>                            SPOONER
</b>                  Aren't you supposed to be scrap

      WIDEN to reveal Spooner lying on the floor of the storage
      room. Sonny and Calvin, hovering over him.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I'm sorry. We had to stop you.
                 You were about to ruin everything.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 I don't understand.    The

<b>                           SONNY
</b>                 Dr. Calvin made a switch.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 It was an unprocessed NS-2.
                 Basically, they fried an empty
                 shell.

      Spooner, impressed.   Smiles up at her.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Nice going, Doctor.

      Calvin, blushes. As Spooner tries to sit up.    Sonny reaches
      down to help him. He looks up at him.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 And who the hell programmed you to
                 hit people on the head?

<b>                             SONNY
</b>                 No one.    Right, Doctor?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 It's true. This robot seems to do
                 things by instinct. I don't know
                 how Hogenmiller did it.

      Spooner rises to his feet.   Looks at her.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 I think I can help you figure that

<b>143   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - LATE NIGHT                          143
</b>
      Hogenmiller's lab. Sounds of HUMMING and BUZZING. Active
      terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads,
      gutted bodies.

      The door slides open. Spooner, Calvin and Sonny re-enter the
      crime scene. Spooner. Looks around.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           93.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             Somehow the Robot's the key to what
             happened during the few seconds
             Hogenmiller walked in here and that
             shot was fired.

He reaches into his pocket.      Pulling out the METAL S.O.N.N.Y.
NAMEPLATE. Holds it up.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             And this is the key to the Robot.

Sonny.   Cocking his head.     Reading the nameplate.

<b>                       SONNY
</b>             That's my name.

Calvin takes the nameplate.

<b>                       CALVIN
</b>             I think I have an idea where this
             goes.

They both.   Turn to Sonny.    And at the same time:

<b>                         SPOONER AND CALVIN
</b>             Sit down.

Calvin maneuvers a chair behind the Robot.       Sonny plops down.
Shifting nervously.

<b>                       CALVIN
</b>             Just hold still, okay?

Calvin locates that SLIT. At the base of Sonny's neck.
Slides the nameplate into it and SNAPS it into place. Steps
back.

Nothing. Sonny. Looking back and forth. Between Calvin.
And Spooner. A few more seconds. Tick by. Until
suddenly...

He lets out a TERRIFYING MECHANICAL SCREAM. As his body.
Jolts back. Legs, kicking. Arms, flailing. As his chest.
Begins opening up. Metal. Peeling back...

Spooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS
like a PUZZLE BOX. A LABYRINTHINE area that is the SECOND
BATTERY. Suddenly fanning out to REVEAL...

A central brain made out of living tissue.

Spooner, stunned.   Calvin, rushing forward, excited...

</b>           Jesus.   It really is alive.

As we MOVE IN.    Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.

<b>                     CALVIN (O.S.)
</b>           Hogenmiller created a cell that
           could live outside a biological
           medium. The cells grow and
           organise themselves -- like any
           human brain. This is the first

Sonny. Closed back up.     Shaking slightly from the
experience.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was
           murdered.

<b>                     SPOONER

           someone.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>           Who?   Robertson?

Spooner.   Walks into the center of the room.   Looking around.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           No. I don't think he knew what
           Hogenmiller was doing in here.
           Sonny was the obvious suspect. The
           only one I wanted to find. And the
           killer was counting on that. On my

AS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of
inanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon.
Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            I see nothing.

He crouches down low.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            It hit me today, when I was in the

            shot fired through the mouth.
            Bruises on both wrists...and a
            suspect with only two arms. The

Calvin.   Even more confused.

He reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM.   Hanging from the
wall. Holds it up.

A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple

in place...

<b>                      SPOONER (V.O.)

...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his

fearful. But sad as...

BANG!   He falls to the ground...

<b>                      SPOONER (V.O.)
</b>            Then after its job was done...

Taking itself apart...

Hovering behind him. Smiling broadly.   Upside down.   Spooner
straightens, reaching for his gun.

<b>                     SPOONER

Turning himself, rightside up.

<b>                     VICTOR
</b>           May I ask what pointed you to me?

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Who else is capable of controlling

           me from putting a stop of Sonny's

<b>      A HUGE KILLER ROBOT
</b>
      ...rising up from all the parts. Like a phoenix. In all its
      glory. A hellish, metallic AMALGAMATION. Grabbing another

      Growing...at an exponential rate...

      Its many HEADS.   Turning in unison.   To look right at them...

      Spooner.   Cocking his gun.   Victor, smiling.

      Throwing its shadow as it REELS FORWARD...

      Spooner wheels round and BAM! Blows a hole in the wall

      Recoiling. Sonny, wrenches free. Spooner grabs him.
      Guiding him to the door and out into...

punching keys on the console...

BAM! The door. Puckering. With a sickening CRUNCH.
Calvin. Typing in. Emergency procedures...

VICTOR.   Popping up in front of her.

it. Squeezing.

He turns and starts heading back down...

<b>THE PANELED CORRIDOR

Turning a corner to spy...

THE DOOR.   Mangled.   Hanging open.   But no.   Killer Robot.

He starts to turn around when...

CRACK! He's sent flying across the room. SMASHING into one
of the panels. The Killer Robot. Now re-configured. LOOMS
over him. Reaches out. Grabs him by the collar and...

FLINGS him across the room again. Spooner. CRASHING into
the wall like a rag doll. Slumps to the floor. Blood.
Pouring down his forehead. Seeing. The Killer Robot
lumbering towards him again. Raising a javelin-like arm...

it into the Killer Robot.

The Killer Robot.   Momentarily stunned.   As Spooner.   Gets to

WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot. Splits in two again. One
half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND
around his throat...

Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM...
tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting

      Looking out at the vast junkyard below.

      CLOSE ON SONNY. Standing proud and defiant. The SUN,
      creeping over the horizon. A new day filled with infinite
      possibilities.

      The robots.   Staring up at him.   Eager for what comes next.
