     Nashville Airport.

2     EXT. NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY

     TRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S 
     old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward 
     coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the 
     same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.

3     INT. AIRPORT - DAY

     NORMAN is attracted to large “CONNIE WHITE” display.

4     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the 
     jukebox we hear one of her songs.

     The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an 
     overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.

     There are several people at the counter with him, including 
     GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT 
     REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.

     A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full 
     or dishes. This is WADE.

                         WADE
                    (to SUELEEN)
               You want a ride into town?

                         SUELEEN
               You bet.

     REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the 
     TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and 
     checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his 
     newspaper.

                         SUELEEN
               Got me an audition tonight.

                         WADE
               Well, you just remember, if you 
               can't kick front, kick back, 'cause 
               at least you're kicking... Ten 
               minutes, okay?

     She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking 
     looks at her.

                         SUELEEN
               I've just been waiting for the 
               right spot to sing in... I'm so 
               nervous...

     She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.

                         SUELEEN
               I'm good, though. There ain't but 
               one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to 
               be conceited, but really it's true. 
               I've been taking special coaching 
               lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's 
               just wonderful. Teaches you how to 
               phrase; that's really important. 
               And breathing. Well, you know all 
               about that. Anyway, I wrote this 
               song.

     She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do 
     all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some 
     glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every 
     time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through 
     the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks 
     away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished 
     his meal.

                         SUELEEN
               Oh, listen, I really do go on. 
               Here's your check. Sure has been 
               nice talking to you.

     As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the 
     jukebox, "Keep on a goin'."  The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.

     CUT TO:

5     INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAY

     We hear the last chorus or "Keep on a goin'" as sung by HAVEN, 
     who is recording.

     He is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY 
     PEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is 
     accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater. 
     HAVEN is not too happy with him. 

6     ANOTHER ANGLE

     OPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape 
     recorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and 
     the piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming 
     instructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.

7     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     OPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.

                         BUD
               Sorry. He sees a tape recorder and 
               gets upset.

     She looks at him.

                         BUD
               He's my father.

                         OPAL
               Haven Hamilton is your father? Can 
               you arrange an interview?

8     INT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY

     They have entered a different control tooth. In the recording 
     portion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song. 
     OPAL asks BUD who this group is.

9     INT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

     BUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and 
     starts to leave, yelling at the producer.

                         HAVEN
               Who the hell is playing piano? Get 
               that hippie out of here... He's got 
               a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. 
               I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to 
               the airport. When you get my 
               backups straight, then we'll talk 
               about cutting this tune here.

     He heads for the hallway.

10     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     It is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates 
     being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white 
     knight. OPAL moves near.

                         OPAL
               Excuse me, sir. I'm here putting 
               together a film. I would like to 
               ask some questions.

     She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.

                         HAVEN
               Foreigner?

                         OPAL
               I'm from BBC television.

                         HAVEN
               Where the hell is that?

     HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and 
     PEARL. He spots LINNEA.

                         HAVEN
               Linnea.

                         LINNEA
               How you doing, Haven?

                         HAVEN
               oh, fine. Couldn't be better.

11     ANGLE T0WARD OUTSIDE

     They all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep

     REESE leaves a tip and exits the coffee shop to greet the plane.

               'Bye... nice talking to you.

     GREEN sees his niece and walks over.

                         GREEN
               Joan?

     She turns.

                         L.A. JOAN
               Did you see who that was?

                         GREEN
               Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, 
               too.

                         L.A. JOAN 
               He is just wonderful.

                         GREEN
               I'1l get your bag.

     CUT TO:

15     EXT. LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAY

     GLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a 
     gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. 
     Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps 
     close to NORMAN.

                         GLENN
               Am I late?

                         NORMAN
               Late!  Oh, Jesus!

     He runs off.

16     ANOTHER ANGLE

     As NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep 
     arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. 
     REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT 
     is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all 
     shake hands.

                         HAVEN
               Delbert, how are you?

                         REESE
               I'm fine. This here is John 
               Triplette. Triplette, like you to 
               meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven 
               Hamilton.

                         HAVEN
               Good to meet you.
                     (turns to BUD)
               Bud, have them move the horses.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Pleasure 

                         REESE
               Where is she?

                         HAVEN
               Still inside the plane posing for 
               pictures and signing autographs. 
               She's got a new album cut again. 
               She'll be down in a minute. But 
               she'll be late for the Opera if she 
               doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on 
               the walkie-talkie.

     BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get 
     anything.

                         BUD
               They don't seem to be answering. 
               The ambulance boys are here, though. 
               Barnett always expects them to get 
               there like a shot. That thing only 
               goes a hundred fall bore with the 
               sirens going.

                         HAVEN
               Thank you, Bud.

     BUD nods like he has been complimented.

17     ANGLE TOWARD PLANE

     A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes 
     and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes 
     as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, 
     especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of 
     applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been 
     exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in 
     awe of the situation.

     When the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN 
     descends the stairs.

                         HAVEN
               Bud, tell them to move the horses. 
               Promised this strip would be spic 
               and span.

     He smiles and winks.

                         REESE
               Listen, we'll go get the car and 
               come back. This'l1 be going on for 
               a while.

                         HAVEN
               You bet. She's probably talking to 
               somebody about their sick child. You 
               know how she is.

     They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone. 
     Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars 
     and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.

18     ANOTHER ANGLE

     BARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL 
     while BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.

19     EXT. AIRPORT NEAR PARKING LOT - DAY

     While the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN 
     finds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath, 
     trying to pretend he's on time.

                         NORMAN
               Hi.

     BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.

                         BILL
               Hi, Norman.

     NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.

                         NORMAN
               Sure is nice to see you all again. 
               I never thought I'd see you again 
               after the last time.

                         BILL
               Oh, Norman, you worry too much.

     MARY takes NORMAN'S hand.

                         MARY
               Norman, how are you?

     She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to 
     someone else.

                         NORMAN
               Fine. Just fine.

     As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top 
     of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement 
     Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking 
     toward it, shaking hands with several people.

                         NORMAN
               Sure have missed you all, though. 
               Oh, where's Tom?  Isn't he with you?

                         BILL
               Don't worry about old Tom.

20     ANOTHER ANGLE

     TOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof.

     Nearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the 
     Replacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape-
     recorded VOICE:

                         VOICE
               Have you thought about your future 
               and what America needs to examine...

     Behind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with "Connie 
     White" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He 
     cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.

21     EXT. PARKING LOT

     NORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the 
     TRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also 
     joins the procession.

22     ANGLE TOWARD RUNWAY

     The orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and 
     there seems to be a great deal at activity.

     REESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into 
     HAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.

23     NEW ANGLE

     Two ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE 
     and REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN, 
     who has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia. 
     They test her reflexes, etc..

                         ATTENDANT
               How long was she out?

                         BARNETT
               Not too long. But she keeps 
               passing out.

     She comes to and looks at them all.

                         BARBARA JEAN
                     (oblivious)
               Just give your manna that vitamin 
               E. Makes a world of difference.

                         HAVEN
               Here she is again.

     She resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.

                         ATTENDANT
               Okay, let's get her to the wagon.

     A stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT 
     climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on 
     DELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people. 
     DELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance 
     speeds off, siren wailing.

26     INT. GREEN'S CAR

                         GREEN
               Eater's been asking for you.

     L.A. JOAN is trying to find a station she likes on her transistor 
     radio.

                         L.A. JOAN
               Uh huh.

                         GREEN
               She's been in the hospital two 
               weeks yesterday.

     L.A. JOAN can't find anything she likes. 

                         L.A. JOAN
               You know anything about the 
               stations here?

                         GREEN
                     (hasn't heard) 
               It's hard to say. Doctors thought 
               she'd come home a week ago. All it 
               was was appendix.

                         L.A. JOAN
               All they got is advertisements.

               We had these two city boys come in 
               last week. One or them said his 
               Ford truck had cut off his foot. 
               The other one said that wasn't true. 
               Then the first said he looked just 
               like Eddie Black when he said 
               that...

     She laughs.

                         SUELEEN
               No -- That's exercises. My coach 
               says you have to do exercise because 
               the vocal chords are muscle and need 
               to be stretched. Every time you 
               stretch them, the middle part sets 
               stronger. That's the place where I 
               sing.

               puke.

     He runs toward the truck. At this point, the TRICYCLE MAN 
     appears through all the cars.

40     ANGLE AT BRIDGE

     The TRICYCLE MAN works his way through traffic. STAR has climbed 
     from his truck and goes to help. ALBUQUESQUE takes advantage and 
     runs off.

41     ANGLE NEAR KENNY'S CAR

     It overheats and explodes. KENNY gets out, carrying his violin 
     case and starts to walk. ALBUQUERQUE spots him and steps near.

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               Hey, mind if I walk with ya?

     She looks at his violin case.

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               You a musician?

                         KENNY
               No.

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               Do you have people in Nashville?

                         KENNY
               No -- Just coming to Nashville, 
               that's all.

42     INT. AMBULANCE

     BARNETT is in a rage. The ATTENDANTS administer oxygen to 
     BARBARA JEAN

                         BARNETT
               I don't care. I pay you people 
               twenty-five bucks an hour and keep 
               you working steady. Now either go on 
               or turn around. But move.

43     EXT. HIGHWAY

     The ambulance passes all the vehicles, including the horse rigs. 
     As he passes NORMAN'S limo:

                         MARY
               Don't worry, Norman. There's no 
               blood. Nobody's hurt.

     She climbs out of the car and moves to the freeway rail and yells 
     for some workmen below to call the police.

44     ANGLE AT DIESEL

     The driver is hurt badly. TRICYCLE MAN and STAR are there. STAR 
     looks up, relieved an ambulance is coming. His face drops as the 
     ambulance speeds past and toward the city.

45     ANGLE FURTHER BACK IN TRAFFIC

     ALBUQUERQUE is walking with KENNY. She sees STAR returning to 
     his truck. She ducks into the ivy.

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               Hurt my foot...

     STAR approaches his truck, sees ALBUQUERQUE is gone and spots 
     KSNNY.

                         STAR
               Have you seen a woman about so 
               high?

                         KENNY
               No.

                         STAR
               She had on high heels?

                         KENNY
               No.

                         STAR
               Need a ride?

     KENNY nods "yes" and climbs in the pickup.

46     ANGLE AT BRIDGE

     People are helping the injured driver. TRICYCLE MAN climbs on 
     his machine and leaves, heading toward Nashville.

47     INT. BAPTIST HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

     BARBARA JEAN is in bed. A DOCTOR is there, along with a crowd of 
     publicity people and well-wishers, including: TRIPLETTE, REESE, 
     BUD. BARNETT hovers over BARBARA JEAN. The atmosphere is 
     stifling.

                         DOCTOR
               Barbara, I'd like to talk to you 
               and Barnett alone.

                         BARNETT
               Anything you say.

     He turns to the visitors.

                         BARNETT
               Doctor says you'll have to go on 
               out now

     There are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved 
     in their own conversations. TRIPLETTE walks toward the bed, but 
     can't really get close enough. He finally captures BARNETT as 
     the people start to leave.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Excuse me, Barnett, how's she 
               doing?

     BARNETT turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers 
     who he is. He doesn't.

                         TRIPLETTE
               I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. 
               I'm John Triplette... a friend of 
               Del Reese... I was at the airport. 
               I just wanted to introduce myself. 
               I'm a great fan of hers. If there's 
               anything you need, just give me a 
               call. I'm at the Sheraton South.

                         BARNETT
               She's going to rest now.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Okay, I just wanted to see if I 
               could help out at all.

     The crowd is almost out of the room now. We see GLENN there as he 
     steps into the hallway.

                         BARNETT
               I appreciate your concern, but she 
               has to rest, so you can go on home.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Oh, sure.

     He stands there too long.

                         BARNETT
               What do you really want?

                         TRIPLETTE
               Not a thing, Barnett, really. I 
               need a little information. But, ah, 
               it can wait.

                         BARNETT
               You bet.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Okay. Thanks.

     BARNETT says "you bet" again and closes the door after TRIPLETTE. 
     BARNETT returns to the bed with BARBARA JEAN and the DOCTOR.

                         DOCTOR
               Well, it's exhaustion, pure and 
               simple, and you're going to have to 
               take a rest or you're going to be in 
               big trouble.

                         BARNETT
               She has to be at the opera tomorrow 
               night and then she can go home.

                         DOCTOR
               She's not going anywhere, Barnett. 
               This is precisely what I'm talking 
               about. She is collapsing. She 
               cannot go on without a rest or she 
               will have to stop altogether for a 
               long time.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Well, I have to go:  It's too late 
               to be replaced, and, besides, I just 
               can't do that. Those people get 
               disappointed. They've come in from 
               all over, you know, and this Miss 
               Foxy who's been writing to me for 
               years is going to be there from 
               Michigan.

                         DOCTOR
               You cannot leave this bed until I 
               say so. The two of you have to 
               understand that. Barnett, you've 
               got to stop this dovetailing and 
               give her some rest. You don't need 
               to make that much more money.

                         BARNETT
               It's not the money. The friends 
               and neighbors love her and they want 
               to see her. We got a debt to the 
               public.

                         DOCTOR
               Well, they are not going to see her 
               tomorrow night, and I suggest you 
               get on the phone and make the 
               necessary arrangements.

     the hall, smoking a cigarette. BUD is talking with a few people. 
     L.A. JOAN brings out a new cigarette and asks GLENN for a 1ight. 
     He doesn't have one, so she moves to BUD. She scares him, but he 
     lights her fresh cigarette anyway. She asks him for a ride, and

     SUELEEN is auditioning. The TRICYCLE MAN goes to the bar and 
     listens. He is one of the few people who do. SUELEEN directs 
     her performance to him.

     Also at the bar is TOM, being interviewed by OPAL.

                         TOM
               We just got a gold record.

               No  Hell, some secretary in New 
               York just hands it to you. Only 
               this one kept dropping it out of the 
               box.

                         OPAL
               Did it break?

                         TOM
               Dent it a little. Boy -- just she 
               couldn1t even find it. She had a 
               hamburger on her desk that looked 
               three weeks old.

                         OPAL
               How long have you been together?

                         TOM
               Probably a little too long.

                         OPAL
               Do you study at all?

                         TOM
               Depends on what I'm studying.

                         DELBERT
               Monday night.

                         MANAGER
               You want her to sing, too?

     Sueleen has finished her song and eavesdrops blatantly.

                         SUELEEN
               I can do benefits

               Twenty dollars for her and ten for 
               you.

               I can only give you fifty a week 
               here and ten bucks for the benefit.

                         SUELEEN
               Money's no object.

     She kisses his cheek. He hates it. He writes on a piece of 
     paper.

               You go here Monday night and be 
               there at eight sharp and look flashy 
               you know what I mean?

               Hundreds of times.

                         MANAGER
               Well, there's a couple of girls in 
               Printers Alley if you got any 
               questions. I know I've seen that G-
               string stuff for sale someplace 
               around.

                         SUELEEN
               Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.

     She isn't convincing.

                         MANAGER
               That's for sure. At the airport - 
               that's where it was. At the 
               airport, there in one of those gift 
               shops... Anyway, you better take a 
               break.

                         SUELEEN
               Thanks. You are just a wonderful

                         LINNEA
               Or course. You should come over to 
               the house. The boys would love to 
               meet you.

               That's not quite what I had in

               Well...How have you been?

                         TOM
               Well, they removed my heart last 
               week, but I'm doing fine except my 
               nose fell off. Looks a little 
               funny.

     She laughs.

               Look, I find you attractive and I 
               want to see you, so I'll call you

               done it too long not to know. But if

               enough so you won't have to do it 
               again right away. Peanut butter's

               My wire's been in the hospital so 
               things might be a little dusty, but

               You're in music, I guess, aren't 
               you?  'Cause my niece sings most of 
               the day. That won't bother you, 
               will it?

     KENNY starts to answer.

                         GREEN
               I didn't think it would. She's

               My wife and I think so, but we're

     KENNY'S eye.

               When you run out or money, 'cause 
               you will here, you can go sing at 
               Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the 
               hat. All these kids do that. Most

               Sorry to bother you, Bud.

                         BUD
               Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.

     They nod.

                         REESE
               Need to have you check these out 
               before he goes on that Walker 
               benefit.

                         BUD
               Sure thing. Put them here... I'll 
               take them.

                         REESE
               Thanks... I'll... go say hello to 
               your mom.

                         BUD
               She's in Paris.

                         REESE
               Oh... Well... Have you heard from 
               Barnett?

                         BUD
               Not yet.

                         REESE
               Let me know when you do, all right?

     REESE starts for another room.

                         BUD
               You bet.

                         REESE
               I'll just be in here.

     He catches OPAL'S eye and doesn't leave.

                         OPAL
               Do you know Barbara Jean?

                         BUD
               Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.

                         OPAL
               Haven's not going to talk to me.

                         BUD
               Sure he will.

     REESE looks at OPAL.

88     EXT. OPERA-LAND - NIGHT

     TRICYCLE MAN arrives. So do REESE and OPAL. She records 
     everything he says, more for him than her. He talks about being 
     counsel for all the Western stars and WALKER, too -

     BROWN is backstage, next to perform. An ANNOUNCER introduces the 
     acts.

91     NEW ANGLE - TOWARD AUDIENCE

     ALBUQUERQUE looks to see who is present.

92     ANGLE BACKSTAGE

     CONNIE WHITE and her entourage are gathered. HAVEN, BUD and 
     PEARL talk. OPAL and REESE arrive. As TOMMY BROWN performs, 
     TRIPLETTE makes the rounds. OPAL comes near. They are handed 
     pieces of anniversary cake.

                         OPAL
               Hi.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Hello.

                         OPAL
               I'm Opal.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.

                         OPAL
               I'm gathering information about the 
               characteristics of music people. I 
               just finished a documentary on 
               Gandi.

     He looks puzzled.

                         OPAL
               The architect  His buildings are 
               drippy. You know, like sand and 
               castles. Then I got this 
               assignment. They want to start in 
               two weeks.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Why?

                         OPAL
               Why?

                         TRIPLETTE
               What?

                         OPAL
               What? Oh. A film.

     At this point, HAVEN walks up.

                         BARNETT
               Where'd you get the cake?

     They are taken quite off guard.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Someone gave it... Here, you want 
               this... I'll...

                         HAVEN
               No.

     Somebody walks by and asks HAVEN how the PRESIDENT is.

                         HAVEN
               A little worried. Fine, though.

     TRIPLETTE clears his throat and turns his back to HAVEN and 
     continues to talk to OPAL. HAVEN walks off.

                         ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
               Ladies and gentlemen, Haven 
               Hamilton.

93     NEW ANGLE

     HAVEN grabs the mike and bursts into one of his more famous 
     songs, then overlaps it with another. At the finish, he accepts 
     applause and begins to speak about BARBARA JEAN.

                         HAVEN
               We want to send special wishes to 
               Barbara Jean who is in the Baptist 
               Hospital. She collapsed yesterday 
               morning at the plane christening. 
               Send your prayers and letters to 
               Baptist Hospital, Nashville, 
               Tennessee. Barnett said she wept 
               because she couldn't be here with 
               you friends and neighbors. But your 
               faith in the great Almighty will 
               bring her back here just to be what 
               you want her to be... And her good 
               friend, Connie White, has given up 
               some time with her own mother, who 
               is sick with a kidney disorder, to 
               fill in and send her warmth to you 
               wonderful friends and neighbors so 
               you won't be too disappointed after 
               this message from teeth-sticken, 
               good, gooey clusters.

94     ANGLE TOWARD GLENN

     GLENN politely leaves when CONNIE WHITE is announced. The

95     INT. OPERA - ANGLE BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

     ALBUQUERQUE talks to two POLICEMEN.

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               I know it's here somewhere. I had 
               it when I walked in, but you weren't 
               here. My name's Albuquerque, and 
               I'm here cutting a record. My 
               people said it would be all right.

     POLICEMAN
     Sorry, miss. No pass, no entrance. Your people should have given 
     you a pass.

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               They did. I know I'll find it 
               here.

     We HEAR HAVEN'S VOICE from the stage.

96     NEW ANGLE

     CONNIE WHITE passes ALBUQUERQUE and the POLICEMEN on her way to 
     the bathroom. ALBUQUERQUE rushes up.

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               Sister Connie... Connie. Hi, I saw 
               you out there. I just think you're 
               so beautiful. What do you think?  I 
               can't find my pass. I'm here 
               cutting a record, you know, and 
               these policemen here...

     The POLICEMEN standing right behind her. They all know she is 
     lying.

                         CONNIE
               I'm so glad you come for a little 
               while, and thank you.

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               I could just sit where I was. I 
               wasn't bothering anybody. That guy 
               asking everybody questions made more 
               noise than I ever did. You saw me 
               there. You signed this program.

     A MAN walks into the group.

                         MAN
               Miss Connie, you're next.

     CONNIE smiles and squeezes ALBUQUERQUE'S hand.

                         CONNIE
               Oh, honey, I gotta go. Thanks for 
               coming. You read what I wrote you 
               now.

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               I did. You said, 'your friend, 
               Connie.'

     CONNIE has disappeared and the POLICE start to usher out 
     ALBUQUERQUE. She tries to see and hear as:

97     INT. OPERA - STAGE AREA - NIGHT

     Connie White starts to sing. She does a few of her tunes.

     CUT TO:

98     EXT. OPERA - NIGHT

     TRICYCLE MAN is the first to leave. He's with L.A. JOAN. After 
     they drive away, there is an exodus.

99     INT. OPERA - NIGHT

     After everyone else has gone, KENNY sits alone in the audience.

     INTERCUT WITH
     SEQUENCE IN OPERA:

100     INT. SUELEEN'S MOTEL APARTMENT - NIGHT

     SUELEEN is in her mirror applying a whole face based upon the 
     stars of the forties. She is listening to the OPERA ON the RADIO 
     and eating pork and beans and tuna from cans. Her room is tilled 
     with photographs of herself and Catholic symbols. She goes to 
     the closet and selects a gown. She is preparing an outfit and 
     face for the benefit.

     CUT TO:

101     INT. BAPTIST HOSPITAL - BAAHARA JEAN'S ROOM

     We HEAR the tail end of CONNIE WHITE'S SONG on the radio. BARNETT 
     is intently listening.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Would you turn that off

     He continues to listen until the end.

                         BARBARA JEAN 
               Barnett, please -

                         BARNETT
               What's wrong honey.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               I don't want to listen to her sing 
               -

                         BARNETT
               Don't feel that way, honey.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Then why are you listening to her -

                         BARNETT
               Well, I have to go thank her for 
               filling in and it's nice to know the 
               tune she sang.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               You have to what?

                         BARNETT
               Go to the King Of the Road and 
               thank her.

     BARBARA JEAN gets up out of bed.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Well here, why don't you take her 
               some of these flowers while you're 
               at it.

     She begins pulling flowers from various vases.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Maybe you'd like to work out 
               something with her, too... Split us 
               up... Her on the road and me in town 
               or in the hospital --
                     (she wails)
               Barnett!

     She sits down on the floor at the foot of the bed and begins to 
     cry. BARNETT backs off. If she was hoping for understanding, 
     she is not about to receive it.

                         BARNETT
               What the hell is wrong with you?  
               Huh?

     He bends down and looks at her with the eyes of a race horse 
     owner whose investment Just collapsed in the stretch.

                         BARNETT
               Wait a minute. You're not going 
               nutsey on me, are you?  Huh...? 
               You're not going to have one of 
               those nervous breakdowns or 
               anything, are you?

     Afraid she has gone too far, BARBARA JEAN stops crying and tries 
     to make everything all right. But she is still choking in her 
     own panic of being left.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               A... No... No, I'm just... I'm 
               really fine... I just.
                     (she gets up)
               don't want you to think I'm giving 
               up or anything like that...

     BARNETT looks at her as if from now on he will suspect her of 
     secretly being crazy. He begins to pick up the flowers from the 
     floor.

                         BARNETT
               I'll just take these on over to 
               her. Show her your appreciation.

     BARBARA JEAN crawls numbly back into her bed, nodding 
     affirmatively.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Sure... you go on and do that.

     She begins to shiver. BARNETT looks at her, but he makes no 
     attempt to come any closer.

                         BARBARA JEAN
                     (very small)
               Barnett?

     He leans in and pats her arm gingerly.

                         BARNETT
               I'll tell her thank you, for you.

     BARBARA JEAN nods affirmatively, still shivering.

                         BARBARA JEAN
                     (please hold me 
                     voice)
               Barnett?

                         BARNETT
               What?

     She senses he can't go any further.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Bye, bye.

     He looks at her again and leaves.

                         BARNETT
               Bye. bye.

     He is not out the door before the tears begin again and she turns 
     into her pillow so he won't hear her.

102     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

     GREEN has come from his wife's room. He sees BARNETT walk down 
     the hall. After a moment's deliberation, GREEN enters BARBARA 
     JEAN'S room.

103     INT. BARBARA JEAN'S ROOM

     We SEE GREEN come in the door. BARBARA JEAN is sti1l trying to 
     control herself, but is not having much luck with it.

                         BARBARA JEAN
                     (to the pillow)
               I just get so afraid sometimes. 
               Then I get more afraid. : Just want 
               you to hold me.

     MR. GREEN can't bear what she's saying. He hesitates for a 
     minute and then figures what the hell.

                         GREEN
               Hello.

     She freezes, thinking BARNETT has come back and she will be 
     discounted as totally insane.

                         GREEN
               Am I disturbing you?

                         BARBARA JEAN
               I'm really all right, Barnett. 
               Don't you worry really... I just 
               don't want you to leave me that's 
               all.

     She turns and screams at GREEN.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Oh, my God.

     She scares GREEN, too, but he recovers better.

                         GREEN
               Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare 
               you.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               How did you come in here?

                         GREEN
               Well, my wife, Ester's down the 
               hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I 
               was just talking to Ester about your 
               being here.     She loves you so much, 
               I just had to come down and say 
               hello. We've been following you 
               since you were a girl. Well, I just 
               scared you to death. I didn't mean 
               to do that.

     She listens to him. The words somehow comfort her and she begins 
     to laugh.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Well, I guess you caught me at a 
               weak moment.

                         GREEN
               You'll have to speak up.

     Realizing he can't hear too well makes her feel a little more 
     secure.

                         BARBARA JEAN
                     (louder)
               I said, I've been real tired.

                         GREEN
               Eater  says she doesn't see how you 
               do it.

                         BARBARA JEAN
                     (loudly)
               What's wrong with her.

                         GREEN
               Oh just about everything, I guess. 
               Those doctors started on an overhaul 
               and don't want to quit. They keep 
               taking things out. She's going to 
               come home an egg shell. Tough,

               What did you say your name was?

                         GREEN
               Green.

     BARBARA JEAN Well, Mr. Green, you tell those doctors to stop that 
     whittling and get her some Vitamin E. Have her take that three 
     times a day, along with some good meals. If I could cook for 
     her, she'd be well in a minute.

     A NURSE enters.

                         NURSE
               Well, Mr. Green.

                         GREEN
               Hi, Sherry.

                         NURSE
               How'd you get in here.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               It's fine. We were just talking 
               about Vitamin S.

                         GREEN
               I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               You remember what I said about the 
               Vitamins.

     know where MARY is.

                         NORMAN
               Maybe she's at the Opera.

                         BILL

     NORMAN shrugs.

     BARNETT, with the flowers, enters and sits in the lounge. 

107     ANOTHER ANGLE

     It is getting crowded by people returning from the Opera.

     OPAL is on one of the house phones, talking to Paris. We can also 
     HEAR the HOUSE PHONE OPERATOR behind the switchboard desk. OPAL 
     speaks in a combination of English and French. She isn't saying 
     much in one language and she might just be talking to the 
     OPERATOR, but is sounds impressive.

108     NEW ANGLE

     CONNIE WHITE and her group step into the lobby. The MC in the 
     lounge, spots her and coaxes her into taking the stage and 
     singing one of her hits. When she finishes, BARNETT walks up and 
     thanks her, handing her the flowers. Meanwhile, HAVEN, who is 
     there with BUD and PEARL, tells TRIPLETTE that CONNIE and BARBARA 
     JEAN will replace each other, but never appear on the same bill. 
     After BARNETT exits, CONNIE leaves with HAVEN, BUD, PEARL and 
     TRIPLETTE. OPAL is still on the phone, now speaking in Ita1ian.

     TRIPLETTE enters the room and starts to take it in. MARY comes 
     from the bathroom, her face swollen. BILL and MARY act as if 
     nothing has happened.

                         TRIPLETTE

               a quiet Sunday at home.

     TRIPLETTE laughs nervously.

               Well, I'm here putting together a

                         MARY
               Oh, no.

                         TRIPLETTE

                         BILL
               He's pretty well known all over.

                         TRIPLETTE
               I was wondering if you'd like to be 
               in it. It's going to be televised 
               and...

     bottle on the floor.

     MARY smiles.

                         MARY
               Well, we can't. We're registered 
               Democrats.

     BILL ignores her.

                         BILL

                         TRIPLETTE
               ABC.

                         BILL
               How much?

                         TRIPLETTE
               Minimum.

     MARY looks at BILL.

                         MARY
               We can't support him  We're 
               registered Democrats.

     BILL begins the fight again.

                         BILL
               It's an appearance. It has nothing 
               to do with support. I don't even 
               like him.

                         MARY
               Bill, he's a crazy man.

     TRIPLETTE moves in fast.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Well, he- expressed a particular 
               wish to have you on.

     They stop and look at him suspiciously.

                         MARY
               What for?

                         TRIPLETTE
               You're real favorites of his.

     They seem to change viewpoints in a moment.

                         MARY
               You're kidding.

                         BILL
               How come?

     TRIPLETTE settles in like they were old friends.

                         TRIPLETTE
               First you have to understand how 
               much he admires you.

     MARY and BILL get caught up in the sincerity. 

                         TRIPLETTE
               You sing for people and that's what 
               he's about. He wants to help 
               people. Especially now, you know.

     BILL bypasses all the talk about WALKER.

                         BILL
               Where'd he ever see us?

                         TRIPLETTE
                     (bluffing)
               D.C.

                         BILL
               D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came 
               there?

                         TRIPLETTE
               Sure thing.

                         MARY
               What National TV...?

                         TRIPLETTE
               You're doing some recording here, 
               aren't you?

                         MARY

                         TRIPLETTE
               Might be good for you.

     BILL takes another shot of tequilla.

                         BILL
               We'll sing.

     TRIPLETTE shakes his hand.

               they get fungus.

                         KENNY
               Fungus?

                         MOTHER (V.0.)
               He doesn1t have fungus, does he?

                         KENNY
               I don't think so.

                         MOTHER (V.0.)
               Well, you'll get it, skin as 
               sensitive as yours.

                         KENNY
               How do you know if they do?

     He looks suspiciously at the dog in his room.

                         MOTHER (V.0.)
               Weather's been awful. All those 
               bombs dropping. It changes our 
               weather. Sure not like the good old 
               days.

                         KENNY
                     (still looking at 
                     the dog)
               Does their hair fall out?

                         MOTHER (V.0.)
               Your hair fell out? Just like your 
               father. Weak hair.

     KENNY signals the dog to get off the bed. He's getting worried. 
     L.A. JOAN will have wandered in and out during this phone call.

                         KENNY
               Listen. Maybe I should go...

                         MOTHER (V.0.)
               I've been a Little dyspeptic.

                         KENNY
               I want to get the dog off my bed.

                         MOTHER (V.0.)
               But, I'll take some of that 
               Nyquil... you know it puts you right 
               to sleep no matter what's wrong, you 
               go right off...

     KENNY is really impatient to get the dog oft his bed.

                         KENNY
               Okay. I'll be talking to you.

                         MOTHER (V.0.)
               Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from 
               you.

                         KENNY
               Bye.

     KENNY hangs up the receiver and starts for his room and the dog.

               I have to try to get my car

               Good. I came out here to meet some 
               underground singer. They say she 
               only writes in those trees over

               gather some information about the 
               characteristics of music people for 
               English television. I started in

               you know, and I just love marine

               Star - oh! that's a fantastic name. 
               Almost as good as Opal. I changed 
               my name in Taos. This man that was 
               really into low budget movies said 
               my eyes were opalistic.

     The studio door is burst open on TOM who is singing. BILL is 
     forced to stand still. TOM doesn't look up until he in finished.

                         TOM
               Howdy.

                         BILL
               Where the hell have you been?

     TOM and MARY bounce a look, her face is a little discolored.

                         TOM
               You guys been having any fun?

     He gets up and starts out the door. BILL is very anxious.

                         BILL
               Where are you going?

                         TOM
               To the bathroom.

     He goes through the swinging door.

                         BILL
               Hat! 

143     INT. HALLWAY

     TOM is on the phone. MARY makes her way toward his back. There 
     is no answer to his call, so he hangs up and faces her.

                         MARY
               Hi.

     Long pause.

                         TOM
               You look terrific.

     Another pause. BILL sticks his head out from the studio room.

                         BILL
               Hey!

                         TOM
               It's the den mother.

     MARY walks pant TOM into the studio room. TOM holds up a finger 
     to indicate he'll be a minute and walks toward the bathroom. 
     MARY reaches BILL.

                         BILL
               Come on, dammit. They want to 
               check levels.

     they exit together.

145     INT. BAPTIST HOSPITAL - BARBARA JEAN'S ROOM - DAY

     BARBARA JEAN is sitting at the foot of the bed. A NURSE in there 
     talking to BARNETT.

                         NURSE
               The doctor is out of town.

                         BARNETT
               I know that and don't you worry, 
               I'm going to get her right into bed.

                         NURSE
               She must rest.

                         BARNETT
               I have this release form signed by 
               the floor doctor.

     The PHONE RINGS.

                         BARNETT
               Yes.

                         TRIPLETTE (V.0.)
               Barnett, John Triplette. How's she 
               doing?

                         BARNETT
               She's fine.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Well, I just thought I'd call.

                         BARNETT
               Well, you did and she's fine. 
               Thanks.

     He hangs up. The NURSE is reading the forms. BARBARA JEAN is 
     going through the flowers... She finds GLENN'S and reads the 
     note.

                         NURSE
               Well, I don't know.

                         BARNETT
               I have a nurse waiting for her in 
               the bus.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Who brought these?

                         NURSE
               I don't remember seeing those.

                         BARNETT
               Somebody brought them. Come on, 
               honey, let's go.

     She puts them on the gurney with the others.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               Well, thank you all so much. You 
               tell the other ladies thank you.

                         NURSE
               Well all right.

     As they start out, DELBERT enters.

                         REESE
               How is she?

                         BARNETT
               A little slow, but she'll be fine.

                         REESE
               Have you talked to Triplette?

                         BARNETT
               Who the hell is he?

                         REESE
               He's lining up talent for Hal 
               Phillip Walker.

                         BARNETT
               Who the hell is he?

                         REESE
               He's going to run for president.

                         BARNETT
               Third party?

                         REESE
               He has that sign with the tree.

                         BARNETT
               What does he want?

                         REESE
               Barbara Jean.

                         BARNETT
               What!

                         REESE
               That's what he wants.

                         BARNETT
               You know better than that.

                         REESE
               It's on National television, 
               Barnett.

                         BARNETT
               I don't care. She's always been 
               neutral in politics and that's not 
               going to change.

     There is a pause. BARNETT and REESE have been talking away from 
     BARBARA JEAN.

                         REESE
               Well, how about the shopping 
               center?

                         BARNETT
               Yes. She's pretty rested up.

                         REESE
               Okay, then we'll see you there.

                         BARNETT
               Okay.

     REESE leaves. BARNETT returns to BARBARA JEAN and the NURSE.

                         BARNETT
               Okay, come on, honey. How are you 
               feeling?

146     INT. Hospital RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

     BARNETT and BARBARA JEAN come from the elevator. GLENN is there 
     writing. He sees her,  As BARRETT and BARBARA JEAN leave, GREEN 
     arrives with flowers for his wife. He sees BARBRA JEAN and hands 
     her a flower.

                         GREEN
               You going today?

                         BARBARA JEAN
                     (loudly)
               Thank you-- Yes, I am.

                         GREEN
               I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled 
               I saw you again.

                         BARBARA JEAN
                     (loudly)
               You get her those Vitamin E right 
               away.

                         GREEN
                     (shows her the 
                     bottle) 
               I got them right here.

     BARBARA JEAN feels BARNETT'S impatience to go.

                         BARBARA JEAN 
               Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.

                         GREEN
               Bye, Bye.

     She goes on out the door as he walks to the desk.

146A     NEW ANGLE

                         GREEN
               Where have you got her hidden 
               today?

     He hands the NURSE a flower. She looks up in disbelief.

                         NURSE
               Mr. Green?

                         GREEN
               Yes, ma'am. How are you today?

                         NURSE
               Didn't you get?... How are you?

                         GREEN
               I'm fine. Can I go up?

                         NURSE
               Let me see if I can get the doctor 
               hold on one second.

     She makes several phone calls and can't locate anyone. She sighs 
     and hangs up.

                         GREEN
               You want me to wait?

                         NURSE
               No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to 
               tell you this -- your wire passed 
               away -- I thought they'd called you 
               at home.

     GREEN has and hasn't heard.

                         GREEN
               What?

                         NURSE
                     (louder)
               Your wire Ester - she passed away.

     He is stunned.

                         NURSE
               If you'll wait Just a minute I'll 
               get everything from the business 
               office.

146B     ANOTHER ANGLE

     He wanders to the waiting area. GLENN has been looking out the 
     window at BARBARA JEAN getting into the bus. He comes back and 
     begins to talk to GREEN so caught up in her he doesn't register 
     GREEN'S grief.

                         GLENN
                     (loudly)
               My mamma used to know her... They 
               lived next door to each other... she 
               said she was always nursing the sick 
               animals.

     GREEN looks at him and nods. He's still got the vitamins in his 
     hand.

                         GLENN
               I really learned all about her from 
               my Momma -- She's been saving this 
               scrap book about her since she got 
               to be famous.

     GREEN nods.

                         GLENN
               The one thing she said to me when I 
               joined was "When you're doing your 
               travels you be sure you see Barbara 
               Jean. You don't have to say 
               anything about me but you be sure 
               you see her."  So that's what I've 
               been doing. Now I'm going to hitch 
               a ride so I can see her in Memphis.

     GREEN nods.

                         GLENN
               You give my test to your wife1

     GREEN nods and puts the vitamins in his pocket as the NURSE calls 
     from the desk.

                         NURSE
               Mr. Green, the doctor is on his way 
               and the business office has your 
               bill ready.

153     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     SUELEEN almost trips over REESE and TRIPLETTE and another man who 
     are talking.

                         SUELEEN
               Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.

               I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I 
               got all caught up in looking at you.

                         TRIPLETTE
               May I see your costume?

     She removes her coat and exposes a costume that looks like a 
     picture of a frosty glass or gin and tonic on a hot day. 
     TIRIPLETTE stares blatantly and REESE can hardly keep his hands 
     off her. SUELEEN starts into her routine as a matter of 
     survival.

                         SUELEEN
               You like it?  Listen, where is the 
               pianist?  I need to go over this

     TRIPLETTE smiles.

               Someday I'm gonna be a star like 
               Barbara Jean.

     TRIPLETTE puts his arm around her and walks off.

154     NEW ANGLE

                         TRIPLETTE
               Sueleen, you're prettier and 
               probably sing better. Besides, she 
               is unusually sick. And tonight you 
               have the opportunity to work in 
               front of some grateful gentlemen. 

     They continue to walk past the many places. 

                         TRIPLETTE
               Have you ever done this before?

     She shakes her head, "no" quite caught up in air.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Well, it's not too hard. You'll 
               sing whatever it is you want to 
               sing. They'll applaud like crazy 
               'cause I can tell them that you're 
               really something and then the piano 
               and drum will give you a little 
               fanfare and you can sing and take 
               off your clothes or not sing. It 
               really doesn't make much difference, 
               really. But since you've never done 
               this before, singing might help.

     They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the 
     oven.

               Now this is to raise funds for 
               someone who can help people who are 
               less fortunate than yourself. The 
               more you take off, you see, more 
               money we can raise.

                         SUELEEN
                     (like a robot)
               I see.

                         TRIPLETTE
               I know that you are an artist and I 
               am sure you are very religious.

     She nods "yes."

                         TRIPLETTE
               Well, this is for people who have a 
               kind of religious belief in the way 
               they live.

     The waiters come in to serve the salad and the rolls and the chef 
     starts to carve the meat. We FOLLOW one of the waiters into the

156     INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

     It is almost full. The pianist and the drummer are on the non-

     The men have finished their dinner and SUELEEN finishes her song. 
     The applause is thunderous. SUELEEN looks to the kitchen door.

     TRIPLETTE is applauding like crazy. REESE in beside him.

160     ANGLE AT SUELEEN

     She blows kisses then runs to TRIPLETTE.

                         SUELEEN
               Don't you think they'd just love 
               another song instead?

                         TRIPLETTE
               Now, Sueleen, you know that's not 
               what we talked about right here in 
               this very room.

     It's too late. The ANNOUNCER speaks. 

                         ANNOUNCER
               We're ready to striiippppp... for 
               cash, gentlemen. The time has come 
               to dig deep. Our little Sueleen in 
               going to dig deep for you.

     There are a few chortles. Suddenly she freezes. TRIPLETTE holds 
     her and kisses her hair.

     ALBUQUERQUE is totally fascinated and delighted, applauding to

     REESE drives SUSLEEN home. He is drunk. He double-parks.

                         REESE
               Here we are, Sueleen.

     She looks out the window and nods. He gets out and opens the 
     door as LADY PEARL walks past them on her way to the lounge. 
     STAR drives up behind REESE'S double-parked ear and has to move 
     around it. SUELEEN starts for her room, but REESE follows very 
     close. Finally, he turns her around.

                         REESE
               Sueleen... Sueleen Gay.

     His look says what he wants. She is terrified.

                         SUELEEN
               Oh, no.

     She starts to walk quickly, but he grabs her arm.

                         REESE
               Wait a minute!  I want to look at 
               you. C'mon.

                         SUELEEN
               Oh, please, Oh, God.

     He pushes her against one or the storefronts.

                         REESE
               C'mon! I Just wanna look...

     He squeezes her arm and she screams.

167     CONTINUED:

                         REESE
               Good. I wanna look really good. 
               You know what I mean? Do you?  Huh?

     She is about to pass out from terror, when all or a sudden he 
     eases of.

168     NEW ANGLE

     The TRICYCLE MAN stands and watches a few feet away. SUELEEN'S 
     terror now is divided between the two men. REESE can't handle 
     the way the TRICYCLE MAN looks at all.

                         REESE
               Oh.

     He releases SUELEEN, turns and runs up the street. She slides 
     down and hugs herself. The TRICYCLE MAN doesn't move.

                         SUELEEN
               It'll be okay... It'll be okay... I 
               know it'll be fine...

     After a while, she pulls herself up and starts up the stairs to 
     her room. The TRICYCLE MAN watches until she is gone, then walks 
     across the street.

               I was in prison for twenty-eight 
               years.

               twice. .. Been out three months.

               I'm not sure...

                         WADE
               I'm forty-six. Do you like to go 
               up or down?

                         LINNEA
               What?

                         WADE
               High?  Do you ever get high? A walk 
               on the wild side. Ever do dust?

     Before TOM can sit down he is called on stage by the MC. Also 
     present are BILL, MARY and NORMAN, talking about NORMAN'S act and 
     OPAL, who interviews them. LINNEA sees TOM.

                         WADE
               All I need is fifteen minutes a 
               night.

                         LINNEA
               Fifteen minutes?

                         WADE
               Sleep. That's all I need. Don't 
               want to waste no time sleeping. You 
               married?

               What...?  0h, yes.

                         WADE
               Not me. Ain't never loved anybody.

               be part of a group. You remember?

     Everybody laughs.

     Well, they're here, Bill and Mary. We're cutting a record here. 
     So far, they've done all the work. It's an accident they're here. 
     I've been hiding from them for days now, right?

     Everybody laughs.

     TOM calls BILL and MARY to the stage. The three of them burst 
     into:  "Since You've Gone."  When they finish, BILL and MARY sit 
     down again.

                         TOM
               I'd like to sing a new song for 
               you. I threw away a good one I wrote 
               yesterday. maybe it was the day 
               before -- anyway.. Let's go here, 
               'I'm Easy.'

     WADE starts in again.

               Love, that's a word that's been 
               overused. I'll say I sure like you. 
               Maybe...

     LINNEA is wiping her eyes with a hanky.

     A large group of people starts out the door, among them TOM and 
     L.A. JOAN. TOM steers himself and JOAN to LINNEA'S table. BILL 
     and MARY catch him there. All the while he is talking to them, 
     he writes a note and places it in LINNEA'S lap. OPAL walks past 
     TOM. They look at each other.

                         BILL
               Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV 
               day after tomorrow. At the park...

                         TOM
               National?

                         BILL
               Yes. Percy Warner Park'.

                         MARY
               Where are you staying?

                         TOM
               Is that for that Walker guy?

                         BILL
               Yes, but we're just singing.

                         MARY
               Sue was trying to get hold of you.

                         TOM
               Come on. He's a crook.

                         BILL
               What crook?

                         WADE
               I'm a Roman Catholic. You're 
               Baptist, I bet. Catholic means 
               universal, everything, know what I 
               mean?

     She nods again. She can't make out the writing with out her 
     glasses and she doesn't want to put them now.

                         WADE
               I'm a scholar of the Bible as well 
               and we're all going to answer to 
               God. Have you read the book of 
               Revelations?

     She nods 'yes.'

                         WADE
               You ever read the 'Apocalypse 
               Unsealed?' 

     She is too curious. She takes out her glasses and looks through 
     them lorgnette style as WADE continues to talk.

                         TOM
               I'm not coming anywhere near that 
               place. He's a rotten guy.

                         MARY
               That's not true.

                         TOM
               He's a politician.

                         BILL
               He saw us at Tammany Hall.

                         TOM
               The Hell he did. Look, I'll see 
               you in the morning.

                         MARY
               Really?

                         TOM
               You bet. Nine, right?  But count

               me after. They said they couldn't

                         LINNEA
               What?

                         LINNEA
               I'm sorry but I have to go.

     She gets up quickly and leaves. Everybody is gone, too.

     musicians prepare for the show. Finally, the bus door opens and 
     BARNETT leads BARBARA JEAN to the platform. The musicians start

               just about everywhere, aren't you?

     THIPLETTE
     I came out to see how you all were doing.

                         BARNETT
               I think I should tell you I know 
               why you're here. The answer is no 
               ... we don't get involved in 
               politics.

                         TRIPLETTE

               Well, that's not entirely true, 
               Barnett. At least not according to 
               Haven.

               poker together since we were 
               fourteen.

                         TRIPLETTE
               I guess that's why he thought you 
               right want to help out.

                         BARNETT
               He knows better.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Well, it's probably because it 
               would help him.

                         BARNETT
               How is that?

                         TRIPLETTE
               Everybody likes to be as good as 
               their word.

               Whose word?

                         TRIPLETTE
               His Word.

                         TRIPLETTE
               That's pretty close. He's going to 
               be on the bill. Why not put Barbara 
               Jean on with him?

     She fights back the tears.

                         BARNETT
               Don't worry, I'll take care or it

                         BARBARA JEAN
               You're so good.

     He blows her a kiss and steps from the bus.

183     EXT. BUS - DAY

     BARNETT sends the nurses inside. GLENN has pushed to front of 
     the crowd. BARHETT grabs a hand mike.

                         BARNETT
               She's fine now, folks. Just too 
               soon after the hospital, I guess.
                     (he pauses)
               She won't be able to continue and 
               she's in the bus crying her eyes 
               out, because she doesn't want to 
               disappoint the people who love her 
               the most.

     There is a group groan. BARNETT looks for some under-standing 
     but there is none. There are several catcalls and GLENN, who in 
     near BARNETT, becomes so enraged, he tries to find the caller. 
     There is almost a fight, but TRIPLETTE intervenes. He glances to 
     GLENN.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Come on, come on. You don't want 
               to waste your energy on that fool.

184     NEW ANGLE

     Catcalls continue from other parts of the audience. TRIPLETTE 
     shouts against GLENN, who has turned his intensity to the crowd

                         GLENN
               She's frail. You never saw anybody 
               so frail. I've seen her breathe hard 
               just standing still, dammit. You're 
               selfish. Worst selfish I've ever 
               heard. What if she died?  Would you 
               like that?  You'd probably say she 
               faked it so they could make money. 
               Well, you're just dumb.

185     NEW ANGLE

                         TRIPLETTE
               We could invite them to the park.

                         BARNETT
               What?

                         TRIPLETTE
               They can come to the concert in the 
               park.

                         BARNETT
               I said 'no!'

     BARNETT studies the angry crowd then TRIPLETTE, who is holding 
     back GLENN against them. The crowd is even more angry

                         BARNETT
                     (to crowd)
               We're very Sorry... Please... If 
               you'll listen.
                     (he makes the 
                     decision)
               You can see her tomorrow at Percy 
               Warner Park...

     GLENN has disengaged from TRIPLETTE'S hold and pushed his way to 
     the back.

                         BARNETT
               Triplette, I want to talk to you.

     Moves closer.

                         BARNETT
               I got trapped and you know it, so 
               let's have some rules.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I 
               understand your position.

                         BARNETT
               No, you don't, so don't say you do. 
               Bunch of damn liars. What do you 
               get out or this?

                         TRIPLETTE
               Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.

                         BARNETT
               Your job, huh.

     He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he 
     speaks.

                         BARNETT
               She will not appear on the stage or 
               support that Walker guy and you 
               can't have any of his signs up while 
               she sings. She'll be on first and 
               out of the park before he shows up. 
               There will be no pictures, no 
               questions, no answers or tying her 
               name up with his now or in the 
               future to come. Any money she makes 
               will go to the President of the 
               United States.

     He calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the 
     statement. Then the secretary signs.

                         BARNETT
               We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send 
               her three songs over this afternoon. 
               She'll be done about ten minutes 
               after she starts and Walker better 
               not show up till she's through. Now, 
               get out of here.

     TRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores 
     it. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S 
     attention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary.

                         MAN
               Barnett?

                         BARNETT
                     (sharply)
               What?

                         MAN
               Well, Barnett, I have this terrific 
               song I've been working on. It would 
               be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like 
               you to take a look at it.

     BARNETT looks at him suspiciously.

                         BARNETT
               I'm very busy right now.
                     (to secretary) 
                     Get me Haven.

                         MAN
               It'll just take a minute. Here, 
               I'll even hold it for you.

     BABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the 
     same as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged.

                         BARNETT
               I don't know where you got this, 
               but something tells me you stole it 
               and I hate thieves.

     The MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him -- 
     BARNETT yells after him.

                         BARNETT
               Aren't you an engineer...?  I know 
               you -- Don't you work at one of 
               those cut a record places...? 
               Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it? 
               Usually their last twenty-five...

     The MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the 
     crowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the 
     MAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and 
     hits the windshield with it. The car MISFIRES but finally 
     starts.. As the MAN drives off, BARNETT stands watching until 
     he's out of sight.

186     EXT. FAIRGROUND - DAY

     We SEE a fairground, then a roller rink, and a wrestling ring, 
     and finally a small portable stage in the center of a circular 
     track. The grandstands are partially ruled and stock cars roar 
     from another part or the field;

     Around the stage -we SEE a sign that says, "Talent Show Tonight" 
     and we see the contestants and the MC, and NORMAN doing a routine 
     with an accordion player. After NORMAN finishes, the NC takes 
     the mike.

                         MC
               Thank you, Mr. Berguan. And now we 
               bring you, 'Albuquerque.'

     ALBUQUERQUE walks to the mike. 

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               Hello, everybody. My name is 
               Albuquerque.

     There are-a few nasty remarks.

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               I'm going to sing a wonderful tune.

     She starts to sing, "You're an Old Smoothie," and as she does the 
     stock cars leave the pit and drive to the entrance of the track. 
     ALEBUQUERQUE, disturbed at first, sings louder. The cars are 
     waiting for the talent show to set off the track.

188     NEW ANGLE

     Albuquerque starts to take off her clothes. The MC hasn't 
     noticed, but the grandstand has. People shout, "Take it off..."  
     ALBUQUERQUE loves it. Before ALBUQUERQUE can remove the last two 
     garments, the MC rushes over and grabs the mike.

                         MC
               We'd 1ike~to announce the winner of 
               tonight's contest. Albuquerque, How

                         ALBUQUERQUE
               Oh, I'm not through.

                         MC
               That's all, folks.

     The stands are calling to have her take it all off and her fellow 
     contestants are furious. RAVEN, BUD and PEARL are there and they 
     discuss her act.

                         MC
               Here is the twenty dollars first 
               prize money and a seat in the 
               grandstands and now let's turn the 
               show over to Al Allen in the race 
               stand.

     He shuts oft the mike.

189     NEW ANGLE - TRACK

     The stock cars start around the track and stop in front or the 
     race announcer.

     AL
               Congratulations to Albuquerque and 
               welcome, everyone, to the Memorial 
               Race for Billy Apple, who died a 
               week ago in a wreck at this very 
               track, and we want you to know his 
               last words were, 'Are the other 
               fellows all right?'

     A wave of applause and we SEE the talent show make its way across 
     the rack. The platform is already torn down and the MC is 
     helping ALBUQUERQUE dress. As she passes the drivers, they cheer 
     and she blows them a kiss and loses her first garment as she 
     does. More cheers.

190     NEW ANGLE

     The cars are dented. On the side of one car it says, "Haven 
     Hamilton," and now we see him, BUD and PEARL in the stands. On 
     the side of another car it says, "Connie White."

     AL
     Want you all to save a dime every day and next Saturday we'll 
     take up a collection and give it all to Billy Apple's wife. 
     Share. Their four kids will sure miss their daddy. Want to 
     announce Bob Trilltree is out of the hospital now. Hope you'll 
     be back with us soon. All right, would you stand, please?

     The people stand to a scratchy record of the National Anthem. A 
     '74 Pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium-sized 
     American flag which flaps as the convertible drive.. At the end 
     of the song the Pontiac drives off the track.

     AL
     This is for Billy Apple. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's pick 
     ourselves a winner.

191     NEW ANGLE

     The drivers get into their cars and start up. The track man 
     waves a flag which starts them around the track in pairs. We 
     notice the TRICYCLE MAN, who has been there all the time. The 
     race starts and the SOUND is deafening. ALBUQUERQUE is thrilled 
     to death. Suddenly, STAR sneaks up on her as she whistles with 
     her fingers in her mouth.

                         STAR
               Winifred.

                         ALBUQUERQUE

                         STAR
               Winifred, the kids want you home 
               and so do I.

                         ALBUQUERQUE

                         STAR
               Come on.

     She has no choice but to follow him out. Several people 
     compliment her as she leaves the grandstand. She buys a bag of 
     peanuts on the way out.

               Wrong.

                         LINNEA
               I have to go. He sighs.

                         TOM
               I know.

     She makes a more to leave.

               Stay.

                         LINNEA

               Car pool?

     She laughs and eases out of the bed.

                         TOM
               When did you think it would happen?

                         LINNEA

                         TOM
               I knew when I first met you.

                         LINNEA
               Oh.

     She starts to go into the bathroom.

                         TOM
               How old are you?

                         LINNEA

                         TOM
               Older than thirty?

     She nods.

                         TOM
               Terrific!  Who was that black guy? 
               A friend of yours?

                         LINNEA
               That's unkind.

                         TOM
               Come on, you ever been attracted to 
               a black guy?

     She looks at him close, then goes into the bathroom and shuts the 
     door.

193     INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

     We HEAR TOM making a phone call. LINNEA grabs a towel and wraps 
     it around her head and throws back the shower curtain, only to 
     find a huge black cockroach in the tub. TOM laughs as she shuts 
     the curtain in horror, then she proceeds to take a sponge bath. 
     She leaves the bathroom quickly.

194     INT. MOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

     TOM is still on the phone. LINNEA dresses, but can't find her 
     slip. She finishes and heads for the door.

                     (into phone)
               Just a minute.

     He steps to LINNEA and puts his arms around her. 

                         TOM
               I'll talk to you tomorrow.

                         LINNEA
               That's what you said before.

                         TOM
               I know. Goodbye.

     He kisses her and walks back to the bed. As she gets to the 
     door, she is hit with something,  It is her slip.

                         TOM
               Maybe you better keep that.

     He smiles and she walks out the door.

                         TRIPLETTE
               Sure thing. 

                         GLENN
               Thanks.

                         TRIPLETTE

     TRIPLETTE hands her the note as BARRETT angrily steps up. 
     Someone calls  "places."

                         BARNETT
               They screwed up. You go on after 
               the choir.

     TOMMY BROWN joins LINNEA and the choir on stage. We SEE TOM 
     wandering and avoiding BILL, but catching MARY'S eye. OPAL is 
     near as is LA JOAN. BARBARA JEAN reads GLENN'S note: "If I die 
     tomorrow, I lived today."

203     NEW ANGLE

     The applause builds.

                         ANNOUNCER
               Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Barbara 
               Jean...

     The audience is swept away.

204     NEW ANGLE

     In the audience we see KENNY and the TRICYCLE MAN and WADE. 
     SUELEEN is there, too.

205     ANOTHER ANGLE -- STAGE AREA

     As BARBARA JEAN sings, GLENN stands next to BARNETT. She finishes 
     the song and looks in GLENN'S direction.

206     ANGLE - BARBARA JEAN

     She is leaning on a stool.

                         BARBARA JEAN
               I want to thank you for all your 
               good wishes. You are so important 
               to Barnett and me. Now I want to 
               sing a special song for all our 
               soldier boys.

     The orchestra starts. She calls for HAVEN to come out. The 
     applause swells and, they start a song together.

207     EXT. FRONT OF PARK - DAY

     A long black limo is parked near two ambulances, the attendants 
     sitting on the ambulance fenders and joking.

208     ANGLE - STAGE

     BARBARA JEAN and HAVEN have finished the soldier song. The choir 
     comes out to back her now. The audience picks up the song they 
     sing. After the song everyone claps loudly, and a large bouquet 
     of flowers gets handed up to BARBARA JEAN. They hug as someone 
     begins to unfurl a "HAL PHILIP WALKER" banner behind them. 
     Photographers crowd in. Suddenly there is a sharp jolt in 
     HAVEN'S body and BARBARA JEAN is down. There is brief confusion, 
     but the choir continues to sing and everyone thinks BARBARA JEAN 
     has fainted again.

209     NEW ANGLE

     The confusion mounts as both HAVEN and BARBARA JEAN are down and 
     there are flowers lying all over the place

                         HAVEN
               Barnett!  My God, Barnett  I'm 
               shot!

     TRIPLETTE runs up the stairs and the choir continues. BARNETT 
     yells for them to stop. He and BARNETT are over BARRARA JEAN, 
     while guards and BUD attend to HAVEN.

                         TRIPLETTE
               She's... oh, my God... there's 
               blood here...
                     (taking mike)
               Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know 
               what to say.

210     ANGLE - AUDIENCE

     There is a VOICE among the noise that shouts:

     I could have got that Walker bastard before. I've been closer, 
     closer than this, but my Nash broke down and somebody kept 
     stealing my things. I wanted to get him the day before, then Mr. 
     Green's wire died, so this was the right time. I love the 
     President of the United States. I love him.

     Guards grab the speaker, KENNY, in an instant. He shoots a 
     policeman's foot by accident. Men swallow him up. Someone 
     yells, "sing."

211     ANGLE - STAGE

     The choir has no direction to go in. ALRUQUERQUE suddenly is 
     with microphone.. She starts to do "It Don't Worry Me."  The rest 
     of the singers join in.

212     EXT. PERCY WALKER PARK - DAY

     BARNETT leads the stretcher to one or the ambulances. He doesn't 
     allow HAVEN to enter.

                         BARNETT
               Have your friend Triplette take you 
               to the hospital.

     A man walks up from the limo. It is WALKER. TRIPLETTE is near.

                          WALKER
     What'd she do, faint again?  I'm getting tired of waiting in the 
     car.

     TRIPLETTE turns and belts him.

     CUT TO:

213     INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

     As it speeds to the hospital. BARNETT is calm. He knows none of 
     it matters anyway.

214     EXT. STREETS - DAY

     The TRICYCLE MAN follows the ambulance, then heads off onto the 
     highway to Memphis. We SEE STAR'S truck going toward the 
     Parthenon.

215     EXT. PARTHENON

     We SEE STAR'S truck arrive and park. He gets out, as the music 
     and chaos swell.

     END CREDITS

     FADE OUT.
