Westworld(1973)


ON TV

Ed
Hi. Ed Ramsey from Deos. 
If there's anyone who doesn't know what Delos is, well, 
as we've always said. Dalos is the vacation of the future, today.
At Delos you get your choice of the vacation you want.
There's Medieval World, Roman World and, of course, Westworld.
Let's talk to some people who've been there.
Pardon me, sir. What is your name?

Gardner
Gardner Lewis. Just got back from Westworld.

Ed
Tell us how you liked it, Mr. Lewis.

Gardner
When you played cowboys and Indians as a kid,
 you'd point go "bang, bang" and the other kid would lie down 
and play dead.
Well, Westworld is the same thing, only it's for real!
 I shot 6 people!
Well, they weren't real people!

Ed
What Mr. Lewis means is  he shot 6 robots 
scientifically programmed to look, act,
talk and even bleed just like humans do. Isn't that right?
Well, they may have been robots.
 I mean, I think they were robots.
I mean, I know they were robots!

Ed
Yes, the robots of Westworld are there to serve you 
and to give you the most unique vacation experience of your life. 
Thanks you ,sir.

Ed
And you madam?

Janet
Hello.

Ed
What is your name?

Janet
My name is Janet Lane, and I was in Roman World.

Ed
What is the one thing that stands out 
in your mind about Roman World?

Janet
Oh, I think it would be the men!  
I just feel marvelous!
 I mean it's just a warm, glowing place to be!

Ed
Thank you very much!

Janet
Oh, thank you very much! Goodbye.

Ed
And you sir?

Yeah?

Ed
What is your name, sir?

Ted
Oh, I'm Ted Mann. I'm a stockbroker from St. Louis.

Ed
And, which world did you just come from, sir?

Ted
Oh, you're not going to believe this! 
I've just been the sheriff of Westworld for the last 2 weeks!

Ed
Did it seem real to you, sir?

Ted
It's the realest thing I've ever done! I mean that!

Ed
Thank you very much.

Ed
And you sir?

Arther
My name's Arther Caine. I've been in the castle.
I've had a couple of sword fights and 3 jousts. 
And I married a beautiful princess.

Ed
Is that something you've always dreamed of doing, sir?

Arther
All my life!

Ed
Well, there were some of the comments of people 
who've just returned from Delos.
Why don't you arrange to take our Hovercraft to Medieval World, 
Roman World and Westworld? Was it worth $1.000 a day?

All
Yes!

Ed
Contact us today, or see your travel agent.
Boy, have we got a vacation for you!

INT-On the Airplane to Delos

Peter
I'm not worried at all. I'm just curious.
 How much do they weigh?
John
3 or 4 pounds.
Peter
That heavy. Do they have much of a kick? 
John
A Colt .45? 
Peter
Well, I never fired one before. 
What about that thing where you go like this over the gun? 
John
Fanning? 
Peter
Yeah.
John
What about it?  Is that hard to do? 
Now, The gunbelt, does it have those strings to tie around your 
leg?
Peter
If that's the kind you want.
John
That's the kind I want. 
I think it's probably better for quick draws, you know.
Peter
It all depends.
John
What kind of gunbelt did you have the last time?
Peter
I had the one without the strings.
John
And you could draw fast?
Then maybe it doesn't matter after all. 
The gun they give you are real guns?
Peter
Real guns.
John
That7s incredible.

Fright attendant
The orientation on the resort will now begin.
Please put on your earphones.
John
Don't you want to listen?
Peter
I heard it the last time.

Video Voice
Western World is a complete re-creation of 
the American frontier of 1880.
Here it is possible to relive the excitement 
and stresses of pioneer life to the fullest.
Western World is a life of lawless violence, 
a society of gun and action.
This is Medieval World, 
where we have reconstructed 13th-century Europe.
A world of chivalry and combat, romance and excitement. 
Our terms of engineers have spared no expense 
in this re-creation
precise to the smallest detail.
Then we have Roman world:
A lusty treat for the senses in the setting of delightful 
decadent Pompeii.
Here the traveler experiences the sensual, 
relaxed morality that existed at the peak of the Imperial 
Roman Empire.
All together, these resorts comprise Delos. 
The most exciting vacation spot in the history of man.
The whole spectrum of technology has been employed in Delos
for the vacarioner's pleasure.
Expensive and unusual, Delos is not for everyone.
But for those who choose it , 
it is truly a unique and rewarding experience.

INT.CONTROL CENTER
Man
This is Delos Control to Station 3.
Your negative deceleration should be 25 
and your ground speed should be 355 and dropping.
We have you on Grid 5.
Notify ground crews.
Stand by. Locking in now. Shut down 2, shut down 3. 
Nice job, everybody.

INT. STATION IN DELOS

in Western World.

John
Was she a ...?
Peter
Probably.
John
That's amazing!
Peter
Supposedly, you really can't tell expect by looking 
at the hands.
They haven't perfected the hands yet.

Announcement
Nothing can go wrong.
 You will enjoy your stay in  Roman World.
While you are there, please feel free to

Medieval World exists for you, the guest. 
Nothing can go wrong.

INT.THE DRESSING ROOM 
People change clothes.

INT.THE CONTROL ROOM.
Crew
You've got a 3-millisecond cycle delay 
which should be computed in.
I don't know what to do if the stagecoach is late.

INT. WESTERN WORLD
Woman
Oh, it's fantastic!
Hotel Clark
I reckon that's everything.  
Bath's down the hall.
Bath'll cost you 2 bits for hot water. 
Dinner at 7, breakfast at 6:30.
Get lunch on your own. Couple of places in town to eat. 
Don't look like much here, but we have everything.
Peter
Just a minute.
John
You mean to tell me he's a robot?
Peter
That's what I mean to tell you.
John
We're paying $1.000 a day for this?
Peter
It's authentic.
John
The West of the 1880s. 
Well, at least they could've made it a little more comfortable.
But that's the point.
Peter
This is really the way it was.
If you wanted comfort, you should have stayed in Chicago.
John
Julie would have loved all this.
Peter
Poking around for hours in all those funny shops,
 looking for silly..
What the hell is wrong with you? You're a lawyer! 
You know better than anybody else what a ride she took you for.
John
Well, the kids.
Peter
Fine ,the kids! But you're here, 
6 months later, still thinking about her.
John
No, not really. She just came to mind, is all.
There's a lot to do here.

Bartender
What'll it be?
John
Whiskey.
Bartender
What about you?
Peter
Vodka martini on the rocks with a twist of lemon. 
Very dry, please.
John
Just give him whiskey. He's new in town.
      You've got to get into the feel of the thing.
Peter
I feel silly.
John
Why?
Peter
It's like a joke.
John
It's not a joke, it's an amusment park. 
It's the best amusment park in the world. 
ALL you have to do is have fun. 
There's some pretty rough-looking customers here.
Peter
How many of them are...? 
John
Guests like us? Who knows? 
That's the beauty of this place. It doesn't matter.
It may look rough, but it's still just a resort.
It may look rough, but it's still a resort. 
There's no way to get hurt here. Just enjoy yourself. 
Peter
What is this stuff?
John
It doesn't say.
Peter
God! Give me this!
John
Puts hair on your chest. 
Peter
Yeah!

A Robot
Sloppy with your drink. Get this boy a bib.
Peter
Go on!
A robot
He needs his momma.
John
Kill him.
Peter
You talk too much.
A robot
You say something, boy?
Peter
I said you talk too much.
A robot
Why don7t you make me shut up? Your move.

(After the Gun Fight)
John
Pretty realistic, huh?
Peter John
Listen, are you sure he was a...?
John
Of course. 
You don't really think you shot anybody, do you?
Peter
Wow.

INT. The Hotel Room
Peter
Hey, John... How do I know 
I'm not going to kill another guest with this thing?
John
Try it. Shoot me. Go on, shoot. Shoot!
The gun has a sensing device.
It wasn't fire at anything with a high body temperature. 
Only something cold, like a machine.
Peter
They thought of everything.

INT. CONTLOR ROOM
Crew
The Black knight won't be repaired 
till tomorrow afternoon.
Scientist
yeah, I have the banquet scheduled for 5:30, 
if that conforms.

INT. HOTEL DINNER
Peter
What do folks do for companionly entertainment 
in this town?
Hostess
I wouldn't know about such things. 
I'm just runnin' this hotel.
Man
Miss Carrie has a real nice saloon 
down at the end of the street.
Peter
Now, I won't have talk of that woman in this house.
Hostess
Not over my dinner.
John
The food's real good, ma'am.
Hostess
Thank you, stranger. 
You're a gentleman of some breedin'.
Peter
Isn't she terrific?
John
Who's Miss Carrie?

INT. BAR
Woman
You fellas new in town?
John
Yep. Whiskey. (to bartender)
Woman
Just passin' through?
Peter

Woman
Looking for some fun?
Peter
maybe.
Woman
Well, you've come to the right place.
 There's plenty of fun here.
That's Cindy and Arlette. Arlette's from Paris. 
Perhaps you gentlemen are taking a likin' to 'em.
Peter
Perhaps.
Woman
They're real accommodation'.
Peter
They look it.
Woman
Listen, Why don't you just go on upstairs 
and we'll reckon accounts later?
Peter
Sound good to me.
John
Are those 2 girls machines?
Now, how can you say a thing like that? Come on!
Peter
What's going on?
Woman
They're robbin' the bank.
Peter
Robbin' the bank? Hey, maybe we oughta go help out.
You don't know. It might be fun to play bank robbers.
John
Look, Pete, this is better.

INT.HOTEL ROOM
Peter
There's something I have to tell you. 
I don't know if it matters, but it matters to me.
I haven't ever had a...  Well, I hardly know you, 
if you know what I mean. I mean...
We just met a few minutes ago. You're probably very nice.

John
How was it? Wasn't it terrific?
Boy, machines are the servant of man! Wasn't that great?
Peter
Not bad.
John
Not bad. Now you're the big lover!
Peter
Well, you know how it is. Some guy have a way with woman.
Shooting stopped.
John
I guess we missed the robbery.
Peter
You can't have everything. 
John, this place is really fun.

INT. REPAIR ROOM
Scientist
I think it's the jugular unit. What do you think?
Scientist
Should we try and rewire her?
Scientist
No, I'd replace the whole 
unit rather than try and repair it.
Scientist
With a 10?
Scientist
use an XX-50 if we have any in stock. 
The double X's have a longer lifespan. A 50 may not fit in here.
Scientist
Maybe you can shift the integrator 
unit further into the cavity.
Scientist
I'll try it.

Scientist
Balance servo again?
Scientist
Yeah, she fell over thie afternoon. 
I think it's the sensor.
Scientist
If it's the central unit we'll open her up.
Scientist
You get a confirmation before you do that.

Scientist
What's he in for?
Scientist
Central manfunction.
Scientist
Another one?

INT. CONTROL ROOM
Scientist
Since we opened the resort 
we had a failure and breakdown rate
conforming to computer predictions. 
That is 0.3 malfunctions for each 24-hour 
activation period concurrent or not. 
Now, this was an anticipated 
operations aspect of the resort 
and we were fully able to handle it.
The majority of the breakdowns were minor or peripheral
until about 6 weeks ago. 
Then Roman World had a rise in breakdown rate
which doubled in a week. 
In addition, we saw a disproportionate rise
in central as opposed to peripheral breakdowns. 
Now, we identified some problems 
with humidity control. And regained homeostasis. 
Despite our corrections, the breakdown rate continued to climb.
Then Medieval World began to have trouble.
Now we're seeing more Western World breakdowns.
And there's a clear pattern here 
which suggests an analogy to an infectious
disease process spreading from one resort area to the next.
Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease.
Scientist
It's only a theoretical concept. 
There are many ways to order that data.
Scientist
I must confess, 
I find it difficult to believe in a disease of machinery.
Scientist
We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here.
These are highly complicated pieces 
of equipment almost as complicated as
living organisms. In some cases, they've been designed 
by other computers.
We don't know exactly how they work.

INT. CONTROL ROOM
Scientist
I'm not getting around pickup from 
the tenth quadrant.
Scientist
Okay, my telemetry is good. Report, 
I have good telemetry.
Scientist
We have sunrise at 0.43. 
Ready on all quadrants. Energize grid.
Scientist
All right, then give me a 436,
 if you can patch that in. If not, 435.
Scientist
I have sound now. Thank you very much.
Scientist
Yes, I want scrambled eggs and bacon and cinnamon 
toast.
Do you have cinnamon toast? You do? Okay, send it down to
Central Control Room, Console 3.
Scientist
Wait a minute.
Scientist
What was that? No grounding on Unit 5?
Scientist
Try a bypass. I have readings on all units, 
5 included.
Scientist
Hold on a minute. All right, 
let's stand by for resort activation.
Scientist
You ready on Phase 443? Okay,
 we are going to activate at 59.
Scientist
Lower gain Alpha 2.
Scientist
Ready on 6, on 5, on4, on 3, on 2. Active now.


INT. BATHROOM
Peter
Oh, give me a home Where the buffalo roam 
And the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom in heard, A discouraging word, 
And the skies are not cloudy all day.
Home, home on the range.

INT. HOTEL ROOM
John
What do you want?
Gun man Robot
Not a word.
John
Do you mind if I finish shaving?
Lady
Have you no sense of...
John
Was he bothering you? He's not gonna bother you again.

INT.JAIL
Sheriff
I'm here to tell you that things have changed.
 There's law here now.
You can't go around plugging whoever you please.
John
But, Sheriff, it was self-defense.
Sheriff
That's what they all say. He shot a man. 
He'll have to stand trial.
Judge'll be here next week. If I were you,
I wouldn't trouble over your friend here.
Judge Benson likes to hung'em. Hang them high.
John
Look Sheriff.
Sheriff
Beat it! I said, beat it.
Peter
I've never been in jail before.
Sheriff
First time for everything.
Peter
But I haven't done anything wrong.
Sheriff
You shot a man. That's something. 
Where are you from?
Peter
Chicago.
Sheriff
Chicago's a long way from here, fella.
 1000 miles and more.

AFTER KILLED SHERIFF
Peter
 guess that sort of makes us desperados.
John
Yeah, I guess. Well, what do we do now?
Peter
The way I figure it, anything we want. 
John
There's no law in that town now.
Peter
I'll say.
John
We go in there. and we do anything we want! 
You know what?
Peter
What?
John
I almost believe all this.
Peter
Why shouldn't you believe it? 
It's as real as anything else. 
John
Yap! I reckon. 

INT. CONTROL ROOM
Scientist
What can you give me in Grid 7?
Scientist
We have that one on SM-514.
Scientist
Transfer, now.
Scientist
Transferred.
Scientist
Reschedule. She wants to meet the king. 
We have to restructure for that. Can't disappoint a guest.

Voice
Yeah, listen, this is the third day in a row 
that I've called you about my laundry. You've got all my shirts.

Scientist
We're rechecking the tapes on the mechanism now.
Scientist
We have programmed infidelity 
in the queen as of two minutes ago.
Scientist
All right, coming up on the castle, zero...Now.
It also conforms with your 5-year history 
at this time of the year.

INT.CASTLE
Queen
Leave me now.
Man Guest
My queen.
Queen
If the king should hear of this, we would both 
be put to death!
Man Guest
I would be more than happy to die for you, my lady.
Queen
Let us pray it shall not be so. I have news.
The Black Knight has returned, and seeks a match with you.
Man Guest
The Black Knight...?
Queen
None other.
Man Guest
Is he pretty tough?
Queen
He has the strength of ten, and cunning besides. 
But his sight is weak in his left eye.
Stay to his left and you will prevail and win the day.

INT.CONTROL ROOM
Scientist
Confirmation of the reprogramming of that 
Black Knight for left lateral 
weakness and instability for tomorrow.

INT.CASTLE
Queen
I shall see you on the morrow?
Man Guest
My lady.

INT.CONTROL ROOM
Scientist
Schedule for tomorrow a.m. 
It's his last day in the resort.
Let's make it a lulu.
Scientist
Tomorrow a.m. Broadswords .Schedule locked.
Scientist
We have a problem with the air conditioning in 
Beta section. 
Send a crew out.
Scientist
Yes He can be sheriff any time he wants. 
That's correct. 
Just give him the badge.

INT. WESTERN WORLD
Man Guest
Now, I'm the new law around here.
Man Robot
You think you can handle things?
Man Guest
You wanna try me?

INT. CASTLE
Daphne
A thousand pardons, my load.
Man
What is your name, child?
Daphne
Daphne.

EXT. WESTERN WORLD 
Peter
Oh, I love this place. I love my horse.
I love may horse and love julie.
John
Oh, shut up, will you?
Peter
I like the spots on my horse.
John
Did you see the spots on my horse?
Peter
Your horse is beautiful.
John
Thank you very much. I like yours, too.
Peter
Thank you.  Look out.
John
Let me handle this! That's not supposed to happen.
Peter
Maybe it is! Maybe it's part of the thing!
John
The hell! Goddamn machines, anyway!
That's not supposed to happen!

INT. CONTROL ROOM
Scientist
A rattlesnake struck a guest?
Scientist
He was shooting at it and he missed.
Scientist
The snakes are programmed never to hit on a strike.
Scientist
Was the guest injured?
Scientist
Minor puncture wounds.
Scientist
It's inexcusable to injure a guest.
Pick up that snake for a total post at once.
Check all the snake's center mechanisms tonight 
during the repair period.
Doesn't anything work around here?

(checking the snake)
Scientist
Logic circuits on the snake simply 
failed to respond.
There was no sign of mechanical damage or 
tampering and no clue to the malfunction.
Central mechanism psychosis?
Scientist
I feel we should shut down the resort for a month.
Scientist
Oh, that seems rash. A snake injured a guest. 
We can't allow that to happen.
Scientist
Many element of the 
Delos Resort are potentially dangerous.
That's part of the appeal. But if they become truly dangerous
Scientist
I agree. We can announce that 
the resort is overbooked
and not allow any further new guests to arrive.
We can take care of the ones already here.
Scientist
If we can't insure the safety of the guests, 
we'll be in desperate trouble.
Scientist
But we can insure their safety. 
Everything's fine.

INT.CONTROL CENTER
Scientist
All right, let's start that bar fight.

INT. THE BAR
Man
Cheat!
Peter
Now, that's just rude!
Woman
Hey, Sheriff! Come on!

INT.REPAIR ROOM
Scientist
What's his problem?
Scientist
Nothing. He got shot up today, 
so we're taking the opportunity
to replace the visual cortex.
Using the new infrared units. 
And we're increasing audio sensitivity.

INT. CASTLE
Daphne
You called for me, my lord?
Man
Yes. How long have you been in the palace, Daphne?
Daphne
Since I was 3, my lord.
Man
Charming. 
I think we ought to get to know each other better, Daphne.
Daphne
Better, my lord?
Man
I can reward you well.
Daphne
My lord...My lord forgets himself! 

INT. CONTROL ROOM
Scientist
Problem with the girl. Program breakdown.
Scientist
What' s the trouble?
Scientist
One of the castle machines isn't responding.
Refusing a guest seduction.
Scientist
Get her out of there, 
and report it to central repair.
Scientist
Right.

Scientist
 Did you find the trouble?
Scientist
No apparent trouble.
Scientist
But she wasn't following programming.
Scientist
She refused a guest seduction and she is a sex model.
Scientist
Certainly is.
Scientist
Will they shut down?
Scientist
No, the directors feel 
that to close down now would hurt tourist confidence.
Scientist
I don't like it.

INT. CASTLE
Man
Breakfast.
Robot
Hold, varlet!
Man
Are you speaking to me?
Robot
None other, sire.
Man
Look, I'm hungry and I ...

INT. CONTROL CENTER
Scientist
Sir we have no control over the robots at all!
Scientist
They 're running on stored charge!
Scientist
How long can they go?
Scientist
Some will begin to run down in an hour. 
Others can go a full 12!
Turn the main grid back on!
Scientist
The relays must be frozen. 
We can't get back our power!
Scientist
Hello? Hello?
Scientist
Now, how are we going to get out of here? 
All these doors are electrically powered.
Scientist
Now, get these doors open in here before 
we all suffocate!
Scientist
Temperature elevated, 98 degrees. Oxygen,
17 percent and dropping.
Scientist
Get that power on so we can open these doors.

EXT. WEST WORLD
Peter
Hey!
Crew
Don't shoot me!
Peter
Hey, wait a minute! What's the matter with you?
Crew
Hold out your hands. Let me see your hands! 
You're a guest.
You really gave me a scare. Look, everything's broken down. 
The machines have gone crazy.
Peter
You know about the machines?
Crew
Yeah, I repair'em.
Peter
There's one chasing me now. A gunslinger.
Crew
Gunslinger. Must be a model 404, maybe a 406.
If he is a 406, he's got all the sensory equipment. 
It's beautiful machine!
Peter
He's after me.
Crew
I don't doubt it.
Peter
What can I do?
Crew
There's nothing you can do. He'll get you.
You haven't got a chance.
Peter
There must be something.
Crew
Fella, don't kid yourself. There are things you could try.
Acid for his visual system, noise for his hearing.
No matter what, he'll always be one jump ahead of you!
You haven't got a chance.
Peter
Yes, I do.

INT. CASTLE
Woman
Help me!
Peter
All right. It's all right.
Woman
Help me!
Peter
You're gonna be all right.
Woman
Help me! No water.
Peter
Go ahead. Go ahead and drink.
