Many years ago, sorcerers crafted the Mask of Acheron and dark forces of Acheron conquered the world.
However, the barbarians vanquished Acheron warriors and broke the Mask into pieces and divided among the tribes.
The barbarian Cimmerian village of chief Corin is attacked by the evil warlord Khalar Zym that wants the last piece of bone of the Mask of Acheron to resurrect his wife.
When his witch daughter Marique finds the hidden piece, he slaughters the villagers and the Corin's son Conan is the only survivor.
Conan swears revenge against Khalar Zym.
Years later, the warrior Conan is a pirate and he decides to release slaves from a field.
When he is celebrating in a tavern with his friends, he sees a thief being chased by a guard and Conan recognizes him as Lucius, the Khalar Zym's soldier that he cut the nose out.
Conan let the guards capture him and once in the prison, he forces Lucius to tell him where Khalar Zym is.
Meanwhile Khalar Zym attacks a monastery where Marique believes that a pure-blood descent of Acheron lives.
But the monk sent the descent Tamara back to her homeland.
She is chased by Khalar Zym's soldiers, but Conan saves her.
Now Conan intends to use Tamara to reach the evil Khalar Zym.
Will he succeed in his intent?
