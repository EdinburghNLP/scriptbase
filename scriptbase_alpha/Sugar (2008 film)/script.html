                              Written by

                        Anna Boden &amp; Ryan Fleck





<b>1    EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC - DAY                           
</b>
     A high angle looking out over a well-manicured baseball field
     carved out of a tropical jungle. A game is currently in
     progress.

<b>A1   ON THE FIELD                                                            
</b>
     Wearing KANSAS CITY KNIGHTS uniforms, mostly Black and dark-
     skinned Dominicans as well as several lighter-skinned
     Venezuelans (17-22 years old) are set in their positions, poised
     for the next pitch.

     CLOSE ON the pitcher, MIGUEL SANTOS (aka AZÚCAR/SUGAR - 19,
     lean, Black and handsome). Sweat drips down his face in the
     oppressive midday heat. He steadies his glove and ball at his
     chest, peeking over at the RUNNER on first base. Miguel lifts
     his leg high into the air, rears back his right arm, and FIRES
     the ball toward the plate.

     THUD! A cloud of dust pops off the CATCHER'S mitt as the ball
     slams inside.

<b>                           UMPIRE
</b>               Strike three!

     The BATTER lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's
     overpowering fastball.

     FROM THE DUGOUT, Miguel's TEAMMATES CHEER him on. HEAD COACH
     REYES (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly, CLAPS.

     BEHIND THE HOMEPLATE BACKSTOP, a dozen rookie players also in
     Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team. Two YOUNG PLAYERS
     clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which
     read 92 and 93 MPH.

     As the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, JOSE
     (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside
     fastball.

     The next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and
     home. Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and
     first baseman, PEDRO BERROA, nearly collide, as the ball lands
     between them and the runners reach base safely.

B1   FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, the ACADEMY'S DIRECTOR, LEANDRO                 B1
     ALVAREZ (light-skinned, late 50s) and several other COACHES and
     SCOUTS jot down notes on their clipboards.

C1   ON THE FIELD, Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and     C1
     kicks the dirt.

     Miguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a
     tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the
     dirt.

     Some players LAUGH and heckle the batter. Others point angry
     fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with
     a friendly, but authoritative, grin.

     He sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through
     it, getting nothing but air.

<b>2    INT. ACADEMY DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                   2
</b>
     The TEAM (about 35 young men) gather around several tables for
     their standard baked chicken and rice lunch. The mood is
     friendly and playful as players tease each other across the
     tables. Miguel, sitting with his friends MARCOS (2nd base) and
     ALFONSO (3rd Base), works on a second helping of dessert.

<b>                          MARCOS
</b>              Check out Sugar... Puts on twenty
              pounds in two months; now he's going
              for twenty more.

<b>                          MIGUEL
</b>                   (mouth full of food)
              All muscle, baby. Rock solid.

     For some NEW PLAYERS, distinguishable in the sea of BLUE
     uniforms by their BLACK "tryout" jerseys and ragged sneakers, it
     is their first healthy meal, and they eat as if it were their
     last.   One of them, SALVADOR (Black, scrawny, 17) holds his
     plate up to his mouth, shovelling food down his throat.

<b>                          PEDRO
</b>              Slow down, kid, it ain't going nowhere.

     A few of the guys LAUGH.

<b>                          MIGUEL
</b>                   (to Pedro)
              If you hustled half as much as him,
              maybe you'd be hungry too.

     The other guys "ohhhh" Miguel's insult, as Salvador and Miguel
     exchange subtle grins.

<b>3   INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - SAME DAY                                  3
</b>
    Kids crowd around in a circle, repeating after the animated
    English instructor, SEÑOR SANCHEZ, who goes over some English
    BASEBALL TERMS in the center. As he repeats the terms, he
    enthusiastically pantomimes the meanings of each.

<b>                           SANCHEZ
</b>             Fly ball.

<b>                           CLASS
</b>             Hone rone!

    CLOSE ON Miguel, repeating the strange words.

<b>4   INT. RECREATION ROOM - SAME NIGHT                                  4
</b>
    It's dark, and most of the team sits around an old TV set
    watching the climactic final scene of Field of Dreams dubbed in
    Spanish. Kevin Costner asks his father to play catch in a voice
    that sounds nothing like Kevin Costner.

    Miguel passes through the room, and we follow him out of the rec
    room down a hall, and into...

<b>5   THE WEIGHT ROOM                                                    5

    ...where he sits down at the bench press, lowers his head in
    thought. TRACK IN CLOSE as he crosses himself, mouths a prayer,
    then leans back onto the bench.

    TRACK OUT as he lifts the bar, and begins a set of presses.

<b>                                                        FADE OUT.

<b>6   EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DAY                                            6
</b>
    The Kansas City Director of Minor League Operations, RUDY
    HUBBARD (white, 40s), watches a TRYOUT SESSION, where TWO SKINNY
    TEENS in worn street clothes pitch to uniformed catchers. Their
    AGENT talks on a cell phone nearby.

    Alvarez, the academy director, approaches one of the kids,
    whispers in his ear. The kid smiles tentatively.

    Alvarez joins Rudy and they speak in English.

<b>                         RUDY
</b>             What'd you tell him?

<b>                         ALVAREZ
</b>             I told him to grip the ball more
             gently. Like a tit.

    They both crack up.

    FROM THE TRYOUT MOUND. The kid looks over to the two men pow-
    wowing about him. He breathes in, nervous...

<b>7   BATTING CAGE - MINUTES LATER                                        7
</b>
    Pedro, sweating hard, takes a few cuts, but only seems to be
    hitting weak ground balls and foul tips.

<b>                         ALVAREZ
</b>             Pedro Berroa. Third year.     Hasn't
             developed like we hoped.

<b>                         RUDY
</b>             How much he sign for?

<b>                           ALVAREZ
</b>             Forty-five.

<b>                         RUDY
</b>             Jesus. These kids keep getting more
             expensive. How much did you sign for
             back in the day?

<b>                          ALVAREZ
</b>             3000.   When I was fifteen.

    Rudy smiles and moves on.    Alvarez follows.   Pedro watches the
    men as they walk away.

<b>8   BULL PEN MOUNDS - MINUTES LATER                                     8

    Alvarez and Rudy approach a PITCHING COACH instructing Salvador.
    Miguel warms up next to him.

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>        Salvador Torres. Been practicing with
        the team for almost a week. Still raw,
        but he's got a lot of potential.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        We gonna sign him?

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>        Soon. Soon. We want to play it low-
        key, see what his agent says.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        How much you think?

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>        They've gotten two offers from other
        clubs. Agent says they were around a
        hundred.

Rudy raises his eyebrows.

<b>                      ALVAREZ
</b>             (firm)
        He's good.

Rudy looks over to Miguel.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        What about him?

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>        Miguel Santos. Great arm. We signed
        him two years ago for fifteen.

Miguel fires in a pitch.    Rudy nods, impressed.

<b>                      RUDY
</b>        Good deal.    He throw any junk?

<b>                   ALVAREZ
</b>             (in Spanish)
        Sugar!

Miguel looks over, sees the American with Alvarez.

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>        Show us your curve.

Miguel nods, nervous, focuses. He pitches.    The ball curves
very subtly over the plate for a strike.

<b>                     RUDY
</b>        Not bad.   Mind if I try something?
<b>
</b>                 Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    6.


Miguel looks back to the men.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        Hey, kid, do you mind?   May I?

Miguel stares blankly at Rudy, not understanding.

<b>                    ALVAREZ

        Give him the ball.

Miguel hands Rudy the ball, and Rudy demonstrates how to handle
a knuckle curve ball, which looks strangely unorthodox, with the
index finger tucked against the baseball.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        Spike curve. Gives you more rotation,
        more movement.
             (hands Miguel the ball)
        You try.

Miguel struggles to emulate Rudy's grip, so Rudy maneuvers his
fingers into the correct position. Alvarez laughs.

<b>                     ALVAREZ
</b>        Vamos!   Let's go! Pitch it!

Miguel looks over to his catcher, Jose. Winds up the next
pitch, and soars it 5 feet wide of the mark.

Rudy and Alvarez laugh.   Miguel looks back over his shoulder.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        It's okay, son, these things take time.
        You'll figure it out.

Rudy pats Miguel on the back and walks off with Alvarez. Miguel
stares at them hard as they go. He turns back to his catcher,
determined, squeezes the ball in spike curve formation.
Delivers.

Misses badly again. JUMP CUTS take us through a half-dozen more
bad curve attempts, as other players take notice and gather
around, some laughing, until...

...finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air,
landing centered in Jose's mitt.

The other players erupt in amazement, while Miguel stares
straight ahead. After a beat, he smiles wide.

      sit on crates around a dominoes table. They wave their hellos
      to Miguel, who smiles back.

<b>                    FRANK
</b>        It's great. But you need to get to
        Kansas City before you start thinking
        about New York. Know what I mean?

Frank sips his beer.

<b>                       MIGUEL

Frank shrugs, as Miguel's sister calls out from the street--

<b>                    ERICA
</b>        Miguel, Luis! Dinner is ready!

<b>                    MIGUEL
</b>        You'd tell me if you knew.

<b>                       FRANK
</b>        Maybe.

Miguel shakes his head, gets up.

<b>                    MIGUEL
</b>        Wanna join us for dinner?

<b>                    FRANK
</b>        Not tonight. But give your mom a kiss
        for me, okay?

Miguel gives a coin to the boy who's been cleaning his shoes
before heading off with his little brother.

Frank sips his beer, calls out to the field--

     Miguel exercises his pitching arm by stretching an elastic tube
     tied against a chain-link fence. As he stretches, he watches a
     group of players line up for a sprint drill, sizing up his
     future competition.

     Salvador, wearing his black jersey, races for his life, beating
     all the others.

     The sweat-drenched players line up according to their positions,
     waiting their turns to participate in a double-play drill, where
     the pitchers cover first base.

     Miguel awaits his turn, watching another pitcher, EDDY, run to
     first to receive a throw from second base, but before Eddy can
     catch the ball...

     ...he twists his ankle tripping over the bag.

     The coaches rush over to Eddy, who is on the ground wincing in
     pain. Miguel and the rest of the team watch in nervous
     anticipation as Eddy struggles to his feet, limps off the field
     with the aid of another player.

     The ball is hit on the ground to first base, where the fielder
     quickly throws it over to second. Miguel charges over to first,
     stutter steps as he nears the base, and receives the throw just
     in time to beat the hitter and step out of the way. He exhales
     in relief.

     The team eats dinner.    At Miguel's table, we catch the punchline
     of a joke...

</b>              So the Dominican's like, `Fuck, what am
              I gonna do?' He stays there, points up
              to the sky and says. `Look! There's a
              plane... Right THERE!'

     Everyone laughs hysterically, as...

     ...the young rookie, Salvador, grabs a seat next to Miguel at an
     adjoining table.

<b>                            SALVADOR
</b>              Hey, Sugar!    They made me an offer.

     Miguel smiles, but hesitates for a beat as Pedro walks past them
     and over to an empty table in the corner of the room. Miguel
     turns back to Salvador, pats him on the head.

<b>                          MIGUEL

     Awkward silence. The players look at Pedro with pity, unsure
     how to respond. After a beat, Miguel mocks coach Reyes and the
     others follow suit, mocking Alvarez and the other coaches.

     ounce of strength to deliver a pitch, and...

     CRACK! The visiting Detroit Academy HITTER knocks the ball over
     the left field wall for a homerun, wherein...

     BLAH! Miguel throws up on the mound.   All the players gasp in
     disgust, but Reyes just laughs.

     Miguel looks over to Alvarez, sitting under an umbrella with a
     clipboard, then to Reyes, hoping he'll yank him out of the game,
     but Reyes just claps.

     Miguel tries to shake off the cobwebs, steps on the rubber,
     stares down the next hitter.

     in the next pitch, which arcs into Jose's glove for a...

     Reyes' smile fades, stunned by the beautiful curve.

     A SERIES OF JUMPCUTS take us through the next three batters, as
     Miguel makes quick work of them, mixing up his nasty curve with
     a blazing fastball.

     After the third out, Miguel walks back to the dugout.     He takes
     a seat on the bench, smiles smugly.

     Carmen interrupts, drapes her arms around Miguel, kissing him
     repeatedly. As Erica looks on, we get the sense that she's used
     to being on the outside of this kind of attention.

     Miguel's eyes get big for a second, until Erica smiles.    He's

     Through cracks in the tarp, Miguel watches Erica join the dance

     Savoring this rare moment alone, he breathes deep, blows wood
     dust off the table leg, and continues sanding. Hold.

      CLOSE ON a plate of french toast. Miguel, Marcos, Antonio, and
      Julio all chow down on french toast again. They eat in silence
      for a few beats, until...

</b>               I have to admit... I'm getting a little
               sick of the french toast.

      The others nod in agreement, but continue eating.

Another beat.    Sofia looks down at her bare feet, scrunches her
toes.

     Miguel warms up, glancing over to the action on the field
     between pitches. He sees...

     ...Los Angeles gets another hit, scoring another run, so...

     ...Stu Sutton walks out to the mound, signals for Miguel.

     Miguel throws one more warm-up toss and sprints onto the field.

<b>66   ON THE MOUND                                                        66

     Miguel arrives, ready for action.   Stu hands him the ball, while
     the catcher, Orlando, translates.

     Miguel nods. As he tosses a few more warm-up pitches from the
     mound, Stu goes back to the DUGOUT where Marcos and Julio
     anxiously await Miguel's spring training game debut.

     The BATTER steps in and Miguel steps on the rubber, touches his
     father's cross around his neck, tucks it in his jersey. He
     looks to Orlando, and nods at his request for a fastball. He
     throws it in...

     Stu exchanges impressed glances with another COACH.

     Miguel sends in the next one, and...

     ...the HITTER checks his swing, but goes too far.

<b>                            UMPIRE
</b>              Two!

     IN THE DUGOUT Marcos gets to his feet, clapping for
     encouragement.

     Miguel nods to Orlando, delivers again...

     CRACK! The ball is smoked toward Brad Johnson at second base.
     He leaps out, body fully extended, and makes a fantastic catch.
     But he's not done yet...

     The runner at second is too far off the bag, so Brad hops to his
     feet, and fires a laser beam to second, finishing off one of the
     sweetest double-plays you'll ever see.

     Miguel pumps his fist into the air, and the team runs to...

     Marcos and Julio are the first to greet Miguel with high-fives.
     Orlando, Ed, and Jorge, coming off the field, follow in suit.
     Miguel awaits Brad's return to the dugout and high-fives him
     too, but they soon return to their segregated places on opposite
     ends of the bench.

     Miguel agrees, as an ASSISTANT COACH finishes handing out checks
     to the remaining players.

     Miguel sits on the bench near his locker, opens his envelope to
     find...

     INSERT:   a check for $502.18.

     He SMILES.

     The ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR goes over baseball related vocabulary off-
     screen, while Miguel glances through his "English for Baseball
     Players" notebook.

     He finds a page with pictures of different foods along with
     their English names. He looks at all the foods, stops at an
     image of a fried egg. He circles the word "egg."

     The instructor finishes up class, and the exhausted Latino
     players get up to leave. Marcos stands, leans over to Miguel.

     proceed to workout on opposite sides of the room. After
     finishing his set, Miguel turns to Brad.

Miguel glances around the table.   Everyone's head is bowed and
eyes closed.

His eyes stop on Anne, seated across from him. She's an
attractive all-American girl, but would never dream of flaunting
her good looks. After taking her in, Miguel closes his eyes.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>        ...And finally, Lord... Please look
        kindly over the Swing this season. May

        well, why not?... if there's anything
        you can do to help us win another
        championship, we'll take that too...
        Amen.

The table laughs, followed by a chorus of Amens. Miguel opens
his eyes, greeted with smiles. He smiles too, as everyone
passes dishes around the table.

<b>                    ANNE
</b>        I bet they have something similar.
        They probably just have another name
        for it.

All eyes are on Miguel as he nervously takes a bite.

A suspenseful beat, until...

              2nd baseman out of Stanford. He'll
              make his professional debut tonight.
              Great night for Swing baseball... And
              also a great night to grab a bite and a
              brew at Harlow's after the game - your
              local pub and proud sponsor...

      As a YOUNG LADY begins singing the Star-Spangled Banner, Miguel
      takes off his hat, looks out to the American Flag. Hold on his
      solemn expression.

      We STAY ON Miguel for the game's highlights, JUMP CUTTING his
      reactions to the best plays of the game.

      PLAY 1: he casually spits sunflower seed shells, then CLAPS the
      final out of the inning, high-fiving players returning to the
      dugout.

      PLAY 2: chats to Jorge, when they react to the CRACK of the
      bat, leap to their feet, eagerly anticipate an umpire's call,
      and CHEER when the call goes their team's way.

      PLAY 3:   grimaces at the sight of a hit-by-pitch.

      PLAY 4:   leaps to his feet, CLAPS.

      PLAY 5:   leaps to his feet, doesn't clap.   Sits back down.

      PLAY 6: Miguel and Jorge sway to the seventh inning stretch
      classic "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."

      PLAY 7: sitting with Brad, they both point to something on the
      field and crack up laughing. Of course, we don't see what
      they're laughing at.

      PLAY 8: standing with Jorge and the rest of the players, the
      mood is tense. The players react to a hit ball, as their heads
      jerk toward the outfield, waiting, waiting, waiting, and...

A98   CELEBRATION! Whatever happened, the game is over and we follow A98
      the players out onto the field to mob Brad, who just scored the
      winning run.

      The BOUNCER examines Miguel's photo ID, which is actually
      Jorge's. He shoots Miguel a suspicious look, but hands it back
      and lets him through.

</b>
      Some of the Swing players celebrate their first victory with
      beers at the local bar/dance club. A few of the guys dance with
      LOCAL GIRLS, but Jorge and Miguel stand against the wall, beers
      in hand, as they watch the MTV-inspired GRINDING and FREAKING
      unfolding before them.

               Go for it, bro. But remember, just
               cause they dance with you, doesn't mean
               they want anything else.

      Orlando and Ed approach with a couple brews.

</b>               Not from you, anyway.

      Miguel notices Brad stroll by, calls him over.

</b>               Yo flaco!

      They all toast beers.

</b>               What's with the flaco? I mean...
                    (flexing his arm)
               You call this flaco?

      Everyone laughs, as Jorge eyes TWO WOMEN on the dance floor.

<b>                            JORGE
</b>               You ready?

</b>
      Jorge whispers in one of the girls' ears and the two of them
      begin dancing with him and Miguel. At first cautious, Miguel
      and his partner ease closer, until Miguel's hands are on her
      hips, leading her in rhythm to the hip-hop jam, while mixing in
      some Latin moves as well.

      As Miguel and Jorge carve and twist with their partners, several
      local bar PATRONS begin to take notice of their fancy footwork.
      But Miguel might be dancing too well for one DRUNK JACKASS in
      particular, who...

      ...wanders over, gets in Miguel's face.

</b>                    (barely audible)
               Careful, Paco. This ain't the jungle.

      Miguel stares him down. A few clubbers in the immediate
      vicinity stop dancing, observe. Jorge steps between them,
      and...

      ...apparently, drunken egos speak the same language everywhere
      because Jorge and the Jackass start jawing back and forth in
      their native tongues. Both seem to be understanding the other,
      though the MUSIC is too loud to hear anything specific.

      Brad and the Venezuelans run over to break it up before anything
      serious starts. They all hustle out to...

<b>102   EXT. BIG MUDDY'S PARKING LOT - NIGHT                              102
</b>
      The Latin players spill out into the brisk night air with Brad
      and the Swing's designated hitter, JEFF ELKS.

      They all pile into Brad's car, as a few locals stand near the
      club's entrance, watching them go.

<b>103   EXT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                    103
</b>
      The car pulls up near the house and Miguel stumbles out, as the
      wild bunch inside HOOT and HOLLER.

      The car backs down the road and the players' voices fade out
      with the hum of the engine.

      An upstairs light goes on. Miguel looks up to the Higgins'
      bedroom where Helen's silhouetted figure lingers in the window.
      He tiptoes inside.

      The sound of a CHURCH CHOIR fades in, and carries over to...

<b>104   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                                 104
</b>
      With the exception of Miguel, the all-white congregation sings
      hymns about Jesus and the Lord. He tries to suppress a yawn
      when he sees Anne Higgins singing in the choir. She notices
      him as she sings. A smile.

      Miguel perks up.

      walks alongside Miguel.

</b>               How'd you like the service?
                    (off his blank stare)
               Our church? Hope it wasn't too boring
               for you. Did you go to church in the
               Dominican Republic?

      He shakes his head.

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>               I am sorry.    I do not understand.

<b>                           ANNE
</b>               S'okay. You understand more than a lot
               of folks around here I bet.

      He nods, still unsure.

<b>                           ANNE
</b>               So listen, me and some friends   are
               hanging out later. You should    stop by
               my house after the game. It's    gonna be
               super chill. Grandma can take    you
               there, but here...

      She stops a random CHURCHGOER...

<b>                           ANNE
</b>               Can I borrow a pen real quick?

      The churchgoer hands over a pen, and Anne writes her address on
      Miguel's forearm.

<b>                           ANNE
</b>               After the game. My house...     Good
               luck, tonight.

      Anne runs off.   Miguel looks after her, mystified.

<b>106   INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON                             106
</b>
      Half-uniformed players hang out, eating sandwiches, passing
      around a PLAYBOY magazine, signing souvenir baseballs, and
      talking at full volume. Hip-hop BLASTS from a stereo, competing
      with an old DUKES OF HAZARD rerun on the TV. HARDY, the
      Bridgetown Swing mascot, passes through with his enormous monkey
      head under one arm.

      Miguel sits at his locker, psyching himself up for his first
      start. He touches Luis' drawing, which is taped to the inside
      of his locker. Closes his eyes, takes a deep breath.

</b>
      ON THE MOUND. Miguel opens his eyes, as the LEAD-OFF HITTER
      steps into the batter's box. He takes a moment, crosses
      himself. Play ball.

      Miguel nods to his catcher, Orlando, then fires in the first
      pitch high for a ball.

      When he gets the ball back, he looks to the stands, where...

      ...Earl, Helen, Michael, and Hilary sit uncomfortably close to
      the field in choice box seats.

      He takes a nervous breath, fires in the second pitch.      Ball two.
      Same for the third. And forth.

      The batter jogs to first, and the crowd GRUMBLES.

</b>               Santos, apparently feeling the
               butterflies on his first professional
               outing. Hailing all the way from the
               Dominican Republic, Santos wowed the
               club with his power during Spring
               Training. But he's off to a rocky
               start tonight.

      Jorge comes over from third base as the batter walks to first.

<b>                           JORGE
</b>               Relax, Sugar. It's the same game we
               played back home. That's all it is.
               Just a game, man. So relax. Let's
               have some fun. Okay?

      Miguel nods.    Jorge points out the next batter.   Another
      Dominican.

<b>                            JORGE
</b>               See?   Just like home.

      Jorge runs back to his position at third.   Miguel tucks his
      index finger into his knuckle curve grip.   Delivers...

</b>                That's it!   There it is!

      And the next pitch...

      ...is hit sharply to Jorge at third, who fires it over to second
      for one, and on to first for a double play.

      The crowd goes WILD and Miguel finally exhales.

      One, two, three... he mows down the next BATTER on three
      consecutive strikes. More APPLAUSE.

      Orlando hands him his first strikeout ball. Miguel takes a
      seat, wipes the sweat from his head, then looks down at Anne's
      address scribbled on his forearm.

      The next BATTER dribbles a spinning groundball at Jorge, but it
      squirts through his legs into left field, allowing the runner to
      score an unearned run from second.

      Stu walks toward the mound, signals for the bullpen.   He and
      Orlando greet Miguel on the mound.

<b>                            STU

</b>                    (in Spanish)
               Take it easy; it's your first game.

      Though he doesn't speak Spanish, Stu knows exactly what's
      happening. He takes the ball from Miguel with a smile, but
      Miguel doesn't move, still reluctant to leave the mound.

      As the FANS begin to cheer his stellar debut...

<b>                           STU
</b>               You hear that? It's for you, kid.

      Orlando smiles, pats Miguel on the butt, and Miguel finally
      starts his slow walk off the field. As we follow him off, the
      FANS rise to their feet and Miguel approaches the dugout to a
      standing ovation. On his way in, he's greeted by his teammates
      with congratulatory high-fives.

      AT THIRD Jorge stares at the dirt, frustrated by his misplay.

</b>               Hey guys, let's get started.   Everyone
               grab a seat.

      The teens crowd into the living room, squeezing together on
      sofas, recliners, and desk chairs. Miguel sits behind the
      majority of the group, not sure what's going on. Anne stands
      before them...

<b>                           ANNE
</b>               I'm so glad you all came. Last year,
               we didn't have half as many people in
               our group. So, I think this just goes
               to show the great work we've been doing
               in spreading the word. But this year,
               I want us to work harder. Now, I know
               a lot of you are studying for SATs or
               working on college applications. And
               all of that is important, but we need
               to remember that our spiritual
               accomplishments are more important.
               What we do in school or for a job...
               that's just a small part of who we are.
               We're only here by the grace of God, so
               let's get out there and share that
               grace.

      Miguel watches, still unsure what's going on.

               His is love beyond a brother's,
               Oh, how He loves!
               Earthly friends may fail or leave us,
               One day soothe, the next day grieve us;
               But this Friend will ne'er deceive us:
               Oh, how He loves!

      A batter swings and misses for strike three.    The catcher throws
      the ball around the horn.

      Miguel steps off the mound, grabs the rosin bag for traction,
      gets the ball back.

      His next pitch is hit on the ground toward the first base line,
      where the first baseman makes a nice back-handed play...

      Miguel sprints over to cover the bag, receives the toss, but...

<b>      OUCH!

      ...the RUNNER storms into Miguel before he has time to pull his
      foot off the bag, knocking them both hard to the ground.   The
      runner is called out, but Miguel is slow getting to his feet.

      Stu and the TRAINER run out to check on him. Jorge rushes over
      from third, and Orlando also comes to help translate.

      The umpire grants Miguel a few "test" pitches.

      Visibly shaken, Miguel sets up for a warm-up pitch, breathes
      deeply, and delivers. He lands gingerly on his right ankle,
      makes a face.

      Stu and the trainer exchange glances. Miguel notices this, as
      he sets up for another pitch. The trainer shakes his head, no.

</b>               I am okay.   Please.

      Stu and the trainer sense Miguel's anxiety.     Stu puts his arm on
      Miguel's shoulder for comfort.

      off the field with Stu and the other players looking after.

      Brad and Miguel. Miguel      wears a big blue boot on his injured
      foot, and a crutch leans     against the wall behind him.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>               You've been pitching so well... it's a
               real shame.

<b>                           EARL
</b>               Don't worry, Miguel, you'll bounce
               right back.

      Miguel pokes at his food, avoids eye contact.

      Brad smiles.

        some time off this summer.

Miguel looks to Jorge for help.

</b>        Grandmother.

Anne nudges her dad under the table.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>        Oh, Miguel, honey.    I'm so sorry.

Miguel nods, takes a bite of potatoes.   There is an awkward beat
as everybody chews.

Miguel musters all his language skills to break the awkward
silence.

</b>             (to Michael and Hilary)

      silence. Hold.

      Miguel and Anne sit alone on the porch. We can hear CHATTER
      from inside, where the others are clearing the table.

<b>                           ANNE
</b>               You like it here in Iowa?

               in mind for you...

      Anne points out a small scar on Miguel's scalp.

<b>                           ANNE

</b>                    (in Spanish, no subtitles)
               Okay... When I was little, I wanted to
               eat some cherries from a tree. It
               wasn't our tree, and there was a fence
               to keep us kids away.

      Anne hangs on his every word as if she understood perfectly.

<b>                           MIGUEL
</b>               So I climbed up the fence to knock down
               some cherries with a stick, but I when
               I took my first swing-- whoosh. I
               fell. There was a lot of blood.

      Anne reaches out, lightly touches his scar.   Her hand lingers
      for a beat, until...

      ...Miguel leans in and kisses her. She kisses him back for a
      beat, but when he puts his hand around her waist, pulling her
      closer, she resists. They separate.

      Anne looks down at her feet, uncomfortable.

<b>                           ANNE
</b>               Sorry, I just...      Sorry.

      Miguel looks on, confused, as she stands.   They lock eyes for an
      awkward beat.

      finds Jorge wearing street clothes and packing up personal
      things from his locker. Miguel knows immediately what's

off.

      Miguel stares at the raw corn with strange fascination.

</b>
      Miguel walks in without crutches, looking healthy. He pounds a
      few players hello, then freezes upon seeing Brad's empty locker.

      Stu approaches Miguel...

<b>                           STU
</b>               There was an injury to the Wichita
               right-fielder. They called up Brad
               this morning... He left you this...

      Stu hands Miguel an old paperback book.

      INSERT: a Spanish-language version of Roberto Clemente's
      biography. Miguel opens to the first page, where Brad has
      inscribed a note, "See you in Kansas City, Mamañema!"

      Miguel smiles, bittersweet, when a familiar VOICE calls out...

<b>                              SALVADOR
</b>               Yo!   Sugar!

      Miguel turns around to find Salvador Torres (the once scrawny
      kid from the Academy) running at him. They hug.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>               Holy shit!     How'd you get here?

<b>                           SALVADOR
</b>               On a airplane, motherfucker.

      Miguel playfully flips Salvador's cap bill down over his face
      for being a smartass.

<b>                           STU
</b>               Great, you guys know each other. Sal's
               our new middle-relief man. Throws a
               nasty cutter. You could learn a thing
               or two from him, Santos...

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>               Okay.

      Stu walks back towards the coaches' office.

</b>               What he say?

                you.

                     (a beat)
                I'm a little nervous.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                Look, just remember... it's the same
                game we played back home. Same rules,
                different place. Just have fun. It's
                only a game.

       CLOSE ON Miguel swearing at himself, clearly not following his
       own advice.

       A RUNNER circles the bases after hitting a homerun.

<b>                            JACK JEFFERIES (V.O.)
</b>                Santos allows his second homerun of the
                game.   First night off the DL, and not
                looking so sharp.

       The SCOREBOARD indicates the Swing losing 5-2 in the 4th.

       Miguel glances out of the corner of his eye to...

<b>       THE DUGOUT
</b>
       ...Stu is scribbling on his scorecard.

       MIGUEL quickly sets up for his next pitch, but Stu is on his way
       out to the mound. Miguel glances back to the bullpen, where
       Salvador is warming up.

       Stu signals for Salvador to come in, and we follow Miguel off
       the field to scattered applause.

A148   IN THE RADIO BOOTH Jack Jefferies continues his play-by-play ofA148
       the game.

                here in the 4th, bringing in rookie
                reliever, Salvador Torres for his
                Bridgetown debut.

B148   IN THE DUGOUT.   Miguel sits on the bench, throws a towel over    B148

       ON THE MOUND.   Salvador warms up, looking a little freaked.

       Players and fans marvel over Sal's unorthodox, side-armed
       delivery. His form is reminiscent of A's legend, Dennis
       Eckersly, but without the grace.

       MIGUEL peaks through his towel at the action...

       ON THE FIELD.   Salvador takes a deep breath, delivers his first
       pitch...

<b>                              UMPIRE
</b>                Strike!

       Salvador seems to relax.    Winds up his next pitch, and...

       ...the ball appears to zig-zag across the plate, freezing the
       hitter in confusion.

<b>                              UMPIRE
</b>                Strike two!

       MIGUEL can't watch, hides behind the towel again.   SLOW ZOOM IN
       on Miguel's head, hidden.

<b>                            UMPIRE (O.S.)
</b>                Strike THREE!

       Miguel removes the towel, sees...

       ...SALVADOR smiling big as he comes off the field. Orlando pats
       him on the back, hands him his first professional strikeout
       ball.

<b>C148   IN THE RADIO BOOTH                                                  C148

</b>                A stellar debut for Torres, who records
                the final out, baffling Josh Lansford
                with a nasty side-armed cutter.

D148   FROM THE DUGOUT, Salvador arrives to a congratulatory standing D148
       ovation from the fans and his teammates.

<b>                            STU
</b>                Welcome to America, kid.

       Salvador sits next to Miguel on the bench, admiring the ball.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                Just do me a favor... don't give it

      Salvador laughs, but Miguel is serious.   He gets up and heads
      for the showers.

</b>
      Helen and Earl drive Miguel home after the game. ON THE CAR
      RADIO, we can hear a news report of a suicide bombing in Iraq.
      Helen turns it down.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>               You started dropping your arm in the
               third. I think that was your problem.

<b>                           EARL
</b>               He lost control of his breaking pitches
               and they just zeroed in on the
               fastball, which isn't as fast as it
               used to be.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>               Earl...

<b>                           EARL
</b>               Don't matter, he can't understand
               anyway.

      Miguel stares out the window in the backseat.

      CLOSE ON corn stalks passing through frame. Miguel stares out
      the bus window. Salvador jokes around with Orlando and Ed about
      whether Dominican or Venezuelan girls are better.

      Salvador in the bullpen. Out of nowhere, Stu mimes the chicken
      walk to Sal, and they both laugh.

      Miguel throws in a pitch, which is lined directly over his head
      for a base hit. He swears to himself as he sprints over to back
      up home plate where the runner scores easily.

<b>155   INT. VISITORS' CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT                                155
</b>
      Miguel storms into the empty clubhouse, grabs a bat from the
      wall rack, and smashes a water dispenser unit to the ground,
      spilling water everywhere. As he observes the mess, his
      breathing steadies, and...

      He glances over to the entrance, where the clubhouse manager
      stares at him, disapproving.

<b>156   INT. VISITING COACHES' OFFICE - DAY                             156
</b>
      Miguel sits across from Stu, staring off, embarrassed.

<b>                           STU
</b>               I know it's hard when you don't perform
               up to your own expectations for
               yourself. But you need to learn self-
               control. Can you understand what I'm
               saying? You need to learn that your
               actions have consequences. So we're
               gonna take the cost of the water unit
               you broke out of your next check...
               That's not something your family back
               home's gonna be too proud of... Is it?

      Miguel turns his gaze to Stu. Though he doesn't fully
      understand what he's saying, Stu's intention is clear.

<b>                           STU
</b>               So you should think real hard next
               time. Think about channeling that
               frustration you're feeling onto the
               field. Into practice. Channel it into
               working harder--

<b>                           MIGUEL
</b>               --I am work hard! Everyday I work
               hard.

<b>                           STU

               you're the only one on this team works
               hard?

</b>                    (in Spanish)
               I don't understand you. You speak too
               fast. I just don't understand!

<b>                           STU
</b>               Look, you may think I don't know what
               you're going through, but I do. I've
               been on the mound; I've played through
               pain. I've been in your exact
               situation before. I've struggled
               too... I've...

      As Miguel glances away in frustration, Stu stops himself.   They
      sit in silence. Hold.

      players pack up their gear in their respective dugouts.

      SLOW ZOOM IN on MIGUEL, staring at the falling rain.

<b>158   INT. MOTEL LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT                                    158

      CLOSE ON about ten pills in Miguel's palm.

      Jeff Elks instructs Miguel, alone, in the small room with a
      flickering fluorescent light.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>               Listen, your first time, take a half.
               Okay? No more. You gotta ease into
               it. Half.

      Miguel nods.

</b>               And anyone finds these, you didn't get
               them from me, okay?

      Before Miguel can respond, Salvador enters with his dirty
      laundry. Miguel hides the pills.

<b>                            SALVADOR
</b>               What's up?

<b>                           JEFF
</b>               What's up, Sal?

       Salvador examines his detergent options from the dispenser
       machine.

<b>                            SALVADOR
</b>                Which one do you use?

       Miguel eyes the bleach.    Can't help himself.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                That one.

<b>                            SALVADOR
</b>                Thanks.

       THE CAMERA eerily floats toward and around Miguel on the mound.
       He stares down the HITTER, totally focused. He touches his
       cross, whispers a prayer to himself.

       Winds up, throws, and...

<b>       THUD!
</b>
       ...a cloud of dust pops off the catcher's mitt, just like the
       old days. Miguel's "stuff" is back. And he knows it.

       eating caramel corn and cola.

                the first. I don't want to jinx it,
                but this sure looks like the Santos we
                knew earlier this season.

C161   IN THE DUGOUT. There's an intensity we haven't seen before in C161
       Miguel. We get the sense he's treating this game like it could
       be his last.

<b>162    ON THE MOUND - 2ND INNING                                           162

       CLOSE ON MIGUEL.    Sweating more than he should at this point in
       the game, but...

       ...who cares? He continues to dominate opposing hitters,
       striking out two more in the 2nd.

       Still sweating, Miguel is now shifting his jaw back-and-forth.
       The SOUND FADES LOW, as he stares onto the field, sees...

       ...the teams changing sides between innings, everyone moving in
       subtle SLOW-MOTION (36 fps).

       Stu approaches Miguel, puts his hand on his shoulder. We see
       him mouth the words, "You okay?", but NO SOUND comes out.

       Miguel nods, yes.

       And back in real time (24 fps). Miguel fires his first pitch
       over the head of his catcher and all the way to the backstop.
       Orlando motions for him to calm down.

       The next pitch is closer, but still high.

       And the next pitch BEANS the hitter in the thigh.

       Miguel swears at himself, tries hard to calm down, but his heart
       is racing.

                talking to himself.

</b>                Strike!

       Orlando nods, encouraging.      Throws the ball back.

       Miguel takes another deep breath. He whispers a prayer to
       himself, grabs the ball in his spike curve grip, and...

       ...his next pitch is ROCKED to deep left field.

       Miguel immediately lowers his head, unable to watch. We HOLD on
       his anguished reaction, as the hitter circles the bases.

E164   MIGUEL does his best to shake it off, but he keeps muttering toE164
       himself, which makes him look crazy.

       Another deep breath.    Another pitch...

       This one almost finds the batter's head, as he falls to the dirt
       to avoid contact. It's on.

       The batter leaps to his feet, walks out toward the mound,
       pointing his finger at Miguel, PISSED.

       Miguel opens his arms, inviting a fight.     Orlando steps between
       them.

       restore order.

      Miguel and the batter continue jawing at each other, while the
      other players swirl around them, creating little sub-conflicts
      of their own. It's a mess.

      The sound FADES TO SILENCE and the image blends to SLO-MO again.
      There's something poetic about a bunch of men in child-like
      baseball uniforms, screaming at each other in silence.

      Miguel looks around, perhaps recognizing this for himself...
      Hold, until...

      ...he calmly walks off the field, leaving the chaos behind.

      Miguel eats a late dinner at the table. Earl sits at the other
      end, sipping some tea, while Helen does dishes at the sink.
      The mood is uncomfortably tense. Nobody says a word, until
      Miguel musters up the courage.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>               I'm sorry.

      Helen turns off the faucet, turns around. Earl methodically
      sets down his mug, stands up, and crosses to Miguel. Puts his
      arm around his shoulder, wherein...

      ...Miguel breaks down, hugs Earl around the waist, his face
      pressed against his stomach. He's crying. Hold.

      Stu addresses Miguel before the game. Though his words are
      encouraging, his tone is detached, cold. Miguel senses this,
      listens, dejected.

               the game. Nobody likes to admit it,
               but it is. The true test of our
               character as athletes... is how we come
               back. It's up to you.

       Similar to an earlier sequence of JUMPCUTS on Miguel reacting to
       the game from the dugout, we now HOLD on Miguel, solemn and
       detached, from the bullpen.

       NOTE: the frame for the following images contains the first 3-4
       rows of FANS seated behind the bullpen, so we can also use them
       to gauge what might be happening on the field.

       PLAY 1: Miguel, the FOUR RELIEVERS, and the fans clap for a
       nice play.

       PLAY 2: The fans jump to their feet as a ground ball passes
       through frame, followed by an outfielder in hot pursuit.

       PLAY 3: A reliever warms up in the foreground. Miguel stares
       ahead, deadpan, while the others chat and spit chewing tobacco.

       PLAY 4: A new reliever warms up, then runs out onto the field,
       leaving only two others with Miguel.

       PLAY 5: Miguel stares ahead, while the crowd does the "Chicken
       Dance" behind him.

       PLAY 6: The fans leap to their feet in applause. The two
       relievers high-five. Miguel CLAPS, going through the motions.

      PLAY 7: Miguel chews and spits sunflower seed shells as the
      fans sing along to "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."

      PLAY 8: Another reliever runs out onto the field, leaving only
      Miguel and one other guy.

      PLAY 9:   Miguel is finally warming up, ready to enter the game,
      but...

      ...the fans leap to their feet, CHEERING victoriously. Game
      over. The only other reliever grabs his jacket, and heads out
      onto the field.

      As the players and fans   head for the exits, Miguel remains on
      the bullpen mound for a   beat. He nods to himself, oddly at
      peace with the moment.    Miguel steps off the mound and we PAN
      with him, as he crosses   frame, and makes the long walk to the
      dugout. Hold.

      Miguel grabs a slip of paper from his nightstand. His large
      duffel bag is packed full in front of him. On the wall, his NYC
      calendar is turned to AUGUST.

      He goes to the phone.   Dials...

      After a long beat he hangs up.

      Helen grabs a dish towel.      They do the dishes together in
      silence. After a beat...

      Helen smiles, pats Miguel on the back.     HOLD.

      Earl drops off Miguel near the team bus, as players and coaches
      load their gear in, and get on.

      Miguel cautiously approaches the bus, sees Salvador,
      hesitates...

<b>                           MIGUEL
</b>               I forgot something in the clubhouse.
               I'll be right back.

      As Miguel turns, Salvador grabs his bag, which is still on his
      shoulder.

<b>                           SALVADOR
</b>               Here, I'll load your bag.

      Miguel grips his bag tighter and the two of them lock eyes.
      Salvador senses his intensity, releases the bag. Miguel backs
      away with Salvador looking on.

      AT THE CLUBHOUSE ENTRANCE Miguel turns back to the bus, sees...

      ...Salvador eyeing him from the open bus window.   Sal raises his
      hand, very subtly waves goodbye.

      Miguel continues on his way.

      Miguel steps on, moves past the other PASSENGERS, finds an empty
      seat towards the back. He sits down, catches his breath, and
      whispers a prayer to himself. When he's done, he looks across
      the aisle, where an OLD LADY is staring at him.

      He shoots her a cautious smile.

      From the New Jersey turnpike, Miguel sees the approaching
      Manhattan skyline in the early morning light. He sits up
      straight, looks attentively at the city emerging in the
      distance.

      Morning COMMUTERS push past Miguel, as he looks around, lost in
      the cacophony of the swirling rush hour environment.

      He locates a giant subway map on the wall, the various subway
      lines reaching into the outer boroughs like colorful tentacles.
      His eyes scan the map, and we follow his finger up the green
      line's numbered stations, stopping on 161ST/YANKEE STADIUM.

      Miguel smiles.

      AT THE TURNSTILES. Miguel inches forward, observes people
      passing through after swiping cards. He notices a line behind a
      Metrocard vending machine nearby.

<b>178   AT THE MACHINE - SECONDS LATER                                    178

      Fortunately, there is a Spanish option, so after a few touches
      and BEEPS, he's got his card.

      He swipes the card, tries to pass through, but the turnstile
      won't budge. He studies the message: "SWIPE AGAIN AT THIS
      TURNSTILE", but can't make sense of it. Miguel tries again,
      this time very slowly, but still can't get through.

      An IMPATIENT COMMUTER behind him SIGHS loudly.

      Miguel steps out of the way, let's the commuter pass.

      After the commuter goes through, Miguel tries again.

      Miguel descends from the elevated subway station, glances
      around. The atmosphere is immediately more familiar, as PEOPLE
      walk by speaking Spanish; MERENGUE blasts out of an open
      apartment window; Dominican flags hang from others.

      Miguel paces up the block, looking for something.    He smiles
      when he finds...

      ...El Restaurante Caribe. A HELP WANTED sign (in English and
      Spanish) hangs in the window.

      The Stadium is closed today, so Miguel struggles to catch a

       his duffel and sits at the desk. He examines the calling card
       for a beat, then goes to the window, looks out. Hold.

      Miguel strolls by various stores and restaurants. He passes
      outside a WOODEN CABINET STORE, where 5-6 Dominican men, ranging
      in age from 20 to 50 years old, make furniture in the shop. He
      stops for a beat, watching the men work.

</b>          Shut up.

<b>                      OSVALDO
</b>          What's so special about Clemente?

<b>                      MIGUEL
</b>          I read this book where he said
          something like, "If you have the
          opportunity to help someone and don't,
          then you're wasting your life."
          And he was a carpenter too.

<b>                      OSVALDO

<b>                      MIGUEL
</b>          For real. He used to make furniture
          during the off season.

</b>          Are you fucking with me? Cause you

</b>          When did you get released?

<b>                      MIGUEL
</b>          They didn't release me. I left a few
          days before the season ended.

<b>                        OSVALDO
</b>          You left?    When was this?

<b>                      MIGUEL
</b>          About two weeks ago.

      Miguel hesitates, unsure where to begin.      Osvaldo senses his
      discomfort with the question.

<b>                           OSVALDO
</b>               Do you have any family here?

               But I'm okay... I have some money
               saved, a couple friends. I'll go home
               to visit soon.

      Osvaldo doesn't quite buy it, but nods anyway.

      in another GUEST, but...

      Unable to sleep, Miguel lies in bed, staring at the ceiling,
      when he overhears a commotion from across the hall.

      After a beat, he hears a door open and SLAM SHUT.

      He goes to the door, listens close.     It's quiet, until...

</b>
      Miguel flinches.    Then slowly cracks open the door to find...

      ...Raquel standing before him with a small leather duffel bag.

               Just a few hours. Til morning. I'll
               be back.

      She forces the bag into his hands, kisses him on the cheek, and
      retreats into her own room.

      Miguel closes the door, still holding the bag. He sets it on
      his bed, stares at it. After a few beats, he grabs it, stuffs
      it under the bed, out of sight.

      He sits down at the desk, stares at the bed, when he hears
      SHOUTING from the hall. Again, he goes to the door, listens.

      Another MAN POUNDS on Raquel's door, SCREAMING in Ukrainian,
      while Nikolai YELLS at the man in English, though Miguel can't
      make out exactly what's going on. The shouting intensifies
      until a SCUFFLE breaks out. A woman SCREAMS. Miguel reaches
      for the door handle, but stops himself.

      He steps into his BATHROOM, shuts the door, sits on the toilet.
      The muffled SHOUTING continues. Miguel waits.

      Now quiet, Miguel stares at the mysterious bag on his bed, then
      heads for the door with his packed duffel over his shoulder. He
      puts his ear to the door, then exits, leaving the other bag
      behind.

               lunch. Hadn't been here long, so he
               knew very little English. Didn't even
               notice the "whites only" sign hanging
               in the window. And Vic was Black. I
               looked him up on Google. I mean Black
               like you. So he sits down at the
               counter and the little waitress comes
               up to big Vic and says, "I'm sorry, we
               don't serve colored people."

      Osvaldo pauses for dramatic effect, as Miguel and Estella
      eagerly await what comes next.

<b>                           OSVALDO
</b>               So he leans close to the waitress,
               tells her in his best English, "That's
               okay, I don't eat colored people."

      After a beat, Estella laughs, but Miguel is unsure.   Osvaldo
      does his best to explain the joke in Spanish.

       Miguel removes the phone from his ear for a beat.

      sign from his catcher. He nods. And delivers.

The ball is SMACKED toward third, where Jorge makes an awkward
lunge for the ball, manages to stop it with his foot. By the
time he gets his hand on it, the RUNNER has made it to first.

The fans and some of the players laugh at Jorge's ugly mistake.

<b>                    OLD MAN HECKLER
</b>             (from the stands)
        This ain't soccer! You can use your

<b>                    MIGUEL
</b>             (smiling)
        Just like old times.

But Jorge shrugs and laughs it off.   No pressure here.   It's
only a game.

Miguel buckles down, delivers a monster fastball.

<b>                      UMPIRE
</b>        Strike!

He gets the ball back, looks to the stands, and sees...

...Monica waving to Jorge at third.

Miguel's new friend, Osvaldo, is also there with Estella.
Miguel smiles to them.

Miguel fires in the next pitch, even faster, and the batter
swings straight through it.

<b>                      UMPIRE
</b>        Strike two!

He gets the ball back, lowers his head and whispers a prayer to
himself. Looks back to the runner on second. Comes to the set
position, and...

...floats in a vicious, swooping, knuckle curve, that causes the
batter to flinch out of the way, before breaking back over the
plate for...

<b>                    UMPIRE
</b>        Strike three!

All the fans and players in attendance go NUTS over the awesome
pitch, as we follow Miguel off the field to a mini-standing
ovation. He tips his hat to the crowd. Just like old times.

      Miguel takes a seat as TEAMMATES pass through the frame and pat
      him on the back.

      The SOUND FADES LOW as we start a SLOW ZOOM IN on Miguel. He
      takes in the moment as we get closer, and his smile gives way to
      a beat of quiet introspection. Hold.

      He looks out across the field.   CLAPS for encouragement.
