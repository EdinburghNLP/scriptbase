          A young man, FREDDIE SUTTON (early 20s)_ speaks to a

                         DOCTOR;

                         DOCTOR
          What are you going to do when you get out
          of here? You're going to have to wear a
          belt for six months, maybe a year...

                         FREDDIE
          What kind of belt?

                         DOCTOR
          A surgical belt. You won't be able to do
          very heavy lifting.

                         FREDDIE
          .I try to stay away from that.

                         DOCTOR
          But you spend time outdoors.

                         FREDDIE

                         MMMM

                         DOCTOR
          What do you do?

                         FREDDIE

                         DOCTOR
          You didn't have very much on you when you
          were admitted. Where were you going?

                         FREDDIE
          I was on my way to Placerville. To the
          Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a
          friend of mine. He doesn't know where I
          am.

                         DOCTOR
          How old are you, Freddie?

                         FREDDIE

          28.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         DOCTOR
          Why don't you turn honest?
          You seem like an intelligent fellow.
          'Quick on your feet - you like to drink?

                         FREDDIE
          It's a weakness. But I like it.

                         DOCTOR
          I know what the other is too.

                         FREDDIE
          How can you tell that? I'm clean.

                         DOCTOR
          The tattoo's.

                         FREDDIE
          Is that a weakness...

                         DOCTOR
          No one ever made money chasing girls.

                         FREDDIE
          You're wrong. This tatoo's my Auntie.

                         DOCTOR
          Who's that?

                         FREDDIE
          My Auntie Bertha, (she raised me.) But
          that doesn't mean I don't have a
          weakness...

                         DOCTOR
          College?

                         FREDDIE
          I tried that, it didn't work.

                         DOCTOR
          Why'd you leave?

                         FREDDIE
          Sometimes my hypo's get the best of
          me, I really feel like walking into the
          street and hitting people's hats off.

                         DOCTOR
          That's how you end up like this. With a
          burst appendix.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         FREDDIE
          That's when I know it's time to get to
          the sea.. what kind of belt?

                         DOCTOR
          A medical belt. Similar for lifting.
          You're going to need some money. What do
          you plan to do?

                         FREDDIE
          I'm going to pay back the hospital. And
          you.

                         DOCTOR
          You don't owe me anything. I'm on surgical
          duty. But you're expected to pay the
          hospital for medicines. And your belt.

                         FREDDIE
          Alright. I intend to do that. You saying
          you have a job for me? What? As an
          orderly?

                         DOCTOR
          You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much
          lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have
          to learn. But maybe you could run an
          elevator, something of that sort.

                         FREDDIE
          I want to get out of here, but I also
          like it here. You think I was gonna die?

                         DOCTOR
          I know you were, Freddie.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't know. I'm not saying you didn't
          save me... . but...I can't seem to die.

                         DOCTOR
          Too lucky?

                         FREDDIE
          Something like that.

                         DOCTOR
          Were you in the service?

                         FREDDIE
          Yes, sir.

                         DOCTOR
          Navy?

                         FREDDIE

                         DOCTOR

                         FREDDIE

                         DOCTOR
          Your luck was up this time, Freddie. You
          should have seen the pus in your belly.
          Something to think about.
          It's not too late to stop being a
          weisnheimer, no matter what you think.
          you're still a young man.

          Freddie walks into the alley, stuffing some money in his
          pockets - he's followed by a FIGURE. FREDDIE realizes,
          stops, SPINS AROUND AND PULLS KNIFE:

                         FREDDIE

          talk with you -

                         FREDDIE
          You can talk standing in front of the
          restaurant, around the corner --
          At that moment, TWO OTHER MEN come out of the shadows and

          JUMP FREDDIE, KNOCK HIM AROUND, TAKE HIS MONEY AND LEAVE.
          He's left a little bloody, messy, no money in the alley.

          eyes.."

          FREDDIE TAKES NOTICE, COMES CLOSER... STARTS TO SIZE UP

          THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION .AND REALIZES HE MAY/DOES

          HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS...
          .he backs away quietly-and starts to THROW SOME

          THINGS INTO A BAG...

          .WHEN SOME OF THE FILIPINO'S NOTICE HIM STARTING TO

          LEAVE, THEY YELL AFTER HIM...

          .FREDDIE TAKES OFF...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          AND THE FILIPINO'S GIVE CHASE.. .THEY MOVE INTO THE FARM

          FIELDS.

          EXTEND OUT. CHASE THROUGH THE FIELDS FREDDIE JUST RUNNING

          AND RUNNING AS FAST AS HE CAN...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER.

          LATER. off the side of the highway. Freddie collects
          himself, obviously running for the past hour and evading
          the Filipino's.
          He hitches now...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. DOCKS/SAN FRANCISCO - HIRING HALL - NIGHT.

          Inside the crowded HIRING HALL, sailors, men looking for
          work, etc. Freddie puts his name down. This is a short
          burst of a scene, establish he wants to get back to sea,
          wants work, but there's nothing for a few weeks.

          EXT. DOCKS/SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT.

          VARIOUS ANGLES. Freddie makes his way around the docks,
          looking for something/anything. PLAY OUT.
          He comes across a SHIP that's being readied for voyage.
          It's an old cattle TRAWLER that seems converted to some
          kind of CRUISE SHIP/PRIVATE YACHT-type vessel.
          There's a buzz of getting ready around the ship also a
          minor cocktail party in progress. (light music playing
          from the ship...) DECKHANDS preparing to ship out, etc...
          Freddie approaches the gang-plank...no one is there to
          guard it. He walks straight up the gang plank and gets on
          board the ship.

          ANGLE, ON BOARD.
          CAMERA follows him around... no one seems to notice or
          care...
          He goes down below...

          ANGLE, BELOW DECK.
          He sneaks around... some YOUNG MEN are getting dressed in

          TUXEDOS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          This plays itself out...FREDDIE finds a small CLOSET with
          a TUXEDO and slips it on. He gets swallowed up into this
          group of young men and acts as if he belongs --

          .THE SHIP PULLS AWAY. HEADING OUT SAN FRANCISCO BAY...

          .FREDDIE HEADING UP INTO A WELL APPOINTED CABIN...

          A COCKTAIL PARTY IS IN FULL SWING AS THE SHIP LEAVES S.F.
          There are all manner of people here, in this area,
          everyone seems quite happy, chatty. Middle aged couples,
          single middle-aged men, young couples, some kids,
          teenagers, etc.
          Freddie working near the bar, starts delivering drinks...
          A live PIANO TRIO playing. FREDDIE NOTICES:
          A LARGE MAN IN HIS MID-40s, all red-hair, red eyebrows,
          red lips sings and dances while holding a baby It's a
          bit blurry across the room from Freddie's POV
          The SONG ENDS and everyone laughs, applauds, collapses.
          KIDS run around...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MAIN DINNER CABIN. LATER.

          Everyone seated for DINNER; we now see the red haired man
          in full: MASTER OF CEREMONIES (early 40s)
           He sits at the head of the table, his family with him:
          HIS WIFE: MARY SUE (pregnant, mid-20s) HIS DAUGHTERS:

          ELIZABETH (18) ELENA (3) SUSANAH (1) HIS SON: VAL (20)
          A RIGHT HAND MAN TO MASTER IS: NORMAN CONRAD (40s)

          ANGLE, THE BAR.
          The BARTENDER whispers to Freddie; indicates he's POURED
          TWO SHOTS FOR THEM TO SNEAK ... FREDDIE and the BARTENDER
          reach and grab them, shoot them back...

          INSTANTLY, FREDDIE'S HEAD POUNDS.

                         BARTENDER
          You feel alright?

                         FREDDIE
          Yeah, fine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         ANOTHER SERVER
          Why don't you go lay down, I'll take
          over...
          Freddie walks off. FREDDIE doesn't seem DRUNK he SEEMS
          DRUGGED. He walks down the hall - AND IN AN INSTANT FALLS
          FLAT ON HIS FACE. DEAD WEIGHT. He's dragged off.

          FADE OUT.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SMALL DARK ROOM - LATER.

          FREDDIE wakes up MASTER OF CEREMONIES is here along with
          MARY SUE and NORMAN CONRAD does the speaking at first,

                         FREDDIE

          Freddie is already sitting in a chair they have him in.

                          FREDDIE (CONT'D)
          Whatdchu put in my drink?

                         NORMAN CONRAD

                         FREDDIE
          I'm sleepy.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM - MORNING.


          CU. FREDDIE.
          Morning sun comes in, hits him in the face. Wakes him up.
          He looks around. He looks out the window.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HALLWAY - SHIP - MOMENTS LATER

          FREDDIE walks out, looks around. . .he walks down the hall,
          a YOUNG GIRL passes him, smiles wide and says "GOOD
          MORNING," ad keeps walking...
          He moves towards a room where he hears a TYPEWRITER. He
          steps in the doorway. MASTER sits at his desk, writing
          gear all around. MASTER looks up, sees him, stops
          typing...
          Smiles. Extends his arm out for Freddie to come in and
          take a seat.. .MASTER is warm, inviting. Not rushed. They
          sort of sit and settle with each a moment;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         MASTER
          Ok?

                         FREDDIE
          Alright.

                         MASTER
          You can't be...

                         FREDDIE
          Is this your ship?

                         MASTER
          I'm it's Commander, yes.

                         FREDDIE
          Where's it going?

                         MASTER
          New York City thru the canal. You're
          seamen?

                         FREDDIE
          Yes.

                         MASTER
          You're looking for work?

                         FREDDIE
          .what did I say last night...?

                         MASTER
          You said you were an able bodied seamen
          and you were looking for work?

                         FREDDIE
          You have any?

                         MASTER
          Perhaps.

                         FREDDIE
          What was in my drink?

                         MASTER
          You were sedated with chloral hydrate and
          bubble gum kisses. Ha ha ha. I'm sure if
          your check your butt-hole you'll find
          it's all in working order (he he he...)
          Isn't that what all men are worried about
          in they surrender themselves.

                         FREDDIE
          I didn't surrender myself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         MASTER
          You were acting very aggressive because
          you drank too much alcohol.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't think I was.

                         MASTER
          Yes I think you were. And I don't like
          strange boys jumping on my ship.

                         FREDDIE
          So what are you gonna do?

                         MASTER
          Why don't you just ask for work? Work
          can't be hard to find.

                         FREDDIE
          Depends on when you're ready to go...do
          you have a job for me.

                         MASTER
          You can't work in your condition.

                         FREDDIE
          What condition is that?

                         MASTER
          You're aberrated.

                         FREDDIE
          What's that mean?

                         MASTER
          A wandering from the path
          The problems you have in your life (your
          appendix, your work, your need to batter
          your body with booze...) I resolve that
          they can be fixed.

                         FREDDIE
          I've got no trouble. You got a job for me
          to do, I can do it.

                         MASTER
          Maybe I do, but not the kind you think.

                         FREDDIE
          Do you own this ship?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         MASTER
          A charter though the Explorer's Club.

                         FREDDIE
          .What do you do?

                         MASTER
          I am many things. I am writer, a doctor,
          a nuclear physicist, a theoretical
          philosopher. Above all, I am a man, A
          hopelessly inquisitive Man, just like
          you.

                         FREDDIE
          Where's your money come from?

                         MASTER
          Many years of successful writing and
          publishing has made me self sufficient.
          Reader's in all languages have enjoyed my
          work - but now I'm retired to study the
          mid and the spirit...my life's true work.

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          These studies have made me a target and I
          am hunted for what I know. Which is
          why... it is so un-wise to go lurking and
          jumping on strange ships.. .how do we know
          what your motives are?

                         FREDDIE
          .well: I apologize if I got a little
          out of hand last night - I'm just...
          looking for work and your ship looked
          good, so...it's a nice looking ship.

                         MASTER
          Don't apologize. You're a scoundrel. How
          I miss the days of working a four
          mastered schooner with nothing but salt
          horse, dried peas and a couple quarts of
          water.. .the present-day maritimer's seem
          so much more fragile, don't you think?
          You - you're and adventurer.

                         FREDDIE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         MASTER
          An able bodied seamen, a maker of wine,
          and a dashing mischievousness is what I
          knew would come to me in this-lifetime.
          .would you study with me? Submit
          yourself?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't understand what you're talking
          about.

                         MASTER
          I am always looking for mature men of
          unusual ability who are willing to
          stretch the boundaries of what they know.
          To increase knowing-ness and
          communication amongst man. I need day-ta.
          And with your help, I can gather it...

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          You already understand, you just need to
          remember. And only say yes. Say, 'yes.'

                         FREDDIE
          I'm not saying yes to anything I don't

                         UNDERSTAND --
          Master holds up the FLASK..

                         MASTER
          What's-about-this?'

                         FREDDIE
          What about it?

                         MASTER
          As a Scientist and a Conniseur I have no
          idea the contents of this remarkable
          potion, what's in it.

                         FREDDIE
          Secrets.

                         MASTER
          Can you make more?

                         FREDDIE

                         MAYBE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         MASTER
          I'll grant you a full reprive from your
          naughtiness as a stow-away if you make us
          some more. I must admit I sampled some
          and ended up drinking it all.

                         FREDDIE
          It's just booze.

                         MASTER
          Horrible Hooch?

                         FREDDIE
          Horrible Hooch.
          BEAT. They both smile, laugh a little. MASTER gets up and
          comes over him...

                         MASTER
          Would you scrub yourself up and make
          yourself clean?
          My daughter is getting married.
          Come and join us and leave your worries
          for a while, they'll still be there when
          you get back..he he he. You are invited.

          AIR...

                         MASTER
          I think we have known each other before
          you and I -

                         FREDDIE
          Oh yeah?

                         MASTER
          It will come out over time, but yes. We
          are re-united... do you reember me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         FREDDIE
          .I don't know...

                         MASTER
          That's alright. Don't strain yourself.
          You will. There will be much time to
          discuss this on the journey to our
          destination. As we travel down Time-
          Holes...you won't be afraid will you?

                         FREDDIE
          .what destination?

                         MASTER
          Have you ever had harm cme to you?

                         FREDDIE
          Sure.

                         MASTER
          What if we could return to a period of
          your life where there was harm and do
          away with it? .would You like that?

                         FREDDIE
          Ok.

                         MASTER
          That's where we go.
          They come across ALL THE PEOPLE ON BOARD. THEY WALK INTO
          THE GROUP. Everyone is getting ready for a WEDDING. . .they
          greet MASTER and FREDDIE. He walks into it and is

          INT. DINNER CABIN. NIGHT.

          It's mid-dinner, post-wedding ceremony party, everyone is
          celebrating, drinking. Master talking a blue streak,
          acting this out.

                         MASTER
          Now, now, now, how 'bout this: Here it
          comes - swooping down on me: A LARGE

          DRAGON, TEETH AND BLOOD DRIPPING! RED

          EYES!
          What do I go? A lasoooo! Whip it up, wrap
          it around it's neck. I wrastle, wrastle,
          wrastle'em to the ground - I snap up, I
          say: sit.
          Everyone laughs, Master is acting all this out, rolling
          around, etc as if he's training a dog...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Dragon sits. I say: stay. Sragon stays.
          So now he's got a leash on and he's
          staying on my command - THAT"S WHAT WHERE
          WERE AT WITH IT NOW - it stays on
          command.
          Everyone is laughing, lapping it all up. He glances;

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Next we're gonna teach it to roll over
          and play DEAD.
          Master sits down, starts speaking to someone about his
          days studying Judo ...
          FREDDIE, sitting up at the dinner table-across the
          table is: VAL, strikes up conversation:

                         VAL
          Freddie, I'm Val, the son.

                         FREDDIE
          Hello.

                         VAL
          Are you having a good time?

                         FREDDIE
          Yes.

                         VAL
          What are you goign to be working on?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't really know.

                         VAL
          Have you done any time-hole work?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't think so.
          VAL is distracted by a WELL WISHER who comes over.
          FREDDIE looks around at everyone. All the faces having a
          good time and celebrating...
          He catches the eye of a YOUNG WOMAN. . .then sees her

          HUSBAND...
          The BARTENDER comes over to FREDDIE

                         BARTENDER
          Alright, old man?

                         FREDDIE
          Yeah.

                         BARTENDER
          No hard feelings?

                         FREDDIE
          No.

                         BARTENDER
          Welcome aboard. Clif Amsbury.
          He serves him a drink.

                         BARTENDER (CONT'D)
          This one's alright. Chink, chink.

          ANGLE, LATER.
          Master is saying good-night to everyone, passes FREDDIE
          and says quietly:

                         MASTER
          When can we have some of your potion?

                         FREDDIE
          Whenever you'd like. I'll get making it -

                         MASTER
          When I'd like it - I will give you a
          signal. I will scratch my ear and rub my
          nose. What will you need?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         FREDDIE
          I'll take care of it.
          MASTER makes his way down the table trying to say goodbye
          to everyone, he finally tears away from the party by

                         SAYING:

                         MASTER
          Enough! Enough! I must get back to work!
          Keep going! Dont stop all night long!
          He leaves. FREDDIE just looks around, caught up in it
          all.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM - LATER.

          Freddie comes down into his little room. A cot has been
          made for him, some fresh clothes and a BOOK
          (hardcover,400pages) on the bed. It reads, very simply:

                         THE CAUSE

          CU. BOOK "THE CAUSE"
          The cover is opened, CAMERA SEES IN CU the opening line
          from the book: "Shall a man be master of his memories? Or
          shall his memories be the master?"

          ANGLE, FREDDIE
          He lays in bed and reads the book. He reads about to
          lines and his eyes slam shit, asleep, still holding the
          book.

          HOLD.

          INT. MAIN DECK / CABIN - MORNING.

          It's the next morning, EVERYONE IS HERE FOR BREAKFAST,
          BUFFET STYLE, FREDDIE mixed in amongst it all.
          FREDDIE sits down to eat with MARY SUE, who feeds her
          baby. The other children around. VAL and NORMAN CONRAD
          are here...

                         MARY SUE
          He's been writing all night ...I think
          you've inspired something in hi,. When
          we're at home, on land, there's too much,
          pulling him in each direction.

          28.

          MARY SUE (CONT'D)
          He was working on a book that showed how
          the Russians used narcosynthesis and
          physical torture and how it worked as it
          did. That was interrupted.
          He had a technology oh psychological
          warfare to present to the Defense
          Department. All that was interrupted,
          lost. Each time he sits to write, a new
          attack is launched against him and he
          spends too much time on defending
          himself. I tell him to ignore it, but
          he's so sensitive...

                         FREDDIE
          Who's attacking him?

                         MARY SUE
          People that are scared. People that are
          greedy. Ex-wives...That's what's so nice
          about being at sea. He gets his studies
          done, advances the learning, and he
          writes BOOK II.

                         FREDDIE
          What's a time-hole?

          DUNBAR (late 20s) are on stage. She is lying down, eyes
          close, he is sitting in a chair next to her, students
          watch as he runs an exercise with her; Mary Sue has
          brought Freddie in here and sits with him in the
          back.. .Freddie watches:

                         WAYNE
          Say, "back beyond" and return to the pre-
          natal area.

                         SUSAN
          Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond.
          Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond.

          I hear a voice..It's my father's voice.

          Listen to the words and repeat them,
          please.

                         SUSAN
          He is talking to my mother. The face
          pressure is hurting. It's uncomfortable.
          It keeps going up and down and it hurts.

                         WAYNE
          Repeat his words, please.

                         SUSAN
          "I don't want to come in you now. Let's
          wait." The pressure is banging my face.
          Into my face. My mother is there, her
          voice...

                         WAYNE
          What is your mother saying? Please, if
          you hear her?

                         SUSAN
          She saying "well get out of there then. I
          don't want you in me at all if your not
          there to come. Get in to come." She's
          mad.

                         WAYNE
          Please return to the start of this and
          recount.

                         SUSAN
          I wonder what they're doing? I hear a
          squishing sounds and it's wet. Oh. Oh my.

                         WAYNE
          Recount please.

                         SUSAN
          A faint rhythm ...then faster. I hear my
          fathers voice say, "oh honey..I wont come
          in you now. I'm not too sure I like
          children that well and I have my job to
          worry about..." And my mother must shove
          him - a sharper pain here - "THEN I DON'T

          IN THERE AT ALL, GET OUT.."

                         WAYNE

          MASTER (V.0.)
          .someone came up to me the other day,
          and I had to say...I had to correct him.
          He said, "I heard the Cause can fix me.."
          I looked down at him and he'd lost his
          legs. He's sitting in a wheel chair and
          had no legs to speak of. I said, "We can
          do very many things, sir...but no, we
          cannot replace your legs. This is how
          rumors get started." Let's talk about
          what we can do...
          FREDDIE looks around and watches all the STUDENTS on
          their headphones. He tries to flirt and make eye contact
          with all the WOMEN.

          MASTER (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          When did you decide you had limited
          potentials and capabilities? You've
          forgotten that this is all just a dirty

          So past failures bother you?

                         FREDDIE

          not really.

          Is your life a constant struggle for
          survival?

                         FREDDIE
          .not really ... .. life's alright.

                         MASTER
          Would you rather give orders than take
          them?

                         FREDDIE
          Sure.

                         MASTER
          Are you often impulsive in you behaviour.

                         FREDDIE
          .sure... Yes.

                         MASTER
          Do other people interest you very much?

                         FREDDIE
          Not really (girls? They do)

                         MASTER
          Do you find it easy to be impartial?

                         FREDDIE
          Yeah.

                         MASTER
          Are you likely to be jealous?

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          Are you logical and scientific in your
          thinking?

                         FREDDIE
          I'm..I don't know. Don't care about
          science.

                         MASTER
          Do you rarely suspect the actions of
          others?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't understand.

                         FREDDIE
          .I suspect people...yes. Sure. So...no,
          rarely. Most people are ass's anyway.

                         MASTER
          Are you usually truthful to others?

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          Are your actions considered unpredictable
          by other people?

          seriously, THEN: OUT OF THE PAUSE AND OUT OF THE BLUE HE

                         MASTER
          Silly..its good to laugh in
          processing.. sometimes we forget.
          Master reaches down, brings the microphone to his mouth:

          He CLICKS it off. Smiles at Freddie; he gives him a
          comforting hug.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Should we sample another sip before we
          join them upstairs?

                         FREDDIE
          Is that it?

                         MASTER
          For now.

                         MASTER
          Do you believe that God will save you
          from your own ridiculousness and self
          contempt?

                         FREDDIE

          She said she'd let me have my inheritance
          if I were to sleep with her. So I did and
          I never got my money. I was drunk. She
          looked good.

                         MASTER
          She's rich? Is she? She has your
          inheritance, does she?

                         FREDDIE
          She controls it all.

                         MASTER
          You feel you're owed this?

                         FREDDIE

          Why aren't you with her?

                         FREDDIE
          I'm an idiot. I don't know. I got no
          reason.

                         MASTER
          Do you love Doris?

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Let me just listen to this tape...
          He picks up the tape and lifts it to his ear..he wiggles
          it around next to his ear..

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Can't hear anything. But there's sound on
          here, no? Sound to be found?
          He puts the tape reels onto the player...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          This should do it!
          He flips the switch. Nothing. No sound.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Hmmmm. Can' thear anything. Wait. There
          are sounds on this tape, but I can't
          hear... wait... how about this...
          Nothing. He continues this ...he plugs the speakers
          in.. . nothing again and again.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Well what do we have? We have the high
          fidelity audio tape, we have speakers,
          and yet..a ha! Just a moment.
          He turns the machine "ON"...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          This should do it...
          Nothing.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Seems we're out of pieces..
          Everyone laughs nervously...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          I know there's sound on that tape...
          He plugs the power cord into the wall... It crackles and
          sound pours out.. It's MASTER'S VOICE.

          MASTER (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Our life has never stopped and always
          been. All of the recordings of our
          lifetimes that we have lived are
          available to us..
          MUSIC STARTS TO PLAY. GENTLE PIANO MUSIC. MASTER turns
          the volume down on the reel-to-reel, speaks live to the

                         PARTY:

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Everything's there isn't it? On the tape?
          Sure is, we just need to get it working
          with all the other pieces in synch-ro-
          nization. No good if it's not plugged
          into the wall. Can't hear it. But the
          sounds are still there. No good if those
          speakers aren't there. Can't hear it.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          But that doesn't mean it's not there,
          does it? No. It doesn't. That flimsy
          little piece of tape is just nothin'
          without all the other equipment lined up
          properly, isn't it? We CAN access the
          past, traumas and seeds that abberate us
          in present time and once we access them -
          we challenge them and throw them away.
          Previously, I'd established how to access
          these aberrations and painful memories to
          pre-birth/cellular times.
          But the new studies prove there is a time
          beyond that. The Whole-of-time with which
          we are now working. At last count,
          perhaps sixty-seven trillion years our
          studies show...
          Besides the everyday struggles of how we
          become better, more able, more productive
          homo sapiens, the uses for this new
          science is the location and removal of
          certain leukemias, apathies, manics.
          Depressives, perverts, stuttering,
          neuroses, ulcers, arthritis, and asthmas.
          This is the province and science of
          Cause.
          If you'll forgive me, I must sit down.
          Perhaps you've taken notice of my leg
          injury and limp damndest thing. You see
          it happens every time I come to Manhattan
          Island, its a wound I've never conquered
          and I'll tell you how I found out about,
          because I never knew what in the H was
          happening...
          Well I did some processing to find out.
          Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me
          back...we processed over three hours! And
          something came up. It was this:
          I lived a life before and suffered a
          great injury. Knee injury...
          It was just around 1888. A great number
          and year. Significant as the creation .
          year of the new york city sewer system if
          I'm not wrong...
          I was a thief and criminal, working late
          into the night robbing a bank in the
          western side of the island.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          The crime was committed with a revolver
          in hand. A Cole .45. My accomplices and I
          made it clear across town when we were
          ambushed by the local authorities.
          -- but I made a slip away. A digression
          into the under constructed sewer system.
          It was here that I could no be found - or
          so my thinking went. All my confidence
          and all my arrogance was brought upon me.
          Full in the face. For I was nose to nose
          with a twenty-five foot alligator in the
          New York City sewer. Oh brother! What a
          scare I was in for. Now if you've veer
          seen the SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! OF A GATOR -
          you'll remember the fear.
          You see, this being an island, and in
          those days more inhabited by creature
          than man, why wouldn't I meet such a
          beast?
          In my evasion -- I dropped the gold. The
          money I'd stolen in my getaway.. .not
          dropped, but stuffed in a newly cemented
          drain hole just around 125th
          Street... present day Harlem County I
          believe today. Yes. Yes.
          I stuffed it and made a getaway from both
          man and beast â€žshattered my knee in five
          different places-turned into a piece of
          glass..woke up early in the morning
          somewhere near the present day Times
          Square-which was nothing more than a
          farm..quite a farm..but that's another
          story.
          So what does this say? Injuries stay with
          us don't they??..They sure do. How's it
          gonna go away. How? How? How'm I gonna
          fix this knee. How are any of us going to
          get better? More able?
          We Must Process The Whole Of Time. This
          Life and Pre Natal Cellular processing is
          not enough. We have Lived Many, Many,
          Many Lives. So anybody tat is not
          processing the whole of time - is doing a
          disservice to man and Will Not Get
          Better. I cannot put it more simply.

          the time away from all of my writing to
          go back down and DO IT so I don't walk
          around with the darndest limp everytime I

          from the back of the room.)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         JOHN MORE
          Some of this seems quite like hypnosis,
          is it not?

                         MASTER
          Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the
          reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is
          un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow
          him to raise his awareness and IQ.

                         JOHN MORE
          What is the difference between this and
          psychotherapy?

                         MASTER
          Yes. Well. They are very different. No.
          Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no,
          no. Don't associate us with such people!
          That's terrible (he, he) why that's a bad
          manner don't you know? I mean at that
          business about sex and all that. That's
          for the neurotic or the person who is
          insane or something like that. That's
          nothing to do with us. They've failed.
          That's for the fortunate few who can
          afford the fees.

                         JOHN MORE
          But some of this does in fact seem to
          share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and
          modern psychotherapy, does it not?

                         MASTER
          No it does not. This is an exact science,
          you see. Comparable to physics or
          chemistry - but simpler. It's
          engineering. Herr Freud had his chance
          and contributed some very workable data,
          but in the end, he failed. So that's
          that.

                         JOHN MORE
          And how long does this take?

                         MASTER
          That depends. But it can be quite fast.
          Quite fast. Or it can take some time.
          Sometimes less than 36 hours.

                         JOHN MORE
          36 hours? And you're saying that these
          methods can cure leukemia according to
          your book and what you've just said?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         MASTER
          Some forms of leukemia, 22 cases tested.
          22 cases cured. Those are the results.

                         JOHN MORE
          You can understand scepticism, can you
          not?

                         MASTER
          Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to
          be expected and welcome. For without it
          we'd be positive's with no negatives -
          therefore zero. charge. We must have it.

                         JOHN MORE
          Are you a religious people?

                         MASTER
          We are not incorporated as a religion,
          no. But remember this: that religion has
          come uniformly from a philosophy.
          Philosophy is senior to religion. You
          could call us a religion of religions.

                         JOHN MORE
          Are you saying then that any religion is
          rather narrow in its outlook?

                         MASTER
          No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's
          belief's, but religions in general can be
          pre-occupied with a God or Idol or
          something of some such nature who is
          merely trying to fill the universe with a
          lot of little replicas of himself - we
          are trying to free the individual - not
          bend to a will of a God, you see. And if
          our teachings can reconcile these views
          it would be doing a great service to

                         MANKIND -

                         JOHN MORE
          Do you think it can?

                         MASTER
          I not only think it can, I know it does.

                         JOHN MORE
          You mentioned 'good science' and what it
          does.. .but doesn't that, by definition,
          allow for more than one opinion?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         MASTER
          Indeed, indeed. Which is why our
          gathering of day-ta is so far reaching -

                         JOHN MORE
          Otherwise you merely have the will of one
          man - which is the basis of cult, is it
          not?

                         MASTER
          T'is, t'is, indeed. Thankfully we are,
          all of us, working at break-neck speeds
          and in unison towards catching the minds
          fatal flaws and correcting it back to
          it's original state of perfect - whilst
          righting civilization.

                         JOHN MORE
          I must say that I find it quite --

          More.

          Where are you from, Clark?

                         CLARK
          I'm from there. Master and headquarters
          there for a year.

                         FREDDIE
          .how'd you see them?

                         CLARK
          I read the first book. I worked at Boeing
          for three years. When I read the book, I
          didn't want to waste my time there
          anymore. I came to help the Cause.

                         FREDDIE
          What did it say?

                         CLARK
          I'm skeptical of everything. Always have
          been. All I know is I used to not be able
          to sleep. Now I sleep through the night.
          I spent 18 months at the Presidio with
          every Army head-shrinker they had and not
          one did as much for me as Book One did.
          That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met
          Elizabeth, so...

                         FREDDIE
          That's good.

                         CLARK
          He changes things. And the research is
          hard to keep up with. None of this is
          done by a long shot. Sometimes it's easy
          to get lost.

                         FREDDIE
          He's a very smart man. I can tell that. I
          don't understand myself but - more time
          with it and I might - I feel better - I
          feel like I've more to do with my life
          since I met him... and I JUST met him.
          So - that can't be a bad thing, right?

          I don't understand what you're saying.

                         CLARK
          The Split Saber.

          BEAT.

                         FREDDIE
          I still don't understand what you're
          saying...

                         CLARK
          The Darkest Cloud? AKA Dual Saber? Or The
          Split Saber?

                         FREDDIE
          .no...

                         CLARK
          .it's what started all this. Back
          then...in 1941, Master...he'd been in
          operation, in army hospital. He died on
          the table...gone for seven minutes...but

                         CAME BACK:
          And in a storm of vision and creative
          output from this experience he wrote The
          Split Saber aka The Darkest Cloud.
          Whoever read it...either went insane or
          committed suicide. Twelve people read it.
          Six dead, four disappeared. The last time
          anyone saw it...was his last publisher in
          New York.

                         CLARK (CONT'D)
          Master walked into the office to find out
          what the reaction was, the publisher
          called for the reader, the reader came in
          with the manuscript... . threw It on the
          table. . .and flung himself out of the
          skyscraper window...
          Master took the book and hid it where no
          one could get to it...it's inside this
          book: all the history. All the facts. All
          too dangerous. He re-wrote it, using what
          he could as the basis for what we are
          able to accept and learn today.. .that's
          Book One that we all study and know. . .but
          the real stuff. The things at the
          center...are still too dangerous. They
          (kill/cure) any man who reads it. It's
          passing through the jaws of resistance.
          It's the truth about all this. The book
          is protected and hidden. No one knows
          where but Master.

                         FREDDIE
          The truth about all what?

                         CLARK
          Life on this planet.
          .Freddie stares at him... then takes a good long look at
          the BURLESQUE DANCER AND HER BREASTS. THEN BACK TO CLARK:

                         FREDDIE
          What is something like that worth?

                         CLARK
          He said he was once offered $25,000
          dollars for it...but the price is... . how
          could you figure out what the price is on
          something like that? Heretofore unknown.
          Incalculable by man.

                         FREDDIE
          Where is it?

                         CLARK
          It's locked away in a vault somewhere? I
          don't know.

                         FREDDIE
          Where?

                         CLARK
          No one knows for sure. Some say Phoenix
          or the desert outside Los Angeles.

          It's held back, until the time is right.
          Or in case it's needed.

                         FREDDIE
          Needed for what?

                         CLARK
          (leverage.) ? I don't know.

                         FREDDIE
          How do you know about this?

                         CLARK
          Everyone knows about it. It's the
          original text.
          FREDDIE just sort of looks, then looks back to the NAKED

          DANCER.

          ANGLE, LATER.
          The DANCER (ELLEN) has joined them . Ad-libbed

          FREDDIE gets severely drunk -- HE MAKES A DRUNKEN APPEAL
          FOR HER TO COME TO THE CAUSE H.Q. For help in her life;

          But he PASSES OUT, FACE FIRST ON THE TABLE.

          INT. HOTEL/HALLWAY - NIGHT - LATER

          CLARK is dragging FREDDIE down the hall, passed out...he
          gets him to the room... opens the door..pulls him
          inside...

          FADE OUT.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

          .FREDDIE wakes up. Takes him a good long time.
          CAMERA just watches. He soaks everything in, thinks,
          thinks, thinks. He puts the pieces together of last night
          an the last few days.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MASTER'S HOTEL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

          START CU. ON MASTER. He looks down at something in his
          hands, quietly inspects it, looks up:
          FREDDIE is here, he's given him the HANDKERCHIEF. HOLD
          between them, then;

                         MASTER
          What is it?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't think John More will be speaking
          out against you again.

                         MASTER
          This isn't the way...you heard me say to
          attack and you attacked?

                         FREDDIE
          You were right.

                         MASTER

                         FREDDIE
          You were right. . .he had a wise-ass mouth.

                         MASTER
          My little Soldier.. .what did you
          do?... . you need to tell me so that I
          know...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         FREDDIE
          That's why I won't tell you. Nothing bad.
          Just scared him good.

          WIDEN ANGLE, THAT MOMENT.
          Reveal MARY SUE is here, listening... Master looks to Mary
          Sue, back to Freddie:

                         MARY SUE
          Whatever you've done, best not come back
          to Master or the Cause.

                         FREDDIE
          It won't.

                         MASTER
          But-this-is-not-the-way-you-naughty-boy.
          Ok? Alright. Freddie:
          You-are-mischeif. Horrible young man you
          are!
          The PHONE RIGHTS, Mary Sue moves and picks it up, speaks
          OC, we stay with MASTER and FREDDIE:

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          How are you...?
          How do you feel to be so close to your
          Auntie - just across the river? Close to
          the incident of this present time?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't really think about all that stuff
          with my Auntie, you know ...I got other
          things going on besides that thing I told
          you about.. .that's yesterday's news to
          me, so...

                         MASTER
          Your problems aren't with your auntie or
          your mommy or daddy or any such things.

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          You have seeded aberrations in this way.
          Absolute rejection of authority and nay-
          sayers.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't like smart-mouths. If that's what
          you mean.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         MASTER
          Don't act out. This anger and battle has
          been there from before you remember.
          Before you know. It's not you, Freddie.
          It's not...I promise you.
          Freddie takes it all in.

                         FREDDIE
          -- what is it?
          He grasps his shoulders, touches his head to Freddie.

                         MASTER
          It's just Q-44...all it is. Trillions of
          years ago - little implants..
          BEAT. He pulls back, smiles...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          I promise to explain it. And make it go
          away.
          MASTER collects his notebooks.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Val has a habit of finding trouble...
          I sometimes wonder what danger a man
          could get himself into this Island.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Can you do this for me?
          With a casualness and delicacy? Watchful
          eyes to make sure trouble doesn't come...
          or that come doesn't trouble? My little
          soldier?

                         FREDDIE
          Keep an eye on him?

                         MASTER
          And report back to me...

                         FREDDIE
          Alright.
          MASTER leaves.

          INT. FREDDIE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          FREDDIE is getting into his duffle bag, re-filling the
          booze supply... hiding the JEWELS he stole from last
          night's party...
          ELIZABETH comes to his room, from the connecting door;
          she's fresh from a bath, in a robe.

                          ELIZABETH
          Hi.

                          FREDDIE
          Hi.

                         ELIZABETH
          Why aren't you downstairs?

                         FREDDIE
          I'm working.

                         ELIZABETH
          What are you doing?

                         FREDDIE
          Errands.

                         ELIZABETH
          You're not an errand boy...you're a
          loafer... you're doing more than that, I
          can tell.
          BEAT. She steps up close to him.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I want to tell you...
          Freddie. . .what you did for my father last
          night was spectacular.

                         FREDDIE
          I didn't do anything.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm my father's daughter.
          Don't tell me you did nothing. It was
          just what was needed to be done. And you
          took it upon yourself.
          Shereaches for his face;

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I can tell that you know what persecution
          feels like...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          She KISSES him. He kisses back. Gentle and small. A
          prolonged simple kiss on the lips.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Can I have some of your liquor?

                         FREDDIE
          No.

                         ELIZABETH
          Why not?

                         FREDDIE
          It's too strong.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm a big girl.

                         FREDDIE
          Not big enough yet -

                         ELIZABETH
          I could just steal some...

                         FREDDIE
          Don't argue with me. You're Father's
          speaking .get dressed and get down
          there...

                         'ELIZABETH
          There's plenty of time... besides:
          I've heard it all before.
          She backs away.. .smiles. . .and closes the door..(JUST
          BEFORE IT SLAMS SHUT - her ROBE FALLS OFF, REVEALING HER

          NAKED FIGURE FOR A FLEETING SECOND...)
          FREDDIE. Looking at the door. FREDDIE. Hold. He takes a

          LARGE SWIG OF BOOZE.

                         CUT TO:

          INT BANQUET HALL - MOMENTS LATER
          MASTER takes the stage. THIRTY/FORTY STUDENTS applaud. He
          gets up, speaks:

                         MASTER
          THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Well? Down but not
          out. Not Dead Yet!
          (no tombstone at least...) he he he he.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          We are going to focus this morning to
          "Communication" to cover "any exchange
          between ourselves and our environment."
          Because that's what I want to talk to you
          about today: dominating your environment.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STAIRWELL. EVENING/LATER

          CAMERA looks up the spiral stairwell of the HOTEL. It's
          the end of the evening/lectures... . WE SEE: VAL walking
          down the steps ... . moments later, about three floors
          above, FREDDIE pokes his head over, sees VAL and starts
          to follow... . MUSIC STARTS.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LOBBY OF THE HOTEL. THAT MOMENT

          VAL moves past FOLLOWERS who are wrapping up for the
          evening, discussing, smoking cigs, exchanging ideas,
          etc...and out into the NEW YORK CITY STREETS.
          FREDDIE follows ... MINI-SEQUENCE...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT./INT. COFFEE SHOP. VILLAGE. NIGHT

          VAL walks into a coffee shop, takes a seat in a booth and
          orders some coffee...
          FREDDIE stands across the street and watches VAL.
          FREDDIE buys hot dog from a hot-dog vendor... stands and
          waits.. .and watches VAL sit alone...
          After a few minutes ... FREDDIE sees something:
          A YOUNG GROUP ENTERS THE COFFEE SHOP. It's BILL WHITE,
          his girlfriend PEGGY and TWO MALE NEW YORK FOLLOWERS: JIM
          LEHR AND FRED FRITZ. They're here to meet VAL. They join
          him, sit down, speak. Order cokes, coffee, smoke cigs,
          etc...
          FREDDIE watching all this from across the street. VAL is
          answering their questions, speaking with some authority
          about something, etc. etc.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          And what this meeting might mean...

          AND PULLS HIS EAR, CATCHING FREDDIE'S EYE. As we hear the
          woman ramble on, FREDDIE gets his FLASK, moves discreetly
          to get a glass, make a drink and brings it to MASTER.
          This is unnoticed by everyone but MARY SUE. The WOMAN

                         FINISHES TALKING:

          Cheers to that!
          Everyone raises their glasses and DRINKS. MASTER downs
          his new drink. A calm... then Master gently protificates:

          up. . .MASTER changes the topic slightly...

          To live in the days of six-shooters and
          open frontier, that's what I'd like! My
          grandfather. Rancher. Wyoming. A criminal
          of the highest lineage, once told me he
          met a boy named Buckskin Joe...
          He keeps talking...

          INT. MASTER'S ROOM/HELEN'S HOUSE - MORNING

          It's the next morning. MASTER is getting ready, dressing
          in the bathroom, getting ready for his lectures... MARY
          SUE comes in, from behind him... she hugs him from
          behind.. .he smiles.. .she looks at him in the mirror, he
          looks at her ... . she REACHES AROUND, GETS INTO HIS PANTS

          AND STARTS TO JERK HIM OFF, LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM IN

          THE EYE AS SHE SAYS:

                         MARY SUE
          You can do. Whatever you want. As long as
          I don't find out. And as long. As. Anyone
          I know. Doesn't know. Other than that.
          You stop this idea. And you put it back
          in its pants. It didn't work for them.
          And it's not gonna work for you. We.
          Have. Enough problems. Cum for me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         MASTER
          Yes. Yes.

                         MARY SUE
          Do it. And get your best behavior out...
          cum for me...

                         MASTER
          Yes, master.

                         MARY SUE
          And no more of that boy's booze.

                         MASTER
          Yes master.
          He comes, collapses, sinks to the floor. She washes her
          hands and walks out of the bathroom.

          EXT. SUBURBAN PHILADELPHIA/CAUSE COLLEGE - DAY

          A beautiful spring day. STUDENTS, FOLLOWERS, COME IN,

          SIGN IN...
          IN THE MAIN LIVING ROOM, on stage, MASTER is working with
          a WOMAN, processing her. She lays back on a couch set
          up...FULL CROWD of students watching...

                         MASTER
          Try to recall how you feel...

                         WOMAN
          Oh, I'm sort of glad it's the end..

                         MASTER
          What happens next?

                         WOMAN
          The doctor puts a stethoscope to her
          chest..

                         MASTER
          What is the doctor wearing?

                         WOMAN
          A white coat.

                         MASTER
          Is there a smell in the room?.

                         WOMAN
          It smells like a hospital.

                         MASTER
          Try to imagine what a hospital smells
          like.

                         WOMAN
          Uugh. Uugh. Alright.

                         MASTER
          What does the doctor say?

                         WOMAN
          He listens to her chest and says, "She's
          gone."
          FREDDIE and VAL are sitting in the front foyer of the
          house, facing each other in two folding chairs...we see
          the. STAGE IN THE B.G...
          .VAL is bored and nodding off to sleep ...FREDDIE
          watches VAL. FREDDIE kicks his chair --

                         FREDDIE
          Wake up. Your Father's speaking.. .you
          could learn something.

                         VAL
          What's that?

                         FREDDIE
          You heard me.

                         VAL
          He's making this up as he goes, don'tcha
          know..? You can sleep and wake up and not
          have missed anything...

                         FREDDIE
          Maybe you should pay more attention.

                         VAL
          You have something to say to me?

                         FREDDIE
          I'm curly-q. Round in circles. So shut
          up.
          .FREDDIE takes a nice big drink from his FLASK...
          FREDDIE looks out the open front door: TWO POLICEMAN AND
          A MARSHALL are parking their cars and walking towards the
          house...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

          FREDDIE.
          Watching them advance... He hesitates. He's not sure what
          to do. So he stays put...
          The MEN walk up to the house ...FREDDIE and VAL look:

                         POLICEMAN
          We're looking for Lancaster Dodd.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't know who that is...

                         POLICEMAN
          May we come in?

                         FREDDIE
          No. You cannot.

                         VAL
          Yes you can. He's up there -
          VAL points to the stage...

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          That's him.

                         FREDDIE
          You can't come in. Get outta here.
          MASTER, ON STAGE, looks out - AGAINST THE GLARE OF THE
          DOOR, he can recognize the FIGURES AS UNIFORMED...

          ANGLE, AT THE DOOR.

                         POLICEMAN
          We have a civil warrant to serve to
          Lancaster Dodd to appear in Philadelphia
          Bankruptcy Court - an arrest warrant -

                         VAL
          Stay out of their way, Freddie.
          MASTER walks down to see what's happening.

                         MASTER
          What is happening here?

                         POLICEMAN
          Are you Lancaster Dodd?

                         MASTER
          Yes I Am.

                         POLICEMAN
          We have an arrest warrant for you, sir...

                         MASTER
          What are the charges?

          That's.what we'll have to take you in for

                         MASTER
          This is a silly joke, no?

                         MARSHALL
          No, sir it isn't. But we have to take you
          in and book and fingerprint you.

                         MASTER
          This is comic opera. Is it illegal in
          this city to get better?

                         MARSHALL
          Please put your hands behind your back.

                         MASTER
          I have no disagreement with you boys
          doing your work in all its silliness as
          defenders of what code? What honor? What
          part of the galaxy? This is a scientific
          gathering - you will cuff me from the
          front, if you please --
          He raises his ARMS for HANDCUFFS. FOLLOWERS COME FORWARD

          AND START TO PROTEST ABOUT THIS. ONE YOUNG MAN, WITH ONE

          ARM AND A HOOK FOR A HAND STARTS SWINGING IT AROUND (WWII

                         VET)
          FREDDIE gets into it and is pushed by a POLICEMAN which
          unleashes a WRATH IN HIM. IT VERY QUICKLY BECOMES A MINI-

          MELE.

          FREDDIE IS SLAMMED TO THE GROUND AND WRESTLED WITH BY THE

          TWO MARSHALS. HE FIGHTS BACK. IT'S VERY ROUGH AND

          VIOLENT.
          MASTER, FREDDIE are taken away in hand cuffs. MARY SUE
          comes out, angry at the police, everyone is, etc. Quite a

          MASTER is actually trying to CALM FREDDIE DOWN, WHO IS

          GOING NUTS IN THE HANDCUFFS AND AT HIS TREATMENT

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Freddie, no, no, no, calm down, please,
          please. It's nothing, just laugh, we'll

          THEY SHOVE FREDDIE INTO THE CAR AND HE GOES CRAZY.

          SMASHING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW, THE BACK SEAT, ETC.

          HE YELLS LIKE AN ANIMAL. KICKS AND SCREAMS, BLEEDING FROM

          HIS FOREHEAD.
          MASTER is put into another car.

          INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

          They arrive in CARS. FREDDIE in one.car. MASTER in the
          other.
          FREDDIE is STILL FIGHTING. THEY DRAG HIM. MASTER is
          speaking to him, trying to calm him down...

          INT. HOLDING CELL - LATER

          It's hours later. FREDDIE is out of energy. MASTER sits
          with him. Old-fashioned holding cell.
          MASTER holds his FINGER TO HIS LIPS.

                         MASTER
          Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
          He gets up close to FREDDIE, whispers in his ear;

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Whatever we say is undoubtably being
          monitored...speak in whispers.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't want to talk to you right now.

                         MASTER
          This is FBI work, Russians
          maybe... this... too much work for the

                         MASTER
          You're fear of capture and imprisonment
          is an implant from millions of years ago.
          An Invader Force played games with your
          spirit as it.moved from one body to the
          next - free for a moment - it was free
          and the invader force captured it - spun
          you around in a device not unlike a
          grinder and hit you with waves of high
          wattage electrical impulses - quaver
          bolts to damage you. The impulse lodges
          and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped
          in scalding hot water, then freezing cold
          - a control mechanism - any legal action,
          a summons to court, the sight of a police
          officer, exposes a glandular reaction and
          anxiety wave of the highest order,

                         TRIGGERED -
          the mere threat of arrest will make a
          psychotic breakdown. This happened to you
          and you are free to stop it. Their game
          and implants are no match for you. Laugh
          in their face. Laugh at it. These
          triggers are useless now. You created
          THEM so YOU can DESTROY THEM.
          MASTER pulls away ... FREDDIE looks at him. HOLD.

                         FREDDIE
          Horseshit.

                         MASTER

          facts.

                         FREDDIE
          Just shut-your-mouth? You're a fucking

          DRUNK.

                         MASTER
          ME shut my mouth? You're a fucking DRUNK.
          You CACTUS. Play a game with me?
          I don't think so, you little yo-yo. That
          ain't the way. You want to shut me up?
          I'm the best and only friend you have,
          shut me up from saving you? HELPING YOU.
          ONLY WAY. FIND ANOTHER ONE, YO-YO. You
          wanna get rid of this or live this way or
          MASTER it?

          You listen - you wanna spit in that cops
          face for touching you? I'm gonna beat him
          with you. Bash his skull in. BUT DON'T

          TURN ON ME, DRUNK.
          Long silence. They sit in it.

          around, the wives of ... . I want to fuck
          all of them.

                         MASTER
          Sex is not an aberration. Never has been.
          So what's wrong?

                         FREDDIE
          I want to fuck 'em all. I want to stick
          it in every one of them.

                         MASTER
          When did you forget that surviving was
          what you're supposed to do. Stick it in.
          Stick it in.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't belong in here, man. I gotta get
          out of here...

                         MASTER
          You belong at sea.

                         MASTER
          .You belong to Doris.

                         FREDDIE
          Why're you talking about her?

                         MASTER
          You think of Doris. The loss of her.
          Triggers millions of little shocks and.
          charges, doesn't it? That present-life
          loss.

                         FREDDIE
          It was Val who let them in the house and
          told them who you were... Val did it.

          MASTER sits on the bed, thinks.

          -- The drinking blocks the physical pain
          and dissolves treatment from working,

          drink.

          .By bringing everyone together with the

          comes... we believe and trust that you are
          the right man for this mission.

                         ELIZABETH
          You're the only one that can do this,
          Freddie.

          .What is Val doing in all this?

                         MARY SUE
          He's a squirrel. And he has weaknesses.

                         NORMAN CONRAD
          Do you believe that no man can be neutral
          in the struggle between civilization and
          chaos?

                         FREDDIE
          Yes.

                         MARY SUE

          Someone's been there. I don't know when.

          door was locked, I went in with the key
          and the house up ended, all smashed up on
          the ground - I walked to the back - the

          Possibly. A crazed lone lunatic for all

          can't have what I paid for, except

          You know what this all is? Huh? It's
          mental cruelty. That's what it is. It's
          just mental cruelty to invent all these
          new ideas and never follow through on it
          and just keep adding and subtracting and
          I gotta pay for this and that level and
          more and more-and Book II's coming. All
          the answers..."if you had that, it's no
          good 'cause here's the new thing.. .and
          oh no...you don't need that.. .that's
          old.. .this is new." And it's more and

          two.. .gets up...
          And walks down the very steep flight of stairs on the
          balcony...

          but OVER THE BALCONY RAILING AND DOWN INTO THE MAIN

          AUDITORIUM...
          The fall should either kill him or break his back.
          Audience members come rushing over, helping him. . .people
          call for help ...FREDDIE'S KNOCKED OUT. HOLD THIS AND

          WATCH AS PEOPLE HELP HIM. . .THERE IS WOMAN HER...SHE IS A

                         ELLEN

          Do you remember me?
          you saved my life.

          You told me where I could get some help.
          And I did.
          And it saved my life.
          Freddie looks at her, looks around, looks down at
          himself. Only a few bandages, all seems to be in order..

                         ELLEN
