Andrews clears his throat ...
					ANDREWS

Thank you gentleman.. This is rumour  control.  Here are 
the facts.  As some of you know, a 337 model EEV crash 
landed here at 0600 on the morning  watch.  There was one 
survivor. Two dead and a droid that was hopelessly smashed 
beyond repair.  
The survivor is a woman.

Mumbles among the prisoners.
MORSE - late twentys, tight-jawed, gold teeth - leans down from one of the upper tiers ...

					MORSE

I just want to say that I took a vow of celibacy.  That also 
includes women.  We all took the vow.  Now let me say, that 
I for one, do not appreciate Company policy allowing  her to 
freely intermingleŠ.

					DILLON
What brother means to say is ... We
view the resence of any outsider,
woman, as a violation of the harmony, a potential 
break in the spiritual unity.

		ANDREWS
We are well aware of your feelings in this matter.  
You will be pleased to know that I have requested a 
rescue team - Hopefully, they will be here inside of a week 
and evacuate her A.S.A.P.
            (to Clemens)
What's her medical status?

All eyes turn to Clemens.
					CLEMENS
She doesn't seem too badly damaged.  She is unconscious.  
Difficult at the moment to make a specific diagnosis.

			ANDREWS
		Will she live?

Clemens considers the question.

					CLEMENS
Yes.  I should think so. -

Pursing his lips.  Andrews glances back at Dillon.

					ANDREWS
				Look, none of us here is naive.
				              (pause)
It's in everybody¹s best interests if the woman doesn¹t come out of
the Infirmary until the rescue team arrives.  And certainly not without 
an escort.  Right?  So we should all stick to our set routines and not 
get unduly agitated.  Correct?  All right.  Thank you, gentlemen.

27	INT.  INFIRMARY												27

Ripley lies still on a cot.
Clemens at her side.
There's an IV pack taped to her arm.

Clemens checks her vital signs...
On a table beside the cot, he finds a syringe with clear liquid... Prepares to give her an injection.
Ripley's eyes snap open.

				RIPLEY
				       What's that?

Clemens is surprised, but tries not let it show -- expels air from the hypo.

					CLEMENS
A light cocktail of my own mix.  Sort of an eye opener.

			RIPLEY
Are you a doctor?

			CLEMENS
I've only got a 3-C rating.  But I'm the
best you're going to find around here
Š I really ought to shave your head.

Startled, Ripley sits bolt upright on the cot, pulling the sheet around her:
			
					CLEMENS
Lice.  Big problem here, I'm afraid.  When your hand is 
steadier you can attend to your private parts yourself.

Pause.

					CLEMENS
My name is Clemens.  I'm the Medical Officer here ...

			RIPLEY
Here?

			CLEMENS
Fury 161.  One of Weyland-Yutani's backwater work prisons.  
Do you mind?  This is just sort of a stabilizer ...

He lifts her arm -- gives her the injection.

	CLEMENS
	You crash landed in an EEV. Evidently separated from your 
	mothership before you hit our atmosphere.  I've no idea how 
	long you were in hypersleep - coming down the way you did 
	can be a jolt to your. system.

I'm gonna be sick for two weeks if I
decompressed too fast.

				CLEMENS
	Yes.  Quite nauseous.

			RIPLEY
	What about the others?

			CLEMENS
	    I'm afraid they didn't make it.
This sinks in.
					RIPLEY
What?
	
		CLEMENS
They didn't survive.

		RIPLEY
I have to get to the ship.

		CLEMENS
You're in no condition for that.
She stands.
Buck naked.	
					RIPLEY
	You want to get me some clothes, or should I go like this?
	
			CLEMENS
	Given the nature of our indigenous population, I would suggest clothes.

He turns and opens a closet.

					CLEMENS
	None of them has seen a woman in years.  Neither have I for that matter.

28   	INT.  STAIIRWELL - CONE OF SELENCE     									28

A now fully-clothed Ripley is being led along the corridor by Clemens.

					CLEMENS
This used to be a thousand convict facility, but its been reduced 
all the way down to a twenty five man custodial staff.  They keep 
the place on pilot light ­

			RIPLEY
Pilot light for what?


26/l/91 - W.H., D.G.	8.

29	INT. CONE OF SILENCE			29
	
	Prisoners WILLIAM, ARTHUR, VINCENT, CHRISTOPHER and ED have lowered the EEV 
	via a huge overhead crane.
							CLEMENS
				Toxic dump.  The prisoners used to make lead sheets to seal off the shafts

						RIPLEY
				Any women here?

						CLEMENS
Sorry Lieutenant Ripley.  This is a double Y chromosome facility.  Strictly male.

			RIPLEY
How come you know my name?

		CLEMENS 
It's stenciled on the back of your shorts.  We also found your dog tags.

		RIPLEY
Great.

Ripley takes a deep breath and crawls into:

 Everything is smashed, wrecked...
 In the very cramped quarters, Ripley finds a place to kneel.  
 Clemens follows her inside.
						RIPLEY
    				   Where are the bodies?

						CLEMENS
We have a morgue.  We've put them there until the investigative team 
arrives, probably in a week's time.

			RIPLEY
	There was an android...

			CLEMENS
Disconnected.  There were pieces of him all over the place.  What¹s left was 
thrown in the trash.  The Corporal was impaled by a support beam straight 
through the chest He never knew what hit him.

			RIPLEY
	What about the girl?

					CLEMENS
She drowned in her cryotube.  I don't think she was 
conscious when it happened...I'm sorry.
She struggles for control.
Impossible
Her eyes fill with tears.
Eyes brimming,  Ripley spots the remains of Newt's cryotube.  
Faceplate is broken.
Probably happened in the crash.
There¹s a strange discoloration on the metal below the faceplate.  
She leans forward, running her fingers over it...

				CLEMENS
			What is it?

RIPLEY
			Where is she?

					CLEMENS
				I told you.  The morgue.

					RIPLEY
			I want to see what's left of her body.

					CLEMENS
	What do you mean, what's left?  The body's intact.

	It is?  I want to see it.

	CLEMENS
Any particular  reason you're so insistent?

		RIPLEY
	I have to make sure how she died.

		CLEMENS
I hate to be repetitious about a sensitive subject, 
but it¹s quite clear that she drowned.

Clemens stops at the foot of the stairs
					CLEMENS
				Was she your daughter?

					RIPLEY
				No ... She wasn't my daughter.

Clemens steps away ...
Ripley begins to examine Newt's corpse.
After a couple of moments Clemens returns
					CLEMENS
				O.K.?

					RIPLEY
				No. We need an autopsy.

					CLEMENS
				You're joking.

					RIPLEY
				No way.  We have to make sure how she died.
					CLEMENS
				I told you she drowned.

Clemens begins to slide the body back.  Ripley stops him.

					RIPLEY
				I'm not so sure - I want you to cut her open.

CLEMENS 
Listen to me, I think you're disorientated --
half your system's still in cryo-sleep.

Ripley doesn't want to hear this.
					RIPLEY
Look, I have a very good reason for
asking this and I want you to do it --

			CLEMENS
		Would you care to share this reason?

			RIPLEY
	Possible contagion.

Clemens now masked and gowned begins to incise Newt's chest.  It's a long time since he's lone this, and he's not altogether sure why he's-doing it now ...
He cuts through her rib-cage.
CLEMENS
We have nothing unusual.  Everything in place.  No 
sign of disease.  No sign of any contagion.-Lungs 
flooded with fluid - ergo, she drowned.

Makes a final cross-lateral incision.

First, Lieutenant Ripley is feeling much better.  
I'm happy to say.  Second, in the interests of public 
health, I'm conducting an autopsy.

				Without my authority?

					CLEMENS
There didn't seem to be time, but it's all turned out all right, 
the body shows no signs of contagion.

					ANDREWS
				Good.  But it might be helpful of Lt. Ripley didn¹t parade
				around in front of the prisoners, as I am told she did in the

Nonsense.  We'll keep the bodies on ice
until a rescue team arrives.

				Cremate -- that's a good one, sir.

Looks at Clemens.

I thought you said there was no sign of disease.

It would appear that the child drowned, though without the 
proper laboratory tests its Impossible to be absolutely certain - 
but I think it would be unwise to tolerate even the possibility 
of an unwanted virus.  An outbreak of cholera would look very 
bad on your report, wouldn't it?

ANDREWS
We have twenty-five prisoners in this facility.  All double

don't think that makes them any less dangerous.  So I try not to 
offend their convictions.  I don't want to disturb the order.  I don't 
want ripples in the water.  And I don't want a woman walking around 
giving them ideas.

Prisoner GREGOR is helping Golic, Boggs and Rains load candles into over-sized backpacks.
They are preparing to explore and forage among the abandoned mine shafts beneath the planet's surface.

					GREGOR
There you are -- this'll top you off.  Golic, don't fidget about.
What's all this damn food you've got in here -it's not properly wrapped.

Golic is stuffing food in his mouth.

					BOGGS
				What the hell does he ever do right?

					RAINS
Eat.  He's got that down pretty good.

Dillon and Junior appear in the doorway.
					DILLON
Golic?

GOLIC
				Yeah?

					DILLON
				Light a candle for Murphy, will you?

					GOLIC
Right.  I'll light a thousand.  He was a special friend.  He never 
complained about me.  Not once. I loved him.  Did his head really 
get split into a million pieces? That¹s what they say...

Golic and his two companions move off..

Clemens remains very calm...

					CLEMENS
				I'm not sure I understand.

					ANDREWS
At 0-seven-hundred hours, I received word from the network.  I may 
point out this is the first high-level communication this installation has 
ever received to my knowledge. They want this woman looked after.  
They made it very clear -- they consider her to be very high priority.

			CLEMENS
	Why?

			ANDREWS
I have no idea -- Why'd you let her out of the infirmary?  This accident 
with Murphy is what happens when one of these dumb sons-of-bitches 
walks around with a hard-on.

			CLEMENS
	I'm a doctor.  Not a jailer.

Don't hand me that.  We both know exactly what you are...

Getting up, Clemens heads for the door.
Andrews pounds his fist on the desk...

Clemens returns to his chair.

					ANDREWS
				I don't like you.  You're unpredictable,  insolent, possibly

Keep your sarcasm¹s to yourself.  Now, is there anything I should know?

					ANDREWS
About the woman.  Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens.  You spend 
every second you can with her: And I have my suspicions that not all 
of your concerns with her are medical ... Has she said anything to you?  
Anything about where she¹s from?  What her mission is?  What the hell
she was doing in an EEV?

					CLEMENS
She told me she was part of a combat team that came to grief.   I assume 
beyond that it's all classified.  I haven't pressed her for more.

	NIGHT

As the wind shrieks...
A gigantic pit stands open to the roaring sky.
It's piled high with everything the prisoners have discarded.  
Standing on a mountain of rusted engines, pneumatic drills and other equipment

RIPLEY

rummaging through miles of wires, tubing and parts.
The wind tears her eyes.
Stopping for a second, she sees...

A HAND

sticking out of a pile of some wiring.

Realizing what she's looking at, she starts digging through the refuse at speed.
Finally, she unearths the remains of ­

BISHOP

The Android.
He's a shambles.
Most of his face and lower jaw are gone.
Parts of his neck, left shoulder and back are intact.
At the rear of his mouth is a small speaker.
Grabbing some wire, Ripley starts stuffing them into a bag.

(NOTE:	The following attackers are.: Junior, Gregor, William, plus one stunt prisoner).
An arm suddenly comes from behind and grabs her around the neck.
Another arm grabs her shoulders.

Another arm starts to fondle her private parts.
As she strugglesŠ
A PRISONER appears, starts to advance on her.
Ripley breaks free of the arms...
Punches the prisoner --
Kicks him in the balls.
But...
An even LARGER PRISONER appears.
It's Junior.
He grabs her -- spread eagles her over a pipe rail.
Two other prisoners appear just behind him.

Dillon suddenly materializes from the dark.

					DILLON
				Knock it off.

					JUNIOR
Jump in the saddle man.  You wanna go first?

			DILLON
	I said knock it off.

			JUNIOR
	Hey what's it to you, man?

			DILLON
	It's wrong.

			JUNIOR
	Fuck you.

Dillon smacks the two prisoners in back.
Junior tries to belt Dillon -- Dillon gut punches him, grabs a metal bar, cracks him twice over the head with it -- time second blow dropping him.
The prisoners cower--
Dillon hits them again - Looks at Ripley--

					DILLON
				You okay?

					RIPLEY
				Yeah.  Nothing hurt but my feelings.

Deep within the unexplored vastness of the complex.
It's black as night.
Illuminated by the light of his torch --
Golic eyeballs a sign on the wall in front of him.
Behind him, Rains lights a candle.
Kneeling he places it in a row that seems to crawl away forever into the dark.
The flickering light reveals a hallway.
A very long hallway.
The sign on the wall above Golic reads:

TOXIC WASTE DISPOSAL
THIS SPACE HERMETICALLY SEALED
Boggs glances back at Rains             
Kneeling, he studies a map at his feet.
When he speaks, his voice echoes and re-echoes off the concrete walls.

BOGGS
				How many?

RAINS
				(checking notes)
This makes a hundred and eighty-six.

Golic shoves some food in his mouth and chews, noisily.  He steps over to an abandoned cigarette machine.  Kicks !he lock off with a bang -- begins loading packs of  cigarettes into his duffel ... 
Irritated, Boggs turns on him.
					BOGGS

	How many candles, again?

Boggs doesn't get an answer.  He, glances sideways at Rains.
Rains is scratching himself furiously
Stares fixedly down the row of flickering candles.  
Golic following his line of sight.
Something very bizarre is happening .

Every few seconds, one of the candles goes out.

					BOGGS
				What the shit is doing that?

					GOLIC
				You're not supposed to swear.

					BOGGS
Shut up.  It's okay to say shit.  It's not against God.

			RAINS
What the hell is going on with the candles?

The three prisoners hold their torches- high in the air.  
Try to see what's going on.
No deal.
Whatever's snuffing out the candles is too far away to be illuminated by the torches.

					BOGGS
Must be a wind from one of the ventshafts -- backwash from the closest 
circulating unit.  If all the candles go out, how're we going to know where 
we are?

Golic hands Rains his torch.
Rains moves down the line of candles.
His companions receding in the distance.
His footsteps echo inside the hallway.
Behind him, he hears Boggs:

					BOGGS
				Watch your step.

The words echo and reverberate within the enclosed space.
Moving forward, Rains starts to sweat.
Ahead, another candle goes out.
Golic and Boggs are a long ways behind him, now.
Only three more candles to go.
Beyond, there's nothing but a black hole.
Stopping at the last flickering candle, he raises his torch high in the air.
There's nothing there.
Relieved, he starts to relax.
Then he realizes there's a massive glob of blackness off to his right.
It's not reflecting the light from his torch.
*	And it's moving.													*

THE ALIEN

rises up, directly in front of Rains.
Now a fully mature creature.
It moves with the speed of a big cat...
In one blurred motion, it is upon him.
Tears open his chest -- leaves a gapping hole in his abdomen.  
The last thing Rains hears is his own scream.

INT.  DARK PASSAGEWAY - GOLIC - BOGGS

Three hundred yards behind, they'd hear Rains' agonized cry and watch the torch flicker out.
Suddenly panicking, Boggs grabs the torch and takes off in the opposite direction.
Golic charges after him.
	Rounding corners, charging through the blackness...
A  maze of ink-black passageways.
Footsteps reverberate.
Finally catching Boggs, Golic takes back the torch.
Both men are exhausted, completely lost.
Out of breath, unable to speak...
Trying to collect himself, Golic stares around.
Ahead, he see candles flickering in the dark.

We ran in a circle.  We're back...

Leaning against the wall. covered with blood

stares blankly at nothing, a look of object terror frozen forever on his face.
Boggs starts to get sick.
He never finishes.
Glancing up on the ceiling, Golic sees

THE ALIEN

crawling across the ceiling like a spider.
At the speed of thought, it leans down and rips off Boggs' head.  
Blood flies everywhere, spattering Golic in the face.
His tunic drenched...
Paralyzed with fear, Golic watches the Alien hurls Boggs' helpless body against the wall.
*	Still hanging from the ceiling, it stops what it's doing and turns to Golic.- 						*
Screaming like a banshee, torch in hand, he runs away into the echoing dark...

Alone, Ripley studies the remains of Bishop.
There¹s a battery pack in his left shoulder.
She checks the connections.
A spark sizzles.
Using a cable, she connects a terminal in Bishop's smashed thorax to the black flight recorder.
Instantly, Bishop's one eye blinks.
A garbled sound comes out of the small speaker at the back of his mouth.
Shoving her hand into his throat, she gives him an adjustment.
Bishop¹s voice suddenly becomes audible.

Seconds pass.

	If you insist ... after my student years, despite the fact that I

residency, I did a 36-hour stretch in an E.R., went out, got more
than slightly drunk, then got called back to duty after a boiler
had blown on a fuel stationed.  Thirty patients.  Eleven of them 
died when I prescribed the wrong dosage of pain killer.  I got 
seven years in prison and my licensed reduced to a 3-C.  While 
in prison I kicked my habit.  And here I am.

RIPLEY

I killed had promising careers as well.  About the prison sentence, no,

Ripley can't scream.
Diaphragm pushes air out -- but no sound.  
The Alien moves closer to her.
She can feel his breath --
it evaporates the sweat on her forehead ­
a chill runs through her but she still can't move ­
The Alien stands alongside her bed.

					GOLIC
				Hey, you.  Get over here.  Lemme loose - I can help you.

The beast turns and looks at Golic, looks back at Ripley ­
Pulls itself back up into the overhead Airshaft and is gone.

begins after ceremoniously clearing his throat.

					ANDREWS
				Yes - thank you, Mr. Dillon.  All right, once gain this is rumor 
				control.  Here are the facts.  At 0-four-hundred hours, prisoner 
				Murphy, through carelessness on his part, was found dead in 
				vent shaft seventeen.  From the evidence gathered on the spot, 
				he seems to have been caught by a strong air draft and got blown
				into the ventilator fan...

He moves around the large room.

					ANDREWS
At 0-four-hundred hours, Prisoners Boggs, Rains and Golic left 
on a routine foraging mission into the underground network -- at 
about 0-seven-hundred hours, prisoner Golic re-appeared in a 
deranged state.  Prisoner Boggs and Rains are missing.  Unfortunately, 
there seems to be a good chance that they have met with foul play 
at the hands of prisoner Golic.  We need to organize and send out 
a search party.  Volunteers will be appreciated.

Stops under the air vent, near the doorway to the kitchen.

					ANDREWS
I think it's fair to say that our smoothly running facility has suddenly 
developed a few problems.  I can only hope that we are able to all 
pull together in the next few days, until the rescue team arrives for 
Lieutenant Ripley...

Suddenly  a door slams -- Ripley enters ...

That¹s right - I'm a company man and not some fucking criminal.

to have a life sentence on this rock, and I¹m smart enough to wait

Okay - I¹m with you.  I want it to die.  I hate the fucker -it

Gregor screams for help, but nobody hears him -
He races down the corridor, ricocheting from comer to comer like a pinball until --

BLAM!  He runs smack into - another prisoner, Morse.

They collide.  Pick themselves up.  Stare at one another in confusion.  Tears of nervous laughter, until -

Faster than an express train -

The Alien - from its POV - swings over from on top, races down, flashes past Morse in a blur.-and -

Smashes against Gregor, using its head like a hammer -

It rips his body apart like a toy, and -

Gregor's body falls like pulp in front of Morse, blood showering over him, as be scrambles away -

Helpless to make himself heard above the noise -

Screaming for mercy, as -

Gregor¹s  body is sucked up into the overhead airduct by the Alien, while --

Morse crawls away ... comes to a pair of feet -

Ripley standing there -

Throws her flare at the Alien as it tries to duck into the airvent
-- the thing drops Gregor¹s ravaged body --

RIPLEY
					Come on. you bastard!

The Alien coils up against a wall.

Ripley advances, the creature cringes and spits --

					RIPLEY
Come on.  I got what you want.  Follow me ... 
I want to show you something.

Ripley screams at it, the Alien recoils, flicking its tail out

Tail lashes Ripley -- whipping, slashing, cutting -

She tries to fend it off -- grab it -. limbs flailing, when -

Dillon arrives in the doorway, as Ripley turns, shouts --
					RIPLEY			
				 (to Dillon)
				Get back!

Dillon enters, sees the frightened beast ­
The creature roars at him, but Ripley shields him ­
Dillon sees, realizes -- grabs Ripley, holds her hostage ­
The Alien sees the threat, flips out --
Dillon pulls Ripley back with him into the main corridor, as ­
The Alien scuttles to camera upside down, into ­

The noise still thunders, as -

At the entrance to the mould, Dillon calls out to the Alien -

DILLON
				In here -!

Dillon sees the Alien on the ceiling, leap over the door jamb.
					
					RIPLEY
				(to Dillon)
				Shut it!  Now!

Dillon slams the door in front of her, imprisoning them both in main corridor with the Alien -

Behind it appears Morse -

					MORSE
				Get out ! Get the fuck out now - !

Ripley shouts over to Morse -

Morse slams his door shut, sealing them in .He stares at them -- still alive -- thru the glass -

Then sees the piston grind slowly past the last air-lock window, obscuring, then blocking them from view

Three down, no escape.

He turns and runs -

Near the mould - the piston crunches into the Alien -

Ripley and Dillon am trapped -- no choice - they have to enter the mould -

		RIPLEY
		Don't come any closer. Stay where you are.

		Wait. They're here to help.

	Ripley looks at Aaron's simple, trusting face. He steps aside.
	The others move in behind him.  A hand raised to stop them.
	Another wave of nausea overcomes Ripley. Unsure of herself, as -
	From the shadows, steps Bishop II. Our first sight -- same as the Droid
