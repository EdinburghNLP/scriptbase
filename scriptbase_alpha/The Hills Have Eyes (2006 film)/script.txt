          EXT. DESERT HILLS - DAY

          Open on a GEIGER COUNTER scanning over a rocky terrain.
          A SAND STORM blows over the landscape. We are lost somewhere
          in the middle of the New Mexico desert.
          According to the instrument, the area contains high levels of
          radiation...
          THREE MEN WEARING FULL ANTI-RADIATION SUITS have left their
          jeep behind to collect samples of contaminated rocks.
          Not at all worried or bothered by the dust storm or high
          winds, they walk towards the hills.
          The man holding the counter stops in his tracks -

                         MAN 1
          (loudly through the

                         STORM)

          ALRIGHT, GUESS.

                         MAN 2

          I'D SAY 43.9?

                         MAN 1

          IT'S OVER 124.5!

                         MAN 2

          IT'S GOT TO BE OFF.

                         (WALKING AWAY)

          THAT'S THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE

          FALLOUT IN CHERNOBYL...

                         - MAN 3
          (following his colleague)

          YEAH. PROBABLY NEEDS SOME

          ADJUSTMENT.

                         MAN 2

          ...CAN'T TRUST THE DIGITAL ONES...

                         MAN 1

                         (STANDING STILL)
          No...It's something else... It's
          like the radioactivity is moving
          around us.
          The numbers on the dial continue to fluctuate. Where is this
          intensity coming from?

                         (CONTINUED)

          He turns around, seeing nothing but sand and rock through his
          mask.
          Suddenly, for no apparent reason, THE GEIGER COUNTER GETS

          LOUDER AS THE NUMBERS SKYROCKET.
          In confusion, he taps on the instrument attempting to
          stabilize it, but the radioactivity continues to climb...
          He looks up to the horizon obscured by the sand storm - still
          nothing in sight.
          He sighs. His colleague is probably right, the Geiger counter
          simply needs an adjustment...
          He turns it off when A MAN COVERED WITH BLOOD, HALF NAKED,
          comes out of nowhere and jumps at his face-

                         MAN

          HELP ME... HELP ME, PLEASE HELP ME!
          Scared to death, the scientist pushes him away and backs off.
          The man covered by blood falls on the ground and starts
          crying, begging for help. The scientist doesn't have time to

                         REACT-

          THE RUSTY POINT OF A PICKAXE COMES THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS

          MASK AND OUT OF HIS FOREHEAD!
          Terrified, the man covered with blood watches the scientist's
          dead body-fall to the ground revealing, for a quick second, A

          DARK SHAPE FLASHING IN THE SUN.

                         CUT TO:
          In the distance, the other scientists continue their work,
          oblivious to the attack. Kneeling behind a rock, they make a

                         DISCOVERY-

                         MAN 2
          What the hell is it?
          With his hand, one of the scientists removes the dust around
          some SKELETAL REMAINS.

                         MAN 3
          They look human...
          The strange shape of the bones and skull makes it impossible
          to tell whether they are human or animal.

          A SHADOW appears above them-

                         MAN 2
          (without turning around)
          Look what we found. Have you...

          THE PICKAXE SWINGS THROUGH HIS BACK.

          IMPALED LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT, HIS BODY IS SWEPT INTO THE AIR

          ONLY TO BE SLAMMED AGAINST THE ROCKS...
          Blood splatters on the third man, who steps back suffocating
          with fear behind his mask.
          The shadowy figure continues the assault on Man 2, finishing
          him off. Powerless to stop'the massacre, the last scientist
          runs away in a panic.
          At the top of the hill, he appears, out of breath. He doesn't
          have time to climb the rocks as he is pulled down, screaming
          in his mask.

                         CUT TO:
          The scientists' Jeep takes off dragging behind it the three
          bodies in their radiation suits and the dead body of the
          other man...

          A thick, juicy steak lands on a hot skillet.

          WE ARE IN A 1950'S COMMERCIAL FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY-
          While preparing dinner, the perfect housewife presents the
          kitchen of tomorrow by praising all the benefits of nuclear
          energy.
          She is joined by her husband, their children, and their dog.
          The entire family sits at the table with big smiles.
          The frame freezes on this naive image of prosperity and well
          being. A slogan appears:

          "NUCLEAR ENERGY, TRY IT...WE DID!"
          CLASSIFIED STOCK FOOTAGE replaces the commercial-
          These new images are of nuclear tests performed by the US
          Army in the New Mexico desert during the same period-

          Old mining towns are evacuated by soldiers. Their inhabitants
          are rounded up like cattle and loaded into trucks.
          Somewhere else, prefabricated towns filled with test dummies
          are eradicated by atmospheric explosions...
          Caged animals used for experiments are carbonized by nuclear
          waves.
          Scientists study the evolution of certain radiated species...
          In a split second, gigantic craters are formed in the middle
          of the desert.
          Explosions destroy everything in their path leaving behind
          only a giant nuclear mushroom, beautiful and terrifying...

          FADE TO BLACK.

          3 EXT. DESERT HILLS - SUNRISE 3


          SUPER: NEW MEXICO - TODAY
          The sharp outline of the hills appears with the first morning
          light.
          The sun begins to rise revealing-
          A long deserted horizon stretching out endlessly.
          Nothing lives in this and wilderness.

          4 EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 4

          A road curves through the desert terrain.
          On the side of the road, at the bottom of a hill, a gas
          station has survived years of wind and dust.
          Around the main building, a tool shed, three gas pumps, a
          dilapidated well, a water tower, and gutted carcasses of cars
          from the 1950's accentuate the desolate feeling which
          prevails in this place.
          A sign reads "LAST STOP FOR 200 MILES".
          A few tumbleweeds roll across the road.

          5 INT. GAS STATION ROOM - DAY 5

          Beams of light slice through the shutters.

          KRIIINK KRONK - a metal grinding noise is heard outside.
          KRIIINK KRONK - the noise becomes regular.
          In the darkness we discover a room hardly furnished. The
          withered and yellowed wallpaper flaps slowly in the draft.
          On the dresser, dozens of empty liquor bottles.
          KRIIINK KRONK - On the bed, THE OLD GAS STATION ATTENDANT
          lays with his back to the window.
          KRIIINK KRONK - The noise outside continues steadily without
          disturbing his sleep.
          KRIIINK KRONK - Suddenly, the old man wakes up short of
          breath and looks around trying to locate the noise.
          KRIIINK KRONK - He looks through the shutters, then quickly
          puts on the top of his gas station overalls. He grabs a
          SHOTGUN, loading it swiftly.

          6 INT. GAS STATION - DAY 6

          KRIIINK KRONK - The metal grinding noise increases as we move
          towards the gas station door.
          The door opens and the old man walks out holding his gun.
          Nobody. Silence has returned. The metal grinding is gone.
          The lever from the water well still moves. IT'S JUST BEEN

          USED!
          Hidden behind the house someone or something observes the old
          station attendant walking slowly to the well.
          DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...- water falls on the palm of his hand.
          Worried, the old man scans the surroundings.

          HE IS NOT ALONE.

          OLD GAS ATTENDANT
          Ruby? Is that you?! Ruby?
          The sun is already high above, the heat waves shimmering over
          the desert.
          The old gas station attendant moves away from the road
          towards the hills.

          RUBY! RU-BY!
          On the side of the hill,-THE ENTRANCE TO A CONDEMNED

          NINETEENTH CENTURY MINE.
          He approaches the mine and looks through the wooden planks
          barring its entrance.

          OLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D)

          RUBY?
          His echo is the only sound that can be heard from the
          depths...
          He aims the shotgun, ready to open fire.

          OLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D)

          IF THAT'S YOU JUPITER, I GOT A

          BUCKSHOT FOR YA... YOU HEAR ME?!
          Behind the gas station, someone observes the old man coming
          back to the house.
          AN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG was placed in front of his door
          during his absence.
          The old man looks-around terrified.
          Diligently, he enters the house leaving the bag on the
          ground.
          On second thought, the door reopens and the bag is dragged
          inside.

          7 INT. GAS STATION - DAY 7

          The shutters are all closed leaving the station in darkness.
          The old man throws the leather bag on the dining table and
          sets down the shotgun.
          He takes a cigar from an ashtray and lights it. He grabs a
          whisky bottle.

          After a solid gulp, he turns on a bare light-bulb hanging
          over the table, and stares at the bag in silence. One more
          swig for courage, and the old man empties the bag on the

                         TABLE-
          Jewels, a Swiss watch, a DV Cam, glasses, several cell
          phones, a pager, loose cash, credit cards, a wallet...

          .A FEW GOLD TEETH, AND AN EAR ON WHICH HANG GOLD EARRINGS.
          He grabs the wallet and pulls out a photo already sticking
          out.
          On the bent picture, we see a young couple kissing. The young
          woman wears the same earrings found on the severed ear...
          The old man heaves a sigh before putting the wad of cash in
          his pocket. Outside, a voice is heard.

          MAN (O.S.)

          SOMEONE THERE?!
          The voice is followed by a car horn.
          The old man quickly gathers the objects from the table
          returning them to the bag.

          8 EXT. GAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 8

          A 1988 AIRSTREAM TRAILER HOME hitched to A CHEVROLET SUV is
          parked in front of the gas station.
          BIG BOB CARTER, an imposing man in his late fifties, stands
          outside the vehicle still honking the horn.
          The trailer home and SUV with the AMERICAN FLAG waving on the
          side, completes the image - Big Bob is an obvious cliche of
          the middle class Republican father with a touch of John
          Wayne.

                         BIG BOB
          where the hell is everybody? I'm
          gonna...
          Before he can finish his sentence, the old gas station man

          still chewing on his cigar.

          You know, it's illegal to smoke
          around a gas station.

           Inside the trailer home, DOUG BUKOWSKI, 32, Lynn's husband,
          tries to fix the broken A/C.
          His glasses and white oxford shirt drenched in sweat, Doug is
          totally out of his element. This is a guy who has never been
          out of the city.
          Using a Phillips screwdriver, he forcibly removes the front
          grill to access the mechanism.

           In the back seat, BRENDA, 17, sleeps against the window.
           A twig tickles her nose.
           Without opening her eyes, the young girl slaps her face as to
           chase away a fly.
           But the twig persists -
           It's her little brother, BOBBY, 15, teasing her. Linkin Park

          Bobby removes his headphones and pushes Brenda.

                         BOBBY
          Wake up, lard ass.

          11 EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 11

           Behind the gas station, Brenda plays with AN ALBINO PIGLET
          tied to a rope.

                         BRENDA
          Bobby, come look at this.
          Bobby joins her.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
          (holding the animal)
          Oh my god! Poor thing.

                         BOBBY
          You two make a perfect pair.
          Bobby turns to a rusty car and unzips to urinate.

                         BRENDA
          Don't pee there...

                         BOBBY

          God, what do you care?
          Bobby re-zips and heads towards the small wooden outhouse
          while Brenda plays with the baby pig.

                         BRENDA
          Piggy, piggy, piggy...

          SOMEONE OBSERVES HER FROM THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE.

          12 EXT. CAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 12

          In front of the gas station, Lynn leans on the car giving
          Catherine a bottle.
          Big Bob opens the hood while the old man continues to fill
          the tank.
          At the same time, Doug comes out of the trailer holding his
          cell phone.

                         DOUG
          (to the old man)
          Excuse me sir, do you have a phone
          I can use? I can't get a signal
          around here and...
          Big Bob interrupts.

                         BIG BOB
          Give. the phone a rest, Bukowski!

                         DOUG

          Honey, you haven't put that phone
          down since we left.

                         DOUG
          This is why I don't go on vacation.
          They're lost without me.

                         BIG BOB
          Stop being at everyone's beck and
          call, Bukowski. You're the boss,

          .I'm sure all that important
          business can wait till next week.
          Doug gives up. He kisses Lynn and takes the baby from her.

          13 INT. SUV - DAY 13

          While they are talking outside, a DEFORMED HAND slides into
          the back window of the SUV.

          A HAND WITH ONLY THREE STRANGELY PROPORTIONED FINGERS.
          It moves slowly, snatching BOBBY'S HOODED SWEATER from the
          back seat.

          SMALL VOICE (O.S.)

                         (WHISPERING)
          .Annnnaaaaau...
          Under the car the visitor's feet walk way. They are bare,
          dirty and covered with dust.

          14 INT. / EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAY 14

          Rays of light pass through the wooden planks.
          The outhouse is so dirty that Bobby is forced to hold his
          breath...
          An EYE peeks between the wooden planks!

                         BOBBY JUMPS-

                         BOBBY
          What the hell Brenda!
          The eye goes away...
          He re-zips looking outside. Nobody.
          When he exits, Brenda appears on the other side.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Freak.
          She looks at him slightly confused...

          15 EXT. GAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 15

          Doug sits on the porch giving the baby her bottle.
          The old gas station attendant checks the oil and the water.

          OLD GAS ATTENDANT
          You're at least six or seven hours
          away'from there.
          Ethel gives her husband a dirty look.

                         ETHEL
          I told you we should have gone
          through Santa Fe. You never listen
          to me.

          OLD GAS ATTENDANT
          This is the only southbound road
          that goes to 1-88. From there you
          can take the 231 West to
          California. But you'll never make
          it before sundown...

          As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns-

          KRIIINK KRONK - KRIIINK KRONK - KRIIINK KRONK
          He leans over and catches Bobby and Brenda in the distance,
          playing with the well. Brenda is about to drink from her
          hands.

          OLD GAS ATTENDANT
          (shouting to them)

          DON'T DRINK THAT WATER, MISS. IT

          AIN'T NO GOOD.

          No answer.
          Cautiously, Lynn moves through the store to the beaded
          curtains. Above the cash register, an old sepia photograph of
          a miner stares at her.

                         LYNN (CONT'D)
          Beauty?
          Lynn goes into the other room.
          In the darkness, among the old empty bottles, she finds
          Beauty standing with her front legs on a window sill and
          barking to the backyard.
          Lynn looks outside- Nobody. Only the desert and hills.
          Inside the room, THE HALF OPEN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG laying
          alone on the table awakens her curiosity.
          As she goes to inspect it, she hears the SUV starting and
          Doug calling out-

          DOUG (O.S.)
          Honey!? We're leaving...
          Lynn grabs the dog by the collar.

          SUSPICION- Has she seen the contents of the bag?

          17 EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 17

          Through the gas station window, we see Lynn leaving with the
          dog.
          Outside, next to the rusty abandoned cars, THE PIGLET HAS
          DISAPPEARED. Only the rope remains.

          A MURMUR IS HEARD AS A SHADOW PASSES SLYLY ON THE FLOOR.

          Lynn puts the dog in the trailer where Doug and Bobby are.

          You know, it's not on the map, but
          if you take a right at the road a
          couple miles from here, it'll lead
          you through the hills. Probably
          save you three or four hours.

          POV through binoculars from the hilltops.
          The binoculars pan across the deserted terrain before
          stopping on the Carter vehicle, a tiny dot at the end of the
          road. The car and trailer approach.
          Off screen, we hear ANIMALISTIC BREATHING behind the
          binoculars.
          The SUV turns off the main road onto a dirt trail. We see
          Brenda lifting the gate and allowing the vehicles to access
          the path, unaware of the danger lurking about.
          Brenda gets back in the SUV. It pulls the trailer on the dirt
          road towards the hills.

          We see the scenery through the window blinds.
          On a wall, photographs of other Carter vacations are
          reminders of the good times spent in the trailer home.
          The thermometer reads above 100 degrees. Sweating, Doug hangs
          on while the camper bounces over the rough road.
          Bobby works on the A/C. He has removed the face plate and
          tries to fix the motor with the screwdriver.

          A breeze of cool air circulates through the trailer. On the
          table, TWO PARAKEETS fly about their strapped-down cage.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          It was nothing... The thermostat
          was disconnected.

          How do you know all this stuff?

                         BOBBY

          Bobby sets down the screwdriver under the sleeper and sits

          Doug extends the pack. Bobby hesitates before reaching for
          one, but Doug pulls the pack away at the last moment.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Yeah right, if you start smoking
          your sister would cut my nuts off.

          The lizard has almost crossed the road when-
          SHLING!- RAZOR SHARP METAL SPIRES come out of the ground
          slicing the lizard in two.
          A trap has been set: a long chain of retractable spikes have
          emerged across the road.
          A few seconds later, the SW drives over them at full speed.

          INSTANTLY, THE TIRES EXPLODE.
          Big Bob loses control of the vehicle.
          The car rolls on the rims causing the trailer to almost flip
          over.
          Inside, Doug loses his grip and is thrown against the side of
          the trailer.
          On the road, the spikes retract, disappearing into the
          ground.

          The lunar terrain of sand and rocks extends beyond the

          DOUG (O.S.)
          Lynn, can you bring me my jacket
          honey?
          Lynn gets up and returns to the trailer.

                         BRENDA
          (imitating her sister)
          "Right away, honey..."
          Without turning around, Lynn gives her sister the finger.
          Brenda smiles with satisfaction.

          30 INT. TRAILER - DAY 30

          Lynn finds her husband's jacket and stops when she sees a
          cigarette butt in the sink. She's pissed. She picks it up and
          throws it away.
          A FLASH OF LIGHT catches her attention outside. She looks
          through the kitchen blinds and spots the quick reflection of
          light coming from the top of the hills when-

          BOBBY JUMPS UP AT THE WINDOW SCREAMING!
          Lynn falls back against.the kitchen table scared to death.
          Bobby laughs, pleased with himself. Annoyed, Lynn shuts the
          blinds in his face.

          31 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 31

          Outside, Doug and Big Bob look at the road map laid out on
          the ground.

                         DOUG
          I'll keep walking north. This
          road's gotta lead somewhere.
          Lynn comes around with the jacket and sees Big Bob and Bobby
          both holding guns.

                         LYNN
          What are you going to do with
          those?

                         BIG BOB
          It's always good to be prepared.

          Are you taking a gun too?
          Big Bob answers for him.

                         BIG BOB
          We've only got two and it's better
          if you guys have one here. You
          never know.

                         LYNN
          Are you sure you're going to be
          alright?
          Lynn puts a fisherman's hat on Doug to protect him from the
          sun and kisses him tenderly.

                         BIG BOB
          If you don't find any help in six
          or seven miles come back. I'll go
          to the gas station...

                         ETHEL
          It's almost 3, you'll never be back
          before sunset.

                         BIG BOB
          It's only about ten miles from
          here. I'll borrow that crazy old
          man's truck and use his phone if he
          has one... Don't worry... I'll be
          back with a tow truck before
          nightfall.

                         BOBBY
          Can I go with Doug?

                         BIG BOB
          No. Stay here with your mother and
          sisters.

                         (TO BRENDA)
          And you, don't tease your brother,
          he's in charge now.
          Holding the gun, Bobby winks at his sister who continues to
          sunbathe.

                         BRENDA
          Yeah, right.

          Is it really too much to ask?
          (turning to her husband)
          Bob?
          Bob finally agrees, and like a good family man, he gathers
          them around.
          Brenda slips on her shirt and joins them.

          Thank God nobody's watching us.
          In a lowered voice, Ethel recites a prayer. Even though only
          Ethel takes it seriously, in that precise moment the arguing
          stops and the family seems united and strong.
          But seen from the surrounding summit, through Goggle's
          binoculars, the family looks small and vulnerable...
          Behind them the sun begins to descend.

          A table and fold out chairs are set up in front of the

          Beauty escapes to the hills.
          Bobby runs as fast as he can but cannot keep up. The dog gets
          further and further away, climbing up the side of the
          mountain.
          Beauty moves through the first series of rocks. Bobby loses
          sight of her and stops. Out of breath, he hesitates-
          Ahead, the rocky horizon shows no indication of a definite
          path.
          He spots Beauty climbing between some rocks and continues his
          chase.

                         BOBBY

          BEAUTY!
          At the bottom of the hill, the rocks are too jagged for him
          to continue running. He slows down and begins moving past the
          first set of rocks.
          With much more agility, Beauty climbs quickly towards the
          top, disappearing behind some rocks.

                         BOBBY (CONT-D)

          BEAUTY? BEAUTY?
          Nothing. Only sharp rocks stand before him.

          SUDDENLY, A HIGH PITCHED HOWLING SOUND TEARS THROUGH THE

          SILENCE AND ECHOES IN THE VALLEY.
          Bobby freezes.
          No doubt about it - Beauty found what she was looking for,
          and it was much stronger...

          Bobby hesitates, then gathers his courage and decides to

          Jagged rock after jagged rock, Bobby slowly climbs towards
          the summit.

          He appears between two big stones reaching an intermediate
          zone before the top-

          erosion.

          A dangerous animal could be hiding behind any corner.
          A SHADOW PASSES BEHIND HIM.. Bobby doesn't notice.

          A THIN SHADOW ON THE GROUND. Someone or something is hiding
          behind a rock.
          Bobby freezes. He stares at the shadow. Who will make the
          first move?
          He makes the decision, creeping towards the shadow. Squeezing
          the stone, he lifts his hand to strike but stops when he

                         DISCOVERS-
          A YOUNG GIRL, ABOUT 14, WEARING HIS STOLEN SWEATSHIRT. She is
          about five feet tall and frail.
          The hood covers her head, partly hiding her face. She is
          rather pretty, even with her ABNORMALLY LARGE EYES...
          She trembles, frightened and intrigued by Bobby. What is this
          girl doing in a place like this?

          So you're the one who took my

                         BOBBY
          What are you doing here Ruby? Where
          are your parents? My family needs
          help. We had an accident.
          Ruby repeats her name mechanically as if she doesn't
          understand the questions.

                         RUBY
          (in a low voice)
          Ru... Ruby... Ruby...
          Bobby gets closer.

                         BOBBY
          I heard you, Ruby... Are you here
          alone?
          Ruby won't answer.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Ruby... I'm looking for my dog...
          Do you understand? My dog... her
          name is Beauty... She's a German
          Shepherd, about this high...

                         RUBY
          Beauty...

                         BOBBY
          That's right, have you seen her?

                         RUBY
          Ruby.. _Ruby is Beauty...
          The last sentence makes her laugh. A STRANGE AGONIZING

          LAUGHTER.

                         BOBBY
          Have you seen her?
          Ruby looks down. She knows something.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Look at me, Ruby... Look at me...
          Where did you see my dog?
          Ruby keeps looking to the ground. Bobby reaches under her
          chin to raise her head.
          Instinctively, Ruby SCREAMS as she backs off, lifting her
          hands to protect herself.

          HER HANDS LOOK LIKE CLAWS. DEFORMED AND MISSING FINGERS, THEY

          ARE NO LONGER HUMAN.
          Frightened, Bobby takes a step back. The girl murmurs softly.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          What? I can't understand. What are
          you saying?
          He comes closer trying to make eye contact as she continues
          to murmur the same thing. She too is terrified-

                         RUBY

                         (SOFTLY)
          The hills... The hills have
          eyes...The hills have eyes...The
          hills have eyes...
          Behind him, a small rock slide grabs his attention. He turns
          his head. When he turns back to Ruby, she is gone.

                         BOBBY
          Ruby, come back!
          Once more, Bobby is alone in the labyrinth.
          On the other side, he finds a trail of blood as if a body had
          been dragged on the rocks.
          The bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another
          set of rocks a few feet away.
          Bobby hesitates, unsure of what he might find...
          As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side
          Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks.
          Before him, on the ground, is Beauty.
          Dead. Disemboweled.
          Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning
          white. He touches the animal's head as if to convince himself
          that this nightmare can't be possible at all. Beauty's face
          is locked in a grimace of horrible pain and shock. And... the
          animal is missing its front right leg.
          DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... DROPS OF BLOOD fall on Bobby's hand -
          ABOVE HIM, PERCHED ON A ROCK, A FIGURE OBSERVES HIM. A man
          with an impressive build crouches like a monkey. He wears old
          clothes covered with dust, and a DERBY HAT on his head.
          Binoculars hang around his neck.

          IT'S GOGGLE.
          Goggle has no face, as if it were totally covered with wax.
          He has two little holes for nostrils and no ears. His mouth
          is like an opened wound sliced in his skin. His eyes are the
          only features which give him any human resemblance at all.
          Using his hand, Goggle devours something ferociously-

          BEAUTY'S LEG!
          Terrified, Bobby runs away.
          Goggle laughs from his rock.
          Bobby jumps down the hill.
          From the summit, Goggle continues feasting. A few yards away,
          Ruby's slender silhouette slides between the rocks. Goggle
          stops eating, sees Ruby, and throws her the remains. Ruby
          looks at the half-eaten leg in disgust, and pushes it away.

          GOGGLE (O.S.)
          (rough and deep)
          What's the matter Ruby.. .You don't
          like dog anymore?

          39 EXT. HILLS - DAY 39

          Moving at top speed, Bobby descends from the hills,
          occasionally glancing behind him.
          He jumps from one rock to the next. Anything to get out of
          this hellhole.
          He turns around one too many times and fails to see the sharp
          precipice ahead. He tries to stop, but it's too late.
          Bobby slides down a few feet before grabbing hold of a
          protruding rock. The rock tears his skin.
          Bobby tries to climb back up, losing his grip. He falls.
          His head hits the bottom. He loses consciousness.
          Behind him a RATTLESNAKE slithers rattling its tail.
          The snake zips its tongue around his face when -

          A WOODEN STICK WITH FORKED END, TRAPS THE SNARE'S HEAD TO THE

          GROUND SAVING BOBBY FROM A CERTAIN BITE.

          With the hood of the sweatshirt still over her head, RUBY
          WATCHES THE WOUNDED BOY TENDERLY with her big, abnormal eyes.

                         CUT TO:

          40 EXT. ROAD - END OF THE DAY 40

          Close on THE RED SUN on the horizon.
          We hear Doug, singing "California Dreaming" a capella.

                         DOUG
          "...All the leaves are brown and the
          sky is gray. I've been for a walk
          on a winter's day. I'd be safe and
          warm if I was in L.A... California
          dreamin..."
          After hours of walking down this road, his face shows signs
          of fatigue.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          I was in LA._ California
          Dreamin..."
          The lyrics resonate throughout the desert. Suddenly, he stops
          singing.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          What the hell?!

          IN FRONT OF HIM, ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD, THE ROAD ENDS-
          A mound of earth blocks the road like a wall, extending
          hundreds of yards on either side.
          Confused, Doug approaches the wall and starts climbing.
          Reaching the top, he takes off his sun clips from his glasses
          and tries to grasp what's on the other side-
          A HUGE ATOMIC CRATER, three hundred yards in. diameter.

          THE CRATER HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A GRAVEYARD FOR CARS, TRUCKS,

          TRAILER HOMES, MOTORCYCLES...
          Doug climbs down and wanders between the rusted vehicles.
          Doug lights a cigarette before continuing his inspection.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         40 CONTINUED: 40
          In the reflection of a shattered rear view mirror, we see him
          approaching another car.
          Dust completely covers the windows. Doug wipes one down to

                         LOOK INSIDE-
          He notices a baby seat still strapped to the back.
          The cars all seem to be in good condition, as if they were
          simply pushed into the crater.
          He leans down towards another car-
          Barbed wire is rolled around the flattened tires...
          As Doug looks around in confusion, trying to figure out what
          this place might be, THE CAMERA CRANES UP TO A WIDE AERIAL
          SHOT - revealing five or six others craters.

          41 EXT. TRAILER - MAGIC HOUR 41

          It's getting colder.
          Lynn warms her hands at a fire in front of the trailer.
          A few feet away, Brenda collects firewood while calling out
          her brother's name...

                         BRENDA

          BOBBY! BOB-BY!
          Inside the camper, Ethel watches the sun set in the horizon.
          She cradles the baby in her arms.
          Brenda joins Lynn and throws some firewood into the flames.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
          (looking at the hills)
          We should've gone looking for him
          when it was still light out. I'm
          nervous.

          Keep it together Brenda, Mom is
          already worried enough... The fire
          will help Bobby find his way back.

                         BRENDA
          What if he doesn't come back? Maybe
          he's hurt. Maybe there was an
          accident...

          Bobby was only wearing a t-shirt
          when he left.

          42 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 42

          Clouds pass, revealing an almost full moon. Wind blows around
          the dark gas station.
          Between the broken-down cars, we see Big Bob approaching on
          the road.
          A rusty tea pot sits on a pile of trash and whistles in the
          wind. By placing his hand on the spout, Big Bob stops the
          whistling and silence returns.
          Whistling. Silence. Whistling.
          Big Bob walks to the porch.

                         BIG BOB

          HELLO! ANYONE HERE?!
          No answer. He knocks on the door.

          BIG BOB (CONT'D)
          It's Bob Carter, I got some gas
          from you a couple of hours ago.
          Still nothing. Big Bob draws his gun and opens the door when-

          SILENCE.
          From the other side of the house, the whistling has stopped.

          BIG BOB (CONT'D)
          Anybody there? Answer me!
          After a few seconds, the whistling returns.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Big Bob shrugs it off and enters.

          43 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 43

          Holding his gun, Big Bob steps into the empty gas station
          store. A faint light comes from the back room. The wind blows
          dust through the broken windows...
          Vigilantly, he moves through the empty shelves, behind the
          counter and past the beaded curtain separating the two rooms.
          The light bulb above the dining table is on.

                         BIG BOB
          Somebody home? Hello?
          Big Bob pushes the last door leading to the back room.
          His hand feels for the light switch.
          CLICK - an old lamp comes on in the corner.
          He finds a wall mounted phone and picks up the receiver.
          No tone.

          BIG BOB (CONT'D)

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Dammit...
          Through the window, Big Bob sees a pick-up truck.
          He starts searching for the keys.
          Going through the different rooms, he discovers a drawer full
          of money, jewels, watches, credit cards... A REAL FORTUNE.
          He spots a key chain hanging from a nail next to the desk. He
          reaches for the keys when something else grabs his attention-
          Partially hidden in the dark, he discovers a few family
          photos and a few newspaper clippings from the 1950s pinned to
          the wallpaper.
          Big Bob lights the desk lamp and turns it towards the wall-
          His face goes cold-
          On the aged photos, we recognize the old gas station
          attendant in his younger days, next to his wife and his

                         CHILDREN-

          ABNORMAL CHILDREN GRUESOME AND DEFORMED BY NATURE...
          Cleft lips, tumors, uneven extremities, malformations, skin
          diseases, and gangrene of the face...

          THEY ARE ALL AFFECTED BY GENETIC ABNORMALITIES.
          On a more recent polaroid, we can recognize Ruby at 6 years
          old. Besides her three fingers and big eyes, half of her
          skull is missing or caved in.
          Another polaroid - in a wheelchair, a little boy has
          difficulty holding up his hugely disproportionate head.
          The headline from the clippings makes Big Bob understand the
          origins of these horrors-
          "New Mexico- Nuclear enters a new age."
          ".. .Miner town evacuated"
          "Miners refuse to abandon their lands by hiding in

                         MINES"
          "Military destroys miner's town."
          The old man's family was. one of those families whose genetic
          lineage was forever changed by the nuclear fallout.
          Big Bob is shocked, never believing such a thing was
          possible.

          A COUPLE OF MORE RECENT ARTICLES MENTION PEOPLE DISAPPEARING

          IN THE REGION.

          BIG BOB (CONT'D)
          You son of a bitch...
          Worried for his own family, he grabs the keys and walks out.
          From the bedroom window, we see him running to the pick-up
          truck.

          44 INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 44

          Big Bob slams the door, starts the engine and turns on the
          headlights.
          The headlights shine on the outhouse.
          The wooden outhouse door slams back and forth in the wind.
          Something blocks it from shutting completely-

          What kind of place is that for
          children?
          In a split second, the old man sets the shotgun under his

                         CHIN-

                          BIG BOB

          FREEZE!

          BANG! - THE OLD MAN'S BRAINS SPLATTER IN THE OUTHOUSE...

          Suddenly, VOICES coming from different directions echo around
          him.

                         VOICES
          Daddy... Daddy...Daaaddyyy...Daddy..
          THE VOICES ARE HORRIFIC AND TERRIFYING. Big Bob backs up
          pointing his gun in their direction.

                         VOICES (CONT'D)
          Daaaaddyyy...Dad-dy...Dad-dy...

                         BIG BOB
          Who's there?

                         VOICES
          Dad-dy...Dad-dy...Daddy...Dad-dy...
          Big Bob can't contain his fear and shoots blindly into the
          darkness.

                         BIG BOB
          Who's there? Show yourself!
          The voices become louder and louder, omnipresent.

                         VOICES
          Dad-dy...Dad-dy...Daaaddyyy...
          Daddy.. Daddy...
          Big Bob walks backwards to the truck, and trips on the
          ground.
          Wide eyed, he stands and throws himself on the car door.

          45 INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 45

          Panicked, he enters the vehicle and turns the ignition.
          As the engine turns over-

          A DEEP VOICE RIGHT BEHIND HIM-

                         VOICE

                         (CALMLY)
          ..Daddy...
          In a split second, Big Bob sees, in his rear view mirror, A

          DARK HAIRY FIGURE WITH EVIL EYES IN THE BACKSEAT-
          It's PAPA JUPITER.

          46 EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 46


          BIG BOB'S FACE SLAMS REPEATEDLY INTO THE WINDSHIELD!
          The truck shakes as Big Bob is attacked inside. Blood
          splatters on the windows.

          47 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 47

          Bloodied and screaming, Big Bob is dragged out of the car in
          the dirt to the entrance of the old mine behind the gas
          station. Big Bob disappears inside. The night is once again
          calm and silent.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          49 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 49

          Miles away, inside the trailer, Ethel washes dishes while
          dinner cooks on the stove.

          SUDDENLY THE RED LIGHT ON THE C/B TURNS ON AND THE RADIO

          SQUAWKS TO LIFE, DISRUPTING THE SILENCE.
          She wipes her hands on her apron and site down next to the
          radio.

                         ETHEL
          (into the mic)
          Hello...Hello... Can somebody hear
          me? Please answer if you hear me.
          Hello?
          No answer. The radio goes silent. Lynn joins her, holding the
          baby.

                         LYNN
          How's it going?

                         ETHEL

          She fiddles with the radio.

          I'm not even sure I know how to use
          this thing.
          Lynn hands her Catherine, and sits in front of the C/B.

          Mayday ...mayday... This is a
          distress call... Do you copy?
          Still nothing.

          50 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 50

          Lynn's distress call is heard from the trailer isolated in
          the middle of the desert.

          51 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 51


                         LYNN
          Mayday. . .We're stranded in the
          desert, we need help...mayday...
          Suddenly, the light on the C/B turns green and static can be
          heard. Ethel grabs her daughter's hand, hopeful that someone
          may have heard them.
          A second later, HEAVY BREATHING is heard over the radio.
          The light turns off. The two women look at each other in
          confusion.

                         LYNN (CONT'D)
          What was that?

                         ETHEL
          It sounded like an animal...
          Lynn stands up worried.

                         LYNN
          If animals start answering our
          radio calls, we're really fucked!

          Watch your language!

                         LYNN
          Give it a rest, Mom. We have more
          important things to worry about.
          She walks out.

                         ETHEL
          Lynn, wait.
          Ethel stays alone with the baby.

          52 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 52

          Still tied to the trailer, Beast growls and pulls on his
          chain.
          Lynn raises the collar of her jacket to protect herself from
          the wind and moves closer to the fire.

                         LYNN
          Brenda?
          No answer.

          BRENDA?!
          In the distance, we see Brenda looking for her brother.

                         BRENDA

          BOBBY? BOBBY?
          With a flashlight in one hand, the gun in the other, and a
          blanket over her shoulders, Brenda moves through the night.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)

          BOBBY? BOB-BY?
          She hears her older sister calling.

          LYNN (O.S.)
          Brenda? Brenda?

                         BRENDA
          I'm here! I'll be back in a minute.
          The flashlight partially lights the desert as she disappears
          into the night.

          53 EXT. HILLS - NIGHT 53

          We fly over the hills before stopping over Bobby's
          unconscious body laid out between two rocks.
          Ruby is still at his side, observing him silently.
          She hears Brenda's calls and runs away.

          Bobby slowly opens an eye, regaining his senses. Blood has
          coagulated on his face. He turns his head in the direction of
          his sister's voice, realizing that it's night. How long has
          he been unconscious?

                         CUT TO:

          54 EXT. TRAILER - MIGHT 54

          The sky is so clear that you can see the milky way above the
          Carters' trailer home.
          Beast strains on his chain, a low growl of rage coming from
          his chest.

          55 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 55

          Inside the trailer-
          The first aid kit is open on the table. Even with a blanket
          around his shoulders, Bobby shivers.
          Ethel soaks cotton in alcohol using it to clean his wounds.

                         ETHEL
          You're lucky Brenda found you.
          Imagine if you had to spend the
          whole night out there in the cold.
          Bobby winces from the pain.

                         BRENDA
          Don't worry, Beauty will come back
          when she's hungry...
          Bobby doesn't answer. He keeps the truth to himself, not
          wanting to worry his family.

                         BOBBY
          Have you tried the radio?

                         ETHEL

          breathing...

          Bobby jumps up, grabs the gun and crouches behind the door.

          (to the others)
          Ssshhhh...
          His mother and two sisters are surprised by his agitated
          behavior.

                         BRENDA
          What's wrong with you?
          Footsteps. Someone approaches.

                         BOBBY
          (stern but soft)
          I want you guys to stay in here.
          Brenda?! You hear me?
          Gun in hand, he opens the door-
          Bobby is about to shoot when a figure emerges from the dark.
          IT'S DOUG, holding as much as he could carry from the car
          graveyard.

                         DOUG
          What the fuck are you doing? Don't
          point that thing at me.
          Bobby lowers the weapon.

          Quickly, Lynn exits the trailer and jumps into her husband's
          arms. They kiss.
          Doug sets down all of his findings.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Look what I found.
          Various tools, a fishing pole...

          With all of this, we can find a way
          to fix the car, right Bobby?
          Bobby doesn't answer.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          I found this really huge crater at
          the end of the road! I've never

          No. The road just stops there. I
          hope your dad has better luck.
          Is there anything to eat? I'm
          starving.

                         BOBBY

                         (QUIETLY)
          I need to talk to you...

                         DOUG
          What?
          Bobby hesitates to talk.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          So, what Bobby?
          Lynn walks by-

                         LYNN
          I'm almost ready...

                         DOUG
          Listen... I'm sure your dad will be
          back soon. He's "Big Bob". It's
          gonna take more than a few snakes
          in the dark to stop him, right?

                         (TO LYNN)
          Are you coming, honey?
          Lynn, holding a blanket and pillows, joins him. They exit
          together hand in hand.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (FROM OUTSIDE)
          If he's not back by midnight, we'll
          go get him. Deal?
          Bobby hates himself for not saying anything. He bolts the
          door shut and stands facing it.
          Behind him, Brenda sets the baby in her crib and starts a
          FISHER PRICE MOBILE hanging above, setting off the music and
          rocking the baby to sleep.
          She disappears in the bathroom for a moment and comes out in
          t-shirt and panties. She turns to her brother-

                         BRENDA
          Can I listen to your iPod?
          Bobby is still focused on the door.

                         BOBBY
          What?

                         BRENDA
          Can I borrow your iPod?

                         BOBBY

                         (DISTANT)
          Whatever...
          Brenda grabs it and cranks the volume. she starts swaying to
          the music, unaware of the dangers lurking about.
          Next to her, Catherine sleeps quietly in her crib.
          On the other side of the trailer, Ethel works on a crossword
          puzzle.
          INSERT- " family, revenge, homicide..." are some of the words
          in the puzzle...

          60 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 60

          In between some bushes, we see the Carter trailer home
          isolated in the desert under the starlit sky. Backlit in the
          window, Brenda dances...
          Next to the trailer home, the SUV-

          61 INT. SUV - NIGHT 61

          In a makeshift bed in the back, Doug is laying on his back
          and Lynn rubs his legs.

                         DOUG
          Ow, Ow... Yeah right there.
          Perfect. God, I feel like I crossed
          New Mexico on foot.
          Amused, Lynn squeezes his legs a bit harder. She moves up to
          his love handles.

                         LYNN
          A little work out can't be all that
          bad for these guys, right?
          Doug laughs and giggles.

                         DOUG
          Stop! Stop, you're tickling me!
          Lynn continues with more fervor.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Oh, so you want to play?
          He turns around and starts tickling her as well. They laugh
          together before kissing passionately.

                         LYNN
          I love you...

                         DOUG
          I love you too...
          They start making out.

          62 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 62

          At the same time A HAND opens the gas tank and unscrews the
          cover.

                         62 CONTINUED: 62
          In total silence, the hand slips a rubber hose into the tank
          and starts siphoning gas. We follow the hose up to the
          monstrous mouth of-
          PLUTO - The deformed bald giant with a child's face. But a
          child with a thick, primal cruelty snapping in his
          asymmetrical, protruding eyes.
          Silently, Pluto siphons some of the Carter's gas into a gas
          can.
          Lynn's hand presses against the window, as she and her
          husband continue, unaware.
          Pluto laughs stupidly, excited by the situation. His large
          smile reveals POINTY SHARK-LIKE TEETH.
          Once the gas can is full, he waves at somebody hidden in the
          dark.

          63 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 63

          Brenda rests on her bed. Exhausted, she turns off the bed
          lamp,. and slides under the sheets. She falls asleep listening
          to the music.
          In the other room of the trailer, Bobby's watch reads
          11:45pm. Bobby is restless. He doesn't know what to do.
          A few feet away, Ethel sleeps on the couch.
          Suddenly, Bobby hears barking in the distance.

                         BOBBY
          Beast?!
          He grabs the gun and exits the trailer, leaving the door
          open.

          64 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 64

          Bobby moves into the night. Beast is still barking somewhere
          in the dark.
          As he passes the SUV, he overhears the moaning and heavy
          breathing coming from inside.
          His flashlight moves over the desert terrain and the
          occasional bush. He calls out to his dog, trying not to wake
          anyone.

          Beast? Come on, boy. You hear me!
          Come on now.
          Bobby moves further from the trailer towards the barking.

          HIS FLASHLIGHT PASSES QUICKLY OVER A SHAPE HIDING IN THE

          BUSHES!
          Bobby shines the light on the bush and approaches-
          Nothing. It must have been his imagination.
          The barking becomes a ferocious growl.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Beast? Beast? Its me. Come on...
          All of a sudden the growling becomes a "mooing" cow.
          Then a goat. Then a chicken.
          Terrified, Bobby turns around and runs back toward the SUV.

          65 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 65

          In the living room, Ethel sleeps.
          At the other end, Brenda turns under the sheets. The muted
          bass coming from the iPod drums on in the background.

          A GNARLED HAND ENTERS FRAME AND BRUSHES A STRAND OF HAIR FROM

          BRENDA'S FACE SO STEALTHILY THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN STIR.

          IT'S PLUTO. THE DIVERSION OUTSIDE HAS ALLOWED HIM TO ENTER.
          He stands above Brenda watching her sleep, an innocent smile
          on his face. His hand softly grazes her hair as if she was a
          kitten, then pulls on the sheets to expose her body.
          Pluto covers her mouth, silencing her. BRENDA'S EYES OPEN

          WIDE.

          66 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 66

          Panting and panicked, Bobby knocks on the SUV's tailgate
          window, interrupting Lynn and Doug.

                         BOBBY
          Doug! Doug!
          Caught red-handed, Lynn dresses and Doug pulls up his pants.

          What do you want, Bobby?

                         BOBBY
          Come on, open up!
          Lynn opens the back window giving him a dirty look.

                         LYNN
          This had better be important.
          Bobby is too scared to keep the truth hidden. He regains his
          calm before talking.

                         BOBBY
          Something's going on around here.
          We're not alone.
          Exasperated, Lynn takes a deep breath, not taking him
          seriously.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          I know this sounds weird, but there
          are people living in those hills.

          something's going on... You even
          said you heard some breathing on
          the radio didn't you?
          Lynn nods.

          We're not alone, I'm telling you...
          Doug exits the car. Obviously, Bobby is not kidding.

                         DOUG
          Calm down Bobby, OK? Let's go check
          it out together. Lynn, stay right
          here.

          67 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 67

          From the window, we can see Bobby and Doug walking to the
          trailer.
          In the back room, Pluto hears them, grabs his walkie-talkie

                         AND GROWLS-

                         PLUTO
          Noaowww!

          68 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 68

          AT THAT MOMENT, an explosion takes place a few hundred yards
          away from the trailer.
          The flames climb into the air lighting the surrounding rocky
          desert.
          SOMEONE SCREAMS. Doug and Bobby turn around.

          IT'S BIG BOB!
          He has been crucified to a Joshua tree and transformed into a

          HUMAN TORCH...
          The explosion and the screaming has awakened Ethel who comes
          out of the trailer in her nightgown. Recognizing his screams,
          she runs to her burning husband.

                         ETHEL

          Doug tries to hold her back, but she is determined to get to
          him.

          69 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 69

          Doug runs into the trailer grabbing a fire extinguisher and
          some blankets. In the panic, he fails to see Brenda
          restrained by Pluto.

                         DOUG

                         (PANICKED)
          Brenda, stay with Catherine!
          He jumps out without waiting for an answer.
          Pluto gives Brenda a satisfied smile- NO ONE WILL BOTHER THEM

          NOW.

          70 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 70

          Doug runs out leaving the door wide open.
          Someone jumps from the roof and, on all fours, lands in front
          of the door. He stands and, for the first time, we see the
          face of -
          LIZARD - Pluto's cousin.
          Lizard is as thin as Pluto is imposing. Extremely pale, his
          face is disfigured by A CLEFT LIP WHICH EXPOSES HIS DEFORMED

          JAW. A SAVAGE WITH NO SENSE OF PITY, LIZARD IS, AFTER PAPA

          JUPITER, THE MOST VIOLENT INHABITANT OF THE HILLS.
          Lizard has Big Bob's Magnum. He enters the trailer and closes
          the door behind him.

          71 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71

          Big Bob screams as the flames devour his naked flesh.
          His fingers tighten. His bloodied face distorts with pain.
          Even his eyes are burnt. Considering the condition of his
          body, it's a miracle he's still alive...
          Doug arrives with the extinguisher and begins putting out the
          fire under Ethel's horrified, watchful eye.

          With a wicked smile on his face, Lizard puts on Ethel's apron
          and places her flowery sun hat on his head. This disturbed
          mind takes pleasure in dressing up in "Mama's clothes"...
          Then, famished, he eats everything he can find in the
          trailer.
          Raw meat, fruit, potato chips... He washes it all down with
          milk, orange juice...
          His eyes stop on the bird cage. He smiles.
          Lizard moves closer, opens the cage and grabs one of the
          parrakeets.
          The small bird looks around in confusion.

          HE TEARS OFF ITS HEAD AND SQUEEZES THE BLOOD INTO HIS MOUTH!
          Blood drips on his chin.
          Brenda's muted screams attract his attention.
          Lizard walks across the trailer. HE WANTS HIS SHARE.
          He pushes Pluto violently to the ground.

                         LIZARD
          Move!
          (with a smile)
          You gotta be a man to do that...
          Pluto is outraged and tries to stand up. He wants to talk but
          no words come out. JUST GRUNTS AND GROWLS.
          Lizard savagely hits him several times.
          Behind them, terrified, Brenda watches helplessly as they
          fight.
          Lizard puts his foot on Pluto's face, pinning him to the
          ground, and then points the gun to his head.

                         LIZARD (CONT'D)
          I told ya to move!
          Pluto moves away and, in a fit of rage, breaks everything in
          the trailer. Dishes, chairs, table... everything.
          Lizard laughs like a goon. He grabs Brenda by her feet and
          pulls her to him.

          Excited and amused at the same time, he stares at Brenda's
          appetizing calf muscle. He smells it, licks it, and then,
          without hesitation, plunges his teeth into her leg.

          73 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 73

          Brenda's muted screams are heard from inside the trailer.

          74 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 74

          The flames have been replaced by white smoke.
          Doug unties Big Bob. His body falls motionless to the ground.

          COMPLETELY CARBONIZED, HE HAS STOPPED BREATHING.
          Smoke comes out of his mouth.
          Doug uses the blanket to extinguish the last flames.
          Behind Doug, Ethel looks at her husband refusing to accept
          the truth.

          No..No.. It's not possible. That's
          not Bob. That's not my Bob.
          She grabs Doug by his shirt trying to convince him.

                         ETHEL (CONT'D)
          Doug.. It's not him. Tell me it's
          not him. It's not my Bob!
          The poor woman has lost her mind. Ethel erupts in laughter
          pointing to her dead husband.

                         ETHEL (CONT'D)

                         (HYSTERICALLY)
          That is not my Bob! That is not my
          Bob! That's not him!
          Lynn and Bobby are paralyzed. Doug turns to his wife.

                         DOUG
          Take your mother away from here!
          With her eyes fixed on her father, Lynn walks her mother
          away.
          In Bobby's eyes, sadness has been replaced by hatred. Full of
          rage, the youngster grabs the gun and walks away.

          I'm gonna take care of the
          motherfuckers!

                         DOUG
          Come back here, Bobby!
          Bobby disappears into the night.
          Doug covers Big Bob's face with a blanket.

          75 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 75

          Returning to the trailer, Lynn struggles to restrain Ethel.
          Ethel finally realizes it's too late for her husband and
          collapses into her daughter's arms.
          Just then, a muffled scream from Brenda pierces the night.

                         LYNN
          Oh my god!
          Lynn runs inside leaving her mother alone.

          76 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 76

          Bursting into the trailer, Lynn stops on a dime when she sees
          Lizard, in Ethel's clothes, holding the baby.
          Behind him, Pluto restrains Brenda.
          Lizard walks up with the baby.

                         LIZARD

                         (EVIL)
          Big fat baby good.., you fat... Fat
          and juicy!
          Lynn is paralyzed with fear.
          Lizard imitates a mother cradling her baby.

                         LIZARD (CONT'D)
          Baby... Baby...
          Instinctively, Lynn grabs the closest thing, a FRYING PAN,
          and hits Lizard brutally in the face.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         76 CONTINUED: 76
          Stunned, he falls to the ground and drops the baby, who
          begins to wail.
          when he lifts his head, Lynn strikes again-
          He blocks her arm and twists it, bringing her to her knees.
          Lynn tries to fight him off, but he is too strong.
          Still restrained, Brenda spots the PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER under
          the sleeper. The one Bobby had used to fix the A/C.
          At the other end of the trailer, Lizard has immobilized Lynn
          and POINTS THE GUN AT THE BABY!
          Lynn stops.

                         LYNN

                         (PANTING)
          No...No...Please... Please don't...
          Without a word, Lizard tears off Lynn's shirt and bra.
          The gun stays pointed at the baby as-
          Lizard removes Ethel's sun hat and hovers over Lynn's
          breast...
          Seen from behind her shoulder, we can't figure out exactly
          what this mental case is doing... Is he nursing from her
          breast?
          Lynn trembles, but can only think of her baby and her sister,
          who are still threatened.
          Excited by what his brother is doing, Pluto fondles Brenda.
          Suddenly, Ethel jumps into the trailer with a broom and
          starts batting away at Lizard.
          For once, her adrenaline kicks in as she fights for the most
          important thing in her life - Her family.
          The broom has little effect and is almost comical...
          BANG! - Lizard shoots Ethel in her chest, throwing her back.

          77 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 77

          From far away, Bobby hears the gunshot. He quickly turns
          around to help his family.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

          78 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 78

          In the trailer home, Brenda takes advantage of the confusion
          to get away from Pluto and grabs the Phillips screwdriver
          from beneath the sleeper.
          Brenda slides the screwdriver to Lynn who raises it and is
          about to strike when-
          BANG! - Lynn is shot in the chest.
          Lizard turns to Brenda and aims at her head.
          He is about to shoot when Lynn, with her last breath-

          PLANTS THE PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER IN HIS THIGH. IT STARTS

          TEARING THROUGH HIS FLESH!
          Lizard screams in pain and turns the gun back to Lynn-
          BANG! - He blows off part of her skull.
          Blood splatters throughout the cabin.

          79 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 79

          Alarmed by the gunfire, Doug gets up and looks at the trailer
          in the distance. He doesn't know what to do.
          Bobby appears behind him-

                         BOBBY
          Come on Doug! They're in the
          trailer-!
          They both take off running.

          80 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 80

          Witness to the slaughter, Brenda is petrified with fear.
          Lizard pulls out the screwdriver and stands with difficulty.
          He picks up the baby and hands it to Pluto.

                         LIZARD
          Take it.
          Pluto obeys. Lizard grabs Brenda by the hair and pulls her
          out of the trailer.

          Come on bitch...
          She screams and resists by grabbing at furniture and pulling
          off the curtains...
          Her nails scratch against the paneling.

          BEFORE LEAVING, LIZARD RIPS THE JEWELRY FROM ETHEL AND LYNN'S

          BODY...

          81 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 81

          Brenda is pulled out by Lizard.
          When he sees Bobby and Doug approaching, Lizard changes his

                         MIND-

          HE INSERTS THE BARREL OF HIS GUN INTO BRENDA'S MOUTH...
          Brenda is wide eyed. Without hesitating, Lizard pulls the

                         TRIGGER-
          CLICK! - no more bullets.
          Lizard drops Brenda.

                         LIZARD
          I'll come back for ya...
          Lizard disappears into the night.
          Brenda lays on the ground trembling and crying.
          Doug arrives at the trailer, while Bobby aims the 9mm at the
          assassins.

          BANG! BANG! BANG!
          It's too late. They're gone.
          Bobby runs to his traumatized sister laying on the ground. He
          holds her in his arms, trying to calm her down.
          Doug approaches the open door. He notices bloody hand prints
          along the side of the trailer home- One of the attackers has
          been hurt...

          82 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 82

          Doug enters the trailer unable to imagine the tragedy.

                         82 CONTINUED: 82
          Horrified, he discovers Ethel on the couch, not quite dead,
          but short of breath and in pain.
          Doug is stone faced-

          ON THE GROUND, LYNN'S BODY, HIS OWN WIFE, SOAKS IN HER BLOOD!
          His eyes fill with tears. He tries to keep from crying but
          his sadness is too deep.
          His hand approaches her face. His fingers graze her hair.

          SUDDENLY, LYNN'S BODY SUFFERS A LAST MUSCLE SPASM, LIKE A

          CIRCUIT SHORTING OUT.
          Doug tries to breathe life back into her body, but death has
          overtaken her open eyes. He closes them and starts weeping.
          The music from the Fisher Price mobile is the only other
          sound...
          Doug turns around. THE CRIB IS EMPTY...

                         DOUG

                         (SOFTLY)
          No...No...
          He squeezes his fist with rage.

          83 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 83

          At the foot of the burnt tree, Big Bob's body is laid out on
          some rocks, the blanket over his face.
          A few figures emerge out of the darkness and gather around
          the body like a pack of hyenas.

          BIG BOB IS DRAGGED AWAY THROUGH THE DUST...

          84 EXT. HILLS - NIGHT 84

          Backlit by the moon, at the top of the hill, we find Goggle
          and his binoculars.
          Reflecting in the lenses, we see the carters' trailer glowing
          in the night.
          A rustling noise attracts his attention.

          Before Goggle can turn around, a wild animal jumps at his
          face- IT'S BEAST.
          The German shepherd tears at Goggle's face and locks deep
          into his throat. Goggle tries to fight it off, but the animal
          is determined to kill.
          Goggle grabs AN OLD RAZOR out of his pocket and tries to cut
          the animal.
          The dog bites down tightening its grip. BONES CRACK.
          He drops the razor. Goggle's derby hat falls between some
          rocks.

          BEAST AVENGES BEAUTY IN A BLOODFEST!
          Someone calls him on the on walkie-talkie-

          RADIO (O.S.)
          "Goggle? Goggle..."
          Goggle will not answer anymore...

          85 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 85

          Laid out on the couch, Ethel agonizes between life and death.
          Brenda stares into space, saying nothing. Doug touches her
          head as he passes. Instinctively, she backs off terrified.
          Across the trailer, Bobby paces back and forth.

                         BOBBY

          What are we going to do Doug? What
          are we going to do if they come
          back?
          Completely defeated, Doug comes back and goes to Ethel's
          side.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Doug!
          Doug does not answer and takes Ethel's hand. She opens her
          eyes and looks at him as if nothing happened.

                         ETHEL
          This camper's so small. No matter

                         DOUG
          Yes, Brenda is here and Bobby is in
          the kitchen.
          At the other end, Bobby turns away, crying. Brenda looks away
          as well.

                         ETHEL
          (short of breath)
          Is Lynn sleeping?
          Doug holds back the tears.

          Yes..
          (after a beat)
          Do you need anything?
          Ethel finds it more and more difficult to talk.

          Look in the closet Doug, I'm sure I
          have another blanket. I'm so cold.
          Doug tucks one of the blankets around her.

          You've always been so sweet. I
          understand why Lynn loves you so
          much.
          She raises her arm to caress his face.
          Her hand falls on the bed. Lifeless.

                         (TERRIFIED)

          THEY'RE HERE... THEY'RE BACK... I

          DON'T WANT TO DIE BOBBY...I DON'T

          WANT TO DIE...DO SOMETHING...
          Bobby picks up the gun-
          BANG! BANG! BANG! - With no hesitation, he shoots through the
          door.
          Brenda throws herself into Doug's arms.
          Bobby stares at the bullet holes in the trailer door.
          Suddenly, the sound of a radio is heard-

          RADIO (O.S.)
          "Goggle, you copy? Goggle..."
          Bobby and Doug look at each other confused.

          "Goggle?"
          Doug silently moves closer to the door.
          From outside we can see Doug's eye through one of the bullet
          holes. Nobody, everything seems quiet.

                         DOUG
          Get ready Bobby..
          Doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight.
          From beneath the trailer, someone observes him...
          Doug bends down and discovers-
          GOGGLE'S SEVERED ARM. In its hand, the walkie-talkie still
          works.

          RADIO (O.S.)
          "Goggle? Goggle?"
          Doug grabs the radio. It's dripping with blood.
          Bobby is about to join him when Doug signals-

          THERE'S SOMEONE HIDING UNDER THE TRAILER.
          Without a sound, Bobby aims the gun at the kitchen floor.
          Outside, Doug backs up to see who is hiding.
          Behind the step ladder, he sees an inert shape in the
          shadows.
          BANG! - Bobby shoots through the floor. Immediately, the
          shadowy figure jumps out into the light-

                         DOUG
          Beast!
          The dog jumps into Doug's arms and begins licking his face.
          Bobby can't believe it, his dog has returned.
          Radio static comes back on the walkie. Bobby picks it up-

          RADIO (O.S.)
          "Papa Jupe... Goggle is dead. I
          found him in the rocks..."
          "Dead?"

          "They got him. He's all torn
          up..."
          Bobby is proud of Beast. Still in the trailer, Brenda looks
          at them, not as hopeful.

                         BOBBY
          Good boy.. That's a good dog.

          PAPA DUPE/RADIO (O.S.)
          "I'm gonna take care of those
          bastards myself"...
          Bobby exchanges a worried glance with Doug. Even though
          neither of the two has yet met Papa Jupe, something in his
          voice tells them that it's only going to get worse.
          Doug grabs the radio-

                         DOUG
          (in the radio)

          WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT? WHY ARE

          No answer. Just static.

          Silence. Suddenly we hear-

          CATHERINE'S CRIES ON THE RADIO!
          Doug drops the radio, scared speechless...

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

          86 INT. DARK PLACE - NIGHT 86

          On a dimly lit wooden table, Catherine lays, wrapped in a
          blanket.
          A butcher's knife is planted next to her...
          Asthmatic breathing, and the sound of running water punctuate
          the silence.
          Ruby steps out of the darkness and moves towards the baby.
          She watches through her abnormally large eyes and extends her
          stringy fingers to touch the baby.
          A large screen splits the room in two.
          A strangely shaped shadow moves behind the screen: A
          HANDICAPPED BODY washed by A LARGE WOMAN...
          An empty wheel chair rests in a corner.
          Amused, Ruby looks at the baby who smiles back. She carefully
          takes Catherine in her arms when the invalid's voice

                         INTERRUPTS-

          LARGE WOMAN (O.S.)
          Put that down Ruby... You know
          better than to play with your
          food...
          Ruby takes a step back, hugging the baby tighter.

                         - RUBY
          Mama, pleaaase...

          HANDICAPPED (O.S.)

          Listen to your mother Ruby and put
          that baby down... Now!
          Frightened, Ruby obeys and quickly runs out of the room.

          Something has gone off in her eyes. She is absent, no longer
          living, just surviving.
          Doug is about to leave, taking with him anything from the
          trailer which might be useful.

          BASEBALL BAT, FLASHLIGHT, PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER...

                         BOBBY

          No, you stay here with your sister

          The sun'll be up soon. One of them
          is hurt, I'm going to follow his
          trail through the hills.
          Bobby pulls out the 9mm gun and hands it to him.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          No. You keep it in case they come
          back.

                         BOBBY
          What about you?

                         DOUG
          Don't worry about me, I'll take
          Beast.
          Beast sits at his feet ready to go. Doug straps the walkie-
          talkie over his shoulder.

          Before walking out, he bends down to Lynn's body and kisses
          her one last time on the mouth.

          88 EXT. HILLS - SUNRISE 88

          The first sign of dawn lights the distant horizon.
          The vultures perched on a dead Joshua Tree swivel their heads
          around, to see a distant, running FIGURE -
          DOUG AND BEAST, moving steadily among the rocks.

          89 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - DAY 89

          Doug and Beast arrive at the old mine's entrance on the side
          of the hill. The trail of blood leads inside.
          Doug hides behind a rock. Sweating, he catches his breath.
          Beast breathes heavily as well. Doug remembers what his wife
          always used to say-

                         DOUG
          (to the dog)
          I told you to stop smoking.
          Doug sets a different frequency on his radio-

          (Into the walkie)

          I'm not sure if I'll get a signal
          from inside. If you don't hear from
          me in a half an hour, you're on
          your own.

                         BOBBY
          Yeah... Good luck, Doug.
          He puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight.

                         DOUG

                         (TO BEAST)
          You ready big guy? I hope you're
          not afraid of the dark.
          He pets the dog one final time and stands up.

          90 INT. MINE - DAY 90

          With the light from the entrance behind him, shadow enters
          the mine.
          The beam from his flashlight follows the trail of blood on
          the ground.
          The wooden pylons which have held up the walls for a hundred
          years threaten to crumble at any second.
          Only static on the radio. Doug turns it off.
          He moves further into the darkness, probing with his
          flashlight into the inky pit.
          Doug arrives at a fork splitting the tunnel off in two
          different directions.
          Doug lights each tunnel with the flashlight until he finds
          the one with-the blood trail, then continues on into that
          one. Tracking.
          Suddenly he stops.
          The beam of the flashlight has revealed TWO DOZEN PICKAXES
          that have been planted in the ground over mounds. That look
          very much like graves. The pickaxes look eerily like crosses,
          given the whole place the feel of A SUBTERRANEAN GRAVEYARD.
          Hanging from the graves, dates and portraits of all the
          miners who have died here, including women and children...
          The flashlight dims. Doug taps it to no avail.

           Come on. You can't be serious.
           Then light goes. completely off, leaving Doug in darkness.
          Scratch! - He lights a match.
          Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until
          he arrives at another fork. He can no longer see the blood
          trail.

          A SHAPE SLIDES SWIFTLY BEHIND HIM!

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          (to Beast, meaning

                         HIMSELF)
          Just stay calm, boy...
          A gust of air kills the match.
          He immediately lights another-
          Again, THE DRAFT SNUFFS IT OUT.
          He turns around, looking for the source of the air, and
          notices a reflection of light at the end of the tunnel.
          He moves towards the reflection.

          91 EST. MINE EXIT - DAY 91
          On the other side of the hill, the collapsed wooden beams and
          stones block part of the mine's exit.
          Doug emerges with Beast. His eyes takes a moment to adapt to
          the bright sunlight.
          He. cannot believe what he sees. At the bottom of a hill, A

          SMALL TOWN - A CLASSIC ONE-STREET TOWN BUILT BACK IN THE

          50'S.
          Doug turns the walkie on.

                         DOUG

          Still nothing. Doug turns around and looks up-
          A wall of rock towers behind him.
          He tries one last time, but the signal won't go through.

          92 INT. TRAILER - DAY 92

          Close up on the C/B radio in the trailer-
          Only static comes from the speakers.

          93 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 93

           Brenda drags one of the tires from the SUV 30 feet away.
           She douses it with lighter fluid and-
          Whoosh! - a match sets it on fire creating a thick, black,
          smoke signal.
          Brenda joins her brother who is busy planting wooden stakes
          in a circle fifty meters around the trailer.

                         BRENDA
          Maybe somebody heard our calls..

                         BOBBY
          Nobody's going to find us Brenda,
          even with that smoke...Nobody's
          coming._.. You heard what Doug
          said-We're alone now, just you
          and me. Let them come, I'm waiting
          for them.
          Now, Bobby stretches the nylon wire from the fishing pole
          around each stake. He sets the fishing pole next to the
          trailer, rigging to it one of Catherine's TOY SHAKERS-
          An improvised alarm system.

          94 EXT. HILLS - DAY 94

          At the summit, somebody observes the trailer and the thick
          cloud of smoke rising to the air.

                         CUT TO:

          95 EXT. TOWN - DAY 95

          Doug runs down the hills towards the town. Behind him, from
          the mouth of the mine, someone observes between the rocks-
          it's Ruby.
          Doug slows his pace as he enters Main Street. The town is
          deserted. No sign of life anywhere. All the houses and cars
          are covered with a thick layer of dust.
          Taking a closer look, he realizes all the parked cars are
          from the 50's.
          Uncertain, Doug walks through the ghost town, with Beast at
          his side...
          No movement besides the wind blowing and lifting an
          occasional cloud of dust. Doug walks up to a house and knocks
          on the front door.
          No one to open the door. Doug wipes one of the windows-
          It's too dark inside to see anything. The door is unlocked,
          Doug pushes it.
          It squeaks open. He hesitates before entering.

          96 INT. FIRST HOUSE - DAY 96

          Sunlight passes through the dusty windows revealing a
          living/dining room decorated from the 50's.
          Doug can't believe his eyes-
          Through the kitchen door, he can see a woman doing dishes.
          A man sits in the living room reading a newspaper.
          Children play in front of the blank TV set...

          THESE ARE NOT REAL PEOPLE BUT MANNEQUINS!
          They have been dressed and placed into real life situations.

          THE ATOMIC SYMBOL CAN BE FOUND ON EACH OF THEIR FOREHEADS.
          Doug spots a telephone behind the staircase and checks for a
          dial tone.
          Nothing. He picks up the phone casing.

          EMPTY. JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE HOUSE, IT'S FARE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          97 EXT. TOWN - DAY 97

          Doug quickly crosses Main Street to visit another house.

          98 INT. SECOND HOUSE - DAY 98

          New interior- New surreal setting.
          Around a table, a family of test dummies eat dinner.

          99 EXT. TOWN - DAY 99

          Stupefied, Doug enters yet another house.
          The door remains open as we see another family of dummies
          living a perfect little life. A LIFE WHICH STOPPED IN THE

          LATE 50'S...
          Around the corner of a house, a little girl dummy is sitting
          on a swing, her face half broken.
          A second later, Doug thinks he hears CHILDREN LAUGHING. He

                         TURNS AROUND-
          Nothing but the wind blowing through the houses.
          Doug takes Catherine's bib from his pocket and lets Beast get
          its scent.

                         DOUG
          Find her, Beast, find Catherine...
          With his nose to the ground, the dog pulls Doug straight
          ahead.
          Doug walks away through the streets, pulled by the dog.
          On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the
          sand. On it, an old metallic sign reads-

          TEST SITE 3B - MILITARY ZONE - HIGH RADIATION RISK
          The scent leads Doug into an alley off the main street.
          He sees an old generator on full throttle. A thick smoke
          pours from the exhaust.

          SOMEONE LIVES HERE!
          His daughter could be there...

          85.

                         99 CONTINUED: 99
          Doug tries to see into the windows, but they are caked in
          filth. He decides to go around when-

          A MAN WALKS INTO VIEW WITHOUT SEEING HIM!
          Immediately, Doug backs away.
          The man drags a cadaver by its feet. Half of the dead body
          is missing, having apparently been torn off.
          Beast GROWLS.
          The man turns around, revealing his horrible face-
          A METALLIC BRACE is screwed on four sides of his head helping
          him stand straight. ENORMOUS CYSTS DISFIGURE HIM AND COVER
          EVERY VISIBLE PART OF HIS BODY. Let's call him "CYST".
          Cyst traces back his steps, trying to find what caused the
          noise. He holds the gas station attendant's shotgun!
          The alley is empty. The generators are still motoring.
          All seems normal. Cyst turns back towards main street.
          Cyst passes an old'parked car without seeing Doug and the dog
          hidden inside.
          Doug breathes a sigh of relief. Close call.
          Quietly, Doug gets out of the car. He hesitates as to whether
          he should bring Beast with him or to leave him in the car.
          The dog could be his best weapon but, on the other hand, he
          also represents a_bigger risk to be spotted.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (SOFTLY)
          You wait here Beast! Come on,
          sit!... Good boy. I'm gonna find
          Catherine...
          The dog is confused and whines through the half-opened
          window.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Shhhh... Quiet Beast... Don't move!
          I'll be back...
          He closes the car door and starts down the alley, lowering
          his head.

                         (CONTINUED)

          From inside the car, Beast watches Doug getting further
          away...
          Doug sneaks along the side of the building towards the front
          door.
          He hesitates, unsure of what awaits him inside-

          102 INT. HOUSE - DAY 102

          Doug crosses a doorway without making a sound. He enters the
          front hall squeezing the bat in his hands.
          Something in the air, A DISGUSTING SMELL, catches his
          attention. Doug moves slowly and discovers, in the dining
          room, sitting amongst the dummies-

          BIG BOB'S CHARRED BODY!
          His father-in-law's arms have been torn off and devoured. THE
          AMERICAN FLAG that used to adorn his SUV is planted THROUGH

          HIS FOREHEAD!
          Doug approaches terrified.

          BEHIND HIM A WEAK AND ASTHMATIC VOICE BEGINS TO SING THE

                         NATIONAL ANTHEM-

          VOICE (O.S.)
          "Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's
          early light,
          What so proudly we hailed at the
          twilight's last gleaming?"
          Doug jumps and quickly lifts the baseball bat, ready to
          swing.
          Nobody. Just the fake living room filled with inert dummies.
          No trace of his baby. An electrical fan turns in a corner,
          close to a shelve full of old books...
          Doug moves forward, gripping the bat tightly.

          VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          (feeble and asthmatic)
          "...Whose broad stripes and bright
          stars, through the perilous
          fight..."
          He can hear his own heart beat as he searches through the
          house. In another room, close to the window and in the
          shadows, he sees someone sitting in a wheelchair.

          VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          "...And the rockets' red glare, the
          bombs bursting in air..."
          Doug gets closer-
          A ray of light shines on the skull of whoever sits in the
          wheel chair.
          The wheel chair moves forward revealing a most horrific sight-
          BIG BRAIN - We recognize the handicapped man whom we have
          seen before, bathing behind the screen. Big Brain's body is
          skeletal. He was born with a genetic disease giving him a
          head ten times bigger than his face. A head so heavy, he is
          unable to hold it up. It rests back on his chair, forcing him
          to stretch his eyes to see from side to side.
          Big Brain is maybe the most representative character of the
          damage done by nuclear fallout in this area.
          Doug threatens him with the baseball bat-

                         DOUG
          Where's my baby! Where's
          Catherine?!
          Big Brain does not answer.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          What did you do with her?

                         BIG BRAIN

                         (MURMURING)
          ..Nothing..
          Doug is beyond his breaking point -

                         DOUG
          Where is she then? ANSWER ME!
          He raises the bat.

                         BIG BRAIN
          (weak and asthmatic)
          .I don't know where she is. I
          never leave this place...
          Big Brain moves away from the window wheeling himself to the
          couch. His hands are thin and pale, like a child's.

                         BIG BRAIN
          (weak and asthmatic)
          You people settled on our lands,
          you destroyed our homes, destroyed
          our silver mines. . .You 'ye made us
          what we've become!
          One day my father went into town
          begging for your help, and you know
          what the doctors did? They
          sterilized him like a dog!
          You thought that in the desert no
          one would see anything, or say
          anything, but the hills... The
          hills never forget...

                         DOUG
          I don't know what you're talking
          about. All I want is my daughter.
          Please...
          Big Brain remains silent.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          What do you want? Money? I can give
          you money... WHAT DO YOU WANT?

          Maybe a trailer? Yeah, a pretty
          trailer, just like yours.

                         DOUG
          Where are the others? Where is my
          baby?
          Big brain starts laughing a high pitched sound.

          IT'S BREAKFAST TIME!
          At the same moment-

          CRASH - PLUTO, THE DEFORMED BALD GIANT, PULVERIZES THE DOOR

          WITH AN AXE AND SMASHES INTO THE HOUSE!
          Like a wild animal, Pluto charges Doug, destroying everything
          in his path.
          Doug retreats in the living room, throwing the dummies at his
          assailant.
          The giant comes closer and closer.
          Dummies are chopped into pieces.
          Doug dodges away and tries to escape, using the stairs in the
          hallway but the giant grabs him by the feet and pulls him
          down...
          The axe swings through the air missing him by a hair each
          time.

          103 INT. 1950 CAR - DAY 103

          Sensing his master is in trouble, Beast jumps around inside
          the car trying to find an exit...
          The passenger window opening is too small for him to break
          out...

          104 INT. HOUSE - DAY 104

          Doug runs into another room, escaping from Pluto and his axe.
          Instinctively, he uses the first piece of furniture he can
          find, A CHEST, to block the door behind him. He looks
          desperately for an exit. No way out.
          The axe penetrates through the door. The chest won't be
          enough to hold back Pluto.
          Second axe blow- This time the axe tears up the boards of the
          door, allowing Pluto to stick his gruesome face inside.
          Seeing Doug trapped in the room, the bald giant begins to
          laugh stupidly before turning around and walking away.

           The house is now silent. No sign of the giant.
           With his heart pounding through his chest and the baseball
           bat in hand, Doug moves towards the half-broken door,.

          CRASH! - PLUTO EXPLODES THROUGH THE WALL, LANDING ON TOP OF

          DOUG!
          Doug loses his bat but slides away before the axe comes
          swinging down.
          Desperate, he picks up the bat and uses it as a shield. The
          axe splits it in half.
          Doug throws himself at Pluto plunging the splintered bat into
          his abdomen.
          The sharp piece of wood enters Pluto's stomach.
          Completely out of his mind, Pluto removes the piece of wood
          from his abdomen and beats Doug in the face with it, sending
          him across the room.
          Pluto lowers his head, charging Doug like a bull. Doug
          crashes into one of the walls.
          He can't even take a breath before the giant grabs him by the
          leg like a rag doll and throws him through a wall.
          Doug falls to the ground in the living room. Wounded and
          exhausted, he is also defenseless. He has lost his glasses.
          Not far away, Big Brain savors the spectacle.
          The giant walks to him spinning the axe in his hand like a
          baton.
          His foot crushes Doug's glasses on the floor.
          The axe swings through the air. Doug jumps out of the way.

                         ANOTHER SWING-

          THE AXE STRIKES INTO HIS LEFT HAND, CUTTING OFF SOME FINGERS!
          Doug stares wide eyed at his amputated fingers and screams
          with pain.
          Blood is everywhere.
          In an act of self preservation, Doug crawls under the table.

          Pluto destroys it with the axe and advances to finish him
          off.
          His asymmetrical eyes stare coldly-
          Doug is at his mercy.
          Pluto slowly caresses the axe's blade on his victims throat
          and face.
          The sharp blade moves dangerously across Doug's skin. Pluto
          stops when he sees Doug holding his PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER!
          Pluto laughs like a dumb child at the feeble weapon. Behind
          him, Big Brain joins in on the laughter-
          Disfigured by his wounds, Doug is frozen with the screwdriver
          pointed at the giant. He looks ridiculous and starts sobbing
          like a terrorized child.

                         DOUG
          Please, I'm begging you... Don't
          kill me...

          Loook at-t hiiis fa-ace... Loook at-
          at hiiis fa-ace...
          Even the frozen faces of the test dummies seem to mock him.

                         SUDDENLY-
          Doug stops crying_instantly, it was a trick!
          He turns the screwdriver around and slams it into Pluto's
          foot.
          The screwdriver goes through the shoe nailing Pluto to the
          floor. Pluto screams in pain.
          Doug rises and moves behind him. In a swift movement, Doug
          takes the American flag from Big Bob's forehead, stabbing
          Pluto in the back of the neck!

          OLD GLORY'S STAFF COMES THROUGH HIS THROAT ON THE OTHER SIDE.
          Pluto screams again, dropping the axe.
          Outraged, Pluto tears the flag from his neck and turns to
          Doug.

          DOUG IS HOLDING THE AXE.
          The blade swings through the air and slams into Pluto's
          skull!
          Pluto's eyes freeze and his body falls to the ground, his
          skull half open. DOUG JUMPS ON TOP OF HIM. FULL OF RAGE, HE

          MUTILATES PLUTO WITH THE AXE TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION.
          Big Brain watches Pluto die without showing any emotion.
          Silence returns to the destroyed house.
          Doug tears off a piece of Pluto's shirt and uses it as a
          BANDAGE for his hand...
          He picks up his half broken shattered glasses on the floor
          and put them back.
          SLING! - Doug removes the bloody axe from the corpse. He
          turns to Big Brain, who backs off-

          105 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 105

          The back door to the SUV opens, revealing Bobby and Brenda
          carrying Lynn's body inside where Ethel's body has been
          moved.
          Not far from the car and above the fishing pole, Catherine's
          shaker remains still and silent...

          106 EXT. TOWN - DAY 106

          Still imprisoned in the car, Beast barks, desperate to find a
          way out.
          A hundred yards away-
          Cyst crosses Main Street toward Big Brain's house still
          holding the shotgun.
          Through the broken door, Cyst spots Pluto in a pool of blood.
          Hatred fills his eyes as he loads the shotgun and prepares to
          shoot.

          He looks for Doug but sees no one.
          Cyst moves in between a few cars, failing to see Doug hiding
          behind one of them.
          Doug hits the man in his knee with the axe.
          HE SEVERS HALF OF HIS RIGHT LEG. Cyst screams in agony.
          In one swift move, Doug removes the axe from Cyst's kneecap
          swinging it into his back.
          Cyst falls on the ground.
          The fall pushes the axe further into his back. Cyst reaches
          for the shotgun lost in his fall.
          Doug steps on his chest and pushes slowly-
          Crack - The axe finally hits the spine, killing him
          instantly.
          Doug picks up the shotgun.

          107 INT. HOUSE - DAY 107

          From the broken window, Big Brain watches Doug walk away
          down Main Street. He picks up a walkie-talkie hidden in his

                         WHEELCHAIR-

                         BIG BRAIN
          Lizard... Kill the baby...

          108 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 108

          Lizard enters the house holding a MACHETE. The wound Lynn had
          given him before she died still bleeds through his improvised
          bandage.
          He moves to the kitchen with a limp. There, he comes face to
          face with Ruby. Behind her, the baby is wrapped inside a
          blanket on the table.
          The kitchen walls are covered with dry blood. Severed human
          remains are scattered about and hanging like slabs of meat.
          Ruby blocks his way-

                         LIZARD
          Get out of the way Ruby...

          Ruby refuses to let him pass. Lizard lifts the machete
          threatening his little sister.

                         LIZARD (CONT'D)

          I TOLD YOU TO MOVE. NOW MOVE!
          Scared, Ruby obeys and runs out the kitchen door. Lizard
          approaches the baby, who moves inside the blanket.

          109 INT. LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT- DAY 109

          At the same time, Doug arrives at the last house on the
          street.
          He looks for his baby in every part of the house.
          Nothing but dummies.
          Doug enters a room and sees a crib.

                         DOUG
          Catherine?!
          He goes to the crib and discovers a plastic doll...

          BIG BRAIN LIED!

                         (INNOCENT)
          You want to play with us mister?
          Doug turns around and sees two children playing in the
          shadows. They smile at him kindly-

          THEIR FACES AND LITTLE BODIES ARE MONSTROUSLY DEGENERATED!
          Doug backs away terrified.

          110 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 110

          Lizard is about to butcher the baby on the table.
          Catherine is calm and moves slowly under the blanket.

          111 EXT. TOWN - DAY 111

          In a panic, Doug runs out of the last house screaming.

                         DOUG

          CATHERINE!

          112 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 112

          Lizard lifts the machete and removes the blanket-

          THE BABY HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE PIGLET STOLEN FROM THE GAS

          STATION!
          Ruby made the swap before Lizard entered the kitchen.
          The piglet runs off oinking...

                         LIZARD

          RUUUBY!
          Enraged, Lizard sticks the machete into the table.

          113 EXT. HILLS - DAY 113

          Outside, with the baby in her arms, Ruby runs as fast as she
          can.

          114 EXT. TOWN - DAY 114

          Desperate, Doug runs through the test town looking for his
          daughter.
          In an upstairs window, he sees Ruby's mother, THE OBESE
          WOMAN, swinging on a rocking chair staring back.
          Suddenly, coming from the hills, Doug hears the sound of a
          baby crying. In the distance, he spots Ruby running through
          the rocks. He runs with the shotgun in hand.

                         DOUG
          Catherine!

          115 EXT./INT. 1950 CAR - DAY 115

          Under the fake car, in between the seats, Beast finds a hole
          big enough to fit his nose.
          The animal forces his way through, scratching at the floor
          until he finally fits his body through the hole and out of
          the car.
          The dog runs down Main Street...

          Sweating, Bobby joins his sister hidden behind the SW. With
          the 9mm in hand, staring at the horizon, he is ready to face
          the enemy.
          Above the fishing pole, Catherine's shaker is still.
          Gust of wind blow on the eerily silent plains.
          Suddenly, in a flash, the fishing line tightens and THE

          SHAKER MOVES AROUND, MAKING NOISE.
          Then, quiet returns as if nothing had ever happened.
          Brenda is terrified. Maybe someone has crossed their zone of
          security.
          Bobby Lifts his head and looks a full 360Â°-

          NOTHING.
          Bobby and Brenda exchange worried glances when-

          THE FISHING POLE MOVES, SHAKING CATHERINE'S SHAKER

          FRENETICALLY.
          The fishing reel quickly unwinds...
          This time there is little room for doubt, even if all seems
          clear around the camper.

          From inside the SW, we see the two adolescents getting
          further away when-

          A DARK FIGURE JUMPS IN THE FOREGROUND, IN FRONT OF THE

          It's PAPA JUPITER. His long hair and thick beard cover
          everything except his determined and PSYCHOPATHIC EYES.

          zone...

          Further ahead, on the ground, a tumbleweed is stuck on the

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
          Let's go back...
          Not convinced, Bobby agrees, but his face freezes when he
          turns back to see- THE BACK DOOR OF THE SUV, WIDE OPEN.
          At a loss, Bobby and Brenda return.

          THEIR MOTHER'S BODY HAS BEEN REMOVED!

          The new "visitor" has brought the nightmare back to life in

          Terrorized, Brenda backs up to the trailer, while her
          brother, with a determined look on his face, walks to the

          Through the window, she watches her brother get further out.

          What Bobby discovers behind the rocks is beyond horrific-
          Kneeling next to his mother's corpse, Papa Jupiter devours
          her heart, tearing into it with his teeth. FEELING BOBBY'S

          PRESENCE, HE TURNS AROUND AND STARES AT THE YOUNG MAN WITH A

          SADISTIC SMILE. BLOOD DRIPS DOWN HIS BEARD.
          Bobby points his gun at him.
          Papa Jupiter stands and, in a fit of rage, charges at Bobby.
          Keeping his cool, Bobby fires-
          BANG! BANG! BANG! The bullets only slow him down.
          CLICK! The gun is empty.

          Papa Jupiter is right behind him.
          He takes a SMALL PICKAXE from his belt and throws it at

          Bobby enters the trailer, closing the door behind him. He
          quickly tapes matches at the bottom of the door, right above
          the striking part of the matchbox on the floor.
          Next to him, the propane flows freely.

          At the same time, Papa Jupiter stands in front of the trailer
          door, relishing the idea that his victims are inside.
          He opens the door. The matches strike-

          PAPA JUPITER IS ENGULFED IN THE FLAMES.

          The road on the edge comes to a dead end.
          Ruby is stuck, the only way out is to climb. Without using
          her hands, she attempts to ascend. It's close to impossible.

          SUDDENLY, LIZARD GRABS HER ANKLE!
          She tries to fight him off, but he is too strong.
          Ruby kicks him in the jaw enraging him more. He pulls her
          down swiftly when-

          BEAST APPEARS BEHIND RUBY!

          Lizard is amused and almost excited with this last

          while keeping his eyes on the barking German Shepherd.

          THE RUSTY, RETRACTABLE SPIKES ARE RELEASED ALONG THE CHAIN!
          Beast sees the weapon and leaps towards Lizard.
          Too late. The chain strikes the dog in the air, sending him
          over the edge.

          BEAST WHINES AS HE LANDS ON A PROTRUDING SECTION OF THE

          RAVINE A FEW FEET FURTHER DOWN...

          With no time to react, Lizard is brutally struck in the face

          DOUG IS BACK!
          Taking no chances and screaming like a wild beast, Doug beats
          Lizard repeatedly pushing him away from the baby.
          With a bloodied face, Lizard can hardly stand.
          Doug turns the weapon around and-
          BANG! - He shoots Lizard in the chest.
          Lizard is thrown back with the force.
          Doug reloads still screaming-
          BANG! Lizard is hit in the throat and falls.to his knees.
          Blood sprays everywhere.
          Doug reloads again-
          BANG! - hit in the shoulder, Lizard falls back in the dirt.
          His face slams into the dust.
          Exhausted, Doug walks over to his adversary.
          He is dead.
          Disfigured with wounds, Doug turns to Ruby, who extends the

          He kisses the baby and hugs her tightly, elated. Ruby is
          moved. She smiles when suddenly her face freezes-

          LIZARD STANDS FIFTEEN FEET BEHIND, HOLDING THE SHOTGUN!
          Trembling, he lifts the weapon towards Doug and the baby.
          Instinctively, Ruby moves to stop him.
          KA-CHUNK! - Lizard reloads.
          His finger squeezes the trigger.

          BANG!
          At the last second, Ruby jumps on Lizard changing the
          direction of the blast.
          They both fall off the mountain into the emptiness. Their
          bodies plunge a hundred feet down, splattering on the rocks

          Pieces of the trailer still burn in the middle of the desert.
          Surrounded by debris, Papa Jupiter's body is impaled.on a

          Come on, Bobby. Let's get out of
          here...
          Bobby's face has changed. He is no longer the innocent kid of
          just a few hours ago. His eyes are now filled with rage and a
          determination to survive and succeed no matter what.
          Brenda and Bobby walk away from the burning trailer. On the
          other side of the smoke, they see-

          DOUG WALKING BACK WITH THE BABY, BEAST LIMPING AT HIS SIDE.
          Exhausted, wounded, disfigured, but still alive.

          131 EXT. HILLS - DAY 131

          From a distance, next to the fiery trailer, we see Doug,
          Brenda, and Bobby gathered around the baby. Reunited again.

          FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE HILLS, SOMEONE OBSERVES THEM WITH

          BINOCULARS.

                         THE END
