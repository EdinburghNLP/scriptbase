FADE IN
<p>THE CREDITS:</p>
<p>Which are SUPERIMPOSED OVER a SCENE of almost unnatural<br/>
beauty. A thickly wooded forest which practically shut out<br/>
the sunlight. All is not serene however. SHOTS RING Out --<br/>
and we are privy to a running battle between a German patrol<br/>
and a band of Russian soldiers. It is a desperate fight --<br/>
and several bodies fall. we see the faces of several men<br/>
whose identity we will learn later. The shooting is still<br/>
going on when the CREDITS come to an END. Then -- </p>
<h3>1. THE SLOPE OF A HILL - DAY</h3>
<p>The CAMERA is MOVING SLOWLY up the hill. The verdancy of<br/>
the hill, the intermittent clusters of daisies and dandelions<br/>
are evidence of the season -- late Spring. Now the crest of<br/>
the hill is in sight; above it a patch of blue sky is<br/>
visible. The mood is pastoral, peaceful.</p>
<p>The CAMERA reaches the crest -- and suddenly a pair of highly<br/>
polished boots almost fills the SCREEN. The CAMERA comes<br/>
to an abrupt HALT. Then SLOWLY, the CAMERA PANS UP from the<br/>
boots to take in a carefully tailored German officer's uniform<br/>
and then the face of the German officer -- CAPTAIN STRANSKY.<br/>
It is a longish face with a high forehead and light blue<br/>
eyes. It is a face that gives an impression of extreme<br/>
forcefulness, an impression underlined by the thin - lipped<br/>
mouth and angular chin. His hair is white at the temples,<br/>
emphasizing by contrast the healthy tan of his face.</p>
<p>At the moment, Captain Stransky is gazing through a stereo-<br/>
telescope. His expression is grim. Behind the Captain<br/>
stands LIEUTENANT MEYER, a youngish, good-natured face.<br/>
However, it is apparent from his expression that he has<br/>
no great liking for his Captain. His lips are tight as<br/>
the Captain moves the knobs of the telescope with long thin<br/>
fingers. Captain Stransky straightens up, locks back at<br/>
Lieutenant Meyer, whose expression quickly changes to one<br/>
of impassivity. Stransky, whose demeanor is angry, says<br/>
nothing, but turns to peer again through the telescope.</p>
<h3>2. VIEW THROUGH TELESCOPE  WHAT CAPTAIN STRANSKY SEES</h3>
<p>A patch of woods, about a square mile in area.</p>
<h3>3. MED. SHOT  STRANSKY AND MEYER<br/>
</h3>
<p>Stransky straightens up.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(angrily)<br/>
Incredible -- sheer stupidity.<br/>
Those woods should have been<br/>
cut down or destroyed by fire.</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
Excuse me, sir, but we retreated<br/>
too hastily for any such luxury.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I disagree. It was an irreparable<br/>
oversight, and I shall send a report<br/>
to that effect to Regiment.<br/>
(looks at the woods,<br/>
reaches for cigarette case )<br/>
Do you think the Russians are<br/>
already in those woods?<br/>
(offers Meyer a cigarette)</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
Thank you. We'II know soon enough.<br/>
Corporal Steiner is on a recconnai<br/>
sance patrol.</p>
<p>Stransky drops his cigarette butt, steps on it.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Reconnaissance patrols have a way<br/>
of not returning.</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
Steiner will be back.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(angrily)<br/>
I did not ask your opinion Herr<br/>
Meyer.</p>
<p>Meyer says nothing. We can see that he regrets his impu<br/>
dence. With a mixture of anxiety and curiosity, he waits<br/>
to see what will happen next.</p>
<p>The ANGLE WIDENS to TAKE IN a PRIVATE who walks up to the<br/>
Captain, salutes.</p>
<p><b>PRIVATE</b><br/>
Captain Stransky? Lieutenant<br/>
Colonel Brandt Would like to see<br/>
you at headquarters.</p>
<p>Stransky nods, gazes sharply at Meyer, walks off, the<br/>
CAMERA TRUCKING with him. All about him are SCENES of<br/>
great activity. MEN are digging bunkers and preparing<br/>
positions. SHOUTS fill the air. As Stransky passes,<br/>
he is greeted by salutes which he acknowledges with the<br/>
briefest of nods.</p>
<h3>4. EXT. REGIMENTAL BUNKER</h3>
<p>An armed GUARD is on duty. He salutes smartly as .Captain<br/>
Stransky comes INTO SCENE, returns the salute without<br/>
looking at the Guard, ENTERS the bunker.</p>
<h3>5. INT. BUNKER  TWO OFFICERS</h3>
<p>are examining a map that hangs on the wall. The older of<br/>
the two is LIEUTENANT COLONEL BRANDT. About fiftytwo,<br/>
a gaunt gray face. The younger officer is a CAPTAIN. In<br/>
his middle thirties, a tired expression, but his features<br/>
are intelligent. At the moment, he is Shaking his head.</p>
<p><b>CAPTAIN</b><br/>
If our main line of resistance is<br/>
at Novorssysk, What are We doing<br/>
do‚—nhere?</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(shrugging)<br/>
We're playing fire department.</p>
<p><b>CAPTAIN</b><br/>
Several hundred miles from the heart<br/>
of the fire? Does that make sense?</p>
<p>The door opens and a CORPORAL announces:</p>
<p><b>CORPORAL</b><br/>
Captain Stransky.</p>
<p>Stransky APPEARS on the threshold.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Come in, Captain. You know my<br/>
adjutant, of course.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Of course. How are you, Captain<br/>
Kiesel?</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Awful. Terrible. How are you?</p>
<p>Brandt laughs, Places a bottle of wine on the table.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
This might cheer you up, Kiesel.</p>
<p>Stransky inspects the label.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
My respects, Colonel Brandt.<br/>
Producing a 1937 Moselle in the<br/>
southernmost corner of Russia.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(fills glasses)<br/>
A bottle of Moselle is no more<br/>
absurd in this region than We<br/>
ourselves. Your health, gentlemen.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
I am not going to drink to my health.<br/>
My health is terrible and doesn't<br/>
deserve to be drunk to.<br/>
(holds up his glass)<br/>
To the end of the damn war.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Incidentally, Colonel, why does our<br/>
presence in the bridgehead strike<br/>
you as so absurd?</p>
<p>Brandt looks at Kiesel, then turns to Stransky.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(ignoring the question)<br/>
Captain,<br/>
Why did you ask to be trans<br/>
ferred from France?</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(laughs)<br/>
Exactly what my commanding officer<br/>
in France asked me. I can't stop<br/>
you, he Said, Since I'm convinced<br/>
that without you the eastern front<br/>
would collapse in a matter of days.<br/>
Go ahead, you heroic fathead.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
(quickly)<br/>
I withdraw my toast to the end of<br/>
the war. To heroic fatheads<br/>
everywhere.</p>
<p>Stransky doesn't know quite how to take this, but decides<br/>
on a faint, icy smile.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Captain Stransky, is there any<br/>
news on Steiner?</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
No, sir, not yet.</p>
<p>Brandt shakes his head.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Incidentally, What sort is he,<br/>
Steiner?</p>
<p>Kiesel looks at Stransky closely.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
A problem....no respect, but a<br/>
first rate soldier  so one looks<br/>
the Other Way.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(a short laugh)<br/>
0f course, I've only been on this<br/>
front a few days, matter of hours<br/>
actually, but I see -- rather I<br/>
sense -- a sort of -- well, it's not<br/>
exactly insubordination -- Well, let's<br/>
call it -- a lack of respect.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
If I hope into a cab which gets<br/>
into an accident because the brakes<br/>
fail, I blame the driver, not the<br/>
company he works for. I'll say<br/>
that he should have refused to drive<br/>
a cab with defective brakes.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I'm not sure I know What you mean<br/>
by that.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
(looks at him a moment,<br/>
then easily)<br/>
I don't intend to discuss polities.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(angry)<br/>
You talk avout lack of respect --<br/>
low morale..... it goes hand in hand<br/>
with impending defeat.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Defeat? I refuse to admit that<br/>
possibility.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
(dryly)<br/>
We'll, said, Captain.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I don't believe that the German<br/>
soldier --</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
The German soldier!<br/>
(laughs mirthlessly)<br/>
In the early years they saw the<br/>
retreating backs of the Russians<br/>
too often to be frightened by his<br/>
face now. The replacements, on<br/>
the other hand, think every Russian<br/>
is an infallible fighting machine.<br/>
I feel damn sorry for our poor land<br/>
sers.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(frigidly)<br/>
In the present state of our nation,<br/>
such talk borders on treason. I<br/>
am a soldier and as such it is my<br/>
duty to subordinate my own ideas<br/>
to the interests of my country.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
(Smiles easily as he<br/>
lifts glass)<br/>
We are still doing our duty,<br/>
Captain Stransky.</p>
<p>Stransky, his face white, glares at Kiesel.</p>
<p>The PHONE has been RINGING. Brandt picks it up with a<br/>
Snap.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Yes? -- What? -- Good, Meyer.<br/>
Wonderful. What sort of shape<br/>
are they in? -- I see.<br/>
(hangs up)<br/>
Lieutenant Meyer. Steiner is back.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Of course.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Naturally, I'd like to talk to him.<br/>
I intend to promote him to Senior<br/>
Sergeant on the spot.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
(wryly)<br/>
Most generous of you.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(saluting)<br/>
If you'll excuse me.</p>
<p>Brandt nods. Stransky LEAVES. There is a moment's silence.</p>
<h3>6. CLOSE SHOT  BRANDT AND KIESEL</h3>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Well, what do you think of our<br/>
Captain?</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
(a moment's thought)<br/>
Must have the most expensive<br/>
tailor in Berlin.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
And, of course, he won't rest until<br/>
he gets the Iron Cross.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
(toasts)<br/>
Gets......not earns?</p>
<p>Brandt, who has lifted the wine bottle, finds it empty.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Oh, to hell with Stransky and<br/>
the Iron Cross. And you, too,<br/>
Kiesel.</p>
<p>They smile at each other grimply.</p>
<p>DISSOLVET0:</p>
<h3>7. LIEUTENANT MEYER</h3>
<p>Pacing back and forth in a trench, outside of a bunker<br/>
door. Occasionally he steals a glance at a group of men<br/>
who are slumped in various indolent positions on the floor<br/>
of the trench.</p>
<h3>8. FULL SHOT  THE GROUP OF MEN</h3>
<p>The CAMERA PANS SLOWLY from face to face. There are<br/>
nine men in the group (all will be identified later indi<br/>
visually). At the moment, all look exhausted, dirty and<br/>
somewhat disgusted. The men, with the exception of two,<br/>
PASTERNACK and ANSELM, are in the same age range (about<br/>
25 to 30). Pasternack and Anselm are younger. SCHNUR<br/>
BART is distinguished by a heavy beard. KRUGER by a<br/>
tough weather  beaten visage. DORN has the look of an<br/>
intellectual. STEINER'S extreme gauntness is what catches<br/>
the eyes. His face is expressionless. The others,<br/>
MAAG, HOLLERBACH and KERN are nondescript, runofthemill<br/>
faces.</p>
<p>Meyer walks past the men in silence. They do not pay too<br/>
much attention to him. Several are smoking cigarettes.<br/>
Meyer looks toward the bunker. The CAMERA, following his<br/>
gaze, MOVES TOWARD the bunker.</p>
<h3>9. INT. BUNKER  LIEUTENANT TRIEBIG</h3>
<p>is seated at the table. He is a very young, very handsome,<br/>
officer. An orderly. KEPPLER, is busy at a hot plate with<br/>
a coffee pot. He, too, is very young. After a moment --</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Is it very hot? Captain Stransky<br/>
won't stand for anything but hot<br/>
coffee.</p>
<p><b>KEPPLER</b><br/>
It is practically scalding, sir.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Good.</p>
<p><b>KEPPLER</b><br/>
Is there anything else you wish,<br/>
sir?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Not at the moment.</p>
<p>As Keppler starts out:</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Just a minute. You can keep me<br/>
company for awhile. I really<br/>
hardly know you. Sit down some <br/>
where.</p>
<p>Keppler looks around uncertainly. Triebig is sitting in the<br/>
one and only chair.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Sit on the bed. Are you always<br/>
so timid?</p>
<p><b>KEPPLER</b><br/>
(with a shaky Smile)<br/>
No.</p>
<p>He perches on the extreme edge of the narrow bed. Triebig<br/>
studies him. Keppler's habitual expression is one of<br/>
helplessness, accentuated by a mouth he keeps permanently<br/>
slightly open.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Where do you come from?</p>
<p><b>KEPPLER</b><br/>
Frankfurt, sir.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Is that so? I know Frankfurt quite<br/>
well.<br/>
(sits on the cot<br/>
beside Keppler)<br/>
If you get along with me, you'll<br/>
have a good life here. You may go<br/>
now. Come to my bunker tonight<br/>
and arrange my gear.</p>
<p><b>KEPPLER</b><br/>
(jumping enthusiastically<br/>
to his feet)<br/>
Yes, sir. When shall I come, sir?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Don't come too early. Around ten.<br/>
We'll have a chance to talk.<br/>
Do your best and I'm sure I shall<br/>
be satisfied with you.</p>
<p>Keppler salutes and GOES.</p>
<h3>10. EXT. BUNKER</h3>
<p>as Triebig COMES OUT. The men are watching Keppler as he<br/>
WALKS OFF.</p>

	<h3>11. MED. SHOT  SCHNURRBART AND ANSELM</h3>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Not a very robust type, would you<br/>
say?</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(the youngest of the<br/>
group)<br/>
Well, Schnurrbart, you're so excessively<br/>
masculine, it evens things up.</p>
<p>The CAMERA PANS to Triebig. He seems to sense what the men<br/>
are thinking. A bit disconcerted, he turns to Meyer.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(sardonically)<br/>
Do you think we can get them to<br/>
Stand at attention when the Captain<br/>
gets here?</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
(grins)<br/>
I don't know, Lieutenant. I'll put<br/>
it up to them, man to man.</p>
<p>There is some half  hearted laughter from the men. Steiner<br/>
is noticeably quiet.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
I'm not getting up till they want<br/>
my Signature On the Peace Treaty.</p>
<p>But he gees someone approaching, and slowly he starts to<br/>
his feet.</p>
<h3>12. STRANSKY</h3>
<p>approaching the trench. In the b.g. the men CAN BE SEEN<br/>
reluctantly getting to their feet. Triebig snaps to attention<br/>
as Stransky comes in.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(a Smart salute)<br/>
Captain.</p>
<p>Stransky, barely nodding to Triebig, looks over the men, no<br/>
discernible expression on his face. Finally --</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Which one is Corporal Steiner?</p>
<p>Steiner takes a step forward, slackly comes to attention.<br/>
Stransky studies him -- disappointed.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
You are Corporal Steiner?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(almost nonchalantly)<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
(pause)<br/>
I am Corporal Steiner.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I had formed a -- somewhat different<br/>
picture of you.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(unconcern in his<br/>
face)<br/>
I'm sorry if I disappoint the Captain.</p>
<p>In the b.g. several of the men permit themselves slight<br/>
smiles, which fade immediately at a glance from Triebig.<br/>
Stransky looks at Steiner again.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(loudly)<br/>
You are promoted to Senior Sergeant,<br/>
promotion to be effective at once.</p>
<p>He watches Steiner's face. It is as if he had spoken to<br/>
a tree. There is no surprise in Steiner's face; only a<br/>
slight flexing of his arms indicates that he has heard at<br/>
all.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
You heard me, Corporal -- Sergeant<br/>
Steiner.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Yes, sir.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Your promotion doesn't seem to have<br/>
made much impression upon you.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
No, sir.</p>
<p>There is an involuntary giggle from young Anselm. Stransky<br/>
glares and there is silence.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(to Lieutenants Meyer<br/>
and Triebig)<br/>
Come in -- you, too, Sergeant.</p>
<p>He starts down the steps to his bunker, Meyer, Triebig<br/>
and Steiner following.</p>
<h3>13. OMITTED</h3>
<h3>14. INT. STRANSKY'S BUNKER  STRANSKY</h3>
<p>is seated behind a table. Steiner, Meyer and Triebig,<br/>
slightly to the side of him, stand facing Stransky, who<br/>
has taken out an elaborate cigarette case. He extends<br/>
it to Meyer who takes a cigarette.</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
Thank you, Captain.</p>
<p>Stransky offers a cigarette to Steiner.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
No, thank you, Sir.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(lighting his cigarette)<br/>
After what you've been through,<br/>
you don't feel the need of a cigarette?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
No at this particular moment -- sir.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I'm ready for your report.</p>
<p>He reaches into pocket, lays sheaf of crushed papers on the<br/>
table. Stransky looks at him in amazement.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I'd like to hear the gist of your<br/>
report.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Lots of<br/>
Russians. Lots of guns.<br/>
(grimly)<br/>
We should be hearing from them very<br/>
soon.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
What about your platoon -- any<br/>
casualties?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Two killed. One missing.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Two killed. How?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(dryly)<br/>
Bullets.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(flushing angrily)<br/>
I deduced that. That missing man --<br/>
did you look for him, Steiner?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(shrugs impatiently)<br/>
We had no time to lose. It would<br/>
have been irresponsible to risk the<br/>
safety of the entire platoon for<br/>
the sake of one man.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
There ought not to be a missing man<br/>
in Such a case.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(no expression)<br/>
Sorry, sir. I'll try to do better<br/>
next time.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(grimly; after a<br/>
moment)<br/>
I have the feeling, Sergeant, that<br/>
you somewhat overestimate your<br/>
importance.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(eyes darken; but no<br/>
change in voice)<br/>
At the moment, I am free of any<br/>
such illusions.</p>
<p>The two men look at each other; then Stransky's eyes fall<br/>
on the tommy gun Steiner holds in his hand.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
That's not a German gun.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
No, sir It's all in the report.<br/>
We surprised a Russian platoon --<br/>
and when they ran, they left<br/>
their guns.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Oh, captured material. Good.<br/>
Where is your gun?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
We couldn't carry both, so we left<br/>
ours.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
What! You left your guns for the<br/>
Russians!</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(quietly)<br/>
Yes, sir. Our guns for the Russians.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
That I cannot understand. You<br/>
must be aware that the quality of<br/>
our arms is far superior to that<br/>
of the Russians and --</p>
<p>He stops as Steiner shakes his head. Stransky raises his<br/>
eyebrows.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
...the Russian guns are better!</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(sharply)<br/>
That is stupid, loose talk. You<br/>
have every reason to be grateful<br/>
for the fine equipment the Father <br/>
land puts into your hands at the<br/>
cost of countless sacrifices.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(cannot suppress a<br/>
mirthless grin)<br/>
I never asked then to put the stuff<br/>
in my hands,</p>
<p>Meyer looks toward heaven. Stransky takes a deep breath.</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
(hastily)<br/>
sir, Sergeant Steiner is greatly<br/>
in need of sleep. I'm positive<br/>
that When he --</p>
<p>Stransky cuts him short by turning his back in a gesture of<br/>
dismissal. Meyer motions for Steiner to follow him.</p>
<h3>15. EXT. BUNKER  THE MEN</h3>
<p>jump to their feet as they see Steiner and Meyer.</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
Be careful<br/>
he's taken strong dislike<br/>
to you.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(wryly)<br/>
Too bad. I'm crazy about him.</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
He can be trouble...</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(laconically)<br/>
I've survived many a battalion<br/>
commander. I'll survive Stransky,<br/>
too.</p>
<h3>16. INT. BUNKER  STRANSKY AND TRIEBIG</h3>
<p>at his desk, coffee cup in hand, sipping.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Dammit. This coffee is cold.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Sorry, sir. It was heated not too<br/>
long ago</p>
<p>There is a LOUD EXPLOSION as a shell lands nearby.</p>
<p>The near miss has shaken up the bunker. Lieutenant Triebig<br/>
is righting a table that has overturned. Captain Stransky,<br/>
girm  faced, is dusting off his uniform.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(placing some papers<br/>
on the table; feeble<br/>
smile)<br/>
Too close for comfort, I should say,<br/>
Captain.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
How many more papers are there for<br/>
me to sign?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Quite a few, I'm afraid.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(sitting down; crossly)<br/>
Let me have the junk.</p>
<p>As he glances through the papers and signs his name. Triebig<br/>
watches him with his soft eyes, the smile remaining fixed<br/>
on his face. As Stransky finishes signing he looks up,<br/>
sniffs the air, looks at Triebig rather strangely.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
That isn't perfume I smell -- is it?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Oh, no, Captain --<br/>
(apologetically)<br/>
Just a bit of after shave lotion.<br/>
It -- bucks me up.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I see.</p>
<p>He fixes his gaze upon Triebig whose smile fades under the<br/>
scrutiny. Then, Stransky's manner changes suddenly. He<br/>
gestures toward a chair, tries to inject a cordial note<br/>
into his voice.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(offering him a<br/>
cigarette)<br/>
Where were you stationed before<br/>
you joined the battalion?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(voice softening)<br/>
In the south of France -- Bordeaux.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Ah! Then being transferred must<br/>
have come hare, eh?<br/>
(voice casual)<br/>
Why were you transferred anyway?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(after a moment's<br/>
Silence)<br/>
I voluntarily applied for a transfer,<br/>
sir.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(suspiciously)<br/>
How interesting.</p>
<p>There is mounting apprehension in Triebig's face as Stransky<br/>
regards him fixedly. Then again there is a sudden change in<br/>
Stransky's expression. Again it becomes friendly -- to Triebig's<br/>
great relief.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
We lived in real mansions right On<br/>
the beach. Swimming at any hour,<br/>
day or night. It was indescribable<br/>
-- the sea, the palms, the beaches,<br/>
the people, everything --</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by his memories, he stops. Stransky is surprised<br/>
to see him swallow with emotion.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(a knowing smile;<br/>
winks)<br/>
The women, you mean.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(raising his head�j<br/>
I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I said, the women. I mean -- in<br/>
referring to the people -- you meant,<br/>
of course, the women?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(shrugging)<br/>
Not so much that. I am -- that is--<br/>
(suddenly confused)<br/>
I didn't have much time to think<br/>
about women.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(casually)<br/>
Do you like soldiering?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(emphatically)<br/>
Certainly.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(nods patronizingly)<br/>
I'm glad to hear that.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
It's like living in an altogether<br/>
different world.</p>
<p>The Candle hag burned down. Stransky rises to light another.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
It is indeed a very different<br/>
world. A world of danger and a<br/>
world of men, a world without women.<br/>
(laughs; puffs, gets<br/>
thoughtful)<br/>
men can get along without<br/>
women. I tell you, man's truly<br/>
natural destiny is not to breed<br/>
children, but to be free, to rule<br/>
and fight -- in other words, to<br/>
lead a man's existence....<br/>
women are no more than a fancy,<br/>
a superfluous dessert.<br/>
(blows a smoke ring;<br/>
looks at Triebig)<br/>
Or do you disagree?</p>
<p>Triebig looks at Stransky in some confusion. What is Stransky<br/>
getting at. Then he gets a grip on himself. Intertwining<br/>
his fingers, he regards his thumb thoughtfully.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
I don't think I disagree, sir.<br/>
(after some<br/>
hesitation)<br/>
I think that if I have to I Can<br/>
live without women.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I'm pleased to hear that.</p>
<p>He studies the burning tip of his cigarette; then looks up<br/>
quickly.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
In other words, you prefer the company<br/>
of a man to that of a woman?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(greatly troubled<br/>
now)<br/>
It depends on the situation.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Really?</p>
<p>Stransky smiles. Triebig does not reply.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
If it will help you, I will put<br/>
your thoughts into words for you.<br/>
(smilebroadens)<br/>
You prefer the society of men to<br/>
that of women in any and all<br/>
situations.</p>
<p>The words hang in the silence of the bunker. Triebig re-<br/>
treats into himself like a snail sealing itself up in its<br/>
shell. He stares with mingled fear, assent and hope at<br/>
Stransky's face which still registers nothing but friendly<br/>
assent. Then, afraid silence might be interpreted as<br/>
agreement, he murmurs...</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
I -- don't understand, sir --</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(smiles confidentially)<br/>
Let's drop the hide and seek. By<br/>
God, Triebig, you don't have to<br/>
put up a front with me of all<br/>
people. What I said is true,<br/>
isn't it? Say yes, man, for heaven's<br/>
sake.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(with the air of a<br/>
man wanting to stop<br/>
himself; in a bare<br/>
whisper)<br/>
Yes.</p>
<p>Stransky springs to his feet, directly in front of him.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Speak up! You said yes. You said<br/>
yes. didn't you? Don't you dare<br/>
lie to my face.</p>
<p>At the sight of Stransky's enraged face, only a few inches<br/>
from his own, Triebig closes his eyes in horror. Stransky<br/>
shakes him.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(feebly)<br/>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(releasing him;<br/>
stepping back)<br/>
Stand up!</p>
<p>Trembling, Triebig obeys. Slowly, Stransky looks him up<br/>
and down.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I can assure you of this! If<br/>
I catch you trying any of that<br/>
stuff, I'll have you hanged,<br/>
remember that! Before all the<br/>
men! Do you understand that?<br/>
Do you hear me?</p>
<p>Triebig is unable to answer.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Now get the hell out of here and<br/>
keep out of my sight for the next<br/>
twenty-four hours. You turn my<br/>
stomach.</p>
<p>Triebig stands immobile.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Get out!</p>
<p>For a second Triebig looks at Stransky's distorted face.<br/>
Then he wheels around, stumbles across the threshold I end<br/>
VANISHES. Stransky remains in the same spot for a moment,<br/>
then he fishes for a cigarette, smiles. He is satisfied<br/>
with the picture of the complete military, masculine image<br/>
he has presented.</p>
<p>DISSOLVETO:</p>
<p>Steiner walking  watching men digging in, goes into<br/>
Brandt's bunker after looking up at the sky for a long moment.</p>

	<h3>17. BUNKER  COL. BRANDT</h3>
<p>The door opens and Steiner COMES IN. The scowl leaves<br/>
Brandt's face. He strides forward to meet Steiner;<br/>
presses his hand vigorously.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
So here are you -- unpunctual and<br/>
unsoldierly as ever.</p>
<p>He laughs and propels Steiner toward a chair.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(laughs)<br/>
I read your report. It's enormously<br/>
valuable. I intend to transmit it<br/>
personally to the General -- Ah,<br/>
one thing. Captain Stransky has<br/>
sent in an official complaint about<br/>
the guns. What have you to say to<br/>
that?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(stolidly)<br/>
What can I Say? I threw away German<br/>
guns to make room for Russian guns.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Why?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
The Russian guns are better. I know<br/>
it. You know it. The men know it.<br/>
Captain Stransky seems somewhat in<br/>
the dark.</p>
<p>Brandt looks at him.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
You're a fresh bastard, aren't<br/>
you?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Brandt looks at Steiner and crumples Stransky's report. He<br/>
offers Steiner a cigarette.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Last month I offered to pull<br/>
you out of the line and give<br/>
you a staff post?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Yes, sir --- and I remember refusing.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
....something about your feeling of<br/>
solidarity with your men. Well --<br/>
I renew the offer. I want you on<br/>
my staff.</p>
<p>No answer from Steiner.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
All right -- what's the reason for<br/>
refusing this time?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(after a moment)<br/>
I don't want to be dependent on<br/>
anyone -- not even a regimental<br/>
commander.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
As usual, I find it hard to under-<br/>
stand you.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(dryly)<br/>
I'm sorry to hear that. A good<br/>
sgt. should be completely under-<br/>
stood by his superior officer.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Steiner! Are you laughing at me?<br/>
(getting up)</p>
<p>Steiner stands up and looks expectantly at Brandt, whose<br/>
mouth twitches.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(voice shaking)<br/>
Get out!</p>
<p>Steiner half salutes and leaves.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<h3>18. CLOSE SHOT  MAAG</h3>
<p>in machine gun emplacement. Darkness has fallen. Maag is<br/>
looking out into the night. Suddenly, a Russian sub-<br/>
machine gun OPENS UP. Maag, frightened, tries to bury his<br/>
head in the dirt.</p>
<h3>19. MED. SHOT  STEINER</h3>
<p>walking in the darkness. At the BURST of BULLETS, he has<br/>
dropped to one knee. Now, there is silence again, and<br/>
Steiner peers cautiously into the darkness. There is<br/>
ANOTHER BURST of FIRE and Steiner stretches out flat on the<br/>
ground. Then there is silence again. Steiner gets up<br/>
quickly and bounds to the nearest machine gun emplacement<br/>
-- bumping into Maag, who is trying to get out. Another<br/>
BURST of BULLETS.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(shouting to be<br/>
heard)<br/>
Where are you going?</p>
<p><b>MAAG</b><br/>
(stammering)<br/>
To -- get reinforcements.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(angrily)<br/>
Leaving your post for that?</p>
<p>He pushes Maag back into the hole. They huddle together till<br/>
the Russian machine guns are quiet. Then Steiner peers<br/>
through the loophole. A few shells WHINE through the air,<br/>
EXPLODE nearby.</p>
<p><b>MAAG</b><br/>
(gasping)<br/>
They must be right in front of<br/>
us. In the Shell holes down<br/>
there.</p>
<p>Behind them there is the SOUND of RUNNING FEET and Schnurrbart<br/>
dives into the emplacement. Behind him come Kruger and<br/>
Hollerbach, and Lieutenant Meyer.</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
What's happening?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
The big craters on<br/>
the slope are full of<br/>
Russians.</p>
<p>Meyer stands frowning for a few seconds, then:</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
(to Steiner)<br/>
Signal for a barrage. Kruger --<br/>
get the rest of the company. I'll<br/>
inform the Commander.</p>
<p>He hurries OUT. Steiner picks up the flare gun.<br/>
Back bent, he LEAVES the emplacement.</p>
<h3>20. MED. SHOT  STEINER</h3>
<p>as he reaches a position in the trench. He inserts the<br/>
cartridges in the flare gun. He sends up a FLARE.</p>
<h3>21. FULL SHOT  SLOPE OF HILL</h3>
<p>ILLUMINED by the FLARE. The dark shapes of the Russians are<br/>
visible in the craters. Then there is darkness -- then once<br/>
again the landscape is ILLUMINED. The dark shapes can be<br/>
seen burrowing into the ground.</p>
<h3>22. MED. SHOT  STEINER</h3>
<p>He is looking at his watch with bated breath. Then he smiles<br/>
grimly as a hollow roaring SOUNDS above his head. It swells<br/>
rapidly to a mighty moan and a moment later comes the heavy<br/>
detonation. Steiner turns as he HEARS hasty FOOTSTEPS.<br/>
He sees Meyer running past him toward the MG emplacement.<br/>
Steiner follows.</p>
<h3>23. MG EMPLACEMENT</h3>
<p>as Steiner slides IN, followed by Meyer. The men of the<br/>
platoon are already assembled.</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
Commander's order. The Second<br/>
Platoon is to undertake a counter-<br/>
attack at once. You are to occupy<br/>
the craters and take as many<br/>
prisoners as possible. Sergeant<br/>
Steiner, you will command. How do<br/>
you think to proceed?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(considersbriefly)<br/>
We'll attack from three sides. Kruger<br/>
from the west, Schnurrbart from the<br/>
east and I from the south. When the<br/>
firing starts We'll need artillery<br/>
support -- to keep the Russians pinned<br/>
down in the woods. I guess that's<br/>
all.</p>
<p><b>MEYER</b><br/>
(nodding)<br/>
Good in theory; let's hope it works<br/>
out in practice.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(smiles grimly)<br/>
It's too simple; it'll never work.<br/>
All right -- First Platoon, down the<br/>
trench till I step you.</p>
<p>With bent backs, Anselm and Pasternack in the lead, the men<br/>
start down the trench.</p>
<h3>24. TRUCK SHOT  THE MEN</h3>
<p>as with bent backs and faces taut with tension they proceed<br/>
down the trench. The CLATTER of weapons persists.</p>
<p>The men stop, look at each other -- some with frightened grins.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(With a nervous<br/>
laugh)<br/>
Sergeant -- could I go make a<br/>
telephone call?</p>
<p>A titter, totally Without mirth, runs through the men.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(to Kruger)<br/>
You and your boys stay here.</p>
<p>Steiner raises his arm. The rest of the men follow him.</p>
<h3>25. SPOT FURTHER DOWN TRENCH</h3>
<p>as Steiner and the men come INTO VIEW. Steiner raises his<br/>
hand in a signal to halt. Then he peers over the trench,<br/>
lifts himself over, gives the signal for the men to follow.</p>
<h3>26. SLOPE OF HILL</h3>
<p>We SEE the shadowy figures of Steiner and the men descending<br/>
the slope. When they reach the level field Steiner again<br/>
gives the signal to halt.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(to Schnurrbart)<br/>
You wait here. Attack in exactly<br/>
five minutes --</p>
<p>Schnurrbart looks at his watch.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
As soon as the first shots are fired,<br/>
we'll come in. Clear?</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
(grunting)<br/>
All Clear.</p>
<p>He shakes hands with Steiner, who walks into the darkness<br/>
followed by Kern, Anselm and Pasternack.</p>
<h3>27. TRUCK - STEINER AND MEN</h3>
<p>trudging toward a clump of woods. Suddenly, Steiner drops<br/>
to the ground.</p>
<h3>28. CLOSE SHOT - STEINER ON GROUND</h3>
<p>The other men have wordlessly followed his example. Anselm,<br/>
crawling on his belly, comes INTO THE SCENE.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(whispering)<br/>
What's wrong?</p>
<p>Steiner points his head leftward. Anselm follows his gaze.</p>
<h3>29. LONG SHOTA COLUMN OF DIM FORMS</h3>
<p>moving cautiously through the darkness. They are no more<br/>
than twenty yards away.</p>
<h3>30. STEINER AND MEN</h3>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
Russkis! At least a hundred of<br/>
them!</p>
<p>Steiner is hesitant.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
How many men has Schnurrbart got --<br/>
a dozen? They'll run right over<br/>
them.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
Why don't we fire on them now?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
That may louse up the whole counter-<br/>
attack.<br/>
(bites his lips as<br/>
he thinks hard)<br/>
Schnurrbart probably won't even<br/>
see them coming --</p>
<p>He reaches into his belt for flares.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
A couple of flares -- and Schnurrbart<br/>
can see he's getting visitors --<br/>
Then if we start shooting up<br/>
their rear --<br/>
(shrugs)<br/>
Maybe, the confusion --</p>
<p>He sends up two flares in quick succession.</p>
<h3>31. LONG SHOT - THE RUSSIAN COLUMN</h3>
<p>is taken by surprise. SHOTS RING OUT, several fall.</p>
<h3>32. MED. SHOT - STEINER AND HIS MEN</h3>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
All right -- after them. Stick close<br/>
together and don't save on hand<br/>
grenades.<br/>
(ironically)<br/>
Remember, the eyes of the entire<br/>
German nation are upon you.</p>
<p>He runs in the direction of the Russians, the men following.</p>
<h3>33. EXT. CAPTAIN STRANSKY'S BUNKER</h3>
<p>The air is crackling with the SOUND of GUNFIRE and heavy<br/>
EXPLOSIONS. Captain Stransky comes running OUT of the<br/>
bunker, followed by Lieutenant Triebig. A Private comes<br/>
running INTO the SCENE from the opposite direction.</p>
<p><b>PRIVATE</b><br/>
Word from Corporal Schnurrbart,<br/>
sir. The Russians have broken<br/>
into the trenches.</p>
<p>Triebig looks alarmed.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(to Triebig)<br/>
Take up positions in front of the<br/>
bunker with all the men attached<br/>
to staff. I'll phone the combat<br/>
train.</p>
<p>He turns and runs hack INTO the bunker.</p>
<h3>34. CLOSE SHOT - STEINER AND ANSELM</h3>
<p>manning a machine gun. They are lying on the slope FIRING<br/>
toward the trenches.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
We've mowing them down.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Who? Ours or theirs?</p>
<h3>35. EXT. 2ND. PLATOON'S BUNKER</h3>
<p>There is the SOUND of faraway BURSTS of machine gun fire.<br/>
Hollerbach and Kern are helping Anselm who is limping<br/>
badly. Behind them are Dorn and Kruger. All look weary<br/>
and begrimed.</p>
<h3>36. INT. BUNKER</h3>
<p>as they come IN.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(to Anselm)<br/>
You're a damn fool not to go to<br/>
the Field Hospital --</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(sinking to the floor)<br/>
I'll wait until the holiday rush<br/>
is over. Otherwise, they're<br/>
just as likely to amputate as not.</p>
<p><b>HOLLERBACH</b><br/>
Does anybody still have any idea<br/>
what the hell went on?</p>
<p><b>DORN</b><br/>
(who seems dazed)<br/>
--- confusion --- confusion --</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
I couldn't see anything. When<br/>
something moved I fired at it.<br/>
Probably got as many Germans as<br/>
Russians.</p>
<p><b>HOLLERBACH</b><br/>
Shut up!</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
Please -- a little respect for a<br/>
wounded man.</p>
<p>Steiner comes IN. He has a bandage on top of his head.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Kruger, what happened to you at the<br/>
signal?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
I was Clearing Out the craters --<br/>
then I heard the firing from your<br/>
direction --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I was wondering if you were waiting<br/>
for a formal invitation.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
You know what you can do with your<br/>
fuckin' sarcasm. I saved your ass.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Oh, did you? Well, you know what<br/>
You can do with my --</p>
<h3>37. MED. SHOT. AT ENTRANCE TO BUNKER</h3>
<p>as Stransky and Triebig come IN. The men start to come to<br/>
attention.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(curtly)<br/>
At ease.<br/>
(to Steiner)<br/>
That was a bad business. You know<br/>
half of 2nd Company was put out of<br/>
action?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Yes, Sir. Our platoon was hit, too.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Why didn't the plan go according to<br/>
schedule?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
We didn't think that --</p>

	<h3>68. CLOSE SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>He is now close enough to the beach to stand. He takes an<br/>
uncertain step or two to stand, then he falls, his face<br/>
down in the water. He makes no effort to rise -- allowing<br/>
himself to slide deeper and deeper into the water. Suddenly<br/>
Gertrud's hands come INTO THE SCENE, grip Steiner's feet,<br/>
pull him back.</p>
<h3>69. MED. SHOT - GERTRUD AND STEINER</h3>
<p>Struggling for breath, he lies on the ground.</p>
<p>Steiner turns over on his back and looks at her. There is<br/>
rage and shame on his face. The blood starts streaming down<br/>
his face again. He tries to sit up. She tries to support<br/>
him and he knocks her arm back.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
If you don't leave me alone I'll<br/>
smash --</p>
<p>He stands up, takes a few steps to meet the incoming surf,<br/>
bends, scoops up a handful of water, washes the blood from<br/>
his face.</p>
<p>Then he turns and sees that Gertrud has retreated a few feet<br/>
up the beach, and stands watching him. The wind is blowing<br/>
her skirt close to her thighs.</p>
<p>He looks at her a moment, then, CAMERA TRUCKING with him, he<br/>
makes his way to her side. Gertrud looks at him steadily.<br/>
Suddenly he seizes her. She struggles, wordlessly. Steiner<br/>
forces her to the ground. With one swift movement he pulls<br/>
her blouse from off one shoulder.</p>
<h3>70. CLOSE SHOT - STEINER AND GERTRUD</h3>
<p>She has stopped struggling. His face is close to hers.<br/>
There is no resistance in her expression, but neither is<br/>
there compliance. She looks steadily into his eyes as<br/>
if there is a battle of wills. Roughly Steiner grabs her<br/>
shoulders. Suddenly, he releases her, stands up. He<br/>
watches her as she slowly sits up, rearranging her clothing.<br/>
He stares at her without Speaking. Then --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(in a low voice)<br/>
Why did you follow me?</p>
<p>She doesn't answer. He shakes his head slightly.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Nurse Gertrud.<br/>
keep your humanitarian<br/>
paws off drunken men. It might be<br/>
misunderstood.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
(breathing heavily)<br/>
You'reinsane.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(laughs harshly)<br/>
We are all insane.<br/>
(he makes a tiny,<br/>
mocking bow)<br/>
goodnight.</p>
<p>He walks toward the blackness of the garden. Gertrud turns<br/>
to watch him until He is no longer in sight.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<h3>71. HALL - REST HOME - STEINER</h3>
<p>has just reached his bedroom door He is about to go in,<br/>
when he stops, hesitates. Then he walks slowly to the next<br/>
door, leans forward, listening. He glances up and down the<br/>
hall, then Slowly depresses the latch.</p>
<h3>72. INT. DARK BEDROOM</h3>
<p>A streak of LIGHT coming through a space afforded by the<br/>
blowing curtains. As Steiner COMES IN, we SEE Inge's shape<br/>
sitting up in bed.</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
Who's there?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(Closing the door<br/>
behind him)<br/>
Three guesses.</p>
<p>Inge, her long nightgown trailing around her ankles, approaches<br/>
him in the darkness.</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
Leave my room at once.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Out of character, but very nicely<br/>
said. Don't worry; I just wanted to<br/>
ask you if you have any aspirin.</p>
<p>Inge comes two steps Closer, looks at him. She hesitates.<br/>
As she turns toward the door, he grips her shoulders and<br/>
holds her tightly.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Were you going to turn on the light?</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(feeling along her<br/>
arms)<br/>
You don't need any light, take my<br/>
word for it.</p>
<p>Pretending to struggle, she manipulates the nightgown off her<br/>
right shoulder, a maneuver not lost upon Steiner.</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
Let me go. I'll scream. I will<br/>
scream.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Naturally, you'll scream.</p>
<p>She closes her arms tight around his shoulders. When she<br/>
tries to kiss him he turns his face aside. He picks her<br/>
up and as he carries her toward the bed:</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<h3>73. LONG SHOT - SUNRISE</h3>
<p>framed in a window. CAMERA PULLS BACK to the interior of<br/>
Inge's bedroom. Inge is lying in bed. Steiner is sitting<br/>
on the edge of the bed, his back to Inge, looking out the<br/>
window.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Funny -- you boasted about your view<br/>
of the sunset. I prefer the sunrise.</p>
<p>Inge laughs. She sits up, throws her arms around his chest.</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
You know -- never once last night did<br/>
you say my name.<br/>
(strokes his chest)<br/>
Don't you like my name?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Why shouldn't I like it?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Up to this moment I've never met a<br/>
girl named Inge. At least not in<br/>
bed.</p>
<p>Inge laughs. When Steiner makes a move to get up, she holds<br/>
him tighter.</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
Where are you going?</p>
<p>He pulls himself loose, walks to where his shoes lying,<br/>
picks then up. Inge, blanket up under her chin, watches him.<br/>
He turns.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Goodnight.</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
(angrily)<br/>
Aren't you at least going to kiss me?</p>
<p>He stoops and casually kisses her shoulder.</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
Is that all?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Isn't it enough? Do you want to<br/>
get paid?</p>
<p>She starts up as though the pillow behind her had become a<br/>
hot iron. Then she throws herself face down on the bed,<br/>
begins to sob wildly. Steiner stands for a moment,<br/>
looking at her in embarrassment and some remorse.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(sadly)<br/>
Depend on me to say a few words<br/>
to many.</p>
<p>He walks slowly to the door, closes it behind him.</p>
<h3>74. DELETED.</h3>
<h3>75. MED. SHOT - GERTRUD</h3>
<p>who has just COME IN and is talking to a MAN at the bar.</p>
<h3>76. MED. SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>He sinks back into his seat, looks off at Gertrud. Then<br/>
he rises and, CAMERA TRUCKING with him, winds his way<br/>
across the floor to her. Her back is to him.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(quietly)<br/>
Gertrud --</p>
<p>She turns, flushes as she sees him, but doesn't say a word.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I wish -- I were meeting you for<br/>
the first time now.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
(looks at him)<br/>
I suppose that's as close to an<br/>
apology as you, Can ever get --<br/>
If you'll excuse me....</p>
<p>He makes a gesture to stop her, but she brushes past him.<br/>
We hear Klaus' voice.</p>
<p><b>KLAUS' VOICE</b><br/>
Rolf --</p>
<p>Steiner turns to face Klaus.</p>
<p><b>KLAUS</b><br/>
She's here --!</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(Pre-occupied)<br/>
Who?</p>
<p><b>KLAUS</b><br/>
You know -- Ilse -- the Iron Cross Tits --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Listen I don't want --</p>
<p>He has turned automatically to look toward the corner of<br/>
the bar. At the sight of the GIRL in the nurse's white<br/>
uniform, Steiner's speech stops; his eyes narrow.</p>
<h3>77. CLOSE SHOT  ILSE</h3>
<p>She is looking toward Steiner, an expectant smile on her<br/>
face. She is very buxom and very pretty in a coarse way.</p>
<h3>78.MED. SHOT. STEINER AND KLAUS</h3>
<p>Steiner's face is expressionless. CAMERA TRUCKING with<br/>
him, he makes his way to the Waiting Ilse. En route he<br/>
passes Gertrud who, struck by the grimness of Steiner's<br/>
expression, keeps her eyes on him as he pushes toward Ilse.</p>
<h3>79. MED. SHOT - ILSE</h3>
<p>Her smile freezes as Steiner STEPS INTO the SCENE.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(steadily)<br/>
Good evening, Ilse.<br/>
She can only stare at him.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I can't blame you, Ilse. After all,<br/>
it's been -- how long --? More than<br/>
a year anyway. Yes, thirteen months --</p>
<p><b>ILSE</b><br/>
(in a very low voice)<br/>
Rolf --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
-- and the law of averages -- What<br/>
right have I to be alive -- Did<br/>
you count on that, Ilse?</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ilse lets out a sob, covers her face with her hands,<br/>
then turns and runs toward the exit. Klaus, who has stood a<br/>
few paces behind, comes up to Steiner.</p>
<p><b>KLAUS</b><br/>
I must say -- it's a strange effect<br/>
you have upon women.</p>
<p>Steiner doesn't answer. Klaus shakes his head, goes after<br/>
Ilse.</p>
<h3>80. MED. SHOT - GERTRUD</h3>
<p>Whose eyes haven't left Steiner. She watches him now as he<br/>
sits down at an unoccupied table. From his inside pocket<br/>
he takes out a piece of paper. She sees him flag a passing<br/>
WAITER. A brief conversation ensues between them, and the<br/>
Waiter lends Steiner a pencil. As Steiner begins to write,<br/>
Gertrud moves slowly toward him.</p>
<h3>81. MED. SHOT - STEINER AT TABLE WRITING</h3>
<p>As Gertrud's shadow falls across the table he looks up<br/>
briefly, goes back to his writing. Without a word, Gertrud<br/>
slips into a chair across from Steiner. After a moment, he<br/>
finishes writing, looks at Gertrud.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I imagine you want to know what it's<br/>
all about?</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
No.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Be honest.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
Yes, I do. Very much.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
It's not too pretty a story -- and it<br/>
isn't very chivalrous of me to tell<br/>
it. But, then, one of the first<br/>
casualties of the war was chivalry --<br/>
(looks at the slip of paper)<br/>
A year or so ago I was in a hospital.<br/>
In four years of war I have been in<br/>
four hospitals.<br/>
(harshlaugh)<br/>
Some day I must get around to rating<br/>
them. Anyway -- Ilse -- Miss Bauman --<br/>
decided she would be more than a<br/>
nurse to me. After three days and<br/>
three nights I told her to be more<br/>
than a nurse to somebody else.<br/>
(looks at Gertrud's face)</p>
<p>He is silent a moment, his face reflecting the humiliation.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
She found a way to get even -- result --<br/>
Court martial -- degraded -- Six months<br/>
in a Penal Battalion --<br/>
(pause. Holds up the paper)<br/>
Now, I in tend to have Miss Bauman's<br/>
signed confession --</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
Please -- don't be brutal to her --</p>
<p>He gets up.<br/>
She looks at him in mute appeal. He shakes his head,<br/>
Starts out, Gertrud looking after him.</p>
<p>He gets up.<br/>
She looks at him in mute appeal. He shakes his head, starts<br/>
out, Gertrud looking after him.</p>
<h3>82. MED. SHOT - BENCH ON BEACH - FACING THE WATER</h3>
<p>On a corner of the bench, Ilse is huddled, still sobbing.<br/>
In the b.g. a figure looms. Then a flashlight, in the<br/>
hand of the figure is snapped on. Its beam ILLUMINATES<br/>
Ilse, who doesn't move. The figure, holding the flashlight,<br/>
moves closer, and we SEE that it is Steiner. Now he stands<br/>
beside Ilse, who does not look up.</p>
<p><b>ILSE</b><br/>
Turn it out -- I can't see.</p>
<p>Steiner snaps off the light. She looks up at him, her face<br/>
a study in fury.</p>
<p><b>ILSE</b><br/>
You Stinking louse.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(laughs grimly)<br/>
I that What I am?</p>
<p><b>ILSE</b><br/>
(violently)<br/>
Yes. And you always were a louse.<br/>
You never knew how to treat a<br/>
woman.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
How right you are. And now, let<br/>
me prove your point --<br/>
(takes Out the<br/>
Slip Of paper)<br/>
-- Sign this.</p>
<p><b>ILSE</b><br/>
What is it?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Your confession.</p>
<p><b>ILSE</b><br/>
Confession. What have I to confess?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Oh -- are we going to play games?<br/>
All right, I'll read it to you --<br/>
(snaps on the<br/>
flashlight,<br/>
starts to read)<br/>
On the night of May 12, 1943, I, Ilse<br/>
Bauman, a nurse at the 2nd Base<br/>
Hospital in Rostov, stole a wrist-<br/>
watch from the room of Corporal<br/>
Karl Wachtel, an amputee, and<br/>
furthermore, hid the watch among<br/>
the belongings of -- Sgt. Rolf Steiner.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ilse jumps to her feet, starts to run, knocking<br/>
the flashlight from Steiner's hands. But Steiner catches<br/>
her in two strides. She kicks him and pummels him with her<br/>
fists. Steiner drags her down to the water, wades in knee<br/>
deep and thrusts her head under.</p>
<h3>83. MED. SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>holding Ilse's head under water. Then he pulls her up by<br/>
the hair.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Will you sign now?</p>
<p>She coughs and struggles for breath. He picks her up in his<br/>
arms, carries her back to the bench, dumps her on it uncere-<br/>
moniously. He picks up the pencil and paper and the flash-<br/>
light. He flashes the LIGHT on her face. Water is dripping<br/>
from her hair down her forehead and onto her hands.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Maybe in bed you could cry your way<br/>
out, but not here.</p>
<p>He thrusts the pencil into her hand. He flashes the LIGHT<br/>
on the bench so that Ilse can see. With trembling hands,<br/>
she signs the paper. Steiner switches off the flashlight.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(looking at paper)<br/>
All right -- you may go now.</p>
<p>She doesn't stir.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(repeats sharply)<br/>
You may go now.</p>
<p>Unsteadily, she gets to her feet, looks at him.</p>
<p><b>ILSE</b><br/>
(tonelessly)<br/>
You're going to report me.</p>
<p>He nods grimly.</p>
<p><b>ILSE</b><br/>
Oh, God. Oh, God, what am I going<br/>
to do?</p>
<p>He shrugs. Slowly she walks away, her wet skirt clinging<br/>
to her legs, head bowed, shoulders twitching.

	</p><h3>84. CLOSE SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>watching Ilse go. There is no pity in his face. Then, he<br/>
sits on the bench, examines the paper closely. He is deep<br/>
in thought when there is the SOUND of SOFT FOOTSTEPS in the<br/>
sand. Steiner looks up, Gertrud stands beside him.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
(quietly)<br/>
So you have what you want?</p>
<p>Steiner nods his head slowly, looks at the paper again. Then<br/>
he gets up, walks to the water's edge. For a moment, he<br/>
hesitates, then he tears the paper into tiny scraps, tosses<br/>
them into the water. Gertrud comes INTO the SCENE, stands<br/>
at Steiner's side. Together they watch the scraps being<br/>
carried out on the waves, dancing and scattering until they<br/>
vanish from sight. There is a moment's silence, broken by<br/>
Gertrud.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
Why?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(shrugs; then, slowly)<br/>
I'm not interested anymore<br/>
in clearing my name. Doesn't matter.....<br/>
He starts away.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
Rolf--</p>
<p>He stops, turns, looks at Gertrud.</p>
<h3>85. CLOSE SHOT - GERTRUD</h3>
<p>as she looks steadily toward Steiner.</p>
<h3>86. MED. SHOT - STEINER AND GERTRUD</h3>
<p>He walks to her. Without a word he takes her in his arms.<br/>
They cling to each other.</p>
<p>DISSOLVETO:</p>
<h3>87. MED. SHOT - NIGHT - CREST OF HILL - GERTRUD AND STEINER</h3>
<p>Gertrud, her knees drawn up, sits facing the sea. Steiner<br/>
sits at right angle to Gertrud, his head resting on her<br/>
shoulder, as he reads a letter:</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
"-- Well, here I am, back in dear old<br/>
Mother Russia, after six weeks in<br/>
the hospital. Why did no one eyer<br/>
tell me before about the pleasures<br/>
of being wounded?<br/>
That nice, clean hospital -- the food<br/>
-- those nurses -- rather, that one<br/>
nurse in particular. But why am I<br/>
telling you. Every hospital, I hear<br/>
has that one particular specimen... "</p>
<p>He turns his head to look at Gertrud. They smile at each<br/>
other. Then he resumes reading.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Anyway -- "At the moment things are<br/>
quiet here, so you can be sure the<br/>
Russkis are preparing something<br/>
big. I suppose you heard that Dorn<br/>
got it. We had finally persuaded<br/>
the professor to put in for Officers<br/>
Training, and the very next day the<br/>
Russkis lobbed over a few shells<br/>
to let us know they're still in<br/>
business --"</p>
<p>He stops reading. Gertrud looks at him.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
Bad you heard of it?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
No.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
Were you fond of him?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
The professor? I don't know -- not<br/>
particularly, I guess.<br/>
(reflects a moment)<br/>
He was a good soldier. Did his<br/>
job.<br/>
(pause)<br/>
I'm sorry he's gone.<br/>
(back to letter)<br/>
"Well, to get on to more cheerful<br/>
news. Our darling Captain Stransky<br/>
is in some sort of trouble --"<br/>
(looks up from<br/>
letter)<br/>
Him -- I can be more definite about.<br/>
(resumes reading)<br/>
"Seems in the Captain's report on<br/>
the Russian action, the night we<br/>
got it, he somewhat overplayed his<br/>
hand. His report, I hear, pictures<br/>
Stransky, accompanied by Triebig,<br/>
appearing at the last moment among<br/>
his fleeing men, stemming the panic,<br/>
and leading the counterattack --"<br/>
(pauses)<br/>
A damned lie!<br/>
(back to letter)<br/>
"From what I hear, Stransky sat out<br/>
the engagement in his bunker. Colonel<br/>
Brandt informed Stransky that he<br/>
was entitled to the Iron Cross First<br/>
Class for bis actions, but he also<br/>
pointed out that two witnesses were<br/>
required. Triebig, that sweet-<br/>
smelling skunk, naturally signed,<br/>
but the signature of the Company<br/>
Commander was also needed. Since<br/>
Lieutenant Meyer was killed and<br/>
you were then in charge, it looks<br/>
like you're elected. We can't wait<br/>
until you get back and are asked<br/>
to sign. So, don't linger by the<br/>
wayside. Hurry back and join the<br/>
fun. Keep well and watch out that<br/>
they don't pick you up and stick<br/>
you in some other unit. Things<br/>
are supposed to be pretty hot<br/>
on the main front. All the best,<br/>
your old friend, Schnurrbart."</p>
<p>Steiner looks out at the sea. After a moment...</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
You don't want to go back do you?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(Pause)<br/>
Not now.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
(trying to sound<br/>
cheerful)<br/>
In the morning you're going<br/>
home for a month. I know it<br/>
sounds crazy -- out maybe in a<br/>
month it'll all be over.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
It'll never be over. Not for me.</p>
<p>He falls silent. The POUNDING of the SURF can be HEARD.<br/>
Gertrud stretches her hand out to Steiner.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
Rolf -- sit beside me.</p>
<p>He takes her outstretched hand, sits beside her, rests<br/>
his head on her breast. She puts her arm around him.<br/>
He lies quietly for a moment, then lifts his face to kiss<br/>
her.</p>
<p><b>GERTRUD</b><br/>
No, darling -- later -- later -- later --</p>
<p>Her arms around him, she is rocking him almost like a<br/>
child as we:</p>
<p>DISSOLVETO:</p>
<h3>88. FULL SHOT - STREET - DAY</h3>
<p>There are two fleets of army trucks lined up. On one<br/>
side of the street the trucks face west; on the opposite<br/>
side they face east. SOLDIERS are boarding both fleets<br/>
of trucks.</p>
<h3>89. MED. SHOT - SERGEANT MULLER - IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET</h3>
<p>He calls out to a soldier who is walking hesitantly to-<br/>
ward the trucks facing west.</p>
<p><b>MULLER</b><br/>
You there -- let me see your orders.</p>
<p>The soldier hands his orders to Muller, who looks at then.</p>
<p><b>MULLER</b><br/>
Where do you think you are going?<br/>
(with sadistic glee)<br/>
These trucks are going home. You<br/>
belong there --<br/>
(Pointing to east-<br/>
bound trucks)<br/>
You're going to the front!<br/>
(pointing to west-<br/>
bound trucks)<br/>
Lucky ones there!<br/>
(waves to east bound trucks)<br/>
Unlucky ones there!<br/>
(laughs again)</p>
<h3>90. MED. SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>standing outside the rest home, near the parked trucks. He<br/>
is looking up and down the street -- evidently waiting for<br/>
Someone. Muller, who CAN BE SEEN in the b.g. , calls out --</p>
<p><b>MULLER</b><br/>
Steiner--! Get into your truck.<br/>
It's ready to move!</p>
<h3>91. MED. SHOT - MULLER</h3>
<p>as Steiner walks slowly up to him.</p>
<p><b>MULLER</b><br/>
What's wrong, Sergeant? For one<br/>
of the lucky ones, you sure don't<br/>
seem anxious to go.</p>
<p>Steiner doesn't even look at Muller who evidently sees someone<br/>
at the west trucks.</p>
<p><b>MULLER</b><br/>
Hey, you there -- let me see your<br/>
Orders --</p>
<p>He runs off, almost colliding with Inge. She looks complacent.</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
Goodbye, Sergeant Steiner.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I'm touched. Up this early just<br/>
to say goodbye to me. Or are you<br/>
waiting to welcome the new batch<br/>
coming in?</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
No. I just thought somebody<br/>
should say goodbye to you.<br/>
(smiles as Steiner looks<br/>
at her)<br/>
Gertrud is not coming, Sergeant.</p>
<p>He stares at her. She takes ah envelope out of her pocket.</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
This is for you.</p>
<p>As he snatches it out of her hand.....</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
That's all right. I've already<br/>
read it.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
You're a pig.<br/>
(looks at the envelope, but<br/>
doesn't open it)</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
I'll be happy to read it to you.</p>
<p>She takes the envelope from him. He just stands there,<br/>
neither objecting nor assenting. Inge's tone, as she<br/>
reads, is not as triumphantly smug as might have been<br/>
expected.</p>
<p><b>INGE</b><br/>
(reads)<br/>
"Dearest Rolf -- I can't face you<br/>
this morning. How can you and<br/>
I know what we feel for each<br/>
other? We hate so quickly and<br/>
easily, maybe we fall in love<br/>
too quickly and easily, too.<br/>
There are things I even needed<br/>
to tell you about.....</p>
<p>Steiner snatches the letter from Inge. crumples it in<br/>
his hand. His face is his usual steel mask again.<br/>
He stands still for a moment, then the SOUND of the trucks<br/>
MOTORS causes him to look up. The trucks bound for the<br/>
front have started slowly off. Steiner looks at the<br/>
crumpled letter in his hand, throws it away, runs for the<br/>
trucks.</p>
<h3>92. MED. SHOT - MULLER</h3>
<p>as Steiner runs past him. He stares in amazement as<br/>
Steiner jumps onto the back of the last truck heading east.</p>
<p><b>MULLER</b><br/>
(almost screaming)<br/>
No! No! Steiner -- wrong truck!<br/>
You're going home. That one's<br/>

<p>But in the b.g. the truck has disappeared around the corner.</p>

<p>FADE IN :</p>
<h3>93. LONG SHOT - ROAD SKIRTING A ROW OF BUNKERS - DAY</h3>
<p>A truck is seen coming to a stop. A lone figure jumps off the<br/>
back, waves to the driver. The truck drives on.</p>
<h3>94. MED. SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>standing in the road, looking about him with some curiosity.<br/>
Then, CAMERA TRUCKING with him, he starts to walk. He<br/>
passes several SOLDIERS. We can tell by the cursory glances<br/>
they exchange that they are strangers to each other.<br/>
Steiner enters the bunker.</p>
<h3>95. LIEUTENANT TRIEBIG</h3>
<p>rounding a corner near the bunker. He HEARS SHOUTS from the<br/>
bunker and stops. Then he HEARS a half dozen voices CRYING<br/>
in unison, "Steiner! Steiner! Steiner!" Triebig's face<br/>
sets. He stands a moment, immobile, then turns, hurries<br/>
away in the opposite direction.</p>
<h3>96. INT. BUNKER</h3>
<p>Kruger, Kern, Schnurrbart and Anselm are grouped around<br/>
Steiner. A NEWCOMER stands off to the side a bit. Steiner<br/>
is opening a beer bottle.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
You're an idiot, Rolf. Why didn't<br/>
you go home when you could have?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(stony-faced)<br/>
Heard it was safer here.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(nodding)<br/>
I was home for two weeks.</p>
<p><b>THE NEWCOMER</b><br/>
(angrily)<br/>
I wish this kind of talk would stop.<br/>
It's -- it's gross exaggeration -- and<br/>
what's more, it has a terrible effect<br/>
on the morale of the troops at the<br/>
front!</p>
<p>Everyone turns to look at the newcomer. Steiner regards him<br/>
coolly.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What's your name?</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(defiantly)<br/>
Zoll.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Thank you, Herr Zoll for worrying<br/>
about my morale.</p>
<p>The men laugh.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Zoll is a Party member. He's con-<br/>
vinced we're winning the war, and<br/>
anybody who doesn't think so, he's<br/>
quite willing to turn in to the<br/>
Storm Troops.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(to Zoll)<br/>
My name is Rolf Steiner -- and please<br/>
memorize my correct serial number.<br/>
I wouldn't want them to come for<br/>
the wrong man.</p>
<p>The PHONE RINGS. Zoll answers it.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(very snappy)<br/>
Second Platoon. Zoll speaking.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
God, isn't it wonderful hearing a<br/>
real soldier speaking again.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(through the men's<br/>
laughter)<br/>
Yes, sir -- yes, sir --<br/>
(hangs up, turns<br/>
to Steiner<br/>
Captain Stransky wants to see you<br/>
in his bunker.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
When?</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
Right away.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Good. I missed my Captain Stransky.</p>
<h3>97. CLOSE SHOT - STRANSKY'S FACE</h3>
<p>The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE that we are in what is<br/>
evidently Stransky's bunker. Triebig is facing Stransky.<br/>
It is now dark.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I'll soften him up, don't worry.<br/>
How long have we kept him waiting?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
About half an hour.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
All right. Send him in.</p>
<p>Triebig, still looking worried, goes OUT. Stransky stands<br/>
for a moment, moves another chair to the table, then sits<br/>
opposite it. The door opens and Steiner comes IN. He looks<br/>
at Stransky, his face devoid of expression.</p>
<h3>98. MED. SHOT - STRANSKY - AT TABLE</h3>
<p>with Steiner in b.g. Stransky's demeanor is carefully<br/>
matter-of-fact.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Welcome back, Sergeant. Please sit<br/>
down.<br/>
(impatiently, as<br/>
Steiner remains<br/>
standing)<br/>
You may sit down.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
If you order me to.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Consider it an order.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Steiner sits down facing Stransky, who moves the<br/>
kerosene lamp so that he himself is sitting in darkness.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Are you quite recovered from your<br/>
wound?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Quite.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Good. Now that you're back, I'm<br/>
willing to make a fresh start.<br/>
I excuse your past behavior. There<br/>
are several important matters I<br/>
wish to discuss with you.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(his face shows that<br/>
he knows what Stransky<br/>
has in mind l there is<br/>
a pause before he<br/>
speaks)<br/>
Certain things can be talked about<br/>
only man to man, not superior to<br/>
subordinate.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(an attempt at a smile)<br/>
You would naturally think that.<br/>
But, you know, don't you, that<br/>
in civilian life, too, a distinction<br/>
is made between people and personalities?</p>
<p>For a fleeting moment Steiner's expression darkens, but he<br/>
quickly composes his features. His tone is ingenuous.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I don't. But I'm'sure you can<br/>
explain that distinction to me.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(smoothly)<br/>
I can. The difference is a matter<br/>
of ethical and intellectual super-<br/>
iority and is caused, whether you<br/>
like it or not, by class difference.<br/>
Those who are reared in dirt will<br/>
never or rarely emerge from it<br/>
because they have never learned<br/>
to see dirt as dirt. Isn't that<br/>
self - evident?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(swiftly and quietly)<br/>
I disagree. Talent, sensitivity<br/>
and character are not privileges<br/>
of the upper class.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(voice less urbane)<br/>
I see. May I ask which of the<br/>
two categories you count yourself?</p>
<p>It is an open challenge. Steiner sits up in his seat.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Is this conversation taking place<br/>
between two equal human beings, or<br/>
between a superior and his sub-<br/>
ordinate?</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(haughtily)<br/>
I see no reason to throw the weight<br/>
of my rank into the balance.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(quietly)<br/>
In that case, I am free not to<br/>
answer your tactless question.</p>
<p>There is e silence as fury mounts in Stransky's eyes, but<br/>
he controls his voice.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
You are forgetting yourself, Steiner.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(coldly)<br/>
If you feel insecure about standing<br/>
on your grounds of equality, we<br/>
can easily go back to our regular<br/>
relationship.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(looks at his hands,<br/>
speaks softly)<br/>
Your impertinence can only come from<br/>
stupidity -- and digging holes.<br/>
(stands up brusquely<br/>
and paces the room<br/>
several times be-<br/>
fore he comes to a<br/>
stop in front of<br/>
Steiner)<br/>
I have met more than one person of<br/>
your type -- and I have always crushed<br/>
them like vermin. I consider you<br/>
nothing more than an insolent lout<br/>
who cannot keep his hands off his<br/>
comrades' property.</p>
<h3>99. CLOSE SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>as he stands up slowly. He makes a visible effort to<br/>
control himself.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(voice steady and<br/>
quiet)<br/>
You'll regret that.

	</p><h3>100. MED. SHOT - STRANSKY AND STEINER</h3>
<p>Steiner wipes his sleeve with his right hand.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
For that remark alone, back home<br/>
I would have had dogs chase you<br/>
over the fields until your feet<br/>
were bleeding straps.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
We're not back home.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
You'll wish you were before long.<br/>
(turns his back on<br/>
Steiner, picks up<br/>
the phone)<br/>
Triebig? Come in here!</p>
<p>He hangs up, turns, sees that Steiner is leaning easily<br/>
against the wall.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Stand at attention!</p>
<p>Steiner takes a half step forward, lets his arms dangle.<br/>
The door opens and Triebig COMES IN.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
How far has my new bunker progressed?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
About a foot and a half.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
The bunker is to be ten feet deep.<br/>
Sergeant Steiner will work on it<br/>
tonight until that depth is reached.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(astonished)<br/>
Tonight?</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Tonight. I shall hold your respon-<br/>
sible for having that bunker ready<br/>
by tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Steiner has listened with an impassive face. Now, without<br/>
change of expression, he holds the door open for Triebig,<br/>
then he turns to look at Stransky. without a word, he<br/>
GOES OUT.</p>
<h3>101. EXT. BUNKER- TRUCK SHOT - TRIEBIG AND STEINER</h3>
<p>as they walk toward the spot (seen in b.g.) where the new<br/>
bunker is being dug. They walk in silence a moment.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
I want you to know I have nothing<br/>
to do with this business.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
That's lucky for you.<br/>
(pause)<br/>
Where's your "friend"?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(looking straight<br/>
ahead)<br/>
He's dead.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Oh -- too bad.<br/>
(sardonically)<br/>
Well -- bear up. Fresh recruits are<br/>
coming in every day.</p>
<p>Triebig looks at him and his voice shakes with hatred.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
I have only one wish, and the<br/>
Commander shares it. We could<br/>
court martial you or get rid of<br/>
you some other way. But we want<br/>
to have the pleasure of seeing<br/>
you -- croak.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(smiles)<br/>
You'll have to take very good care<br/>
of yourself if you want to outlive<br/>
me.</p>
<p>Triebig clenches his fists in helpless fury.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Thank you for the warning.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
You're entirely welcome.</p>
<p>By this time they have reached the pit where four men are<br/>
digging.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(to the men)<br/>
Ail right -- you're relieved. You<br/>
may return to your quarters.</p>
<p>The men, seeing only Steiner with Triebig, don't quite<br/>
comprehend.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(shouting)<br/>
I said you may return to your<br/>
quarters!</p>
<p>The men hastily drop their shovels, clamber out of the pit,<br/>
and walk AWAY. They keep looking back at Triebig and<br/>
Steiner, still not certain of what's going on. Triebig<br/>
turns to Steiner.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
If I were you, I'd make sure it<br/>
was done by morning.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
It won't be for lack of trying,<br/>
sir.</p>
<p>Triebig glowers at him, walks AWAY. Steiner jumps into<br/>
the pit, starts to shovel. The CAMERA notes that Steiner<br/>
is up to his kneecaps in the pit.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<h3>102. CLOSE SHOT - PAIR OF MUDDY BOOTS</h3>
<p>The CAMERA PANS UP from the boots to Steiner's face.<br/>
Steiner is asleep in a chair, his feet stretched out.<br/>
The scene is the outer room of Brandt's command post.<br/>
After a moment, the inner door opens and Kiesel and<br/>
Triebig COME OUT.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
You'll wait here, Lieutenant.</p>
<p>Triebig nods nervously, Kiesel looks at Steiner, shakes<br/>
his head.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Steiner!</p>
<p>Steiner opens his eyes, stumbles to his feet, straightens<br/>
up. Kiesel holds the door open. Steiner looks at Triebig,<br/>
then walks IN.</p>
<h3>103. INT. BRANDT'S ROOM</h3>
<p>Brandt is sitting behind a huge, clumsy desk piles with<br/>
all sorts of useless objects. He holds a lighted cigarette<br/>
between his fingers. Steiner and Kiesel COME IN.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
So there you are. Next time you're<br/>
wounded, give me a week's notice<br/>
that we're going to lose you, ha,<br/>
ha. How are you, Steiner?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I can't complain.</p>
<p>Brandt stands up, shakes hands heartily, then gestures<br/>
toward chair.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Make yourself comfortable.<br/>
(extends cigarette<br/>
case to Steiner)<br/>
How was it in the hospital?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(laconically)<br/>
Pretty good.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
And the Rest Home?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I recommend it.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(laughs, then, casually)<br/>
That night you were wounded -- did<br/>
you know that Captain Stransky<br/>
led the Second Company's counter-<br/>
attack?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
That's what they tell me.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Is it true?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
The counterattack was led by<br/>
Lieutenant Meyer. Captain Stransky<br/>
was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>Brandt and Kiesel exchange glances.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Are you sure of that?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Absolutely. In the first place,<br/>
I would have seen him, and in the<br/>
second place, Lieutenant Meyer had<br/>
to report to the Captain what had<br/>
been happening in the lines.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
How do you know that?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I was there when Lieutenant Meyer<br/>
phoned.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
A-ha!<br/>
(sharply, to Kiesel)<br/>
Fetch Triebig.</p>
<p>Kiesel GOES OUT.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(grimly)<br/>
I think you're entitled to a little<br/>
fun.</p>
<h3>104. MED. SHOT -AT DOOR</h3>
<p>as it opens and Triebig and Kiesel COME IN. Triebig looks<br/>
very worried. For a moment, Brandt just looks at Triebig<br/>
who bites his lip. Finally, Brandt speaks. His voice is<br/>
unusually soft and low.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
You signed your Captain's report,<br/>
Lieutenant Triebig. Were you<br/>
present when Captain Stransky<br/>
led the counterattack?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(after a notice-<br/>
able hesitation)<br/>
I accompanied the commander to the<br/>
hill and saw him calling several<br/>
men around him. Then he sent me<br/>
back to the command post.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Then how do you know that Stransky<br/>
really led the counterattack? You<br/>
signed a statement to that effect,<br/>
Lieutenant Triebig.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
I -- I learned of it from wounded<br/>
men who were returning.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Can you give me the name of one<br/>
of these wounded men?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
They weren't staff men -- just company<br/>
men. I -- I knew them only by sight.<br/>
Besides, it was pitch dark when I<br/>
spoke to them.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(icily)<br/>
I want you to know, Lieutenant<br/>
Triebig, that I have had your<br/>
statements checked. Captain<br/>
Kiesel will inform you of the<br/>
results of our investigation.</p>
<p>Steiner watches closely as Kiesel takes a sheet of paper<br/>
out of his pocket, studies its contents for a moment.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
(placidly)<br/>
Our investigation so far has<br/>
disclosed that at the moment<br/>
there are forty-two men in 2nd<br/>
Company who took part in that<br/>
counterattack. They declare<br/>
Unanimously that the attack was<br/>
led by Lieutenant Meyer. None<br/>
of them saw Captain Stransky, and<br/>
none of them heard that he was<br/>
even with the company.</p>
<p>Brandt turns to Triebig, who looks ds if he were standing<br/>
against a wall watching an execution squad line up in front<br/>
of him.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
To my mind, there is nothing more<br/>
contemptible than snatching the<br/>
laurels that properly belong to<br/>
a man who died in action. I shall<br/>
abide by Sergeant Steiner's testimony.<br/>
If he stands by his statement that<br/>
Captain Stransky was not with the<br/>
company, I shall be compelled to<br/>
institute disciplinary proceedings<br/>
against the Captain. You may go<br/>
now. You are no longer needed<br/>
here.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Yes, sir.</p>
<p>He doesn't look at Steiner as he LEAVES the room.</p>
<h3>105. MED. SHOT - BRANDT, KIESEL AND STEINER</h3>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(to Steiner)<br/>
Very well. Do you stand by your<br/>
statement?</p>
<p>To Brandt's surprise, Steiner doesn't answer immediately.<br/>
Then, after some hesitation:</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Would it be possible for me to<br/>
think it over for a few days?</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(anger and disappoint-<br/>
ment in his voice)<br/>
Think it over? What is there to<br/>
think over? Did you see Stransky<br/>
or not?</p>
<p>Steiner doesn't answer.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
I don't understand you. Are you<br/>
a friend of Stransky's? My im-<br/>
pression is that you wish him<br/>
in hell.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
My differences with Captain Stransky<br/>
are a private matter.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(losing patience)<br/>
Oh, they are? Why were you<br/>
ordered to dig Stransky's bunker<br/>
tonight?</p>
<p>Steiner compresses his lips.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
I asked you something!</p>
<p>Steiner looks up, their eyes meet.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Do you want to hear lies?</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(leaning forward)<br/>
Do you know that Stransky intends<br/>
to recommend disciplining you?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(a growl)<br/>
If I were he, I wouldn't lose a<br/>
minute about it.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(to Kiesel)<br/>
I really think I should place a<br/>
guard over him and have him dig<br/>
holes until he's blue in the<br/>
face.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
(shrugs)<br/>
Why try to revise the decisions of<br/>
Providence?</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(sternly, to Steiner)<br/>
Listen to me. You know I've always<br/>
shown a great deal of understanding<br/>
for you. But I am beginning to<br/>
get tired of battling with your<br/>
superiors over you.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(defiantly)<br/>
I didn't ask you to.</p>
<p>AS soon as the words are out, it is obvious from Steiner's<br/>
expression that he regrets going that far, but it is too<br/>
late. Brandt rises and leans on his desk. His voice is<br/>
hoarse with rage.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Didn't ask me to! You didn't ask<br/>
me to! Have you gone clean out<br/>
of your mind? Do you have any<br/>
idea what you're saying?</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Steiner -- you ungrateful idiot --<br/>
</p>
<p>For a second, Steiner closes his eyes. Se is struggling<br/>
not to let the words out -- but they come pouring forth<br/>
violently.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What are you asking me, Captain<br/>
Kiesel? To love Colonel Brandt?<br/>
I hate Colonel Brandt. I hate<br/>
you, Captain Kiesel, and Stransky<br/>
and Triebig, and ever since I've<br/>
put on this damn uniform I've hated<br/>
everybody and anybody connected<br/>
with it. If I get into any trouble,<br/>
if I have any problem with anything<br/>
or anybody, I'll solve them myself --!<br/>
Thank you very much!<br/>
</p>
<p>Me pauses, shaking. There is a dead silence in the room.<br/>
Brandt is breathing heavily. His unsteady hands grope<br/>
across the top of his desk.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(his voice broken)<br/>
Get out. Get out of here at once!<br/>
</p>
<p>Steiner doesn't move for a split second, then he GOES OUT.<br/>
Brandt tries to regain control of himself. Kiesel looks<br/>
at the floor.<br/>
DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<h3>106. PANORAMIC SHOT - LINE OF TRUCKS AND MARCHING MEN - DAY<br/>
</h3>
<p>all headed west. This is followed by QUICK CUTS of the<br/>
troop-laden trucks. The total impression is of a gigantic<br/>
exodus.</p>
<h3>107. INT. SECOND PLATOON'S BUNKER<br/>
</h3>
<p>Steiner, Schnurrbart, Kruger, Zoll, and Anselm are all<br/>
present. They have packed all their belongings, ready<br/>
to move out. Schnurrbart and Kruger are playing cards.<br/>
Steiner is sitting quietly on his bunk. The others are<br/>
moving about -- obviously beset by impatience.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
Why the hell aren't we moving<br/>
out?</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
What's everybody so worried<br/>
about? Moving a regiment is<br/>
quite a job, let me tell you.<br/>
It doesn't move all at once.<br/>
</p>
<p>The PHONE RINGS.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
Ah -- that's probably our orders<br/>
now.<br/>
</p>
<p>AS Steiner goes to the phone, everybody makes for their<br/>
packs, ready to leave at the word.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(into phone)<br/>
Yes -- yes, sir -- I see --<br/>
(no change of<br/>
expression)<br/>
Yes, sir -- at what time? -- Yes,<br/>
sir.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(to Steiner, who<br/>
has hung up)<br/>
What's the good word?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
The good word is that we've been<br/>
elected.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(cautiously)<br/>
Elected to -- what?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Captain Stransky's paid us a great<br/>
honor. We -- that is, our platoon --<br/>
is to stay here as a rear guard<br/>
until dark. For two hours. Maybe<br/>
three.</p>
<p>The men are frozen in disbelief.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I think we ought to feel very<br/>
proud.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
Those idiots are crazy.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Not so crazy. They're pulling out,<br/>
we're not.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(takes a map from<br/>
his pocket, spreads<br/>
it on the table,<br/>
traces with his thumb)<br/>
The division is moving back to new<br/>
positions east of Krimskaya --</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(nodding)<br/>
Much easier to launch an offensive<br/>
from there.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Why us? Of all the platoons in the<br/>
battalion, why us?</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(violently)<br/>
Because our sergeant is such a pal<br/>
of Captain Stransky'e! That's<br/>
why us!</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I'm sorry. In the next war I'll try<br/>
to pick my enemies more carefully.</p>
<h3>108. MED. SHOT - STAFF CAR - DAY</h3>
<p>The car stands outside Stransky's bunker. A military<br/>
CHAUFFEUR is at the wheel, and the MOTOR is RUNNING.<br/>
A steady stream of trucks and equipment, headed west,<br/>
flows past the staff car. In the b.g. the door to Stransky's<br/>
bunker flies open and the Captain with Lieutenant Triebig<br/>
behind him, STEPS OUT. As they make for the car, the phone<br/>
within the bunker is HEARD RINGING.</p>
<h3>109. INT. BUNKER- AT PHONE</h3>
<p>as Stransky comes INTO the SCENE, picks up phone. Triebig<br/>
is in the b.g.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Captain Stransky -- Yes, yes,<br/>
Captain Kiesel, we were just<br/>
about to leave -- Yes, sir --<br/>
What's that, sir?<br/>
(his expression is<br/>
cloudy as he listens)<br/>
I see, sir. Yes, sir. I'll attend<br/>
to that immediately. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>He hangs up. Triebig looks at him inquiringly.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Intelligence reports that the<br/>
Russians are already on the high-<br/>
way. Regiment feels that it would<br/>
be not only useless but suicidal<br/>
to leave behind any rear guard<br/>
platoons. They're to join the<br/>
evacuation immediately.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
I see.</p>
<p>He and Stransky exchange glances.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Shall I call -- I believe it's<br/>
Sergeant Steiner's platoon, is<br/>
it not?</p>
<p>Stransky nods. Triebig waits for him to say something,<br/>
but he doesn't so Triebig picks up the phone.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Just a second, Lieutenant --</p>
<p>Triebig turns to face Stransky.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
What do you think of this story?<br/>
We tried to establish telephone<br/>
communication with Steiner's<br/>
bunker, but evidently his wires<br/>
had already been cut. You, Lieuten-<br/>
ant Triebig, upon personal investigation,<br/>
discovered their bunker abandoned.<br/>
Apparently, the platoon had already<br/>
left to take up its forward position.</p>
<p>The two men look at each other. Then!</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(slowly)<br/>
I think it's an excellent story.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Just a story?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Much more than a story. I think<br/>
it's fully justified.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
You do? Why?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(after a moment's<br/>
thought)<br/>
It is my firm conviction that the<br/>
Third Reich would be better off<br/>
without the likes of Steiner and<br/>
his cronies.</p>
<p>The two men stand looking at each other without speaking.<br/>
Then Stransky takes the telephone wire in his two hands<br/>
and yanks it out of the wall. He doesn't look at Triebig<br/>
as he strides from the bunker. Triebig follows.</p>

	</p><h3>110. EXT. BUNKER<br/>
</h3>
<p>All the men, with the exception of Steiner, are present.<br/>
They are busy packing ammunition boxes.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
Damn it. I hate to leave this<br/>
place. We worked weeks fixing<br/>
this place up -- this damn army.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
The trouble with you is -- you're<br/>
scared stiff.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(looks at him)<br/>
You don't know how grateful we are<br/>
that you were sent to us. It's<br/>
nice to have one brave man in the<br/>
platoon.</p>
<h3>111. MED. SHOT - AT DOOR</h3>
<p>as it opens, and Steiner, his uniform wringing wet, COMES<br/>
IN.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Well -- are we all still here?</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
What do you mean "still here"?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(pretending surprise)<br/>
No deserters?<br/>
(walking to table)<br/>
All right, then, let's have a look<br/>
at the map before we start.</p>
<p>He looks at map. The men gather around him.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
How far is it to Krimskaya?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
About twenty miles.<br/>
(staring thought-<br/>
fully at the map)<br/>
The stuff between is regular<br/>
wilderness. And a stream<br/>
running through.<br/>
(MORE)</p>
<p><b>STEINER (CONT'D)</b><br/>
How big a stream? Suppose there's<br/>
no bridge? And the whole region<br/>
is marshy. The big question is<br/>
whether we can get through.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Then let's use the highway.</p>
<p>Steiner just looks at him.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(anxiously)<br/>
What does that look mean? Did<br/>
you see any Russians on the high-<br/>
way?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Infantry, trucks, tanks, the whole<br/>
damn Russian army.</p>
<p>There is a moment's silence.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
On the highway?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Not in the air, take my word for<br/>
it.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(strapping on ammuni-<br/>
tion box)<br/>
How are we going to cross the highway<br/>
with the Russians on it?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
It's dark, it's raining--and there<br/>
are bound to be a few gaps in the<br/>
procession. We'll wait for the<br/>
right moment and scoot across.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
It's hopeless. It's just plain<br/>
suicide.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(slinging his tommy<br/>
gun over his shoulder)<br/>
We're eight self-reliant, resource-<br/>
ful Germans. We'll make it.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(sardonically to Kern)<br/>
There! Do you feel better?</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
Suppose we do make it. The Russians<br/>
will be in Krimskaya before us.<br/>
That means to get to our lines,<br/>
we'll have to cross theirs. How?<br/>
How, I'm asking?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(his boxes are<br/>
strapped to him)<br/>
We can tunnel beneath the Russians<br/>
-- or we can pole vault over them.<br/>
Are we all ready?</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(groaning)<br/>
You can joke, but we're finished.<br/>
Finished.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Of course we are. No doubt about<br/>
it. And because you have so<br/>
brilliantly pointed that out,<br/>
you may lead the way.</p>
<p>He flings the door open I motions for Kern to start the<br/>
exodus. Kern looks sour, but leads the way. The others<br/>
squeeze past Steiner at the door. When they are GONE,<br/>
Steiner kicks the stove so that it falls over, spilling<br/>
its golden embers on the floor. Then he GOES OUT, closing<br/>
the door behind him.</p>
<h3>112. FULL SHOT - THE PLATOON</h3>
<p>huddled together in the rain, waiting for Steiner. After<br/>
a moment, he comes INTO the SCENE. He jerks his head<br/>
in the direction he wishes them to take. Then he starts<br/>
off. The men exchange glances, but no one says a word.<br/>
They trudge off.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<h3>113. OPEN PLOWLANO - NIGHT</h3>
<p>It is still dark, but in the east the sky is beginning to<br/>
lighten. In the distance WE SEE the line of men walking<br/>
slowly, their heads bent against the rain.</p>
<h3>114. MED. SHOT - THE MEN WALKING</h3>
<p>The ANGLE FAVORS Zoll and Kern. They are panting under the<br/>
burden of their machine-guns and boxes of ammunition.<br/>
They are cursing under their breaths. The CAMERA PANS<br/>
DOWN to their boots. They are caked with great lumps of<br/>
muddy soil.</p>
<h3>115. MED. SHOT - STEINER - AT HEAD OF LINE</h3>
<p>His face expressionless, he is walking steadily on. Ahead<br/>
of him the terrain begins to slope upward. Suddenly,<br/>
Steiner stops in his tracks r holds his hands up for the<br/>
men to stop.</p>
<h3>116. MED. SHOT - KERN, KRUGER, ZOLL AND SCHNURRBART</h3>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
What the devil's the matter now?</p>
<p>No one answers. Schnurrbart motions for them to listen.<br/>
After a moment, the low DRONE of big MOTORS, the CREAKING<br/>
of heavily laden TRUCKS is HEARD. Also an occasional<br/>
windblown SHOUT is HEARD.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(whispering)<br/>
Russians.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(nervously)<br/>
A whole army.</p>
<p>With quivering fingers he unthinkingly reaches for his<br/>
cigarettes and thrusts one between his lips. As he strikes<br/>
a match, Steiner suddenly APPEARS in front of him. There<br/>
is a sharp SLAPPING SOUND, followed by a RAIN of SPARKS<br/>
from the crushed cigarette. Kern utters a whimpering<br/>
sound and presses both hands against his mouth.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(voice thick with<br/>
rage)<br/>
You idiot!</p>
<p>The men look at him in alarm, but he whirls around and<br/>
runs forward, signaling for the men to follow.</p>
<h3>117. MED. SHOT - KERN</h3>
<p>as he walks along. There is a burn on his upper lip<br/>
which he pats tenderly. His face is clouded with resent-<br/>
ment. The VOICES ahead become increasingly distinct. The<br/>
crisp TREAD of nailed boots is very marked -- grows even<br/>
louder.</p>
<h3>118. MED. SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>signaling for the men to halt. He walks back to the<br/>
group.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(to Schnurrbart and<br/>
Anselm)<br/>
You come with me. The rest will<br/>
wait here.</p>
<p>Steiner, Anselm and Schnurrbart run off. The men watch them<br/>
as, bent low, they DISAPPEAR into the darkness. Then,<br/>
one by one, the men sink down onto the wet ground. For a<br/>
few moments no one has the strength or the inclination to<br/>
speak. Then --</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
He shouldn't have hit you.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Why not?</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
What's more important than the<br/>
treatment of one German soldier by<br/>
another -- I'd like to know.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
I'll tell you what's more important --<br/>
(MORE)</p>
<p><b>KRUGER (CONT'D)</b><br/>
(brings his face<br/>
close to Zoll's)<br/>
It's more important that we have to<br/>
get out of here. And you know why?<br/>
I'll tell you --</p>
<p>He pokes his finger into Zoll's chest. Zoll moves indignantly<br/>
back.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
We have to get out so that we'll<br/>
be on time to get into the next<br/>
mess. Out of one mess into the<br/>
next. That's been going on for<br/>
three years, and it'll go on until<br/>
we get into one mess good and deep<br/>
and don't come out of it --</p>
<p>He has worked himself into such a rage that he can't go on.<br/>
There is another morose silence. Zoll sits up on one<br/>
elbow, listens.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
I think all that activity on the<br/>
highway is slackening.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
Don't worry. We'll never get<br/>
across.</p>
<p>He stops, for everyone is listening intently. He listens<br/>
too. There isn't a sound from the direction of the highway.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(whispering)<br/>
I don't hear a thing....</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Here comes somebody --</p>
<p>Every head turns.</p>
<h3>119. LONG SHOT - A FIGURE COMING OUT OF THE MIST</h3>
<p>From the group's P.O.V. The figure stops.</p>
<h3>120. FULL SHOT - GROUP</h3>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
It's Anselm.</p>
<p>Anselm stops, waves his fist in the air.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Let's go.</p>
<p>They snatch their guns, run up the slope, DISAPPEAR into<br/>
the mist.</p>
<h3>121. CROWN OF HILL</h3>
<p>Beneath it lies the highway in the gray dawn LIGHT.<br/>
Deserted. In the b.g. WE SEE the platoon slipping down<br/>
the steep decline and racing across the trampled, rutted<br/>
width of the road toward the edge of the woods which rise<br/>
like a dark wall against the further mountains.</p>
<h3>122. MED. SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>He is standing about 100 yards in the forest, looking toward<br/>
the highway. The men can be seen running towards him.<br/>
In a few seconds, they reach Steiner. As they fight to<br/>
catch their breaths, Steiner looks at them, triumph in his<br/>
eyes.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
Well --</p>
<p>Steiner holds up his hand for quiet. They listen. The<br/>
rumble of vehicles can be HEARD from the highway.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(grinning)<br/>
Now that we're here that sounds<br/>
like music to me.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(dryly)<br/>
I think it's a little early for<br/>
congratulations.<br/>
(picks up his gear)<br/>
We're ready.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
Sergeant --</p>
<p>Steiner turns to regard him.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
Before we start, there's a matter<br/>
I'd like to bring up. The matter<br/>
of your treatment of a comrade,<br/>
Private Kern.</p>
<p>Steiner looks at him closely.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
One soldier of the Fuhrer is just<br/>
as -- good as --</p>
<p>He wilts under Steiner's gaze, stops.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(coldly)<br/>
Please continue. Just as good as<br/>
what?</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(weakening)<br/>
Anyway -- I believe I speak for<br/>
all the others --</p>
<p>Steiner looks at the others.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(to Zoll)<br/>
Why don't you mind your own lousy<br/>
business! It was idiotic of me<br/>
to light that cigarette. Now,<br/>
let's go.</p>
<p>Steiner looks at Zoll, then, without a word, turns and<br/>
starts walking. The others follow.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<h3>123. STREET - IN KRIMSKAYA - DAY</h3>
<p>The scene is one of great bustle and activity. Trucks are<br/>
unloading. Anti-aircraft guns are being set up on empty<br/>
lots between houses. A Staff car speeds INTO the SCENE,<br/>
jolts to a stop before one of the houses. Captain Kiesel<br/>
alights, taking a salute from the SENTRY, ENTERS one of<br/>
the houses.</p>
<h3>124. INT. HOUSE - STRANSKY AND TRIEBIG</h3>
<p>are supervising the installation of phones. Kiesel comes<br/>
RUNNING IN.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
You're slow with those phones,<br/>
Captain. Regiment has been trying<br/>
to speak to you.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
They'll be in any minute, Captain<br/>
Kiesel.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
with the Russians breathing down<br/>
our necks, the Colonel wants a<br/>
patrol out front. I think Steiner's<br/>
the most experienced --</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Sorry, Captain. I haven't the<br/>
faintest idea of the whereabouts<br/>
of Steiner and his platoon.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
What do you mean by that?<br/>
(stares at Stransky)<br/>
You mean you didn't pull him out<br/>
of line and bring him back? You<br/>
had your orders.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I tried to contact Steiner immediately<br/>
-- wasn't that so, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Yes, Captain.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
But he had already moved his platoon<br/>
from the bunker.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Why? He had orders not to move till<br/>
dark.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(shrugging)<br/>
You know Steiner Disobeying orders<br/>
is a speciality of his.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
How the devil is he going to get<br/>
back here? He's got the whole<br/>
Russian army to get through.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
He had his orders--he disregarded<br/>
them.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
It doesn't sound like Steiner.<br/>
He'd risk his own neck, not a<br/>
whole platoon's --<br/>
(looks at Stransky<br/>
closely)<br/>
I think I can promise you a full<br/>
investigation, Captain Stransky,<br/>
when Steiner gets back. If he<br/>
gets back.</p>
<p>He turns and walks OUT rapidly. The telephone men are<br/>
still in the room, so Stransky and Triebig can only exchange<br/>
covert congratulatory glances. The CAMERA MOVES to the<br/>
window, THROUGH IT to an open field and as it MOVES EAST...</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<h3>125. OVERHEAD SHOT - THICK WOODS - DAY</h3>
<p>The CAMERA MOVES DOWN through thorny undergrowth until<br/>
it picks up Steiner's platoon, fighting their weary way<br/>
through. The undergrowth has ripped the men's uniforms<br/>
and scratched their hands and faces. Sweat is pouring<br/>
from their faces. They are almost continually s lapping at<br/>
almost invisible stinging mites which hover about them.<br/>
The CAMERA PANS DOWN to two pair of boots slogging through<br/>
the marsh. It is evident that they are suffering a great<br/>
deal.</p>
<h3>126. LONG SHOT - THE SUN LOW IN THE SKY</h3>
<p>It will be dark in a little while. From THIS ANGLE the<br/>
CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN into the forest. It picks out Steiner<br/>
trudging in water that is halfway up to his knees.</p>
<p>There is no one in sight behind him. Suddenly, from the<br/>
rear there are HOARSE SHOUTS. Steiner stops, turns,<br/>
listens. The SHOUTS are HEARD again. Steiner starts<br/>
back, CAMERA TRUCKING with him. There is a slight rise<br/>
in the terrain, which is firm and dry. Most of the men<br/>
are stretched out on the ground.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What's the trouble?</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
You'll have to call a rest, Rolf.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(tersely)<br/>
We're not even half way yet.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
I know, but what can't be done<br/>
can't be done.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(reluctantly)<br/>
All right.</p>
<p>He notices Zoll, who is lying on his stomach off to one<br/>
side, his head pillowed in his arms.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Where are your ammunition boxes?</p>
<p>The others become attentive. Zoll doesn't stir. Steiner<br/>
digs the toe of his boot into Zoll's side.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Didn't you hear me?</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(a grunt)<br/>
Leave me alone.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
He had them ten minutes ago. The<br/>
swine must have dumped them.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Then he'll go back for them.</p>
<p>Zoll still doesn't move, so Steiner grips him by his<br/>
cartridge belt and pulls him to his feet. Face twisted<br/>
with fury, Zoll whirls, snatches up his rifle, brandishes<br/>
it.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(hoarsely)<br/>
Keep your dirty paws off me.<br/>
If you touch me again.</p>
<p>Steiner looks into Zoll's rabid face with a sort of<br/>
curiosity.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(quietly)<br/>
You're too much of a coward.<br/>
Watch!</p>
<p>He drops his tommy gun and gestures Schnurrbart and Kruger<br/>
back. They watch worriedly as Steiner steps so close to<br/>
Zoll that the barrel of his rifle touches his stomach.<br/>
Quietly he reaches out, grasps the rifle by the barrel and<br/>
takes it from Zoll's hands. A sort of relieved sigh goes<br/>
up from the men. Zoll stands motionless, his face re-<br/>
flecting fear, rage and shame. Steiner picks up his tommy<br/>
gun.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Get those boxes.</p>
<p>Zoll hesitates for just a second. Then he turns and walks<br/>
off INTO the brush. The men look after him grimly.</p>
<h3>127. MED. SHOT - STEINER - IN A TREE</h3>
<p>making his way to the top. When he nears it, he pushes<br/>
aside two branches to give himself a view.</p>
<h3>128. LONG SHOT - FROM STEINER'S POV</h3>
<p>An enormous expanse of reeds cuts a swath across the<br/>
woods. Brown water shimmers along the thick stems. Then<br/>
there is a hundred yard width of muddy water, then more<br/>
weeds.</p>
<h3>129. MED. SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>He looks grim as he starts his descent.

	</p><h3>130. FULL SHOT - THE MEN</h3>
<p>as they wait for Steiner.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
I bet this is the only dry spot<br/>
for miles around. Why don't we<br/>
just stay here?</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
Don't be silly. They won't know<br/>
where to send our pay. Ah --</p>
<p>For Steiner has dropped out of the tree.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Well -- ?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Reeds, swamp, open water, more reeds,<br/>
more swamp. Worse than I thought<br/>
it would be.</p>
<p>Steiner spreads the map on the ground. The men look over<br/>
his shoulders. Steiner points to something on the map.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(nods)<br/>
Tomorrow morning we'll start<br/>
before dawn.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(querulously)<br/>
Straight into the creek?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Shut up! We'll march north to the<br/>
road.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
How far is that?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
About thirty miles.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Thirty miles! It's crazy! This<br/>
way we're no more than eight miles<br/>
from Krimskaya!</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Sure. If we could cross that<br/>
swamp, and we can't!</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Before I march thirty miles I need<br/>
something to eat.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
If you've got to have something<br/>
to eat, try tree bark. Boiled in<br/>
soft water it's supposed to be<br/>
edible. Damn it all, don't act<br/>
like a bunch of children.</p>
<p>They look shame-faced, but Kruger growls...</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
You've seen what the water looks<br/>
like. Like a hundred cows have<br/>
been scheissing in it.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Then boil it and skim it. You<br/>
won't mind the filth -- you've got<br/>
a pig's stomach anyway.</p>
<p>The men grin.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
We'll make a soup. Put the meat<br/>
and bread right in it. Kruger<br/>
and Schnurrbart fetch water. But<br/>
don't anybody try drinking the<br/>
muck before it's boiled. The rest<br/>
of us can gather wood.</p>
<p>The men make a movement to start.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Wait a minute -- we may as well<br/>
settle this now. We'll need a<br/>
volunteer for sentry duty tonight.<br/>
At least to start it off --</p>
<p>Nobody answers. The men don't look at each other.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I know you're all tired, but --</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
Sergeant, I --</p>
<p>At this moment, a NOISE in the brush causes all heads to<br/>
turn. An exhausted Zoll, lugging the ammunition boxes'<br/>
struggles INTO the SCENE. Steiner looks at him, then turns<br/>
to Kern.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
That's all right. The problem is<br/>
solved.</p>
<p>The men laugh, start off. Zoll looks puzzled by the laughter.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<h3>131. CLOSE SHOT - SMALL SMOLDERING CAMP FIRE</h3>
<p>The CAMERA PULLS BACK to REVEAL Kruger, Schnurrbart, Kern<br/>
and Anselm asleep on the ground in various uncomfortable<br/>
postures. Pawn is breaking in the sky. The air is filled<br/>
with the croaking SOUND of FROGS.</p>
<h3>132. MED. SHOT - KRUGER</h3>
<p>as he slowly awakens. It is a moment before he is fully<br/>
awake. He reaches out and nudges Kern awake.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
Huh? -- What? -- Oh -- what's up?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Where's Steiner, do you know?</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
He just got up sometime ago and<br/>
went off somewhere.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Did he say where?</p>
<p>By this time the conversation has awakened the other men.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
I asked him, but you know Steiner<br/>
-- he just gave me a look and off<br/>
he went. I got the shits.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
(grimly)<br/>
Steiner goes -- and you get scared'<br/>
huh?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(looks around at all<br/>
the faces)<br/>
We're all scared the minute Rolf's<br/>
not around to hold our hands.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
(tosses a branch into<br/>
the fire, sending up<br/>
a shower of sparks)<br/>
He'll be back. Anselm, relieve Zoll.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(rebelliously)<br/>
Why me?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Hurry up and relieve Zoll. On the<br/>
double.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
You and Schnurrbart -- big shots!<br/>
Lousy noncoms! You're all alike.<br/>
Rank goes right to your heads. It<br/>
stinks. The whole damned army<br/>
stinks. And you, Kruger, stink<br/>
worst of all!</p>
<p>Kruger picks up a dry stick of wood which is only partially<br/>
in the fire and tosses it at Anselm, who barely throws his<br/>
hand up in time. Then, with a cry of rage, he jumps across<br/>
the firs and onto Kruger's neck. The two men struggle on<br/>
the ground.</p>
<p><b>KERN, SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
(simultaneously)<br/>
Come on, now - stop it. Kruger!<br/>
Anselm!</p>
<p>Zoll comes running IN from his sentry post.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
What's going on here?</p>
<p>Zoll, assisted by Kern, tries to separate the two men who<br/>
are locked together on the ground.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
Watch out -- somebody's going to get<br/>
burned in the fire!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Steiner's voice is heard.</p>
<p><b>STEINER'S VOICE</b><br/>
Zoll -- Kern! Let them fight it out.</p>
<h3>133. MED. SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>His gun is in the back of an elderly RUSSIAN. The others<br/>
are in the b.g.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Why shouldn't they kill each<br/>
other? Why should the Russians<br/>
have to do it?</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Who the hell is that?</p>
<p>The old man sinks to the ground.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
It's my guess he's a very old<br/>
Russian -- what's yours?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Where did you find him, Rolf?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
There's a dirt road about four<br/>
miles from here. The road leads<br/>
to a bridge. He was guarding it.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
A bridge! A bridge that crosses<br/>
the swamp, you mean?</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Eureka, that means we don't have<br/>
to march thirty miles to the<br/>
highway, doesn't it?</p>
<p><b>KERN'S VOICE</b><br/>
Not to mention the forty more to<br/>
Krimskaya.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(feeling his<br/>
throat)<br/>
Doesn't anybody care that my neck<br/>
is broken?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Not so fast. On the other side<br/>
of the bridge there's a house. and<br/>
there are Russians in the house.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
How do you know -- did you see any?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
No, but there was smoke coming out<br/>
of the chimney. You ask him how<br/>
many there are.</p>
<p>Kruger talks in Russian to the old man, who replies. Then!</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
He says there's two wagons and<br/>
two horses.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
To hell with that. Ask him how<br/>
many men there are in that house.</p>
<p>Kruger speaks in Russian, but the old man just shakes his<br/>
head.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
How many men are there in the<br/>
house?</p>
<p>Kruger speaks to the old man who closes his eyes and turns<br/>
his head aside.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
He won't say.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(putting the muzzle<br/>
of his gun against<br/>
the old man's head)<br/>
He has to. Ask him again.</p>
<p>Kruger expostulates with the Russian, illustrating his words<br/>
with unmistakable gestures. The Russian slowly opens his<br/>
eyes. Steiner is regarding him without expression. A<br/>
brief smile passes over the Russian's wrinkled, parchment-<br/>
like face, and he says a few words.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What is he saying?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
He says he is an old man.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(calmly)<br/>
We can see that. I admire him, but<br/>
I'm going to have to shoot him.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Isn't it dangerous, firing a shot?<br/>
There may be some of them around,<br/>
looking for him.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
You may be right. On the other<br/>
hand, we can't waste time hanging<br/>
him.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
Well, let's see -- there's strangu-<br/>
lation, drowning, stoning --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
If we had the time we'd let you<br/>
talk him to death.</p>
<p>Pause. Steiner takes a knife from his scabbard. The men<br/>
are very silent.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Any volunteers?</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(after a moment)<br/>
How about you, Zoll? You were a<br/>
butcher in civilian life, weren't<br/>
you?</p>
<p>The joke falls flat, even with Anselm.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(after a moment)<br/>
If everybody's scared, I might<br/>
have a try at it.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
No. I'll make it quick and clean.<br/>
(lifts the Russian<br/>
to his feet, to<br/>
Kruger)<br/>
We'll give him one more chance.<br/>
Tell him what I'm going to do.</p>
<p>Kruger speaks to the Russian who says nothing, doesn't<br/>
even shake his head.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
All right, then --</p>
<p>He pushes the Russian ahead of him toward a grove of small<br/>
trees, CAMERA TRUCKING with them.</p>
<h3>134. FULL SHOT - GROUP</h3>
<p>They stand around in silence. A low GASP is HEARD O.S.<br/>
The men tense. Anselm ventures to look off.</p>
<h3>135. LONG SHOT - ANSELM'S POV</h3>
<p>Steiner is seen bent over, leaning against a tree.</p>
<h3>136. FULL SHOT - GROUP</h3>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
I'll say this for Steiner. At<br/>
least he's throwing up.</p>
<p>All eyes are fixed o.s. After a few moments, Steiner<br/>
comes back IN. His knife and scabbard are both gone.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
All right, get your things together.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
I wonder how many Russians there<br/>
are in that house.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Since we've got to cross that bridge,<br/>
it doesn't matter how many there are.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
Aren't we too few for the job?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
No. There's only the front door<br/>
and one window on the side. We'll<br/>
smoke them out with grenades, then<br/>
mow them down as they come out.<br/>
(looks at Zoll)<br/>
And hang on to your ammunition boxes.<br/>
We're going to need them.</p>
<p>Steiner picks up his pack.</p>
<h3>137. LONG SHOT - A ONE-STORY HOUSE - DAY</h3>
<p>It is made of massive logs. Smoke is pouring from one of<br/>
the chimneys. The CAMERA STARTS PULLING BACK and we see<br/>
that a creek flows parallel to the house. Its bank is<br/>
overgrown with shoulder-high reeds which sway gently in<br/>
the wind. Two unhitched wagons, their contents concealed<br/>
under dark brown canvas' stand by the side of the house.<br/>
Then we see a primitive but wide wooden bridge with rails<br/>
on both sides. In the center, leaning against the narrow<br/>
slats of the railing, stands a GUARD -- an elderly man with<br/>
a yellow, wrinkled face. His cap is pushed back on his<br/>
head and he is staring dully at the dirty surface of the<br/>
water. His tommy gun is slung diagonally across his back.<br/>
The CAMERA CONTINUES BACKWARD across the bridge into the<br/>
reeds. Finally, it comes to rest on the flattened shapes<br/>
of Steiner and his platoon who are gazing intently at the<br/>
sight. The men speak in whispers.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
You realize how important it is<br/>
that no one -- not a single one --<br/>
escapes?</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
We won't be able to get them all.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
We have to get them all. Once the<br/>
Russians find out there are Germans<br/>
behind their lines there'll be<br/>
hundreds of them beating the bushes<br/>
for us.</p>
<p>He looks at the men significantly. They nod grimly.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Anselm -- you and Kruger stay here.<br/>
Set up the machine gun -- see that no<br/>
one gets past this way. The rest<br/>
will come with me. Keep your heads<br/>
behind the trees -- and remember, if<br/>
one of them gets away we're sunk.</p>
<p>with bent back, he moves forward, the men following.<br/>
Anselm starts setting up the machine gun.</p>
<h3>138. MED. SHOT - STEINER AND MEN</h3>
<p>walking cautiously through the woods to get on the other<br/>
side of the house. The CAMERA FOCUSES on Zoll, who is<br/>
last in line. His eyes are fixed on the ground, on small<br/>
patches of SUNLIGHT on the ground. They change shape,<br/>
expand and contract each time the leaves stir overhead.<br/>
Suddenly Zoll takes mincing little steps, now jumping or<br/>
skipping to avoid a band of SUNLIGHT. He becomes so<br/>
absorbed in this that he is oblivious to everything else.<br/>
He doesn't notice that Steiner is standing in his path,<br/>
watching him curiously. Zoll is on the point of jumping<br/>
over a broad s trip of LIGHT when his eyes meet Steiner's.<br/>
His intended jump becomes a halting step that carries him<br/>
right into the middle of the SUNLIT band. Zoll stands<br/>
still, looking into Steiner's face.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(weak smile)<br/>
Just a game --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(incredulously)<br/>
A what? A game?</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(apologetically)<br/>
When we were kids -- a came -- we'd<br/>
race through the woods. No one<br/>
was allowed to step on a spot of<br/>
sunlight --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I see. And would you like us to<br/>
join you in the game? Perhaps we<br/>
could find the time.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
I only thought -- silly idea -- if I<br/>
don't step on a spot of sunlight<br/>
now I'd come through this all right.</p>
<p>He smiles an abject, apologetic smile. Steiner's face<br/>
is expressionless. He turns to the men, motions them to<br/>
the ground. Zoll is the last to obey.</p>
<h3>139. MED. SHOT - STEINER ON THE GROUND</h3>
<p>The men behind him.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I'll take care of the gentleman<br/>
on the bridge. When I run -- you<br/>
follow me --<br/>
(looks at Zoll)<br/>
-- taking special care to avoid<br/>
the spots of sunlight.</p>
<p>Zoll flashes a look of hatred at Steiner, but remains quiet.<br/>
Steiner lifts his tommy gun, sights it at the man on the<br/>
bridge. He takes his time. Beside him, Kern is trembling<br/>
visibly.</p>
<h3>140. LONG SHOT - THE GUARD ON THE BRIDGE</h3>
<p>He has not changed his position.</p>
<h3>141. ANGLE - OVER STEINER'S SHOULDER</h3>
<p>SHOOTING TOWARD the Guard in the b.g. Steiner is still<br/>
aiming.</p>
<p>Then he FIRES -- a whipping round of SHOTS. In the b.g., we<br/>
SEE the man on the bridge start to move as though he stood<br/>
on a whirling disc. Then his hands grip the wooden railing<br/>
for support. His legs sag, and he slides, knees first,<br/>
underneath the railing and into the dirty water. Steiner<br/>
jumps to his feet, runs madly for the bridge, the men<br/>
following.</p>
<h3>142. OTHER SIDE OF BRIDGE</h3>
<p>as Steiner comes across, throws himself flat on the ground.<br/>
The others, close behind, do the same. They all SHOOT<br/>
round after round at the doors of the hut. Then --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(holding up his hand)<br/>
Stop!</p>
<p>A FINAL BURST from Kern and then there is stillness. The<br/>
men look toward the house.</p>
<h3>143. LONG SHOT - THE HOUSE</h3>
<p>There is not a sound from the house. Not a single sign<br/>
of any activity.

	</p><h3>144. MED. SHOT - THE MEN</h3>
<p>still lying flat on their stomachs. They turn their faces<br/>
to look at each other questioningly.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(hopefully)<br/>
Maybe there's nobody in the house.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Don't worry, there is.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
Well, it can't be too large a<br/>
force.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
Enough to give us a hero's death.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
(to Steiner)<br/>
What do you make of it?</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(excitedly)<br/>
Look -- !</p>
<p>A figure is rushing toward them.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Don't shoot -- it's Kruger!</p>
<p>Kruger comes RUNNING IN, out of breath.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Rolf --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(sharply)<br/>
Why did you leave your post?<br/>
Anselm can't handle them alone.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Anselm is in the house.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Didn't you hear the screaming?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Screaming?<br/>
(looks at the men<br/>
for confirmation)</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Women's screams, then moans. So<br/>
Anselm went in.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(bitterly)<br/>
Naturally. If it's anything to<br/>
do with women --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What do you mean, women?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
I mean women! Anselm says to come<br/>
over.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Well, it's nice of him to invite<br/>
us. Kern, you stay outside. Fire.<br/>
one shot if you see anyone coming.</p>
<p>He gets up, runs toward the house, the men following.</p>
<h3>145. EXT. HOUSE</h3>
<p>as Steiner comes INTO the SCENE, kicks open the front door.</p>
<h3>146. INT. HOUSE - HALL</h3>
<p>It is a narrow hall, which separates two rooms. From the<br/>
left room comes a weird MOAN. The men look at each other.<br/>
Steiner walks to the room.</p>
<h3>147. INT. ROOM</h3>
<p>The entire long wall of the room is taken up by a heap of<br/>
straw covered with blankets. Crowded together in the rear<br/>
half of the room, faces half-defiant, half-terrified, are<br/>
about a dozen and a half WOMEN in Russian uniforms. They<br/>
carry no weapons. Most of them are big breasted, stocky<br/>
women. Their full blouses, reaching down over their hips,<br/>
are gathered at the waist by broad belts. One or two<br/>
are fairly young and attractive, and there is one exceed-<br/>
ingly pretty GIRL. At the women's feet, bedded down on<br/>
the straw, lies a young WOMAN, the clothing stripped away<br/>
from the upper part of her body, a blood-soaked bandage<br/>
Covering her right breast. Her eyes are closed, she emits<br/>
the weird MOAN.<br/>
Anselm is guarding them. Steiner and the men stop in their<br/>
tracks as they see the women.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(grinning broadly)<br/>
I hope you put me in for the Iron<br/>
Cross, Sergeant. I took them<br/>
single-handed.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Well, what do we do with them?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What do you do with armed guerrillas,<br/>
male or female?</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
These are not guerrillas. They're<br/>
regular uniformed troops. Besides<br/>
-- they had no arms.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
If they're regular troops, we'll<br/>
treat them as we must treat all<br/>
prisoners in our situation.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
(gasping)<br/>
You mean, shoot them?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Do you see any other way? If<br/>
one of them escapes and gets to<br/>
the Russian lines before us, we're<br/>
done for.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
Steiner is right. The women must<br/>
be killed.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(looks at Zoll)<br/>
Despite the fact that you agree<br/>
with me, I still feel I'm right.</p>
<p>His glance falls on the wounded woman. She is looking at<br/>
him with an expression of wild horror. An older WOMAN<br/>
beside her speaks in Russian.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What did she say, Kruger?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
She says there's a kettle of hot<br/>
water in the room across the<br/>
hall. Please help the girl, she<br/>
says.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Anselm, get the water. We'll clean<br/>
the wound.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(bewildered)<br/>
What's the sense of fixing her up,<br/>
if you're going to shoot her?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(sharply)<br/>
Get the water.</p>
<p>Anselm shrugs, GOES OUT.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(to Kruger)<br/>
Ask them where they come from<br/>
and where they were going. Tell<br/>
them if they lie to us we'll throw<br/>
them in the creek.</p>
<p>Kruger talks in Russian, the older Woman, who appears to<br/>
be an officer, replies.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(to Steiner)<br/>
They belong to the B d th Women's<br/>
Mortar Battalion and are on their<br/>
way from Maihop to Krimskaya. I<br/>
think she's telling the truth.</p>
<p>Steiner looks grim. Anselm COMES IN with a bowl of hot<br/>
water, sets it on the floor.</p>
<h3>148. MED. SHOT - STEINER AND WOUNDED WOMAN</h3>
<p>as he bends down beside her. She tries to roll back<br/>
against the wall.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Take it easy. What do you think<br/>
I want to do?</p>
<p>He lifts the bandage. We do not see the wound, but from<br/>
Steiner's face, we know that it is a serious one.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(opening his first<br/>
aid kit)<br/>
Are you in pain?</p>
<p>The woman understands, nods.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(enigmatically)<br/>
The pain will be over soon.</p>
<p>He starts to wash the wound. In the b.g., we CAN SEE that<br/>
the other women have not changed their posture. They<br/>
are still huddled together against the wall, fearfully<br/>
watching his movements.<br/>
Steiner lays a compress on the wound.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
This is ridiculous. A nice clean<br/>
bandage -- then a bullet.</p>
<p>Before Steiner can reply there is a NOISE at the door.</p>
<h3>149. MED. SHOT - KERN AND OLD RUSSIAN</h3>
<p>Kern has his gun in the Russian's back. The Russian is<br/>
squat and stocky and despite his age looks powerful.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(grinning proudly)<br/>
He practically walked into our<br/>
arms --</p>
<p><b>OLD RUSSIAN</b><br/>
(to Steiner, raising<br/>
his hand pleadingly)<br/>
Captain --</p>
<p>Steiner pushes him in the direction of the women, motions<br/>
for him to lie down. As the old man reels, several of<br/>
the women SCREAM.</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
I had a look at the wagons, Sergeant<br/>
-- there's plenty of food. Canned.<br/>
stuff.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Good. Zoll, you stay here. If<br/>
any of the women starts anything,<br/>
shoot her at once.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(as they walk off)<br/>
When do I get to eat?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Don't be in such a hurry. Who<br/>
wants to eat?</p>
<p>He starts OUT.</p>
<h3>150. CLOSE SHOT - PAIR OF HIGHLY POLISHED OFFICER'S BOOTS</h3>
<p>CAMERA PANS UP to a MED. SHOT of Colonel Brandt on the<br/>
telephone. The scene is obviously his new headquarters<br/>
in Krimskaya, the second floor of a Russian building.<br/>
Captain Kiesel stands near the window, listening.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Yes, General.... Yes, General,<br/>
we're so solidly dug in, it seems<br/>
almost a shame --<br/>
(smiles ironically<br/>
at Kiesel)<br/>
I say that, General, because in<br/>
four or five days -- we'll be driven<br/>
out of these beautifully dug-in<br/>
positions.<br/>
(another smile<br/>
to Kiesel)<br/>
Certainly, General. I know about<br/>
German valor. without that valor,<br/>
I wouldn't give us more than two<br/>
days -- Yes, General. I will, sir.<br/>
(hangs up, shrugs<br/>
in Kiesel'S<br/>
direction)<br/>
The General was short with me; but<br/>
he knows the truth as well as I do.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Of course. It's always he who<br/>
orders us to fall back, isn't it?</p>
<p>There is a KNOCK at the door.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Come in.</p>
<p>An ORDERLY opens the door for a CAPTAIN.</p>
<p><b>CAPTAIN KILIUS</b><br/>
Captain Kilius reporting, sir.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Oh, yes. You have your orders?</p>
<p><b>KILIUS</b><br/>
Yes, sir. And a letter for you.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(as he opens the<br/>
envelope)<br/>
This is Captain Kiesel--</p>
<p>Kiesel and Kilius shake hands.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Captain Kilius comes to us from<br/>
the Western Front.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Really? Whatever induced you to<br/>
leave, Captain?</p>
<p>Kilius smiles wanly. Brandt, reading the letter, snorts<br/>
loudly.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Didn't you once mention Captain<br/>
Stransky's good connections?</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
There is a Major General Stransky<br/>
attached to Army High Command,<br/>
South. He is, I think, a cousin<br/>
of Captain Stransky's.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
I see.<br/>
(tosses letter on<br/>
table as if it<br/>
were filth)<br/>
You can guess what that is, can't<br/>
you?</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
His transfer, of course.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(grimly)<br/>
Exactly. Herr Stransky is to report<br/>
to Paris within a week.</p>
<p>There's a silence in the room as if both men had forgotten<br/>
the presence of Kilius. Then Brandt recovers. He turns<br/>
to Kilius.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Please excuse me' Captain. My<br/>
orderly will arrange for your<br/>
billeting.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Don't unpack too thoroughly.<br/>
We'll be on the move soon.</p>
<p><b>KILIUS</b><br/>
(smiles)<br/>
Thank you, Colonel Brandt.</p>
<p>Se salutes, LEAVES.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
He's so new here, he didn't even<br/>
ask in which direction.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
That bastard, Stransky!<br/>
(shrugs)<br/>
without Steiner to contradict him,<br/>
he'll get his Iron Cross and strut<br/>
all over Paris. That arrogant<br/>
bastard!<br/>
(pause)<br/>
So Stransky will be in Paris, while<br/>
Steiner --<br/>
(looks glumly out<br/>
the window)<br/>
God knows where he is --</p>
<h3>151. CLOSE SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>stuffing food into his mouth. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to<br/>
show the scene as the exterior of the house, at one of the<br/>
wagons.</p>
<p>The other men are eating greedily too. Steiner turns,<br/>
looks toward the window of the house.</p>
<h3>152. CLOSE SHOT - ZOLL'S FACE - AT WINDOW</h3>
<p>The CAMERA PULLS BACK to take in the Russian female prisoners<br/>
and the old man. The women are still huddled close together<br/>
as close to the wall as they can get. They are asleep or<br/>
pretending to be asleep. The wounded woman lies with her<br/>
head on another woman's lap. Her eyes are closed and she<br/>
MOANS softly in her sleep.</p>
<h3>153. MED. SHOT - OLD MAN AND YOUNG GIRL</h3>
<p>They are sitting in the forefront, and are the only ones<br/>
not asleep. Their heads are together and they are<br/>
whispering. The girl is no more than twenty and very<br/>
pretty. The old man's expression is very worried.</p>
<h3>154. MED. SHOT - ZOLL</h3>
<p>as he turns from the window. He sees the old man and the<br/>
young girl whispering.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
Shut up, you two!</p>
<p>The old man and young girl draw slightly apart. The girl<br/>
looks at Zoll and her expression is frightened.</p>
<h3>155. CLOSE SHOT - ZOLL</h3>
<p>as he looks at the girl. His eyes glide searchingly over<br/>
her figure. It is very evident what he is thinking.<br/>
He looks at her quite a while, then, with an effort, turns<br/>
away, walks to the door, stands with his back to it, tries<br/>
not to look at the girl.</p>
<h3>156. MED. SHOT - GIRL AND OLD MAN</h3>
<p>The old man has moved closer to her, and has cautiously<br/>
resumed his whispering. The girl's expression is still<br/>
tense. She draws back in fright as Zoll suddenly comes<br/>
INTO the SCENE.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
I told you to be quiet, didn't<br/>
I?</p>
<p>He lifts his foot and, kicking his boot against the old<br/>
man's shoulder, sends him sprawling on his back. The old<br/>
man looks up at him, then, as if resigned, turns over on<br/>
his side. Zoll looks at the girl. It is some time before<br/>
he takes his gaze away. Then, he walks to the window,<br/>
looks out again. In the b.g., we SEE the men grouped<br/>
around the fire, evidently eating. After a moment, Zoll<br/>
turns away from the window. The CAMERA is CLOSE on his<br/>
FACE and we SEE him gape and stand rooted to the spot.<br/>
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to take in Zoll and the young girl.<br/>
Her head is bowed and she is fingering her blouse. The<br/>
top button is already open. She doesn't look at Zoll and<br/>
she slowly unfastens the second button. Zoll gulps, then<br/>
looks at the old man who is lying on his side, eyes closed.<br/>
Zoll's eyes take in the rest of the room, the CAMERA PANNING<br/>
with his gaze. Most of the women seem to be asleep, or are<br/>
sitting with heads drooping, staring at the floor. Then,<br/>
the CAMERA comes to rest on the young girl again. She is<br/>
looking steadily toward Zoll who watches her in fascination.<br/>
She unfastens another button. Then she closes one eye in<br/>
a slow wink and smiles at Zoll.</p>
<h3>157. CLOSE SHOT - ZOLL</h3>
<p>He holds his breath. He is perspiring slightly.</p>
<h3>158. MED. SHOT - ZOLL AND GIRL</h3>
<p>The door to the hall is in the b.g. The girl has now<br/>
unbuttoned the last button and is looking smilingly at<br/>
Zoll, who stands hesitant. 'But now, the tread of heavy<br/>
BOOTS is HEARD in the hall. Zoll hurriedly jumps to the<br/>
wall and comes to an attitude of strict attention. The<br/>
door opens and Schnurrbart APPEARS.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Everything all right?</p>
<p>Zoll manages to nod indifferently. Out of the corner of<br/>
his eye he looks toward the girl. She is holding her<br/>
blouse closed and staring vacantly at the floor.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
As soon as Kern has finished eating<br/>
he'll take over so you can eat.<br/>
(his eyes rove over<br/>
the prisoners)<br/>
They asleep?</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(curtly)<br/>
They seem to be.</p>
<p>He is anxious for Schnurrbart to leave, but Schnurrbart<br/>
takes his time. He comes all the way into the room, his<br/>
eyes on the prisoners.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(impatiently)<br/>
What do you want? Everything<br/>
is all right.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Doesn't it seem funny to you that<br/>
they're all asleep?</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
Why is it so funny?</p>
<p>Schnurrbart shrugs, goes OUT. Zoll kicks the door shut,<br/>
quickly turns to look at the girl.</p>
<h3>159. MED. SHOT - THE GIRL</h3>
<p>She has opened her eyes and is looking encouragingly at<br/>
Zoll. When he doesn't stir, she spreads her blouse open,<br/>
puts her hand under her undershirt. with her other hand<br/>
she beckons to Zoll.

	</p><h3>160. CLOSE SHOT - ZOLL</h3>
<p>He digs his teeth into his lower lip. He stands as if<br/>
nailed to the spot. His eyes sweep over the heads of<br/>
the other prisoners. pause upon the face of the man.<br/>
Although the old man is lying with closed eyes, Zoll looks<br/>
at him suspiciously. But then he looks toward the girl<br/>
again --</p>
<h3>161. MED. SHOT - THE GIRL</h3>
<p>She smiles at Zoll and begins to push herself along the<br/>
floor toward him. This overcomes Zoll's fears. He<br/>
takes one last look at the old man, then beckons to the<br/>
girl with a movement of his head.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(softly)<br/>
Come. Come with me.</p>
<p>She hesitates and glances at the old man for the briefest<br/>
moment. His eyes are still closed, his back is to them.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(hoarsely, with<br/>
another gesture)<br/>
I said--come.</p>
<p>The coquettish smile on the girl's face has vanished. There<br/>
is fear in her eyes. She doesn't move. He takes one long<br/>
stride to her, grasps her shoulders tightly, pulls her to<br/>
her feet. He throws another glance at the old man who<br/>
doesn't stir. Abruptly, Zoll pulls the resisting girl<br/>
by the waist to the door. He throws open the door, pulls<br/>
the girl into the hall.</p>
<h3>162. MED. SHOT - IN HALL - ZOLL</h3>
<p>looks madly around. There is a door on the opposite side<br/>
of the hall. He turns to the girl, sees that she is trying<br/>
with her free hand to button her blouse. Zoll shoves her<br/>
toward the opposite door.</p>
<h3>163. INT. OPPOSITE ROOM</h3>
<p>as the door is flung open and Zoll, dragging the girl,<br/>
COMES IN. The room is sparsely furnished, its chief<br/>
feature being a huge wardrobe closet against the one wall.<br/>
As Zoll lays his tommy gun down in a corner, the girl<br/>
suddenly breaks loose and runs toward the door. In two<br/>
bounds, Zoll is at her side. He throws her to the ground,<br/>
falls on her, panting with exertion and excitement. She<br/>
tries to defend herself, her clenched hands battle against<br/>
his face and she begins to scream. Zoll, who has ripped<br/>
her blouse off her shoulders, drags one of the blankets<br/>
over her face, smothers her screams.</p>
<h3>164. HALL - THE OLD RUSSIAN</h3>
<p>stands hesitant as he HEARS the MUFFLED SCREAMS.<br/>
Then he runs to the front<br/>
door, peers cautiously out, RUNS OUT.</p>
<h3>165. EXT. HOUSE - AT WAGON - THE MEN</h3>
<p>have just about finished eating.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(sitting up suddenly)<br/>
What was that?</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
What was what?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(overlapping)<br/>
I thought I heard a shot.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I heard it. It was a shot, all<br/>
right...</p>
<p><b>KERN'S VOICE</b><br/>
(faint and far off)<br/>
Rolf -- Kruger --</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
It's Kern!</p>
<p>He and Kruger RUN OFF. Then the others follow.</p>
<h3>166. FULL SHOT - KERN LYING ON GROUND</h3>
<p>Anselm and Kruger run in, bend over him. Steiner and<br/>
Schnurrbart COME IN.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
He's hurt -- Kern is hurt --</p>
<p>Steiner looks grimly in the direction of the hut.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
Maybe a company of Russians has<br/>
come up.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
One shot, and it's a company of<br/>
Russians!</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
(gasping)<br/>
The old Russian -- he ran past --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What!</p>
<p><b>KERN</b><br/>
Sorry, Steiner -- I was in no position<br/>
to -- he grabbed my gun --</p>
<p>He falls silent, his eyes close. Steiner bends over to<br/>
examine him.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
How bad is he?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(getting up)<br/>
He's probably finished. Do what<br/>
you can for him.<br/>
(looks grimly<br/>
toward hut)<br/>
I think I'll have a few words with<br/>
Herr Zoll.</p>
<p>As he starts away, the men look down worriedly at Kern.</p>
<h3>167. INT. HALL - OF HUT</h3>
<p>as Steiner comes RUNNING IN. He is about to enter the<br/>
room on the right when he HEARS WHIMPERING from within<br/>
the room on the left. He listens for a moment, then the<br/>
WHIMPERING IS HEARD AGAIN. Steiner lifts his foot, kicks<br/>
the door in.<br/>
</p>
<h3>168. INT. ROOM- ZOLL</h3>
<p>who is fastening the buckle on his belt, whirls around as<br/>
the door flies open. The girl lies on the floor naked<br/>
and whimpering. Zoll stares incredulously at Steiner<br/>
in the doorway. For a few seconds they merely stare at<br/>
each other.</p>
<p>Then Steiner comes slowly into the room and slowly approaches<br/>
Zoll until he is right in front of him. The WHIMPERING of<br/>
the girl STOPS.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I hope you had a good time,<br/>
because you're going to pay<br/>
quite a price for it.</p>
<p>He raises his gun. Zoll takes a step backward in terror.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(incredulously)<br/>
You're not going to shoot me?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
You left your post, you let a<br/>
prisoner escape, you've endangered<br/>
all our lives.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
But Steiner, he was asleep -- I swear<br/>
it -- he was asleep.</p>
<p>Steiner hesitates, then his eyes fall on something.</p>
<h3>169. CLOSE SHOT - THE SINGLE-DOORED WARDROBE</h3>
<p>It fills the entire left corner of the room. It is<br/>
massively built, but has no lock, the door can only be<br/>
closed by a wooden catch.</p>
<h3>170. MED. SHOT - STEINER AND ZOLL</h3>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(to Zoll, indicating<br/>
wardrobe)<br/>
Open the door.</p>
<p>Zoll doesn't move, his face reflecting fear. Then, invol-<br/>
untarily, he glances toward his tommy gun -- out of reach in<br/>
the farthest corner of the room. Steiner catches his Glance.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(coldly)<br/>
Don't try it. You couldn't get<br/>
there. Come on, open the wardrobe.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
Not until you tell me why you<br/>
want me to open it.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(in sudden fury)<br/>
Go on, go on, hurry up.</p>
<p>Zoll turns quickly, walks to wardrobe, opens the door a<br/>
little.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
More.</p>
<p>Zoll pulls the door wide open. The wardrobe is empty inside,<br/>
Steiner nods in satisfaction. He turns his head for a<br/>
moment to see that the girl's gaze is fixed upon him. He<br/>
turns to Zoll.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
If she had a gun she'd fill us<br/>
both. Get into the wardrobe.</p>
<p>Zoll, his eyes wide with fear, takes a quick step to the<br/>
side. Steiner steps up to Zoll, whacks him across the<br/>
face with the heavy barrel of his gun. Zoll lets out a<br/>
wild shriek, presses both hands against his nose, which<br/>
streams blood. Steiner, ignoring his cries, shoves him<br/>
into the wardrobe. Steiner slams the door shut, pushes<br/>
the wooden catch down. From within, comes Zoll's MUFFLED<br/>
VOICE -- "Steiner -- Steiner --"</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(loudly)<br/>
If you make a sound, I'll fire<br/>
through the wood.</p>
<p>From the side he tugs at the wardrobe until he has moved<br/>
it somewhat away from the wall. Then, he squeezes between<br/>
the wall and the rear of the wardrobe. He braces his<br/>
back against the wail and, with a mighty shove, pushes<br/>
the wardrobe over. It crashes to the floor, sending up a<br/>
cloud of dust, behind which appears the girl's white face.<br/>
For a few seconds there is silence, then Zoll begins to<br/>
SHOUT and KICK. Steiner hammers the butt of his gun<br/>
against the rear wall of the wardrobe. The SHOUTING STOPS.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Stop the racket. And don't be<br/>
ungrateful. For you, the war is<br/>
over.<br/>
(he turns to the<br/>
girl; gestures)<br/>
You stay here.</p>
<p>He looks at the wardrobe with grim satisfaction, WALKS OUT.</p>
<h3>171. INT. HALL</h3>
<p>as Steiner COMES OUT. He HEARS a woman SHOUTING from the<br/>
other room. Steiner crosses to the room.</p>
<h3>172. INT. OTHER ROOM</h3>
<p>as Steiner COMES IN. A woman SHOUTS at him.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(looks at the<br/>
wounded woman}<br/>
How do you feel? Any better?</p>
<p>The woman just stares up at him. Steiner kneels, looks<br/>
at the bandage.<br/>
Anselm, Kruger and Schnurrbart come RUNNING IN, in a<br/>
state of great excitement. The former has a roll of<br/>
maps in his hand, the latter carries a walkie-talkie.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
Sergeant -- we were rummaging through<br/>
the second wagon and look what we --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
You picked a lovely time to go<br/>
souvenir hunting. What good is<br/>
a Russian walkie-talkie to us?<br/>
What have you got?</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
A pretty goddamn good map. It's<br/>
not only got their positions in front<br/>
of Krimskaya -- it's got ours, too.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Why, that's almost German efficiency.</p>
<p>He spreads the map on the table, looks at it critically.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
What do you make of it?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
A work of art. What Colonel Brandt<br/>
wouldn't give to have this.<br/>
(looks at map again)<br/>
Their Company Three is pretty well<br/>
spread out. Right opposite is a hill<br/>
marked on our side.<br/>
(again examines<br/>
map)<br/>
The best spot to cross looks like<br/>
Number Three's spot.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Through a whole company?</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
And in our gorgeous gray-green<br/>
uniforms, some chance we'd have.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
It's the only chance we have. The<br/>
dark will give us some --</p>
<p>He pauses, as his eyes fall upon the Russian women. He<br/>
stands silent as the men look at him. Then he turns to<br/>
Kruger.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Tell them to undress.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Who?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(impatiently)<br/>
Them, the women. Tell them to<br/>
undress.</p>
<h3>173. CLOSE SHOT - WARDROBE - ZOLL</h3>
<p>can be HEARD BANGING FEEBLY on the door.</p>
<h3>174. OTHER ROOM</h3>
<p>The men are in various stages of jonning the women's<br/>
uniforms. They are grumbling.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Where in hell is Zoll?</p>
<p>There is a sudden silence. The men look at Steiner, who<br/>
is searching around for a blouse.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I don't think we have to worry<br/>
about him.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Has he skipped out?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What would you have done in<br/>
his place? Hurry up, or we'll<br/>
have a Russian regiment on our<br/>
necks.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(bursting out)<br/>
Suppose we do sneak through the<br/>
Russian lines? Our own men<br/>
will mow us down, us looking like<br/>
a pack of damned Russians!</p>
<p>A silence falls upon the men.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Don't you prefer a German bullet<br/>
to a Russian one? Where's your<br/>
national pride?</p>
<p>Bitter, raucous laughter from the men.<br/>
The men, the uniforms in their arms, start for the door,<br/>
with backward glances at the women. The men GO.</p>
<h3>175. MED. SHOT - STEINER AND KRUGER</h3>
<p>who are bringing up the rear. The old Russian woman<br/>
SHOUTS some thing.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What did you say?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
She still wants to know where<br/>
the young girl is.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Tell her when we're gone, to<br/>
look across the hall.</p>
<p>Kruger speaks to the woman. The wounded woman moans.<br/>
Steiner, his face expressionless, bends, lifts the<br/>
bandage. inspects the wound.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
How does it look?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(getting up)<br/>
She's a goner. Very soon now.</p>
<p>The wounded woman, looking up at them intently, speaks in<br/>
low, halting tones. Steiner looks inquiringly at Kruger,<br/>
who shrugs.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
She says how do we like it now<br/>
that they have us on the run?</p>
<p>Steiner is silent a moment.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Have you got an answer to that?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
No.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(grimly)<br/>
Then, let's go.</p>
<p>He stalks OUT, followed by Kruger.</p>
<h3>176. FULL SHOT - THE WOMEN</h3>
<p>are donning whatever clothing the men have left behind.<br/>
Others have draped blankets around themselves. Three<br/>
women are bending over the wounded woman. From the ex-<br/>
pressions on their faces we know that the end is near for<br/>
their wounded compatriot.</p>
<h3>177. MED. SHOT - WOMAN AT WINDOW</h3>
<p>She is peering out cautiously. After a few moments. she<br/>
turns and says something in Russian to the other women.<br/>
Several come hastening to the window, look out.</p>
<h3>178. LONG SHOT - WOMEN'S POV</h3>
<p>In the b.g., we SEE the men walking off. with Steiner in<br/>
the lead, they DISAPPEAR into the woods.</p>
<h3>179. MED. SHOT - WOMEN - AT WINDOW</h3>
<p>They turn and their faces express grim satisfaction.<br/>
Then, a large woman, evidently the leader, looks through<br/>
the open door, across the hall to the door beyond. Her<br/>
face sets. The women follow her gaze.</p>
<h3>180. INT. OPPOSITE ROOM - THE WARDROBE</h3>
<p>is lying flat on the floor. The CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER<br/>
to it.</p>
<h3>181. INT. WARDROBE - ZOLL</h3>
<p>is lying on his stomach, his head resting on his arms,<br/>
his mouth to a small crack in the planks. After a moment,<br/>
he raises himself up on one elbow, listens carefully. He<br/>
thinks he hears something -- but evidently he is mistaken.<br/>
He lies flat on the floor again. Then he reaches for his<br/>
glasses which are lying by his side. He inspects them;<br/>
they are broken. He shakes his head in anger. He presses<br/>
his mouth to the crack again, breathes. The neat is<br/>
intense. He wipes the Perspiration from his face. Finally<br/>
he opens the buttons of his shirt, pulls down his trousers<br/>
and turns over on his back. He lies still and quiet for<br/>
a few moments, then an expression of great fear comes<br/>
into his face. He calls out!</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
Steiner -- ! Steiner -- Kruger -- !<br/>
Schnurrbart! I'm in here -- !</p>
<p>There isn't a sound, and Zoll's fear grows.</p>
<p><b>ZOLL</b><br/>
(yelling)<br/>
Steiner -- do you hear me! Let me<br/>
out! Schnurrbart -- it's Zoll, I'm<br/>
in here -- !</p>
<p>His shouting has become frantic. He pounds on the door.<br/>
He crooks his body and beats his heels against the bottom<br/>
of the wardrobe. He digs his hands into the crack of the<br/>
door and pulls until his fingers are bleeding. At last,<br/>
he lies still, punting for air. Then, his expression<br/>
freezes. There is the SOUND of softly advancing FOOTSTEPS.<br/>
The wardrobe begins to move. Twice, Zoll is jolted against<br/>
the wood -- and suddenly there is DAYLIGHT.</p>
<h3>182. EXT. WARDROBE - THE CROWD OF WOMEN</h3>
<p>are grouped around the wardrobe, the door of which has<br/>
been smashed open.</p>
<h3>183. MED. SHOT - ZOLL - ON FLOOR OF WARDROBE</h3>
<p>Stunned, he pulls himself up to a half-sitting position<br/>
and blinks in speechless terror at the crowd of mocking<br/>
faces that are bending over him, at rows of breasts<br/>
bulging out of dirty underwear. Suddenly, dozens of<br/>
hands reach into the wardrobe, grip his hair, his clothes,<br/>
his limbs, pull him up and hurl him to the floor of the<br/>
room. As he starts to defend himself, his arms and legs<br/>
are pinioned, his clothes torn off, and a rain of merciless<br/>
blows beat down upon him. Russian CURSES fill the air.</p>
<h3>184. CLOSE SHOT - ZOLL'S FACE</h3>
<p>as the blows rain on him. Just above him is the face of<br/>
the young Russian girl he has raped. Her hair hangs in<br/>
tangled strands over her forehead, her eyes gleam like<br/>
green glass lighted from within. She does not strike him<br/>
or curse him as the others are doing. She only stands<br/>
stooped above him, staring at him in silence. And as<br/>
Zoll looks into her face, the blood runs down his fore-<br/>
head, bubbles out of his nose and mouth. He jerks and<br/>
writhes under the kicks and punches.</p>
<h3>185. FULL SHOT - WOMEN</h3>
<p>as they beat Zoll, who is hidden from the CAMERA.<br/>
Suddenly, there breaks from him a SCREAM that no longer<br/>
resembles anything human. The scream paralyzes the women.<br/>
For a moment, they stop the beating. Several hold their<br/>
hands to their ears. Then, one woman shakes off the<br/>
paralysis. with both feet at once, she jumps on the<br/>
bellowing, twitching, bleeding body. The others spring<br/>
on him, too, stamping, screaming and kicking.</p>
<h3>186. CLOSE SHOT - DOZENS OF BOOTS</h3>
<p>as they jump up and down mercilessly on Zoll's body.</p>
<h3>187. LONG SHOT - FROM HALL - THROUGH OPEN DOOR</h3>
<p>at the spectacle. Gradually, the kicking and jumping<br/>
stop. The women turn, file slowly OUT of the room. Two<br/>
of them have their arms around the softly weeping young<br/>
girl. When the last have walked PAST the CAMERA, it<br/>
STARTS to MOVE SLOWLY TOWARD the battered body in the<br/>
center of the room.

	</p><h3>188. CLOSE SHOT- ZOLL'S FEET</h3>
<p>lying quietly on the floor. A ray of SUNLIGHT is coming<br/>
through the window -- and we see the feet lying in a pool<br/>
of flickering LIGHT.</p>
<h3>189. INT. DARK ROOM</h3>
<p>dimly LIT by one candle. At the window, his back to CAMERA<br/>
stands a half-dressed man. Evidently, he has been roused<br/>
from bed. O.S. we HEAR another man's VOICE.</p>
<p><b>MAN'S VOICE</b><br/>
--They'll be coming through at<br/>
Hill 124 at 0400. Sergeant<br/>
Steiner and what's left of his<br/>
platoon. Their signal will be<br/>
two flares in quick succession.<br/>
then a count of four and a third<br/>
flare. We are to hold our fire.</p>
<p>The man at the window turns and we SEE that it is Captain<br/>
Stransky. His lips are set tight. The CAMERA PULLS BACK<br/>
to reveal the scene as Stransky's bedroom. The man who<br/>
has been speaking is Lieutenant Triebig.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(after a moment)<br/>
I see. Who received this message?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Corporal Stemple.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
was there anybody with Stemple?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
No,sir.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
How well do you know Stemple?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(a split second's<br/>
hesitation)<br/>
Very well, sir.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
He's a very good -- ah -- "friend"<br/>
of yours?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(not looking at<br/>
him)<br/>
Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Stransky looks at him closely.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
He knows how I feel about Sergeant<br/>
Steiner.</p>
<p>A look passes between the two men.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Then I take it that only you, I<br/>
and this Stemple know about this<br/>
message.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
That's right, sir.</p>
<p>Pause. Stransky indicates two packed bags on the floor.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
You know, of course, that I'm<br/>
leaving for Paris?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Of course, sir.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(evenly)<br/>
I could arrange to have you sent<br/>
for. Or would you have some<br/>
objection to continuing on as my<br/>
adjutant in Paris?</p>
<p>For a moment, Triebig merely gasps.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(stammering)<br/>
You don't know how grateful I<br/>
would be to you for that.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(after a moment)<br/>
If I sent you out on a patrol --<br/>
just four men -- two machine-gunners --<br/>
If, in the dark, you saw half a<br/>
dozen men in Russian uniforms<br/>
advancing on you, could anyone<br/>
blame you if you opened fire?</p>
<p>Triebig blinks. Stransky's voice changes. It rings like<br/>
steel.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Get that creature Steiner off my<br/>
neck and I guarantee that you will<br/>
survive this war. He must not come<br/>
back even if you have to kill him<br/>
with your bare hands.</p>
<p>Triebig stands stunned, incapable of speech.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I know from reliable sources that<br/>
the men in this bridgehead have<br/>
been written off. Everyone south<br/>
of Perekop will suffer the same<br/>
fate as the sixth Army at Stalingrad.<br/>
Do you want to be here then?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(a hoarse whisper)<br/>
No.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
within five days after I reach Paris,<br/>
you'll have your orders to join me.<br/>
You know my connections. What do<br/>
you say, Triebig?</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(stares up at Stransky's<br/>
flushed face, swallows<br/>
hard)<br/>
I -- don't know.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
You have the choice. You can rot<br/>
here in a grave, or guzzle champagne<br/>
in France. Which do you prefer?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
May I know one thing?</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
What is that?</p>
<p>Their eyes lock.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Why is it so important to you?<br/>
If you are leaving here in a few<br/>
hours, it shouldn't matter to you<br/>
what happens to Steiner.</p>
<p>Stransky steps over to the window to stare out into the<br/>
darkness. Finally:</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(in measured tones)<br/>
What happens to Steiner is more<br/>
important to me than whether we<br/>
win or lose the war.<br/>
(turns)<br/>
But you will not understand that.<br/>
It's my personal affair, Triebig.<br/>
(pause)<br/>
Are you going through with it or<br/>
not?</p>
<p>The CAMERA MOVES UP to a CLOSE SHOT of Triebig's face as<br/>
he stands, indecisive.</p>
<h3>190. CLOSE SHOT-KRUGER'S FACE</h3>
<p>The CAMERA PULLS BACK to SHOW that he is looking at the<br/>
outstretched figure of Kern who is covered by a blanket<br/>
up to his chin. The SCENE is an open field. It is quite<br/>
dark. Schnurrbart comes RUNNING IN.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Do you honestly think we can slip<br/>
through?</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Well, we'd have a better chance<br/>
if we didn't have to --<br/>
(MORE)<br/>
(looks at the sleep-<br/>
ing figure of Kern,<br/>
lowers his voice)<br/>
-- lug him along.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
What else can we do?<br/>
(pause)<br/>
Too bad about Kern. That's all<br/>
we needed.</p>
<p>Suddenly the SCENE DARKENS. The men look up.</p>
<h3>191. MOON - THEIR POV</h3>
<p>It is covered by thick clouds.</p>
<h3>192. MED. SHOT - SCHNURRBART AND KRUGER</h3>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
That's the end of the moon for<br/>
tonight. That's lucky anyhow.</p>
<p>Suddenly Kern turns on his side and lets out a terrible cry.<br/>
Kruger and Schnurrbart start. The scream continues to<br/>
issue out of Kern like an endless coil of sound unwinding<br/>
and unwinding from his throat.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
Kern! -- Kern! -- for God's sake -- !</p>
<p>But the screaming continues.</p>
<h3>193. FULL SHOT</h3>
<p>Steiner, Anselm come RUNNING IN. Steiner kneels at Kern's<br/>
side.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
(anxiously)<br/>
He'll have the Russians on our<br/>
necks --</p>
<p>The screaming continues.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
(hysterically)<br/>
Shoot him! Shoot him! Or it's<br/>
the end of us!</p>
<p>Steiner turns such a look of scorn upon Anselm that he<br/>
subsides immediately, shame-faced.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(holding flashlight<br/>
close to Kern's<br/>
face)<br/>
Be quiet now -- You don't have to be<br/>
afraid -- we're all with You.</p>
<p>The screaming, which has been dwindling, stops. Steiner<br/>
bends to listen to his heart.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
If we only had a medic with us.<br/>
He ought to have a shot or morphine.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(dully)<br/>
He's dead.</p>
<p>silence a moment.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
Why be hypocrites about it? It's<br/>
better for Kern and it's better<br/>
for us. We couldn't get through<br/>
the lines carrying him.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(enigmatically)<br/>
Yes, he was good enough to die in<br/>
time.</p>
<p><b>ANSELM</b><br/>
What do we do now, bury him?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
We haven't got the time. Let the<br/>
Russians do it.</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
At least we're going to have some<br/>
sort of service, aren't we?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I see. You believe in God?</p>
<p><b>SCHNURRBART</b><br/>
At any rate, I believe we are<br/>
dependent on Someone who decides<br/>
our fate.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I believe in God, too, but I think<br/>
He's a sadist.</p>
<p>Pause.  The men are silent.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
All right.  For the sake of<br/>
Schnurrbart who believes in God,<br/>
and so that it shouldn't be brought<br/>
up against us at the Peace Table,<br/>
we'll have a service.<br/>
(grimly)<br/>
Gather around.</p>
<p>They do.  Steiner looks down at Kern.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
If Kern had died at home, a few<br/>
dozen, maybe even a hundred people<br/>
would be standing around his grave<br/>
in their best dark clothes. And<br/>
they would Say, "So young, it I s<br/>
always the best who go first" --<br/>
A few weeks later they would have<br/>
forgotten him. Let us not forget<br/>
him. And let's not feel too sorry<br/>
for him.  At least now, he's rid<br/>
of his guilt.<br/>
(pause)<br/>
Cover him up -- and let's go.</p>
<p>Steiner STRIDES OFF.  The men stand a moment, then follow<br/>
him OFF.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<h3>194.  EXT. SLOPING FIELD - NIGHT - FULL SHOT</h3>
<p>AS SEEN FROM a trench.  The CAMERA MOVES UP to a MED. SHOT<br/>
of Triebig and four MEN in the trench.</p>
<p>Two machine guns have been set up.  We SEE Triebig stealing<br/>
a furtive look at his watch. Then he looks out over the<br/>
field, his eyes trying to pierce the darkness.  The CAMERA<br/>
FOLLOWS his gaze, MOVES SLOWLY DOWN the field.  In the b.g.<br/>
we begin to perceive a huddled mass. The CAMERA MOVES<br/>
CLOSER and we SEE Steiner and his men, lying flat on the<br/>
found. Steiner is looking at his watch. Then he looks<br/>
toward Schnurrbart who raises a flare gun, FIRES TWO quick<br/>
FLARES.</p>
<h3>195.  MED. SHOT - TRIEBIG AND THE FOUR MEN</h3>
<p>their FACES VISIBLE in the LIGHT o{ the FLARES.  Triebig's<br/>
expression is tense. He turns to the men who are manning<br/>
the machine guns.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Look sharp -- we may be getting<br/>
visitors.</p>
<p>The LIGHT from the FLARES dies away. A brief interval<br/>
and the THIRD FLARE goes up.  In its light, we SEE<br/>
Steiner and his men running for the trench.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Russians!  Fire!</p>
<p>The two MACHINE GUNS OPEN FIRE.  The SCREAMS of men mix<br/>
with the RATTLE of guns. We SEE three men drop. Then<br/>
the LIGHT is gone.  All is darkness again.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(peering into the<br/>
darkness)<br/>
Steady now -- they may be coming<br/>
on again.</p>
<p>A moment's silence, then:</p>
<p><b>STEINER'S VOICE</b><br/>
(shouting)<br/>
Sergeant Steiner here, don't shoot!</p>
<p>Triebig's face goes white. Now, figures are SEEN running<br/>
again, for the trench out of the darkness, their arms<br/>
upraised.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
It's US -- Sergeant Steiner!  Don't<br/>
shoot!</p>
<p>For a moment Triebig stands paralyzed, his face contorted.<br/>
Then, when Steiner is almost upon him, Triebig raises his<br/>
tommy gun, points it at Steiner's chest.</p>
<p><b>ONE OF TRIEBIG'S MEN</b><br/>
(frantically)<br/>
Don't Lieutenant -- it's one of our<br/>
men!</p>
<p>Triebig, unheeding, is about to press the trigger when<br/>
the man hits his arm.  Triebig's GUN FIRES harmlessly<br/>
into the sky.  Steiner and another figure jump into the<br/>
trench.</p>
<h3>196.  MED. SHOT - TRIEBIG</h3>
<p>slumped against the rear wall of the trench.  He is staring<br/>
wildly at Steiner who is bent over double, trying to<br/>
catch his breath.  His companion is also breathing heavily.<br/>
We SEE it is Kruger. The man who had deflected Triebig's<br/>
aim addresses him.</p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>
You see, Lieutenant, I was right.<br/>
It's our men.</p>
<p>Triebig, still staring at Steiner, can't answer. Now<br/>
Steiner is standing erect.  He fixes a steely glance on<br/>
Triebig.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Why did you fire?<br/>
(savagely)<br/>
You got our message!</p>
<p>Triebig finally finds his voice.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Uh--uh--what message?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(with nervous anger)<br/>
We said we were coming through<br/>
in Russian uniforms -- and where<br/>
and when --</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(not looking at<br/>
anyone)<br/>
I don't know anything about any --<br/>
(his voice trails<br/>
off)</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
Schnurrbart sent it.  He --<br/>
(looks around)<br/>
Where's Schnurrbart?</p>
<p>A silence falls as the men turn to look through the darkness<br/>
at the field.  Finally --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(voice low but<br/>
tight)<br/>
Is Anselm there too?</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(barely audible)<br/>
He must be.<br/>
(pause, puzzled)<br/>
I don't get it.  How could they<br/>
help seeing it was us?</p>
<p>Steiner turns to look at Triebig.  Then he turns back to<br/>
his men.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(voice still low)<br/>
Bring them in.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
(stupidly)<br/>
Who?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Who do you think?  Schnurrbart<br/>
and Anselm.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
But they must be dead.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I know they're dead.  Bring them<br/>
in.<br/>
(to Triebig's<br/>
men)<br/>
Give them a hand.</p>
<p>Triebig's men look to him for approval.  Triebig barely<br/>
nods his head, so they scramble up the trench with Kruger<br/>
and DISAPPEAR INTO the darkness.</p>
<h3>197.  MED. SHOT - TRIEBIG AND STEINER</h3>
<p>as Steiner turns to face the terrified Lieutenant.  Triebig<br/>
waits for Steiner to speak but the Sergeant doesn't say<br/>
a word. He just looks at Triebig's ashen face. For a<br/>
few brief moments, Triebig tries to stand up under Steiner's<br/>
unrelenting s tare but he cannot -- and breaks.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(hysterically)<br/>
It wasn't me -- I begged him -- !<br/>
But he insisted --</p>
<p>Steiner's face shows no surprise.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
He could have me shot, Captain<br/>
Stransky!<br/>
(his hysteria grows)<br/>
I said to him -- what does it matter<br/>
to you what happens to Steiner --<br/>
I begged him -- I --</p>
<p>He is practically shouting now.  The men can be HEARD<br/>
RUNNING back from the field.  Steiner s laps Triebig hard,<br/>
across the cheek, silencing him. His head is down as the<br/>
men APPEAR carrying two bodies.  with the help of the<br/>
other men they lower the bodies into the trench. Not a<br/>
word is said. Finally the silence is broken by Kruger.</p>
<p><b>KRUGER</b><br/>
They're finished ail right, both<br/>
of them.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(after a moment)<br/>
Take them back to Battalion. The<br/>
least we can do is bury them<br/>
decently.<br/>
(as the men are<br/>
slow to comply)<br/>
Hurry up, it'll be light soon.</p>
<h3>198.  CLOSE SHOT - TRIEBIG</h3>
<p>as the men set about picking up the bodies, he looks<br/>
anxiously at Steiner.</p>
<h3>199.  CLOSE SHOT - STEINER</h3>
<p>His eyes are fastened upon the two bodies.  He doesn't<br/>
look at Triebig.</p>
<h3>200.  FULL SHOT - THE GROUP</h3>
<p>as they start down the trench with the two bodies. Triebig<br/>
and Steiner are in the rear.  As Triebig starts to follow,<br/>
Steiner steps quickly to his side.</p>
<h3>201. CLOSE SHOT-STEINER AND TRIEBIG</h3>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(a fierce whisper)<br/>
Stay here!</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
But --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(his gun in Triebig's<br/>
ribs)<br/>
Stay here!</p>
<p>Triebig freezes.</p>
<h3>202.  LONG SHOT - THE GROUP</h3>
<p>From Steiner's and Triebig's ANGLE, the group DISAPPEARS<br/>
into the darkness.</p>
<h3>203.  MED. SHOT - STEINER AND TRIEBIG</h3>
<p>Triebig turns terrified eyes on Steiner who is looking in<br/>
the direction of the departing men. Then he turns to<br/>
Triebig.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(pointing to<br/>
top trench)<br/>
Climb up.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Why?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Climb up!</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(quavering)<br/>
You're not going to shoot me--?</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(grimly)<br/>
I promise you I am not going to<br/>
shoot you.  Unless, of course,<br/>
you don't get up there at once.</p>
<p>Triebig casts an anxious, appealing look at Steiner who<br/>
waves to the top of the trench with his gun. Triebig<br/>
raises himself to the top, sits on the edge.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Stand up!</p>
<p>Triebig stands up slowly, then turns.around.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
Steiner, I --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Turn around!<br/>
(as Triebig<br/>
hesitates)<br/>
Turn around, or I shoot!</p>
<p>Triebig turns. He is now a figure in the darkness. Steiner<br/>
reaches into his belt, takes something out -- SHOOTS OFF a<br/>
FLARE.  The figure of Triebig is BRIGHTLY ILLUMINATED.</p>
<p><b>TRIEBIG</b><br/>
(screaming)<br/>
Steiner -- !</p>
<p>But his scream is lost in the RAT - TAT - TAT of bullets from<br/>
the Russian side.  Triebig's both hands reach into the<br/>
air.  He reels, falls heavily back into the trench.  For<br/>
a moment, Steiner looks down at the dark shape, the LIGHT<br/>
of the FLARE gone.  Then he turns, walks quickly in the<br/>
direction the men have taken.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO :</p>


	<h3>204. EXT. KRIMSKAYA STREET HOUSE - DAY - LONG SHOT</h3>
<p>A SENTRY stands guard outside. Steiner, dressed now in<br/>
a rather makeshift German uniform, walks INTO the SCENE,<br/>
exchanges a few words with the Sentry, ENTERS the house.</p>
<h3>205.  INT. ROOM OF HOUSE - BRANDT AND KIESEL</h3>
<p>are facing the door expectantly.  It opens and Steiner<br/>
COMES IN. Brandt greets him with an outstretched arm.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Well, well, Steiner--you're a<br/>
wonder!<br/>
(pumps his hand<br/>
vigorously)<br/>
How you ever got through with your<br/>
platoon--!</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(Wryly)<br/>
Another man and me, Colonel.<br/>
That's my platoon.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
I imagine you have a long report<br/>
to make, Sergeant.  You'd better<br/>
have a cigarette first.</p>
<p>He reaches for his cigarette case.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
I don't have to hear the report<br/>
to know there's an Iron Cross in<br/>
it for you, Steiner.<br/>
(quickly)<br/>
Now, don't tell me what I can<br/>
do with it.</p>
<p>The PHONE RINGS.  Brandt picks up the receiver as Kiesel<br/>
lights Steiner's cigarette.</p>
<h3>206.  MED. SHOT - KIESEL AND STEINER</h3>
<p>BRANDT'S VOICE<br/>
Yes, yes, Captain Stransky.</p>
<p>Steiner stiffens.  This is not lost on Kiesel, who snaps<br/>
his lighter shut.</p>
<h3>207.  MED. SHOT - BRANDT ON PHONE</h3>
<p>Steiner and Kiesel in b.g.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(coldly)<br/>
I'm sorry, Captain Kiesel and I<br/>
will be needing my staff car almost<br/>
immediately.  It's only a mile and<br/>
a half to the air strip.  You can<br/>
walk it in twenty minutes --  Good-<br/>
bye, Captain.<br/>
(dryly)<br/>
I hope things aren't too rough in<br/>
Paris.<br/>
(hangs up)<br/>
I could let the bastard have the<br/>
car, but to hell with him. Let<br/>
him walk.<br/>
(to Steiner)<br/>
Well, I'm anxious to hear your<br/>
story.  It must be astounding.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
May I make a request, Colonel?</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Of course.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Could I have a few hours sleep<br/>
before I make the report?</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Why certainly -- even though I'm<br/>
consumed with curiosity.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
There's an empty room in the next<br/>
house.  Why don't you nap there --<br/>
and report when you're rested.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Thank you very much.   I'll<br/>
do that.</p>
<p>He GOES.  The two officers are silent for a moment.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
Stransky in Paris...!  What<br/>
I cannot understand is why this<br/>
creature is the one to escape.<br/>
Stransky of all people.<br/>
(walks to window<br/>
and looks out)<br/>
Do you know what I'm looking at?<br/>
Steiner running down the road<br/>
like a madman.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Which road?</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
The road to the air strip.</p>
<p>Kiesel runs toward the door.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(sharply)<br/>
Where are you going?</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
I've got to stop Steiner... he'll<br/>
kill Stransky.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
You will stay here.</p>
<p>Kiesel continues to stand, indecisive, at the door.<br/>
Brandt's tone becomes harder.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
I have given you an order.</p>
<p><b>KIESEL</b><br/>
Colonel -- you are making me guilty<br/>
as an accomplice.</p>
<p><b>BRANDT</b><br/>
(straightening up)<br/>
I am on the point of leading my<br/>
regiment into a cul-de-sac from<br/>
which it has not the slightest<br/>
chance of escaping.<br/>
(ironically)<br/>
If the whole fuhrer business<br/>
were to start tomorrow, what<br/>
would I most likely do?  I'd<br/>
close my eyes again - I'd click<br/>
my heels, I'd' march, I'd heel!<br/>
Germany will lose this war but<br/>
Germany will survive.<br/>
(puts bottle on<br/>
the table)<br/>
-- My last bottle of wine. Captain,<br/>
will you join me in drinking to the<br/>
success of Steiner's mission --<br/>
whatever it is?</p>
<p>He starts to pour.</p>
<h3>208. EXT. AIR STRIP - LONG SHOT</h3>
<p>There are several small planes on the field.   Several MEN<br/>
are lounging about.   One small plane stands on the edge<br/>
of a runway.   Its MOTORS are WARMING UP.   The CAMERA<br/>
SWINGS AWAY from the strip towards the road leading to the<br/>
air strip.   A tiny FIGURE is DISCERNIBLE in the distance.</p>
<h3>209. MED. SHOT - STRANSKY</h3>
<p>A bag in each hand, is walking toward the strip. The<br/>
SOUND OF RUNNING FOOTSTEPS behind him causes him to turn.<br/>
A figure is running towards him.  His jaw drops as he<br/>
sees it is Steiner.  Steiner is now close to him.  We has<br/>
a Luger in his hand.   The bags fall from Stransky's hands<br/>
as he sees the Luger.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Steiner--!</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Clasp your hands behind the back<br/>
of your head.</p>
<p>As Stransky hesitates, Steiner makes a menacing move with<br/>
the Luger.   Stransky puts his hands behind his head.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Are you aware of what you are<br/>
doing?  You're dealing with an<br/>
officer --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I think that for the time being,<br/>
we can forget about the differences<br/>
in our rank -- and class.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
Steiner -- you'll hang for this --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I doubt it.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
I don't know what you're planning,<br/>
but you'll never get away with it.<br/>
This is a heavily traveled road.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
In that case, I'll be quick.  For<br/>
a long time, Captain Stransky, I<br/>
haven't had anything to live for --<br/>
for a long time -- but<br/>
the Russians couldn't do it,<br/>
disease couldn't kill me? poor<br/>
Lieutenant Triebig couldn't do<br/>
it.  Not even you could manage<br/>
it<br/>
(moves closer to<br/>
Stransky)<br/>
And not wanting to live, yet not<br/>
willing to die, do you know what<br/>
that kind of a conflict does to<br/>
a man?<br/>
(laughs in<br/>
Stransky's face)<br/>
Now, in a crazy sort of way I am<br/>
grateful to you, Captain Stransky.<br/>
Thanks to you, I am willing to die.<br/>
I could shoot you and then the Army<br/>
would hang me. But, no, that isn't<br/>
good enough.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(his dignity going,<br/>
his voice rising)<br/>
Are you out of your mind?  Steiner,<br/>
if you'll just think for a moment --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
I did think, Captain Stransky.<br/>
I thought and thought -- and did<br/>
nothing!</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(whimpering now)<br/>
Steiner -- Steiner -- you're mad --<br/>
you're absolutely mad!</p>
<p>Steiner steps close to Stransky. With his free hand, he<br/>
pulls a grenade from his belt.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Stand close to me, Captain.</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(backing away)<br/>
No -- No -- You can't --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
(pulls Stransky<br/>
to him)<br/>
This will do for the both of us<br/>
-- the final fraternization --</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(a whimper so low<br/>
it can scarcely<br/>
be heard)<br/>
Steiner -- please -- Steiner --</p>
<p>Steiner pulls the pin from the grenade, holds it between<br/>
himself and Stransky.</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
What's the count before it goes<br/>
off?</p>
<p><b>STRANSKY</b><br/>
(his lips move, but<br/>
no sound comes out)<br/>
-- Steiner --</p>
<p><b>STEINER</b><br/>
Count with me, Captain -- One --<br/>
Two --</p>
<p>The CAMERA STARTS to MOVE UP and AWAY from Steiner and<br/>
Stransky.</p>
<p><b>STEINER'S VOICE</b><br/>
-- Three -- Four -- Five -- Six --</p>
<p>The CAMERA is at TREE TOP LEVEL now --  Suddenly there is<br/>
a SHATTERING REPORT. The branches of the tree tremble.<br/>
The CAMERA STAYS on the tree for a moment.  The leaves<br/>
stop trembling. There is a vast silence now. The CAMERA<br/>
starts to PULL AWAY AGAIN. As it DOES:</p>
<p>FADE OUT:</p>
<p>                          THE END
