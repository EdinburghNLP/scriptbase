<b>                                   AMOUR
</b>                         
                         
                         
                                 Written by
                         
                              Michael Haneke




<b>          SCENE 1 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY
</b>                         
          The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is
          open.
                         
          The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain-
          clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several
          firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all
          wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses.
          Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their
          way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand,
          the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional
          flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor.
                         
<b>                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
</b>           (to the superintendent and the
<b>                          NEIGHBOR)
</b>           Wait Outside please.
                         
          He signals to a police officer who herds the curious
          onlookers back out through the door.
                         
<b>                          POLICE OFFICER
</b>           (to the superintendent, pointing to
           a pile of mail)
           What's the date of the last letter?
                         
<b>                          SUPERINTENDENT
</b><b>                          (VERIFYING)
</b>           The 16th from what I can see...
           Wait...
                         
          The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the
          door on the left. It has been sealed up with adhesive tape.
                         
<b>                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
</b>           (to the fire officer)
           Can you try?
                         
          While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes
          detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the
          windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via
          the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped
          up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room,
          where he also opens up the windows...
                         
<b>           FIREMAN (O.S.)
</b>           The door is open.
                         
          ...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting
          firemen. Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the
          police officer and the janitor.
<b>           2.
</b>                         
                         
<b>                          JANITOR
</b>           ...no as far as I know. During the
           whole time, they had a nurse, but
           it's been a while since I last saw
           her. My wife has been...
                         
          The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now
          accessible. Its windows are open and the draft makes the
          curtains billow into the room.
                         
<b>                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
</b>           (to the firemen who are now curious
           enough to come and stand by the
<b>                          DOOR)
</b>           Did you open the windows?
                         
          The firemen shake their heads.
                         
          The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed
          placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right-
          hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand
          bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where
          once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The
          corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers
          that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a
          crucifix.
                         
          SCENE 2 - White letters on a black background: THE CREDITS
                         
                         
<b>          SCENE 3 - INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
</b>                         
          All we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and
          ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go
          to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once
          everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking
          people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught
          with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the
          lights go out. APPLAUSE.
                         
          Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. THROATS
          ARE CLEARED here and there. Finally, the MUSIC begins.
                         
                         
<b>          SCENE 4 - INT. ARTISTS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>                         
          The music from Scene 3 continues. The soloist is surrounded
          by admirers who congratulate him.
                         
          Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room. (If the
          soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most
          of the others).
<b>           3.
</b>                         
                         
          When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group
          of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly,
          visibly glad to see them.
                         
                         
<b>          SCENE 5 - INT. BUS - NIGHT
</b>                         
          Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3.
                         
          Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty
          bus. Anne talks enthusiastically, Georges says something from
          time to time, and smiles now and then. They are both relaxed
          and happy.
                         
<b>          SCENE 6 - INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>                         
          The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the
          outside. THE MUSIC ENDS.
                         
          Georges comes in, turns on the light. He and Anne observe the
          open door. Around the lock, one can see the traces of an
          attempted forced entry.
                         
          Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep
          grooves.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES
</b>           They used a screwdriver or
           something like that...it doesn't
           look very professional...
                         
<b>                          ANNE
</b>           But who would do something like
           that?
                         
<b>                          GEORGES
</b>           No idea. Why do people break in?
           Because they want to steal
           something.
                         
<b>                          ANNE
</b>           From us?
                         
<b>                          GEORGES
</b>           (laughs briefly out loud)
           Hey, why not? If I thought about
           it, I could come up with at least
           three or four people we know who've
           been burgled.
                         
          After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the
          double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him.
<b>           4.
</b>                         
                         
<b>                          ANNE
</b>           What time is it? Can't we call the
           superintendent?
                         
<b>                          GEORGES
</b>           I'll do that tomorrow morning.
           Anyway, they didn't see anything.
                         
          He unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet
          in the hallway.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
</b>           Don't let it spoil your good mood
           now.
                         
<b>                          ANNE
</b>           Or the police?

          She goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with
          his in the closet.

          slippers. Anne has gone into the bathroom.

           apartment was burgled from the
           loft. They just knocked a hole in
           the wall, cut out all of the

           and disappeared without a trace.

          As he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears
          to be looking at Anne.

          With a gentle LAUGH, Georges disappears into the kitchen,
          where he turns on the lights. We hear him FIDDLING AROUND,
          apparently getting a glass and some wine. After a short

          Georges wakes up. He looks with amazement beside him, then
          raises his eyes. Anne is sitting upright, her back against
          the headboard.

          After a while, the RINGING of a kitchen egg-timer leads us to

          The egg timer in the kitchen RINGS.
                         
          Georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is
          half set for breakfast. He has mobile phone raised to his ear
          and a phone book opened in front of him. Anne is getting up
          from the table. She goes toward the stove, turns off the gas,
          takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under
          cold water. Like Georges, she is still in her robe.

           What about next week? No but still,
           it would make sense to get it done
           soon. It might give people silly
           ideas. And anyway, it's too ugly to
           look at... Wednesday? What time?
           OK... Will you bring the paint with
           you too, to paint over it? But at

          He hangs up.

           Yes, that's true. (Reacting when
           she places the egg in his egg cup)
           Thanks. If I call a regular
           professional, we'll still be

          She has sat down. Looks straight ahead. He cracks open his
          egg, puts salt on it, eats.

          He eats. Wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is
          empty.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
</b>           The saltcellar is empty.
                         
          He looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal
          with it. As she doesn't react, he realizes the
          inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself,
          heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
</b>           I don't know if he's going to bring
           us the CD. Maybe he won't come at
           all. In any case, he didn't mention
           it. I'd like to buy it. It was
           really good and I don't want to
           wait long for it. We could go to
           Virgin this afternoon and buy it.
           What do you say?
                         
          He comes back to the table and sits down again.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
</b>           Hmmm? Anne? What's the matter?
                         
          She looks at him and doesn't answer.

          He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
</b>           Helllloooo!!! Cuckoo!!! I'm here!
                         
          She continues to look at him without reacting.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)

          He waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly,
          leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her
          turn toward him.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)

          He manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but
          her eyes look through him.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
</b>           Anne...what's...
                         
          He takes her face in both hands and turns toward him.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
</b>           Anne...
                         
          She stares into the void. He drops his hands. Then sits
          beside her, for quite awhile.
                         
<b>                         SILENCE

          Finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap,
          wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and
          places it on Anne's face. Waits for a reaction that doesn't
          come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and
          applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her
          imploringly.

           Anne...Darling...please!
                         
          Once again they both remain seated. In the background, we
          hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has
          forgotten to turn it off.
                         
          Making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the
          hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress
          agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. Suddenly,
          the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far
          as the bedroom.
                         
          George doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short.

          Finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen.
                         
          Anne is seated in the same place and looks at him.

          tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside

          head, perturbed that she can't understand. Georges looks at

          damp marks. She slowly grasps that something is awry.

          The superintendent hesitates another moment.

          He leaves the apartment.
                         
          There is a brief moment of perplexity. Then Georges says:
                         
<b>                          GEORGES

</b>           In the living room.
                         
          Georges pushes her toward the living room door, walks around
          the wheelchair, opens the door, comes back behind the
          wheelchair and pushes Anne into the LIVING ROOM.
                         
          The doorway is narrow. The wheelchair only just passes
          through it. Georges pushes Anne toward the sofa and the
          armchairs and then steps in front of her.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES
</b>           Shall I make some tea?

           First come sit with me.
                         
          George registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a
          clumsy way. He sits down in one of the two arm chairs.
                         
<b>                          ANNE (CONT'D)
</b>           Can you help me into the chair?
                         
          Georges stands back up.

          He extends his hands. She puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts
          the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from
          the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm
          to Georges.
                         
<b>                          ANNE
</b>           It's best if you put my arm around

           me, that way it'll be easy.
                         
          He does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together
          the short distance to the second arm chair. Cautiously, he
          lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. Because
          they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward
          and clumsy.
                         
<b>                          ANNE (CONT'D)
</b>           Thanks.
                         
          He smiles because it seems silly to him to answer "Don't
          mention it". Then he sits down opposite her.
                         
<b>          LONG PAUSE.

          At first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the
          fact that words do not come easily. After a long while,
          during which we hear the intermittent sound of the TRAFFIC

          hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the

          He looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom.
          She waits till he's outside. Tries to relax. Then she
          remembers the book. She takes it in her left hand and tries
          to open it. It's not easy for her.
                         
          Then she notices that she's forgotten her glasses. She rests
          the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on
          the night stand. In the end, she manages it. Then she opens
          the book again, and tries to read.

          around again toward Georges.

          He stands in front of the closed door of the toilet, waiting.
          After a while, we hear the noise of flushing. After a while
          longer, we hear

          He opens the toilet door, goes around Anne, pulls her up, she
          puts her left arm around his neck, keeps herself upright that
          way, he pulls up her pants under her skirt. Then they slowly
          hobble out of the toilet and he sits her back down in the
          wheelchair.

          They are both lying in their beds. Anne sleeps, BREATHING
          NOISILY. Georges lies with his eyes open, listening
          attentively to her breathing.

          The sun shines in. Georges has cooked something simple. They
          are both in a good mood, eating and drinking.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES
</b>           ... some banal romance or other
           about a nobleman and a lower middle-
           class girl who couldn't have each
           other and who then, out of sheer
           magnanimity, decide to renounce
           their love - in fact I don't quite
           remember it any more. In any case,
           afterwards I was thoroughly
           distraught, and it took me a bit of
           time to calm down. In the courtyard
           of the house where grandma lived,
           there was a young guy at the window
           who asked me where I'd been. He was
           a couple of years older than me, a
           braggart who of course really
           impressed me. "To the movies", I
           said, because I was proud that my
           grandma had given me the money to
           go all alone to the cinema.

</b>           "What did you see?" I started to
           tell him the story of the movie,
           and as I did, all the emotion came
           back. I didn't want to cry in front
           of the boy, but it was impossible;
           there I was, crying out loud in the
           courtyard, and I told him the whole
           drama to the bitter end.

</b>           No idea. He probably found it
           amusing. I don't remember. I don't
           remember the film either. But I
           remember the feeling. That I was
           ashamed of crying, but that telling
           him the story made all my feelings
           and tears come back, almost more
           powerfully than when I was actually
           watching the film, and that I just
           couldn't stop.

           cassette player and after the
           speech she put on "Yesterday" by
           the Beatles. You can't imagine.
           Everybody turned round to look at
           her. Apparently, it wasn't planned.
           His grandchildren were there. Of
           course they giggled as soon as the

          He hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into
          the bed.

          objects.

          Georges, in pajama pants, naked torso, brushes his teeth. The
          doorbell rings.
                         
          Georges spits out, wipes his mouth, goes into the hallway and
          over to the front door.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
</b>           Yes? Who's there?
                         
          No answer. Georges is very irritated. O.S., Anne calls to
<b>                         HIM:
</b>                         
<b>                          ANNE
</b>           Georges? What's going on? Who is
           it?
                         
          Georges opens the door. Outside, however, instead of the
          usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without
          a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment. It
          looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment. A couple of
          ladders are propped against the opposite wall. At the other
          end of the room, to the side, is a small door. Georges is
          stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened.
          Hesitating, he crosses the room toward the door.
                         
          O.S., in the distance, Anne's worried voice:
                         
<b>                          ANNE (CONT'D)
</b>           Georges? What's going on?
                         
          Georges opens the small door. Behind it is a narrow,
          windowless corridor, as brightly lit as the room. At the end
          of the corridor, a door. Georges heads toward this door and
          opens it too. Behind it is a tiny windowless room, equally
          bright as the others. Everything is very quiet. Georges
          enters, turns round, then goes back along the corridor,
          crosses the room, comes through the apartment door into the
          hallway of the apartment. But it too is now empty and bright,
          with bare unpainted walls, no doors; only the door to the
          bedroom is open. Behind that too, it appears to be empty and
          bright. Georges goes toward it.
                         
          At the same time, we hear GEORGES' VOICE. At first he groans,
          but then begins inarticulately hollering, louder and louder.
          Shortly after, we also hear:

          She manages to switch on the bedside lamp. Georges is sitting
          up in his bed, having just awoken, wide-eyed with terror. His
          breathing is labored.
                         
          Anne extends her good hand toward him, caresses his back to
          calm him. He slowly calms down and flops back on his pillow.

          him.

          He crouches down in front of Anne who is seated on the bed,
          puts his mobile phone back in his pocket and continues to put
          on her socks and her shoes.

          going better. Georges smiles encouragingly at Anne, noticing
          her improvement. She reacts like someone duty-bound, but
          without conviction.

          Close shot: a CD is inserted into a player. As the MUSIC
          begins (the concert heard in Scene 3), Georges takes a card
          out of the envelope that contained the CD and reads it to
<b>                         ANNE:

           pupil, Martin.
                         
          The MUSIC makes their SILENCE less awkward. Then, after a
          long while, Anne says:

          Georges hesitates, and doesn't understand the suddenness of
          this request.

</b>           Please!
                         
          He finally gets up and goes into the adjoining room. He comes
          back after a few moments with a stack of albums, pushes away
          the remains of Anne's meal and sets down the first album in
          front of her.

          With her able hand, Anne opens the album, looks at the
          photos, turns the pages, looks.

          Georges looks at her. She continues to thumb through the
          pages. After a while she turns toward him.

          They are both lying in bed. Georges reads the day's news to
          Anne from the newspaper. When he looks over to her, she has
          fallen asleep. He then puts the newspaper on the night stand

          It's morning. Georges is helping Anne to get out of bed into
          her wheelchair. As he does it, he notices that the bed and
          her nightgown are wet.

          He sits her back on the bed and goes out of the room.
                         
<b>                          GEORGES (CONT'D)

          During this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed,
          and waits. He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat
          of the wheelchair.

          He lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes
          her through the hallway into the bathroom.
                         
          He lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and
          takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head. She
          starts to SOB inconsolably. He caresses her face.

          Anne is in bed. She's on a drip. Eva is seated on a chair
          beside the bed.

</b>           ... thinking about whether it
           wouldn't be better to invest the
           money in an apartment block. If
           inflation gets going again,
           property is the only sure thing.
           Right now, savings accounts pay
           1.75% at best. Four years ago,
           Geoff bought some stocks with a
           small sum of money and the whole
           thing collapsed. So now we're
           obviously worried. Unfortunately,
           in the meantime, other people have
           had the same idea, and property
           prices are going through the roof.
           Since we came back from
           Scandinavia, I spend all my spare
           time looking through newspaper ads.

          down and put an incontinence pad on her. She's now almost
          incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an

          Georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano.
          Finally he leans over toward the CD player and stops it. The

          holds the sipping cup to her lips. She drinks slowly, one sip
          after the other. He pulls the cup back between each sip, to

          They both leave the kitchen. As the nurse, in the hallway,
          takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on,
          she comments on Anne's continuing CALLS FOR HELP.
                         
<b>                          NURSE

           Usually they always say something.
           She might just as well say "Mom,
           Mom, Mom". It's just mechanical.

          He closes the door behind her. Remains motionless a moment,
          then goes into the bedroom, where Anne's CALLS FOR HELP,
          unaltered, continue.
                         
          Georges sits down beside Anne on the bed, takes her hand,
          holds her. After a while, Anne calms down, her CALLS FOR HELP
          become quieter and finally stop altogether.
                         
          After a long PAUSE:

           I'd like to hire a second nurse.
           The two could take turns. That

           simpler. What do you think?

          The front door. We hear the key in the lock. Georges enters
          with a shopping bag, and behind him is the superintendent. He
          carries bigger and heavier bags. Georges holds the door open
          for him.

          The superintendent precedes him into the kitchen with the

          He then follows the superintendent into the kitchen.
                         
          The superintendent has put the bags on the work surface.

          The window opening onto the light well is open. A pigeon has
          landed on the window ledge.
                         
          It walks to and fro, then finally dares to jump down inside,
          onto the floor. It starts to explore the surroundings.
                         
          We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Georges comes out of the toilet.
          The door opening frightens the pigeon. Alarmed, flapping its
          wings, it flutters about the room.
                         
          After a moment of surprise, Georges tries to shoo it back
          toward the window. But the bird escapes in the opposite
          direction. George follows it.
                         
          He closes the doors of the other rooms. Coming from the

          back out through the window. Georges, visibly exhausted, has
          to sit down on the chest in the hallway.

          tries carefully, but using some force, to separate her teeth.
          Pours a little tea in. The liquid runs out of her mouth.

          some of which has run down onto the pillow. He tries to mop
          it up. She watches him the whole time. Finally he puts the
          towel down beside the cup and looks at her. Tries not to show
          his helplessness and his anger.

          understand, huh?". Eva is slightly irritated, but follows him

           we change her incontinence pad. I
           rub cream on her to avoid sores.
           Then, around 7, I try to persuade
           her to eat and drink. Sometimes it
           works, sometimes not. Sometimes she
           tells me things from her childhood,
           then for hours she calls for help,
           and then an instant later she's
           giggling away to herself, or

          Georges has remained by the door. After a while, they both
          leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the
          living room.
                         
          Georges closes the door. For an instant he puts a consoling
          hand on Eva's shoulder. Then he sits down.
                         
          Eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and
          looks outside. Suddenly she starts sobbing.
                         
          After a while, Georges gets up and goes out of the room. Eva,
          vexed, blows her nose.
                         
          Shortly after, Georges comes back. He has another teacup in
          his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down.

           can't talk too loud, it wears me
           out... Here we go: when I was
           little... well, I wasn't as little
           as all that... it was toward the
           end of primary school, so I was
           about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a
           holiday camp. They thought it would
           do me good to spend the summer with
           kids my own age... We were lodged
           in an old castle in the midst of a
           magnificent wooded landscape... I
           think it was in the Auvergne... I
           don't know... in any case it was
           the opposite of what I'd
           expected... We had to get up at 6
           and go for a morning swim. Not far
           from the castle, there was a pond
           fed by an icy mountain stream. We
           entered it running, in a double
           file. You know, I was never very
           sporty. They had a program to keep
           us on the go all day, probably to
           nip any potential pubescent
           impulses in the bud ... But the
           worst thing was the food. The third
           day after our arrival, there was
           rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice
           pudding. We sat at long tables in a
           huge hall. I didn't want to eat the
           stuff and the housemaster said to
           me: You won't get up until you've
           cleared your plate. So after the
           meal everybody left the room, and I
           remained seated, in tears. I had
           made a secret pact with Mom. I was
           to send her a postcard every week.

           if not, some stars. She kept the
           card; it was covered all over in
           stars. After three hours, I was
           allowed to leave the table. I went
           up to my room, got into bed and had
           a fever of 42 degrees. It was
           diphtheria. They took me to the
           nearest hospital where I was put in
           an isolation ward, which meant that
           Mom, when she came to visit me,
           could only wave at me through a
           window. At some point I lost that
           postcard. It's a pity.

          Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to
          move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it
          with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's

          The front door of the apartment is unlocked. Georges, in city

          Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall

          out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its
          hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up
          again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He

          Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast
          with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for
          reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible.
          Suddenly, Georges starts.
                         
          At the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between
          the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it.
          For a long time.
                         
          Then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the
          kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room.
                         
          On the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. He takes the
          wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen,
          carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm.
          Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it
          over the pigeon. But it manages to escape into the hallway.
                         
          Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times.
          The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up,
          flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light-
          well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an
          exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He
          cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans
          against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.

          dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices
          his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually:
                         
<b>                          ANNE
</b>           I'm almost done.
                         
          Georges continues to look at her unwaveringly.
                         
<b>                          ANNE'S VOICE
</b>           You can put your shoes on if you
           want.
                         
          Georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her,
          goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet
          and puts on his shoes. O.S. we hear Anne finishing her work.
          She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears
          for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has
          got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is
          tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. When she comes out
          again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it
          on.
                         
<b>                          ANNE
</b>           Thanks.
                         
          They head for the front door.
                         
<b>                          ANNE (CONT'D)
</b>           Aren't you taking a coat?
                         
          Georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from
          the hook and they leave the apartment.
                         
<b>          SCENE 61 - INT. HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DINING ROOM - LIVING ROOM
</b><b>                         - DAY
</b>                         
          Four long shots: all the windows are open. The sun is
          shining. It is fairly bright.
                         
          Hallway.
                         
          SILENCE. Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED. Eva comes
          into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door.
          Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes
          into the bedroom.
<b>           67.
</b>                         
                         
          Anne's twin bed isn't there any more. On Georges' bed lies
          only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes
          through the partition door into the dining room.
                         
          There, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living
          room.
                         
          There too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano
          stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she
          heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the
          table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table,
          turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear
          STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the
          armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room.
