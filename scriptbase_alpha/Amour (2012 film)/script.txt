          SCENE 1 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is
          open.
                         
          The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain-
          clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several
          firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all
          wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses.
          Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their
          way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand,
          the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional
          flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
           (to the superintendent and the
                          NEIGHBOR)
           Wait Outside please.
                         
          He signals to a police officer who herds the curious
          onlookers back out through the door.
                         
                          POLICE OFFICER
           (to the superintendent, pointing to
           a pile of mail)
           What's the date of the last letter?
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
                          (VERIFYING)
           The 16th from what I can see...
           Wait...
                         
          The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the
          door on the left. It has been sealed up with adhesive tape.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
           (to the fire officer)
           Can you try?
                         
          While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes
          detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the
          windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via
          the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped
          up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room,
          where he also opens up the windows...
                         
           FIREMAN (O.S.)
           The door is open.
                         
          ...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting
          firemen. Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the
          police officer and the janitor.
           2.
                         
                         
                          JANITOR
           ...no as far as I know. During the
           whole time, they had a nurse, but
           it's been a while since I last saw
           her. My wife has been...
                         
          The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now
          accessible. Its windows are open and the draft makes the
          curtains billow into the room.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
           (to the firemen who are now curious
           enough to come and stand by the
                          DOOR)
           Did you open the windows?
                         
          The firemen shake their heads.
                         
          The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed
          placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right-
          hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand
          bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where
          once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The
          corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers
          that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a
          crucifix.

          SCENE 3 - INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
                         
          All we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and
          ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go
          to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once
          everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking
          people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught
          with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the
          lights go out. APPLAUSE.
                         
          Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. THROATS
          ARE CLEARED here and there. Finally, the MUSIC begins.
                         
                         
          SCENE 4 - INT. ARTISTS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The music from Scene 3 continues. The soloist is surrounded
          by admirers who congratulate him.
                         
          Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room. (If the
          soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most
          of the others).
           3.
                         
                         
          When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group
          of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly,
          visibly glad to see them.
                         
                         
          SCENE 5 - INT. BUS - NIGHT
                         
          Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3.
                         
          Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty
          bus. Anne talks enthusiastically, Georges says something from
          time to time, and smiles now and then. They are both relaxed
          and happy.
                         
          SCENE 6 - INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the
          outside. THE MUSIC ENDS.
                         
          Georges comes in, turns on the light. He and Anne observe the
          open door. Around the lock, one can see the traces of an
          attempted forced entry.
                         
          Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep
          grooves.
                         
                          GEORGES
           They used a screwdriver or
           something like that...it doesn't
           look very professional...
                         
                          ANNE
           But who would do something like
           that?
                         
                          GEORGES
           No idea. Why do people break in?
           Because they want to steal
           something.
                         
                          ANNE
           From us?
                         
                          GEORGES
           (laughs briefly out loud)
           Hey, why not? If I thought about
           it, I could come up with at least
           three or four people we know who've
           been burgled.
                         
          After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the
          double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him.
           4.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           What time is it? Can't we call the
           superintendent?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I'll do that tomorrow morning.
           Anyway, they didn't see anything.
                         
          He unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet
          in the hallway.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Don't let it spoil your good mood
           now.
                         
                          ANNE
           Or the police?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Come on, give me your coat.
                         
          She goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with
          his in the closet.
                         
                          ANNE
           Imagine if we were here, in our
           beds, and someone broke in.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Why should I imagine that?
                         
                          ANNE
           But it's terrible! I think I'd die
           of fright.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (LAUGHING)
           So would I.
                         
          He undoes his shoes.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Shall we have a drink?
                         
                          ANNE
           I'm tired.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I still fancy a drink.
                         
          He puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his
          slippers. Anne has gone into the bathroom.
           5.
                         
                         
           ANNE (O.S.)
           Go ahead then. Mathilde told me
           that in her building, the attic
           apartment was burgled from the
           loft. They just knocked a hole in
           the wall, cut out all of the
           valuable pictures from their frames
           and disappeared without a trace.
                         
          He goes toward the kitchen.
                         
                          GEORGES
           They must have been professionals.
                         
          As he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears
          to be looking at Anne.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Did I tell you, you looked good
           tonight?
                         
          SHORT PAUSE. THEN:
                         
           ANNE (O.S.)
                          (FLATTERED)
           What's got into you?
                         
          With a gentle LAUGH, Georges disappears into the kitchen,
          where he turns on the lights. We hear him FIDDLING AROUND,
          apparently getting a glass and some wine. After a short
                         PAUSE:
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Weren't those semiquavers in the
           presto incredible? What staccato!
           Don't you agree?
                         
          Short PAUSE.
                         
           GEORGES (O.S.)
           You're proud of him, huh?
                         
          SCENE 7 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Georges wakes up. He looks with amazement beside him, then
          raises his eyes. Anne is sitting upright, her back against
          the headboard.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Something wrong?
                         
                          ANNE
           No.
           6.
                         
                         
          After a while, the RINGING of a kitchen egg-timer leads us to
          the next scene.
                         
          SCENE 8 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          The egg timer in the kitchen RINGS.
                         
          Georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is
          half set for breakfast. He has mobile phone raised to his ear
          and a phone book opened in front of him. Anne is getting up
          from the table. She goes toward the stove, turns off the gas,
          takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under
          cold water. Like Georges, she is still in her robe.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (on the phone)
           What about next week? No but still,
           it would make sense to get it done
           soon. It might give people silly
           ideas. And anyway, it's too ugly to
           look at... Wednesday? What time?
           OK... Will you bring the paint with
           you too, to paint over it? But at
           least some primer...Yes, OK. Thank
           you.
                         
          He hangs up.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
                          (TO ANNE)
           You can depend on that guy.
                         
                          ANNE
           (who comes back to the table with
           the egg) I hope so. The last time,
           he kept us waiting for ages, if you
           remember.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (laughs while acquiescing)
           Yes, that's true. (Reacting when
           she places the egg in his egg cup)
           Thanks. If I call a regular
           professional, we'll still be
           waiting two months time.
                         
                          ANNE
           (more to herself)
           Really?
                         
          She has sat down. Looks straight ahead. He cracks open his
          egg, puts salt on it, eats.
           7.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           The Frodons waited three days when
           their toilet was blocked. Not
           exactly pleasant.
                         
          He eats. Wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is
          empty.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           The saltcellar is empty.
                         
          He looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal
          with it. As she doesn't react, he realizes the
          inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself,
          heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I don't know if he's going to bring
           us the CD. Maybe he won't come at
           all. In any case, he didn't mention
           it. I'd like to buy it. It was
           really good and I don't want to
           wait long for it. We could go to
           Virgin this afternoon and buy it.
           What do you say?
                         
          He comes back to the table and sits down again.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Hmmm? Anne? What's the matter?
                         
          She looks at him and doesn't answer.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           What's going on? What's the matter?
                         
          He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Helllloooo!!! Cuckoo!!! I'm here!
                         
          She continues to look at him without reacting.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (serious now) Anne! What's going
           on?
                         
          He waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly,
          leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her
          turn toward him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anne, what's the matter?
           8.
                         
                         
          He manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but
          her eyes look through him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anne...what's...
                         
          He takes her face in both hands and turns toward him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anne...
                         
          She stares into the void. He drops his hands. Then sits
          beside her, for quite awhile.
                         
                         SILENCE
                         
          Finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap,
          wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and
          places it on Anne's face. Waits for a reaction that doesn't
          come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and
          applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her
          imploringly.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (close to tears)
           Anne...Darling...please!
                         
          Once again they both remain seated. In the background, we
          hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has
          forgotten to turn it off.
                         
          Making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the
          hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress
          agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. Suddenly,
          the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far
          as the bedroom.
                         
          George doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anne?
                         
          Finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen.
                         
          Anne is seated in the same place and looks at him.
                         
                          ANNE
           What are you doing?
                         
          She turns toward the breakfast.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           You left the water running.
           9.
                         
                         
          Georges stares at her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (both aghast and furious)
           Hey, what's going on? Are you
           completely crazy? Is this supposed
           to be a joke, or what's going on?
                         
          She looks at him with amazement.
                         
                          ANNE
           What did you say?
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (SERIOUSLY)
           Is this a joke? Is this meant to be
           a joke?
                         
                          ANNE
           What joke? I don't get it! Why are
           you talking to me like that? What's
           got into you?
                         
          Georges comes from the door to the table.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne! Please! Stop this game. It's
           not funny.
                         
                          ANNE
                          (GETTING IRRITATED)
           What game, for Christ's sake? What
           on earth's the matter?!!
                         
          Georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone,
          but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken. He
          tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside
          Anne, sits down and looks at his wife. She doesn't know how
          to react.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What's the matter? Why didn't you
           react?
                         
                          ANNE
           To what?
                         
                          GEORGES
           To what? To me, to everything.
                         
                          ANNE
           When?
           10.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Just now. A moment ago.
                         
                          ANNE
           Please tell me what's wrong. What
           am I supposed to have done?
                         
          Georges first looks away reluctantly, then looks at Anne. He
          doesn't want to believe that its serious.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't know what to say. Do you
           really not know what just happened?
                         
                          ANNE
           But what DID happen?
                         
                          GEORGES
           (almost reluctantly bowing his head
           as he speaks) You were sitting
           there, staring at me. You didn't
           answer me when I asked you what the
           matter was.
                         
          He picks up the wet tea towel from the table.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I put this tea towel on your face,
           and you didn't react.
                         
          Anne looks at the towel, then at Georges, and shakes her
          head, perturbed that she can't understand. Georges looks at
          her. He sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Look... There's still dampness on
           your collar.
                         
          Anne follows his gesture, tugs on her collar and sees the
          damp marks. She slowly grasps that something is awry.
                         
                          ANNE
           When... When was it?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Just now, a few minutes ago.
                         
                          ANNE
           So...??
                         
                          GEORGES
           There's no "So". I went into the
           bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to
           get help.
           11.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           Help?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes, and then you turned off the
           tap.
                         
                          ANNE
           Yes. Because you left it on.
                         
                         SILENCE
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           I don't understand.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Neither do I.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Don't you think it's best if I call
           Dr. Bertier?
                         
                          ANNE
           Why? What can he do?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't know. Examine you.
                         
                          ANNE
           I'm fine. There's nothing wrong
           with me.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne, please!! That's absurd. We
           can't pretend that nothing
           happened.
                         
                          ANNE
           But what DID happen?
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           I'm here. I'm having my breakfast,
           and you're telling me things
           happened that I don't understand.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Can you explain how the tea towel
           got there?
           12.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
                          (IRRITATED)
           No, I can't!
                         
                          GEORGES
           Who turned on the tap?
                         
                          ANNE
           You did!
                         
                          GEORGES
           Can you remember that?
                         
                          ANNE
           (more and more desperate, close to
           tears) No I can't! Do you want to
           torture me? Leave me in peace!
                         
          Georges looks at her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Don't you think it would be better
           to fetch Dr. Bertier?
                         
                          ANNE
           No!
                         
          She takes her cup of tea, as if to show how well she is, and
          drinks it up. When she wants to re-fill her cup, she
          completely misses her aim. She notices it, puts down her cup
          and bursts into tears.
                         
          SCENE 9 - INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
                         SILENCE
                         
          We see wide shots of the apartment. The hallway. The bedroom.
          The living room. The dining room. The kitchen. Nobody in
          sight.
                         
          SCENE 10 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          EVA, around 50, has come to pay a visit. Anne isn't there.
                         
                          EVA
           You know how he is. Once he's got
           something into his head, he has to
           go through with it. In the end,
           everybody was delighted. And
           besides, it didn't hurt our
           financial situation. We're playing
           until the 28th.

                          EVA (CONT'D)
           Then we have 10 days to rest, then
           we go to Stockholm for four days,
           and then to Kumo in Finland. Heaven
           knows where that is. At the North
           Pole. But Geoff's already been
           there few times, and he loves it.
           We're playing the "Dowland
           Transcriptions" there and then
           we're back in London.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What about the children?
                         
                          EVA
           Liz is at boarding school and John
           is living his own life. He's twenty-
           six years old.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What does he do?
                         
                          EVA
           He's a student. We rarely see him.
           He's got his own ideas. Life Geoff.
           They don't really get along. Geoff
           wants to advise him on everything,
           and John doesn't like that at all.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Is he good?
                         
                          EVA
           I think so. He's less impulsive.
           Very industrious.
                         
                          GEORGES
           That sounds rather derogatory.
                         
                          EVA
           No!! He's not like Geoff. Quiet,
           but stubborn. I think he'll do all
           right. At the last Conservatory
           concert, he played the solo part in
           the Haydn Concerto. It was very
           good. Geoff was there and
           congratulated him at the end.
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           And you?
                         
                          EVA
           What do you mean?
           14.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Did you both make up?
                         
                          EVA
           (with a little laugh)
           My God, you know him, don't you?
           Over the winter, he suddenly
           discovered his passion for a viola
           player who'd been in our ensemble
           for years. What can I tell you? It
           was a huge drama, and the poor
           little darling wound up trying to
           commit suicide. That scared him and
           he came back to me in full remorse.
           I've got used to it now. What's a
           bit embarrassing is that the
           ensemble, you can't keep any
           secrets from anyone.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Do you love him?
                         
                          EVA
           Yes, I think so.
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
                          EVA (CONT'D)
           What's aphasia?
                         
          Georges gestures that it's too complicated.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What can I say? The carotid artery
           was blocked. They did an ultrasound
           scan, two in fact, and they said
           they had to operate on her. She was
           scared. She was confused and
           scared. You know she has always
           been afraid of doctors. They said
           the risk was very low and that if
           they didn't operate, she'd be
           certain to have a serious stroke.
                         
                          EVA
           And what do they say now?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Just that it didn't go well. It's
           one of the 5% that go wrong.
                         
          He yawns.
           15.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           It's pretty upsetting.
                         
          He looks at his watch.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Usually at this time, I take a nap.
           My blood sugar is somewhere down in
           my socks.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          EVA
           I'm so sorry.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yeah.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          EVA
           What can I do for you?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Nothing. It was nice of you to come
           despite all of your stress.
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
          She doesn't know what to say.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           No, really. There's nothing you can
           do. We'll see how things go when
           she's back here in the apartment.
           We'll manage. Maybe I'll get a
           caretaker in, or maybe I'll manage
           on my own. We'll see. We've been
           through quite a lot in our time,
           your mother and I.
                          (LITTLE LAUGH)
           All this is still a bit new.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          EVA
           (with a little laugh)
           It's funny. I don't know if I
           should say it. Maybe it'll
           embarrass you. But when I came here
           a short while ago, I suddenly
           remembered how I always used to
           listen to the two of you making
           love when I was little.
                          (MORE)
           16.
                         
                          EVA (CONT'D)
           For me, at the time, it was
           reassuring. It gave me a feeling
           that you loved each other, and that
           we'd always be together.
                         
          SCENE 11 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          A carpenter and his assistant are raising the base of the
          double bed. Georges watches.
                         
          SCENE 12 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          The door of the apartment is opened. Georges comes in. Behind
          him is Anne in a wheelchair, pushed by a paramedic. A second
          paramedic (as young as the first) follows with a suitcase and
          a large bag. Behind them, the superintendent.
                         
          Georges tries to rid of the three as quickly as possible. He
          stuffs a twenty euro note into the hand of the first
          paramedic.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Here. Thank you very much. It's for
           both of you. You can just put the
           things down here. There, beside the
           window, right. We'll be okay on our
           own. Thanks a lot.
                         
          The two paramedics exchange a brief glance, say thanks, and
          leave the apartment, passing the superintendent as they go.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (to the superintendent)
           Thank you, Mr. Mery.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           If you need anything, just call
           downstairs. If we can help at
           all...
                         
                          GEORGES
           Right now everything's fine. I'll
           let your wife know as soon as we
           need anything.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
                          (TO ANNE)
           It's nice to have you back, Mrs.
           Laurent.
                         
                          ANNE
           Yes. Thank you, Mr. Mery. Thank
           you.
           17.
                         
                         
          The superintendent hesitates another moment.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Yes, thanks.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           Yes... So... Goodbye then, ma'am.
           Welcome home again. Goodbye, Sir.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Goodbye, Mr. Mery.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           Goodbye.
                         
          He leaves the apartment.
                         
          There is a brief moment of perplexity. Then Georges says:
                         
                          GEORGES
           (with a nervous smile)
           Where do you want...
                         
                          ANNE
           In the living room.
                         
          Georges pushes her toward the living room door, walks around
          the wheelchair, opens the door, comes back behind the
          wheelchair and pushes Anne into the LIVING ROOM.
                         
          The doorway is narrow. The wheelchair only just passes
          through it. Georges pushes Anne toward the sofa and the
          armchairs and then steps in front of her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Shall I make some tea?
                         
                          ANNE
           (with a faint smile)
           First come sit with me.
                         
          George registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a
          clumsy way. He sits down in one of the two arm chairs.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Can you help me into the chair?
                         
          Georges stands back up.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (EAGERLY)
           Of course.
           18.
                         
                         
          He extends his hands. She puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts
          the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from
          the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm
          to Georges.
                         
                          ANNE
           It's best if you put my arm around
           your neck and your right arm around
           me, that way it'll be easy.
                         
          He does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together
          the short distance to the second arm chair. Cautiously, he
          lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. Because
          they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward
          and clumsy.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Thanks.
                         
          He smiles because it seems silly to him to answer "Don't
          mention it". Then he sits down opposite her.
                         
          LONG PAUSE.
                         
          At first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the
          fact that words do not come easily. After a long while,
          during which we hear the intermittent sound of the TRAFFIC
          below.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (softly almost to himself)
           I'm glad you're back.
                         
                          ANNE
           (in a voice just as soft)
           Me too.
                         
          Another PAUSE. Then Anne says:
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Promise me one thing.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What?
                         
                          ANNE
           Please never take me back to the
           hospital.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What?
                         
          PAUSE.
           19.
                         
                         
          She looks at him. He has understood.
                         
                          ANNE
           You promise?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne...
                         
                          ANNE
           You promise?
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne, I...
                         
                          ANNE
           Don't talk right now. And don't
           give me any lectures. Please.
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What can I say, it's...
                         
                          ANNE
                          (INTERRUPTING HIM)
           Nothing. Just don't say anything.
           OK?!
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
          SCENE 13 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          He helps her into bed, then throws the blanket over her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           There.
                         
                          ANNE
           Thank you. Thank you, Darling.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Everything OK?
                         
                          ANNE
                          (SMILING)
           Everything's fine.
                         
          He hesitates.
           20.
                         
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           You don't have to hold my hand all
           the time now. I can look after
           myself, you know.
                         
          He nods.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           And don't feel guilty. That would
           be pointless. And a drag. For me
           too.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't feel guilty.
                         
                          ANNE
           That's good.
                         
          She smiles.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Go over there now. I'm not a
           cripple. You can easily leave me
           alone for two minutes. I won't
           collapse.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (with a slight smile)
           OK.
                         
                          ANNE
           Did you buy the new book on
           Harnoncourt?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I've already read it.
                         
                          ANNE
           And?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Do you want it? I'll get it for
           you.
                         
                          ANNE
           Sure.
                         
          He goes out of the room to fetch the book. She remains lying
          there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her
          hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the
          blanket that has slipped out of place a little. After a
          while, we hear Georges shouting.
           21.
                         
                         
           GEORGES (O.S.)
           I don't know where I put it.
                         
                          ANNE
           Don't worry. It isn't that
           important.
                         
           GEORGES (O.S.)
           Yes, it is. Hold on, maybe it's in
           the... Just a moment! Viola! Here
           you are! Nothing like an infallible
           memory!
                         
          She smiles, looks in his direction. He enters with the book
          in his hand.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I thought I'd left it over there in
           the other room, but I'd already put
           it away. Tidy people just can't
           help being tidy.
                         
                          ANNE
           (taking the book)
           Thanks.
                         
          She puts the book on her stomach. Looks at Georges.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Right now, take care of yourself.
           And don't wait to see how I hold
           the book in my hand, OK?
                         
                          GEORGES
           OK.
                         
          He looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom.
          She waits till he's outside. Tries to relax. Then she
          remembers the book. She takes it in her left hand and tries
          to open it. It's not easy for her.
                         
          Then she notices that she's forgotten her glasses. She rests
          the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on
          the night stand. In the end, she manages it. Then she opens
          the book again, and tries to read.
                         
          SCENE 14 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          The superintendent's wife puts the filled supermarket bags on
          the counter. Takes the stack of mail that she had put on top
          of one of the bags and puts it down beside them. Then she
          takes out the receipt and the change.
           22.
                         
                         
                          SUPERINTENDANT'S WIFE
           Unfortunately the strawberries were
           already moldy. I'll go and get you
           some fresh ones tomorrow from the
           market. My husband will bring you
           the bottled water this afternoon.
           I'm not supposed to carry anything
           heavy: my back, you know...
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Sure, no problem.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
           It came to 76 euros and 40 cents.
           There's the till receipt and here's
           your change: 23 euros 60.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Thank you very much. Keep the
           change. Thanks.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
           Thank you, sir.
                         
          Short embarrassed PAUSE.
                         
           SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D)
           Well, I'll be off. Call me if you
           need anything else.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes. I will.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
           Is your wife well? ...
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes, she's OK. She's recovering.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
           Fine. Give her my regards. My
           husband and I are very glad she's
           back.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes, we are too. Bye, Mrs. Méry,
           thanks so much.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
           Goodbye, sir.
                         
          She heads toward the front door of the apartment, turns
          around again toward Georges.
           23.
                         
                         
           SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D)
           I'll bring you the strawberries
           tomorrow around noon, if that suits
           you.
                         
          He nods, she closes the door as she leaves.
                         
          SCENE 15 - INT. HALLWAY - TOILET - DAY
                         
          He stands in front of the closed door of the toilet, waiting.
          After a while, we hear the noise of flushing. After a while
          longer, we hear
                         
           ANNE (O.S.)
           There. Can you come in, please?
                         
          He opens the toilet door, goes around Anne, pulls her up, she
          puts her left arm around his neck, keeps herself upright that
          way, he pulls up her pants under her skirt. Then they slowly
          hobble out of the toilet and he sits her back down in the
          wheelchair.
                         
          SCENE 16 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          They are both lying in their beds. Anne sleeps, BREATHING
          NOISILY. Georges lies with his eyes open, listening
          attentively to her breathing.
                         
          SCENE 17 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          The sun shines in. Georges has cooked something simple. They
          are both in a good mood, eating and drinking.
                         
                          GEORGES
           ... some banal romance or other
           about a nobleman and a lower middle-
           class girl who couldn't have each
           other and who then, out of sheer
           magnanimity, decide to renounce
           their love - in fact I don't quite
           remember it any more. In any case,
           afterwards I was thoroughly
           distraught, and it took me a bit of
           time to calm down. In the courtyard
           of the house where grandma lived,
           there was a young guy at the window
           who asked me where I'd been. He was
           a couple of years older than me, a
           braggart who of course really
           impressed me. "To the movies", I
           said, because I was proud that my
           grandma had given me the money to
           go all alone to the cinema.
                          (MORE)
           24.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           "What did you see?" I started to
           tell him the story of the movie,
           and as I did, all the emotion came
           back. I didn't want to cry in front
           of the boy, but it was impossible;
           there I was, crying out loud in the
           courtyard, and I told him the whole
           drama to the bitter end.
                         
                          ANNE
           So? How did he react?
                         
                          GEORGES
           No idea. He probably found it
           amusing. I don't remember. I don't
           remember the film either. But I
           remember the feeling. That I was
           ashamed of crying, but that telling
           him the story made all my feelings
           and tears come back, almost more
           powerfully than when I was actually
           watching the film, and that I just
           couldn't stop.
                         
          She looks at him, smiles, then turns back to her food.
                         
                          ANNE
           That's cute. Why didn't you ever
           tell me before?
                         
                          GEORGES
           There are still a few stories you
           don't know.
                         
                          ANNE
           Aha...? Don't tell me you're going
           to ruin your image in your old age?
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (GRINNING)
           You bet I won't. But what is my
           image?
                         
          She takes a mouthful, eats ponderously. Then she looks at
          him.
                         
                          ANNE
                          (TENDERLY)
           Sometimes you're a rotter. But
           you're nice.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (EMBARRASSED GRIN)
           Can I take you for a drink?
           25.
                         
                         
          She laughs.
                         
          SCENE 18 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          He does physiotherapy exercises with her. Counts the
          repetitive movements of the exercises.
                         
          SCENE 19 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          She's lying on the sofa. He's seated in the armchair. They're
          both reading the newspaper. After a while:
                         
                          ANNE

          PAUSE. Then
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (GOOD-HUMORED)
           You've only yourself to blame if
           you read stuff like that.
                         
          Brief PAUSE. Then:
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Tomorrow afternoon is Pierre's
           funeral.
                         
                          ANNE
           You have to go.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I fear I must. I don't want to go
           at all.
                         
                          ANNE
           Who does like going to funerals?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Oh, I know a few people who do.
           Annette can never wait to get all
           dolled up again. And François
           has...
           26.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           You're mean. What would you say if
           no one came to your funeral?
                         
                          GEORGES
           (dryly) Nothing, presumably.
                         
          She shoots him a glance, smiles at his irony. Then she says:

           was in the hospital? I mean, does
           she know I can't come?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Of course.
                         
                          ANNE
           What did she say?
                         
                          GEORGES
           She was shocked.
                         
                          ANNE
           How?
                         
                          GEORGES
           (a bit irritated)
           My God, what are people like when
           they're shocked? She couldn't
           believe it, she was speechless. I
           don't remember any more. In any
           case, not exactly. I've spoken to a
           lot of people since.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           Sorry.
                         
                          GEORGES
           No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be
           unkind, but I just don't see the
           point of talking about it all the
           time.
                         
          Short PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           Do I talk about it all the time?
           27.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           No. Sorry.
                         
                          ANNE
           Don't worry.
                         
          SCENE 20 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          The front door is unlocked from the outside, and Georges
          enters. He's back from the funeral, dressed for the occasion.
          He turns on the light. He's wet. Clearly, it's been raining.
          As he closes the door again, his eyes fall on Anne. With her
          back to him, she is sitting on the floor in front of the
          opened window of the light well, half propped against her
          wheelchair.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What ... ?!
                         
          Shaken, he heads toward her, picks her up and seats her in
          the wheelchair. Outside, in the light well, it is raining.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           (once she's seated in the
                          WHEELCHAIR)
           Why are you back already? What time
           is it?
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
          Georges has understood immediately. He closes the window
          noiselessly.
                         
          Then just stands there, at a loss.
                         
          SILENCE. Then
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
                          (SOFTLY)
           Forgive me, I was too slow.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne...
                         
                          ANNE
           Can you wheel me into the living
           room?
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes.
           28.
                         
                         
          He turns toward her, pushes the wheelchair into the living
          room between the two armchairs. Turns on the light. Stops
          beside the switch. They both look exhausted.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           You're always good at surprises.
                         
                          ANNE
           Yes. Why are you home earlier?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I didn't come home earlier. I took
           a taxi. In August, there isn't a
           lot of traffic.
                         
                          ANNE
           That's true. How was the funeral?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne...!
                         
                          ANNE
           How was it, go on, tell me!
                         
          He thinks an instant, then goes and sits down facing her in
          an armchair. Looks at her. She raises her head and returns
          his look. He understands that he can't insist right now. Long
          PAUSE. Then he begins:
                         
                          GEORGES
           It was rather bizarre. The priest
           was an idiot. Then one of Pierre's
           co-workers made a speech that was
           embarrassingly emotional. His old
           secretary came with a radio-
           cassette player and after the
           speech she put on "Yesterday" by
           the Beatles. You can't imagine.
           Everybody turned round to look at
           her. Apparently, it wasn't planned.
           His grandchildren were there. Of
           course they giggled as soon as the
           music began. Then the urn was put
           on a huge stretcher that was
           obviously designed for a coffin,
           and out we went into the rain. They
           placed the urn on a small electric
           cart that crawled along for what
           seemed like an eternity to the tiny
           hole they had dug. A lot of people
           had to stifle their laughter. It
           must have been terrible for Jeanne.
           I have...
           29.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
                          (INTERRUPTING HIM)
           There's just no point in going on
           living. I know it can only get
           worse. Why should I inflict it on
           us? On you and me.
                         
                          GEORGES
           You're not inflicting anything on
           me.
                         
                          ANNE
           You don't have to lie, Georges.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Imagine you were me. Didn't you
           ever think something like this
           could happen to one of us?
                         
                          ANNE
           Of course I did. But imagination
           and reality have little in common.
                         
                          GEORGES
           But things are getting better every
           day. We'll...
                         
                          ANNE
                          (INTERRUPTING HIM)
           Georges, I don't want to carry on.
           You're making such efforts to make
           everything easier for me. But I
           don't want to go on. For my own
           sake. Not yours.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't believe you. I know you.
           You think you're a burden on me.
           But what if things were the other
           way around? What would you do then?
                         
                          ANNE
           I don't know. I can't be bothered
           to think about being you. I'm
           tired. You tire me. Everything
           tires me. I can't talk. I want to
           go to bed.
                         
          He looks at her. Finally he gets up and pushes her wheelchair
          out of frame.

          She is lying in bed. The bedside lamp is on.
                         
          We hear the RADIO coming from the living room: a program
          about the fauna and flora of the South Seas, or something
          similar.
                         
          SCENE 22 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges comes out of the kitchen and opens the front door. On
          the doorstep stands the soloist (male or female) from Scenes
          3 and 4.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (somewhat perplexed, but pleased)
           Oh hello! Nice to see you.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           Forgive me for dropping in on you
           like this, Professor. I tried to
           reach you by phone a couple of
           times, but no luck.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I'm sorry. I only pick up the phone
           when I've stored the caller's
           number and I can see who's calling.
           Why didn't you leave a message?
           Anyway, do come in...
                         
          He closes the door behind his guest.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           I just couldn't manage to come by
           after the concert. I was so sorry,
           because I was so pleased you came
           along.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Come with me.
                         
          While they pass into the living room, they continue to speak:
                         
                          SOLOIST
           ... And now, an unexpected
           opportunity has arisen because
           François Mitry called me - you know
           him, he's my agent - to say he'd
           arranged for me to meet the boss of
           the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées
           tonight to talk about their new
           concert series.
                          (MORE)
           31.
                         
                          SOLOIST (CONT'D)
           So I flew to Paris this morning,
           and while I was in my hotel, I
           thought, I'll just give it a try
           and drop in. After all, it's
           virtually just around the corner.
                         
          Sorry, these are for your wife.
                         
          He takes the bouquet of flowers from its wrapping paper and
          hands it to Georges.
                         
                          SOLOIST (CONT'D)
           Isn't she at home?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes, she is. I'll go and get her in
           a minute. Have a seat.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           I hope I'm not disturbing you too
           much.
                         
                          GEORGES
           No, not at all. I'm happy that you
           came. We were so thrilled by your
           concert. We hoped we'd see you
           again soon. Please do have a seat.
           Can I can get you something? A cup
           of tea?
                         
                          SOLOIST
           No, no, thank you very much.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Hold on, I'll just freshen up the
           flowers; in this heat they wilt so
           fast...
                         
                          SOLOIST
           I've only just bought them. They
           should keep quite...
                         
                         
                         
          But Georges has already left the room with the bouquet and
          closed the door behind him. The soloist looks around him.
                         
          After a few moments we hear the VOICES of Anne and Georges in
          the distance, without understanding what they're saying. It
          lasts a while.
                         
          Finally Georges opens the door and pushes Anne, in her
          wheelchair, into the living room.

                          ANNE
           Martin! What a delight. How lovely
           to see you!
                         
          The (male or female) soloist has got up and doesn't quite
          know how to handle the situation.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           Mrs. Laurent! Lovely to see you
           too.
                         
                          ANNE
           Don't get up. Come on, sit yourself
           down and don't look so shocked.
                         
          The soloist sits down hesitantly, Georges pushes the
          wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down.
          Brief embarrassed PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           I'm so proud of you. We were both
           in raptures after your concert.
           Georges wanted to buy your new CD
           the very next morning.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           Oh God! I wanted to bring you the
           CD, but I left in such a hurry that
           I forgot it. I'm so sorry. I'll get
           one today and drop it by.
                         
                          ANNE
                          (SMILING)
           No, no, don't worry. We want to
           make a contribution to your
           success. Even if it's only twenty
           euros.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           You've already contributed so much.
           I owe you so much, Madame.
                         
                          ANNE
           You owe it to your hard work and
           your talent.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           (shaking his head a little) Do you
           remember, when you first gave me
           the Bagatelles to play? I was
           twelve at the time, and in my
           youthful arrogance I said: "But why
           the Bagatelles?" And you really
           gave me a piece of your mind.
           33.
                         
                         
          They both smile. PAUSE. Then he goes on:
                         
                          SOLOIST (CONT'D)
           So what happened?
                         
                          ANNE
           My right side is paralyzed, that's
           all. It can happen when you get
           older.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           And how...?
                         
                          ANNE
           Let's talk about something else,
           shall we?
                         
                          SOLOIST
                          (DISCONCERTED)
           Sure ...
                         
                          ANNE
           Don't be offended. But I want to
           enjoy the lovely interlude you've
           given us with your visit.
                         
                          SOLOIST
                          (DISARMED)
           Of course.
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           You haven't told us yet what's been
           going on since the Paris concert.
                         
          The soloist is a bit thrown by the couple's behavior.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           Well, actually I've spent most of
           the time in London studying. Then I
           went to Copenhagen for two
           performances, that was Schubert
           too. My whole life revolves around
           Schubert at the moment. The
           concerts with the Impromptus and
           the Moments Musicaux, and for my
           bread-and-butter work I'm
           developing the sonatas. Not the
           late ones, I think I still need a
           couple more years for those.
           34.
                         
                         
          (The dialogue concerning music will be modified according to
          the performer chosen.)
                         
                          ANNE
           Could you do me a favor?
                         
                          SOLOIST
                          (SURPRISED)
           Really?
                         
                          ANNE
           Would you play Für Elise?
                         
                          SOLOIST
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Um, I don't know if I remember it
           very well. Beethoven, it's been a
           long time since I've... But if you
           want...
                         
                          ANNE
           Give it a try.
                         
                          SOLOIST
                          (HESITANTLY)
           OK.
                         
          He looks at Georges, then at Anne again, gets up, goes to the
          grand piano and plays.
                         
          SCENE 23 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Georges is leaning against the chest, and watches Anne, who
          is practicing maneuvering her new electric wheelchair.
          Forward, backward, turning. In the end, she goes round and
          round in circles several times. He laughs, so does she.
                         
          SCENE 24 - INT. BEDROOM - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Anne is lying in bed. A book rests on her stomach. She
          listens to the PIANO playing coming from the living room.
          After a while the music stops.
                         
                          ANNE
           What's the matter?
                         
                         LIVING ROOM
                         
          Georges is seated in front of the open piano. His hands in
          his lap, he looks straight ahead.
                         
          SCENE 25 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
           35.
                         
                         
          The superintendent's wife runs the vacuum cleaner over a
          carpet.
                         
          SCENE 26 - INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Anne is seated on a stool. Georges washes her.
                         
          SCENE 27 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
                         
          Georges has cooked himself a steak and is eating. On the
          radio, we hear the EVENING NEWS. Suddenly, coming from the
          neighboring room, a LOUD CRASH and the SOUND of crockery
          breaking. Stifled CRY from Anne. Georges gets up, irritated,
          crosses the HALLWAY and enters the BEDROOM.
                         
          Anne lies on the floor, beside the overturned night stand, in
          the midst of the crockery and remains of a meal.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (shocked, and hence furious)
           Good God, what are you doing?
                         
          He hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into
          the bed.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Have you lost your senses?! I don't
           believe it! How stupid!
                         
          He points to the broken objects.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Look at that! Did you need to do
           that? Can't you call me when you
           need something?
                         
                          ANNE
           (meekly) I'm sorry.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (STILL FURIOUS)
           Yes, so am I.
                         
                          ANNE
                          (SOFTLY)
           Sorry.
                         
          Georges bends down, and begins to gather up the scattered
          objects.
                         
                          GEORGES
           The lamp is broken too.
                         
          SCENE 28 - INT. BATHROOM - HALLWAY - ANNEX - DAY
           36.
                         
                         
          Bathroom.
                         
          Georges, in pajama pants, naked torso, brushes his teeth. The
          doorbell rings.
                         
          Georges spits out, wipes his mouth, goes into the hallway and
          over to the front door.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Yes? Who's there?
                         
          No answer. Georges is very irritated. O.S., Anne calls to
                         HIM:
                         
                          ANNE
           Georges? What's going on? Who is
           it?
                         
          Georges opens the door. Outside, however, instead of the
          usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without
          a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment. It
          looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment. A couple of
          ladders are propped against the opposite wall. At the other
          end of the room, to the side, is a small door. Georges is
          stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened.
          Hesitating, he crosses the room toward the door.
                         
          O.S., in the distance, Anne's worried voice:
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Georges? What's going on?
                         
          Georges opens the small door. Behind it is a narrow,
          windowless corridor, as brightly lit as the room. At the end
          of the corridor, a door. Georges heads toward this door and
          opens it too. Behind it is a tiny windowless room, equally
          bright as the others. Everything is very quiet. Georges
          enters, turns round, then goes back along the corridor,
          crosses the room, comes through the apartment door into the
          hallway of the apartment. But it too is now empty and bright,
          with bare unpainted walls, no doors; only the door to the
          bedroom is open. Behind that too, it appears to be empty and
          bright. Georges goes toward it.
                         
          At the same time, we hear GEORGES' VOICE. At first he groans,
          but then begins inarticulately hollering, louder and louder.
          Shortly after, we also hear:
                         
                          ANNE'S VOICE:
           Georges, what's going on?
                         
          SCENE 29 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Darkness. GEORGES HOLLERS
           37.
                         
                         
                          ANNE'S VOICE
           Calm down will you! There's nothing
           there. It's nothing.
                         
          She manages to switch on the bedside lamp. Georges is sitting
          up in his bed, having just awoken, wide-eyed with terror. His
          breathing is labored.
                         
          Anne extends her good hand toward him, caresses his back to
          calm him. He slowly calms down and flops back on his pillow.
                         
                          ANNE
           What was it?
                         
          He doesn't answer. Continues breathing heavily. She caresses
          him.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (still with labored breathing)
           I didn't understand... I thought
           I'd gone mad... It was something
           impossible...
                         
                          ANNE
           What was?
                         
          SCENE 30 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Close shot on the screen of a cell phone. We read on it:
                         
          Coming to Paris on 12th. Plan to stop by in afternoon. Hope
          all well. So look forward to seeing you. Love Eva.
                         
          We hear O.S. the voice of
                         
                          GEORGES
           Eva. They're coming on the 12th.
                         
          He crouches down in front of Anne who is seated on the bed,
          puts his mobile phone back in his pocket and continues to put
          on her socks and her shoes.
                         
                          ANNE
           Why?
                         
                          GEORGES
           No idea. Apparently she's coming
           with Geoff.
                         
                          ANNE
           When is it?
           38.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't know exactly. What day is
           it today? I'll go and look.
                         
          Short PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           I don't want that.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What?
                         
                          ANNE
           Geoff doesn't need to come.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
          Georges doesn't agree, but continues to dress Anne.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           I don't need any comments on my
           predicament. I can only take his
           British humor in small doses.
                         
          SCENE 31 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Once more the set of physiotherapy exercises. Things are
          going better. Georges smiles encouragingly at Anne, noticing
          her improvement. She reacts like someone duty-bound, but
          without conviction.
                         
          SCENE 32 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Close shot: a CD is inserted into a player. As the MUSIC
          begins (the concert heard in Scene 3), Georges takes a card
          out of the envelope that contained the CD and reads it to
                         ANNE:
                         
                          GEORGES
           Dear Madame Laurent, Dear Monsieur
           Laurent, it was beautiful and yet
           sad to see you. My heartfelt wishes
           that things will get better.
           With deep gratitude, your former
           pupil, Martin.
                         
          The MUSIC makes their SILENCE less awkward. Then, after a
          long while, Anne says:
                         
                          ANNE
           Stop the CD.
                         
          He hesitates, looks at her, then stops the music. They remain
          SILENT.
           39.
                         
                         
          SCENE 33- INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING ROOM - DAY
                         
          They eat. Suddenly, Anne says:
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Where are the family albums?
                         
                          GEORGES
           The family albums? I don't know,
           there, in the other room. Why?
                         
                          ANNE
           Can you get them for me?
                         
                          GEORGES
           What, now?
                         
          Anne nods.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Why, Anne?
                         
                          ANNE
           I'd like to look at them.
                         
          Georges hesitates, and doesn't understand the suddenness of
          this request.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Please!
                         
          He finally gets up and goes into the adjoining room. He comes
          back after a few moments with a stack of albums, pushes away
          the remains of Anne's meal and sets down the first album in
          front of her.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Thanks.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (a bit irritated)
           You're welcome.
                         
          With her able hand, Anne opens the album, looks at the
          photos, turns the pages, looks.
                         
                          ANNE
           That's nice.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (self-consciously, softly)
           What?
           40.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           Life...so long... What a long
           life...
                         
          Georges looks at her. She continues to thumb through the
          pages. After a while she turns toward him.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Stop watching me.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (caught in the act)
           I wasn't watching you.
                         
                          ANNE
           Of course you were. I'm not that
           dumb yet.
                         
          SCENE 24 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          They are both lying in bed. Georges reads the day's news to
          Anne from the newspaper. When he looks over to her, she has
          fallen asleep. He then puts the newspaper on the night stand
          and turns out the light.
                         
          SCENE 35 - INT. BEDROOM - HALLWAY - BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          Bedroom.
                         
          It's morning. Georges is helping Anne to get out of bed into
          her wheelchair. As he does it, he notices that the bed and
          her nightgown are wet.
                         
                          GEORGES
           You're soaked through.
                         
                          ANNE
           What do you mean?
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Hold on.
                         
          He sits her back on the bed and goes out of the room.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I'll be right back.
                         
          During this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed,
          and waits. He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat
          of the wheelchair.
           41.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           It's no big deal. Come on.
                         
          He lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes
          her through the hallway into the bathroom.
                         
          He lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and
          takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head. She
          starts to SOB inconsolably. He caresses her face.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Come on, darling. It's nothing
           serious. Things like that happen..
                         
                          ANNE
                          (SOBBING)
           I can't... take it any more.
                         
          He holds her tightly against him, strokes her hair, feeling
          helpless.
                         
                          GEORGES
           My love. My darling.
                         
          SCENE 36 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Anne is in bed. She's on a drip. Eva is seated on a chair
          beside the bed.
                         
                          EVA
           ... thinking about whether it
           wouldn't be better to invest the
           money in an apartment block. If
           inflation gets going again,
           property is the only sure thing.
           Right now, savings accounts pay
           1.75% at best. Four years ago,
           Geoff bought some stocks with a
           small sum of money and the whole
           thing collapsed. So now we're
           obviously worried. Unfortunately,
           in the meantime, other people have
           had the same idea, and property
           prices are going through the roof.
           Since we came back from
           Scandinavia, I spend all my spare
           time looking through newspaper ads.
                         
          To put an end to the PAUSE that follows, she adds:
                         
                          EVA (CONT'D)
           It takes time, that's all. We'll
           find something in the end.
           42.
                         
                         
          Another oppressive PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           (slowly) Yes yes I have... I
           have... the grandmother... woman
           with house... not... the house then
           ... money
                         
                          EVA
           I don't understand you, I'm afraid.
                         
                          ANNE
           ... yes... now... it's all... house
           sel... sel... sel... was... in two
           strokes of... so quickly... god
           it's hard... to say... sell...
           money gone... left... there too...
                         
          PAUSE. Eva has tears in her eyes.
                         
          SCENE 37 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges and Eva's husband, GEOFF, around fifty. He speaks
          with a British accent.
                         
                          GEORGES
           ... three times a week... I'm not
           experienced enough. We'll see if
           that's enough.
                         
                          GEOFF
           How much is she asking?
                         
                          GEORGES
           It's paid by the hour. We'll see.
                         
                          GEOFF
           And her?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne?
                         
          Geoff nods. Georges shrugs.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           It's hard to say. Sometimes I get
           the feeling she's totally unaware
           of the state she's in. And then I
           feel the opposite. It's... I don't
           know.
                         
                          GEOFF
           And what about the doctor? What
           does he say?
           43.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           He's...
                         
          Eva comes in through the door. She's in floods of tears.
                         
                          EVA
                          (CRYING)
           She only talks gibberish. I don't
           know what...
                         
          Geoff gets up, hesitantly.
                         
                          GEOFF
           Hey, dear...
                         
          He goes toward her and leads her to the armchair where he was
          sitting.
                         
                          GEOFF (CONT'D)
           ...come here, sit down, it's OK.
                         
          She shakes him off, irritated, and sits down.
                         
                          EVA
           Nothing is OK.
                         
          At first he's vexed by her brusque response, but then goes to
          sit down on the sofa. Meanwhile, Eva turns to Georges:
                         
                          EVA (CONT'D)
           What's going on, actually? You
           can't just leave her lying on her
           bed like that! She's
           unrecognizable! It's ridiculous!
                         
                          GEORGES
           We can't do anything for the
           moment. Calm down, darling. She's
           getting medical treatment, they
           give her the necessary medication,
           and there are no other options
           right now.
                         
                          EVA
           What does that mean, "no other
           options"? Why isn't she in a
           hospital?
                         
                          GEORGES
           She had a second stroke. Bertier
           examined her and felt we could
           spare her all the hospital
           inpatient procedures.
                          (MORE)
           44.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anyway, they wouldn't keep her,
           they'd send her to a care home.
           What they do in those places, we
           can do here.
                         
          Eva looks at him, amazed.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           And she won't be put in a care
           home. I promised her that.
                         
                          GEOFF
           Don't you think you're taking on
           too much?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Have you got a better idea?
                         
          Geoff doesn't know what to say. Eva has composed herself
          somewhat and blows her nose.
                         
                          EVA
           I can't believe that these days
           there's no way of handling this
           efficiently.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (CURTLY)
           No one's stopping you from finding
           out.
                         
          Eva gets up, furious, and goes to the window. Georges follows
          her with his eyes.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
                          (PEACEABLY)
           Believe me, I love your mother as
           much as you do. So please, don't
           treat me as if I was a total idiot
           incapable of doing the obvious.
                         
                          EVA
           I didn't say that. I'm simply
           questioning whether what I see
           going on here is the answer to
           everything!
                         
                          GEOFF
                          (TO GEORGES)
           Don't you want to get a second
           opinion?
           45.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Now you two had better stop, OK?
           Another doctor did come. He said
           Bertier was right. From Monday, a
           nurse will come three times a week.
           Now can we talk about something
           else?
                         
                          EVA
           Like what?
                         
          SCENE 38 - INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Georges washes the tea cups that he used for Eva and Geoff.
          On the radio, the EVENING NEWS.
                         
          SCENE 39 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          With expert gestures, a nurse shows Georges how to lie Anne
          down and put an incontinence pad on her. She's now almost
          incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an
          object, as tears flow silently down her face.
                         
          SCENE 40 - INT. LIVING ROOM -DAY
                         
          Anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the Scene 3. We
          watch her and listen to her for a while.
                         
          Georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano.
          Finally he leans over toward the CD player and stops it. The
          MUSIC suddenly stops. Georges remains silently seated.
                         
          SCENE 41 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          He prepares a bowl of muesli, fills a sipping cup with water
          and brings both into the bedroom. Sits down on the bed close
          to Anne to feed her her food.
                         
                          GEORGES
           There, my love, I hope you like it.
                         
                          ANNE
           OK...
                         
          He begins to feed her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I added a little orange juice. I
           find it tastes quite good.
                         
          She can only swallow slowly, and so something keeps running
          back out of her mouth. He wipes it with a tea towel,
          continues to feed her. Finally, after a few mouthfuls, she
          keeps her mouth shut.
           46.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Come on, Anne, you have to eat some
           more. You've only swallowed three
           mouthfuls.
                         
          Anne continues to keep her lips sealed.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Please, darling. A bit more.
                         
          Anne doesn't move. He puts the muesli on the night stand and
          holds the sipping cup to her lips. She drinks slowly, one sip
          after the other. He pulls the cup back between each sip, to
          give her more time. Suddenly she says:
                         
                          ANNE
           ...Mom to the concert...
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes?
                         
                          ANNE
           ...Mom to the concert... no
           dress...
                         
                          GEORGES
           Mom has no dress for the concert?
                         
                          ANNE
           ...Mom to concert... no ... uuu...
           no...
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes?
                         
          Long PAUSE. Georges waits.
                         
          SCENE 42 - INT. BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges and the nurse install Anne on a metal armchair in the
          shower.
                         
          As she does so, the nurse keeps talking reassuringly to Anne.
          Finally, she turns on the tap.
                         
                          ANNE
           (in a monotone)
           Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
           Help!...
                         
          Without being phased, the nurse continues to speak
          reassuringly. Georges remains standing there, helpless.
                         
          SCENE 43 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY
           47.
                         
                         
          Kitchen.
                         
          Georges and the nurse are seated at the table with a cup of
          coffee. In front of the nurse, on the table, is a sum of
          money. As they speak, we hear, coming from the room, Anne's
          CALLS FOR HELP.
                         
                          NURSE
           ... we could take turns. She'd come
           from 8 till 12 and I'd do 2 until
           6, or 3 to 7. That would certainly
           relieve the pressure on you.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I'll think about it.
                         
                          NURSE
           She just has to know in time so she
           can arrange it in her schedule.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes, of course, I'll let you know
           in the next few days.
                         
                          NURSE
           Very well. I have to go now...
                         
          She takes the money on the table, pockets it and gets up.
                         
                          NURSE (CONT'D)
           Thanks for the coffee.
                         
                          GEORGES
           My pleasure. I'll see you out.
                         
          They both leave the kitchen. As the nurse, in the hallway,
          takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on,
          she comments on Anne's continuing CALLS FOR HELP.
                         
                          NURSE
           You mustn't take it too seriously.
           Usually they always say something.
           She might just as well say "Mom,
           Mom, Mom". It's just mechanical.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (nodding, softly)
           I know.
                         
          They've reached the door.
                         
                          NURSE
           Goodbye, sir.
           48.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Goodbye.
                         
          He closes the door behind her. Remains motionless a moment,
          then goes into the bedroom, where Anne's CALLS FOR HELP,
          unaltered, continue.
                         
          Georges sits down beside Anne on the bed, takes her hand,
          holds her. After a while, Anne calms down, her CALLS FOR HELP
          become quieter and finally stop altogether.
                         
          After a long PAUSE:
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (slowly, softly)
           I'd like to hire a second nurse.
           The two could take turns. That
           would make everything a bit
           simpler. What do you think?
                         
          Long PAUSE. Then:
                         
                          ANNE
           (softly) ...Help...Help...
                         
          SCENE 44 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          They are both lying in bed. Georges SNORES noisily. Anne's
          eyes are open.
                         
          SCENE 45 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          The front door. We hear the key in the lock. Georges enters
          with a shopping bag, and behind him is the superintendent. He
          carries bigger and heavier bags. Georges holds the door open
          for him.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Would you mind putting them in the
           kitchen.
                         
          The superintendent precedes him into the kitchen with the
          bags. Georges calls toward the bedroom:
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I'm ba-aack!
                         
          He then follows the superintendent into the kitchen.
                         
          The superintendent has put the bags on the work surface.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Thanks very much.
           49.
                         
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           Can I do anything else for you,
           sir?
                         
                          GEORGES
           No, thanks, Mr. Méry. You've been a
           big help.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           Oh, it's nothing, sir.
                         
          Georges has already taken out his wallet and gives some money
          to the superintendent.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT (CONT'D)
           Thanks a lot, sir.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I'll let you know if I need you
           again.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           With pleasure, sir.
                         
          He gets ready to leave. He stops again in the doorway and
          turns around.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT (CONT'D)
           May I say something, sir?
                         
                          GEORGES
           What is it?
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           My wife and I, we're very impressed
           by the way you're managing
           everything. I take my hat off to
           you.
                         
          As he speaks, Georges' mobile phone has started to ring.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (taking the mobile phone from the
           pocket of his jacket)
           That's very kind of you. Thanks.
           See you soon.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           Give my regards to your wife.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I certainly will. Thanks.
           50.
                         
                         
          As the superintendent leaves the apartment, Georges looks at
          the display on his mobile phone and makes a call.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Hello Eva, how are you?... Things
           are fine.
                         
          SCENE 46 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges, standing at the foot of the bed, faces Anne and
          starts singing.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (insistently)...Sur le pont ...

                          ANNE

                          GEORGES
           (smiling to encourage her): ... Sur
           le pont d'Avignon...
                         
                          ANNE
           ... ssur... le ..
                         
                          GEORGES
           ... pont... Sur le pont
           d'Avignon... (he begins to sing):
           Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse,
           on y danse, sur le pont d'Avignon
           tout le monde y danse en rond...
                         
          He encourages her to sing with him. Starts singing again:
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Sur le pont d' Avignon, on y danse,
           on y danse ...
                         
          Anne tries to sing too, she has a hint of a smile on her
          face, but she produces only isolated SOUNDS.
           51.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (singing to encourage Anne,
           accompanied by the sounds that she
           produces): Sur le pont d'Avignon on
           y danse, on y danse ... Sur le pont
           d'Avignon tout le monde y danse en
           rond ...
                         
          SCENE 47 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          A second nurse is doing Anne's hair roughly. The brush sticks
          in her tangled hair.
                         
                          SECOND NURSE
                          ("CHEERY")
           ... there we are...now we're all
           beautiful again...so everybody will
           admire us...there...you see...
           wait...
                         
          She takes a mirror that she has placed within reach. Holds it
          in front of Anne's face.
                         
           SECOND NURSE (CONT'D)
           Well?... What do we say to that?
           Aren't we a pretty sight?
                         
          Anne, sickened, averts her eyes. Emits a muffled SOUND. The
          nurse ignores it.
                         
           SECOND NURSE (CONT'D)
           You'll see, Monsieur will be
           dazzled by you...
                         
          Furious SOUND from Anne.
                         
          SCENE 48 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The window opening onto the light well is open. A pigeon has
          landed on the window ledge.
                         
          It walks to and fro, then finally dares to jump down inside,
          onto the floor. It starts to explore the surroundings.
                         
          We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Georges comes out of the toilet.
          The door opening frightens the pigeon. Alarmed, flapping its
          wings, it flutters about the room.
                         
          After a moment of surprise, Georges tries to shoo it back
          toward the window. But the bird escapes in the opposite
          direction. George follows it.
                         
          He closes the doors of the other rooms. Coming from the
          bedroom, we faintly hear ANNE'S VOICE.
           52.
                         
                         
          Georges fetches a towel from the bathroom. He chases the
          bird. He hits out at the bird for so long that it escapes
          back out through the window. Georges, visibly exhausted, has
          to sit down on the chest in the hallway.
                         
          SCENE 49 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges and the second nurse.
                         
                          NURSE
           ... as you wish, sir. I don't know
           what you were expecting. I gave up
           another job to come and work here.
           You should have thought it over
           before deciding whether you wanted
           a second nurse or not.
                         
                          GEORGES
           But I've only just found out how
           incompetent you are.
                         
                          NURSE
                          (FURIOUS)
           What's that supposed to mean?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't want to discuss it with
           you. Anyway, you wouldn't
           understand.
                         
                          NURSE
           No one has ever complained.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Good for you. (To get rid of her)
           How much do I owe you?
                         
                          NURSE
           (after a brief calculation)
           Seven hundred and eighty euros.
                         
          Georges takes his wallet from his jacket hanging on the
          armchair and takes out eight one-hundred euro bills. The
          nurse is hopping mad.
                         
                          NURSE (CONT'D)
           I've never had anything like this
           happen to me before. Who do you
           think you are?! I've been doing
           this job for ten years. I don't
           need you to teach me how to do it.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Do you have twenty euros?
           53.
                         
                         
          The nurse takes out her purse angrily, looks inside.
                         
                          NURSE
           No.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Then take the eight hundred euros.
           You can go now.
                         
          The nurse pockets the money.
                         
                          NURSE
           You're a nasty old man. I feel
           sorry for you.
                         
          Georges has put back his wallet, turns to her again and looks
          at her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I hope from the bottom of my heart
           that one day someone treats you the
           way you treat your patients, and
           that you too will have no way of
           defending yourself. Now get out.
                         
          She looks at him, at first doesn't know what to answer, then:
                         
                          NURSE
           Go fuck yourself, you old fart!
                         
          She leaves, slamming the door behind her. A few seconds
          later, we hear the front door of the apartment fall shut.
          Georges sits down in his armchair, looks straight ahead. Then
          he lights a cigarette, his hands shake, he smokes.
                         
          SCENE 50 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          He tries to pour some tea into her mouth with the sipping
          cup. She won't loosen her lips.
                         
                          GEORGES
           ... Please, open your mouth... go
           on... open it... Anne! Please!...
           come on... stop that!...
                         
          He sits upright.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           If you don't drink, you'll die.
                         
          Indecipherable SOUND from ANNE.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Is that what you want?
           54.
                         
                         
          PAUSE. She looks at him. He bends over her again, presents
          the cup in front of her sealed lips.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Come on, Anne, please.
                         
          She doesn't react. He opens her lips with his fingers and
          tries carefully, but using some force, to separate her teeth.
          Pours a little tea in. The liquid runs out of her mouth.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
                          (ANGRILY)
           Goddammit!
                         
          He puts down the cup, takes a towel and wipes the liquid,
          some of which has run down onto the pillow. He tries to mop
          it up. She watches him the whole time. Finally he puts the
          towel down beside the cup and looks at her. Tries not to show
          his helplessness and his anger.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anne! ... You can't force me to let
           you die of thirst. If you persist,
           I'll call Bertier and he'll put you
           in hospital. They can force-feed
           you there. Is that what you want?
                         
          BRIEF PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I promised to spare you that. But
           you must help me. I'm out of my
           depth.
                         
          He takes the cup again and puts it against her lips.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Please, Anne!
                         
          Her lips remain sealed. He presses the cup hard against them.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Drink that, now!
                         
          It hurts her, so she opens her mouth and lets in a little
          liquid.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           There!
                         
          She closes her mouth again and he puts down the cup.
           55.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
                         
           Good.
                         
          Then she spits it all out like a fountain. After a moment of
          bewilderment, he slaps her.
                         
          SILENCE. He's frightened by his own gesture. Then he puts
          down the cup and sits on the chair beside the bed. They don't
          look at each other.
                         
          LONG PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
                          (SOFTLY)
           Help... help...
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (SOFTLY)
           Please, forgive me.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           (softly) Help... Help... Help...
           Help...
                         
          SCENE 51 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          The various paintings hanging in the apartment. Without their
          frames. Like views on various realities.
                         
          SILENCE. Sometimes, the REMOTE sound of TRAFFIC in the
          distance.
                         
          SCENE 52 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DINING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Living room.
                         
          Georges is drinking tea and reading the newspaper. SILENCE.
          Suddenly, the DOORBELL RINGS.
                         
          Georges, annoyed, puts down his newspaper, gets up, goes into
          the hallway and goes to the front door.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Who's there?
                         
                          EVA'S VOICE
           It's me.
           56.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Eva?
                         
                          EVA'S VOICE
           (a bit irritated) Yes.
                         
          Georges, panicked, thinks for a few seconds.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Just a minute.
                         
          He goes toward the bedroom door, locks it and puts the key in
          his pocket. He goes into the dining room, also closes the
          door leading to the bedroom. He comes back. He is about to go
          toward the front door, but remains motionless an instant,
          opens the door of the toilet that is located just nearby,
          flushes the toilet, closes the toilet door again and opens
          the front door.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Hello.
                         
          A brief kiss hello.
                         
                          EVA
           Hello. What was going on?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I was in the toilet. Sorry.
                         
          He closes the front door behind Eva, indicates the direction
          of the living room.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Come in.
                         
          Eva points to the bedroom with a questioning look. He shakes
          his head as if to play down the question, and indicates back
          in the direction of the living room, as if to say: "You
          understand, huh?". Eva is slightly irritated, but follows him
          into the living room.
                         
          He closes the door.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Why this unannounced visit? Where
           have you come from?
                         
                          EVA
           What's going on with Mom?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Nothing. What should be going on?
           57.
                         
                         
                          EVA
           Well... (gesture toward the
                          BEDROOM)
                         
                          GEORGES
           Don't you want to sit down first?
                         
          Eva wants to answer, but finally gives in and sits down.
          Georges does the same.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           So why are you in Paris?
                         
                          EVA
           What's going on with Mom? Why don't
           you answer the phone? After our
           last conversation, I left four
           messages on your answering machine.
           Why don't you call back?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Sorry. I didn't listen to it.
           Forgive me.
                         
                          EVA
           Don't you realize we're worried?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Your worries are no use to me.
                         
          Eva glares at him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           No, don't get me wrong. I'm not
           criticizing you. I just don't have
           the time to deal with your worries,
           that's all.
                         
                          EVA
           Dad...
                         
                          GEORGES
           No. Let's stop this conversation
           right there. I'm taking care of
           your mother. It's a full-time job.
           And I'm not saying that to
           complain, just to explain why I
           didn't answer your phone calls and
           why I don't want to have any
           pointless discussions on the
           subject. Your mother is just as
           could have been expected: bad the
           whole time.

                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           She is turning more and more into a
           helpless child, and it's sad and
           humiliating, for her and for me.
           And she doesn't want to be seen in
           that state either. Even the last
           time you visited, she didn't want
           you to come. You two have your own
           life. Nothing wrong with that. But
           let us have our life too. Even
           though it's a lousy one. OK?
                         
                          EVA
           Dad, what's the matter?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Nothing's the matter; your visit
           caught me by surprise. And I'm
           annoyed that you show up here to
           check that everything's OK. Who do
           you think you are?
                         
          PAUSE. Eva is speechless.
                         
                          EVA
           I...
                         
          Then she gets up and makes to go to the door.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Stay here, will you!
                         
          She stops short, looks at him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (softly, but insistently)
           Please!
                         
          She hesitates a moment, but winds up leaving the living room.
                         
          WE HEAR HER PASS IN THE HALLWAY TO GO INTO THE BEDROOM AND
          HER VAIN ATTEMPT TO OPEN THE DOOR.
                         
           EVA (O.S.)
           Mom? ... Mom??
                         
          Georges remains seated, motionless, until she comes back. She
          seems upset by the situation, as one would expect.
                         
                          EVA (CONT'D)
           Tell me, what's going on? Have you
           gone crazy?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Please, sit down.
           59.
                         
                         
                          EVA
           I don't want to sit down. What's
           going on here?
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (QUIETLY)
           Nothing's going on. I want to spare
           us all a pointless drama. I presume
           your mother is asleep. She mostly
           sleeps the whole day. And then she
           wakes up at night. If you really
           want to, we'll go and see her in a
           little while. Now, sit down. OK?
                         
          They look at each other.
                         
          Reluctantly, Eva heads toward her armchair and sits down.
          PAUSE. Then Georges goes on in a quiet voice:
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           We do our speech exercises every
           day, or we sing together. Most of
           the time, I wake up around 5. At
           that time, she's still awake. Then
           we change her incontinence pad. I
           rub cream on her to avoid sores.
           Then, around 7, I try to persuade
           her to eat and drink. Sometimes it
           works, sometimes not. Sometimes she
           tells me things from her childhood,
           then for hours she calls for help,
           and then an instant later she's
           giggling away to herself, or
           crying. Nothing of any of that is
           worth showing to anyone.
                         
          SILENCE. Eva looks down. Finally, she says:
                         
                          EVA
                          (SOFTLY)
           You can't stop me from seeing her.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (ALSO SOFTLY)
           No.
                         
          They remain seated for a moment, finally Eva gets up. Georges
          follows her into the hallway.
                         
          He unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom.
                         
          The bright light from outside filters through the blinds.
           60.
                         
                         
          Eva goes over to the bed, looks at Anne. Finally, she
          caresses her face, shyly and clumsily. Anne opens her eyes.
          Looks at her. No movement.
                         
                          EVA
           It's me, Mom.
                         
          Anne emits a FURIOUS SOUND.
                         
                          EVA (CONT'D)
                          (HELPLESS)
           Can I do something for you? Mom...
                         
                          ANNE
           Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom...
                         
          SILENCE.
                         
          Georges has remained by the door. After a while, they both
          leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the
          living room.
                         
          Georges closes the door. For an instant he puts a consoling
          hand on Eva's shoulder. Then he sits down.
                         
          Eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and
          looks outside. Suddenly she starts sobbing.
                         
          After a while, Georges gets up and goes out of the room. Eva,
          vexed, blows her nose.
                         
          Shortly after, Georges comes back. He has another teacup in
          his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down.
                         
                          GEORGES
           The tea isn't very hot any more.
                         
          Eva turns toward him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           But it does make you feel better.
                         
          After a short PAUSE, Eva comes toward the table. Sits down.
          He fills her cup.
                         
                          EVA
           Thanks.
                         
          She takes the cup, drinks. Replaces it. Still can't bring
          herself to look at him.
           61.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           It was silly of me to lock the
           door. I'm sorry. You took me by
           surprise, that's all. I'm sorry.
                         
          She nods her head, indicating she understands. Finally she
          looks at him:
                         
                          EVA
           What's going to happen now?
                         
                          GEORGES
           (with a little ironic laugh)
           What's going to happen now? The
           nurse comes twice a week, and every
           two weeks Dr. Bertier and the
           hairdresser come. That's what you
           want to know, right?
           Things will go on as they have done
           up until now. They'll go from bad
           to worse. Things will go on, and
           then one day it will all be over.
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
                          EVA
           You can't go on like this, Dad.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Can't I? What do you suggest?
                         
                          EVA
           Can't we have a serious talk, you
           and me?
                         
                          GEORGES
           What do you call "a serious talk"?
           What do you want to suggest? Do you
           want to have Mom live with you? Do
           you want to pack her off to a care
           home? Do you? What do you want? Go
           on, talk to me "seriously"!
                         
          Eva looks at him.
                         
          SCENE 53 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges is seated on the bed beside Anne, who is still
          bedridden.
           62.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           (in a rush)... short... short
           dress... only I... only I... all
           long... it was... (with a small
           gesture to imitate a bell): ding...
           dong...
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (SMILING)
           Yes, it swung to and fro.
                         
                          ANNE
           (still rushed) ... yes... to ...
           fro ... you... very serious... like
           that... (she imitates a serious
           countenance, continues in a low
           voice): like that... serious...
                         
                          GEORGES
           (unable to keep from laughing a
           little) Yes. I think I was pretty
           uptight.
                         
                          ANNE
           (smiling) yes... up... tight...
                         
          PAUSE. Anne puts her hand on Georges'.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           ... it was n...nice...
                         
          SILENCE.
                         
          SCENE 54 - INT. BATHROOM - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY
                         
                         BATHROOM
                         
          Georges is shaving. Suddenly we hear, coming from the
          bedroom,
                         
                          ANNE'S VOICE
           (loud) Help... Help... Help...
           Help... Help...
                         
          Georges wipes his face and, to the sound of Anne's cries,
          crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom.
                         
          Anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself.
                         
          Georges goes over to her bed.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (trying to calm her like a sick
           child) What is it?..
                          (MORE)
           63.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Are you in pain?... What's the
           matter?... Is your pad full?
                         
          He raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs, then
          replaces it.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           No... So what's hurting you?
                         
          He sits down beside her on the bed. Takes her hand.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           It's all right... it's all right ...
           I'm here... everything's fine...
           we'll... Hold on, I'll tell you a
           story... but you must be quiet, I
           can't talk too loud, it wears me
           out... Here we go: when I was
           little... well, I wasn't as little
           as all that... it was toward the
           end of primary school, so I was
           about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a
           holiday camp. They thought it would
           do me good to spend the summer with
           kids my own age... We were lodged
           in an old castle in the midst of a
           magnificent wooded landscape... I
           think it was in the Auvergne... I
           don't know... in any case it was
           the opposite of what I'd
           expected... We had to get up at 6
           and go for a morning swim. Not far
           from the castle, there was a pond
           fed by an icy mountain stream. We
           entered it running, in a double
           file. You know, I was never very
           sporty. They had a program to keep
           us on the go all day, probably to
           nip any potential pubescent
           impulses in the bud ... But the
           worst thing was the food. The third
           day after our arrival, there was
           rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice
           pudding. We sat at long tables in a
           huge hall. I didn't want to eat the
           stuff and the housemaster said to
           me: You won't get up until you've
           cleared your plate. So after the
           meal everybody left the room, and I
           remained seated, in tears. I had
           made a secret pact with Mom. I was
           to send her a postcard every week.

           64.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           If I was pleased with the place I
           was to draw some flowers on it, or
           if not, some stars. She kept the
           card; it was covered all over in
           stars. After three hours, I was
           allowed to leave the table. I went
           up to my room, got into bed and had
           a fever of 42 degrees. It was
           diphtheria. They took me to the
           nearest hospital where I was put in
           an isolation ward, which meant that
           Mom, when she came to visit me,
           could only wave at me through a
           window. At some point I lost that
           postcard. It's a pity.
                         
          Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story. He still
          holds her hand.
                         
          LONG SILENCE.
                         
          Then Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his
          pillow and presses it over her face. STIFLED SOUNDS from
          Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to
          move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it
          with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's
          movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without
          removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.
                         
          SILENCE.
                         
          SCENE 55 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Hallway.
                         
          The front door of the apartment is unlocked. Georges, in city
          clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut
          flowers. He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it
          in the closet.
                         
          The TELEPHONE RINGS. Georges takes the bags and carries them
          in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water.
          He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water.
          We watch him doing so for a while. Meanwhile, the TELEPHONE
          HAS STOPPED RINGING.
                         
          SCENE 56 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall
          closet. He is looking for a specific dress. He takes some
          out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its
          hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up
          again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He
          takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again.
           65.
                         
                         
          Looks at the dress. Then he lowers his arm a little and is
          about to leave the bedroom. He catches his feet in the dress.
                         
          He just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the
          wheelchair that is parked there. Exhausted, he flops down
          into it.
                         
          SCENE 57 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          With wide adhesive tape, Georges seals up the door frame of
          the bedroom.
                         
          SCENE 58 - INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING BEDROOM - HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast
          with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for
          reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible.
          Suddenly, Georges starts.
                         
          At the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between
          the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it.
          For a long time.
                         
          Then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the
          kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room.
                         
          On the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. He takes the
          wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen,
          carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm.
          Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it
          over the pigeon. But it manages to escape into the hallway.
                         
          Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times.
          The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up,
          flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light-
          well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an
          exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He
          cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans
          against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.
                         
          SCENE 59 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          From the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen
          table, writing. Finally we see what he is writing:
                         
          ... you won't believe it. A pigeon came in, for the second
          time already, through the light well. This time I caught it.
          In fact it wasn't difficult at all. But I set it free again.
          I'm going to ...
                         
          SCENE 60 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - HALLWAY - DAY
           66.
                         
                         
          Georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at
          the ceiling. O.S., we faintly hear the SOUND of running
          water, and from time to time the CLATTERING OF DISHES.
                         
          After a while, Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen.
                         
          He remains in the doorway and watches Anne who, doing the
          dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices
          his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually:
                         
                          ANNE
           I'm almost done.
                         
          Georges continues to look at her unwaveringly.
                         
                          ANNE'S VOICE
           You can put your shoes on if you
           want.
                         
          Georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her,
          goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet
          and puts on his shoes. O.S. we hear Anne finishing her work.
          She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears
          for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has
          got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is
          tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. When she comes out
          again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it
          on.
                         
                          ANNE
           Thanks.
                         
          They head for the front door.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Aren't you taking a coat?
                         
          Georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from
          the hook and they leave the apartment.
                         
          SCENE 61 - INT. HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DINING ROOM - LIVING ROOM
                         - DAY
                         
          Four long shots: all the windows are open. The sun is
          shining. It is fairly bright.
                         
          Hallway.
                         
          SILENCE. Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED. Eva comes
          into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door.
          Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes
          into the bedroom.
           67.
                         
                         
          Anne's twin bed isn't there any more. On Georges' bed lies
          only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes
          through the partition door into the dining room.
                         
          There, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living
          room.
                         
          There too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano
          stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she
          heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the
          table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table,
          turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear
          STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the
          armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room.
