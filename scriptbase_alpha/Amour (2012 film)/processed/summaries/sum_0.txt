Georges and Anne are a couple of retired music teachers enjoying life in their eighties.
However, Anne suddenly has a stroke at breakfast and their lives are never the same.
That incident begins Anne's harrowingly steep physical and mental decline as Georges attempts to care for her at home as she wishes.
Even as the fruits of their lives and career remain bright, the couple's hopes for some dignity prove a dispiriting struggle even as their daughter enters the conflict.
In the end, George, with his love fighting against his own weariness and diminished future on top of Anne's, is driven to make some critical decisions for them both.
