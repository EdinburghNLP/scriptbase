                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL INTERPLANETARY SPACE

               A vast field of stars. The gas giant Neptune slowly spins 
               into view. Brilliant and blue and cold against the void.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL A BLACK SILHOUETTE

               stands out against the planet, tiny against Neptune's scale.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL DRIFT CLOSER

               to discern the hard angles of a man-made craft. A ship. No 
               longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges: 
               a vast labyrinth of steel.

               Its shadow swallows all in darkness.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               Shafts of Neptune's blue light enter through windows, 
               illuminate debris suspended in the zero-gravity environment: 
               shards of metal and glass.

               MOVE from the Corridor into:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               A cockpit for three. Neptune's blue light fills the chamber, 
               reflects off immobile particles in the air. Thick quartz 
               windows look down at Neptune. The cockpit lights are dark 
               but for one blinking red light.

               An emergency beacon. Under-floor lights go on.

               The strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the 
               helm, slowly spinning. He is dead, perfectly preserved in 
               the cold vacuum of space. His eyes are empty black pits and 
               his mouth hangs open in a scream: DR. WILLIAM WEIR.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               Weir opens his eyes, waking from dream. Sweat beads his 
               ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist.

               He turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment. 
               Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count 
               photographs. His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful 
               woman.

               Weir reaches to the stand. Picks up...

               RECENT, UNFRAMED PHOTO

               The woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave 
               smile.

               Weir lies back on the bed. Looks at the photo. Presses it to 
               his forehead and closes his eyes. Trying to be with her, 
               just one more time.

                                     WEIR
                              (whisper)
                         I miss you.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

               Weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a 
               straight-razor. The mirror reveals the bathtub just behind 
               him. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP...

               Weir turns to stare at the bathtub. Water wells up at the 
               mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls... 
               DRIP.

               Weir turns back to his shaving.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

               Weir stands in the kitchenette, staring at the microwave as 
               it cooks his breakfast.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

               Weir stands before his window, chewing his oatmeal 
               mechanically, forcing himself to swallow. He reaches out to 
               open the blinds...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT REVERSE ANGLE

               as the blinds pull aside, revealing Weir, upside-down.

               ROTATE AND PULL BACK...

               EXT. DAYLIGHT STATION - MODEL TO REVEAL DAYLIGHT STATION

               Weir's window is just one of many in a space station, a 
               delicate combination of cylindrical habitats and solar panels. 
               The structure hangs above the Earth in low orbit.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT (BLINDS OPEN)

               A videophone RINGS OS...

                                     WEIR (V.O.)
                         This is Weir.

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                              (tinny)
                         Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like 
                         to see you as soon as possible.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DAYLIGHT - OFFICE

               A military office, United States Aerospace Command seal 
               blazoned on the door. Views of the Earth. Admiral HOLLIS 
               sits behind his desk, a gruff career officer and a good man.

               Weir enters, escorted by Hollis' adjutant, LYLE.

                                     WEIR
                         You wanted to see me, Admiral?

                                     HOLLIS
                         I apologize for the short notice, 
                         Bill, but we've had something come 
                         up that requires your immediate 
                         attention. Lyle?

               INT. HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

               Lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system. A 
               box magnifies the eighth planet, Neptune, revealing a flashing 
               red dot in its orbit.

               INT. DAYLIGHT OFFICE

                                     LYLE
                         At oh-three-hundred this morning, 
                         TDRSS picked up an automated 
                         navigation beacon broadcasting at 
                         two minute intervals in Neptune orbit.

               Lyle hands Weir a stack of hardcopy data. Weir reads the 
               data with growing excitement.

                                     WEIR
                         Incredible... These are the same 
                         coordinates before the ship 
                         disappeared... this, this happened? 
                         This isn't some kind of hoax?

                                     HOLLIS
                         I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. 
                         Houston confirms the telemetry and 
                         I.D. codes.

                                     WEIR
                              (excited)
                         It's the Event Horizon. She's come 
                         back.

               Hollis answers drily.

                                     HOLLIS
                         That ship was lost in deep space, 
                         seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed 
                         into New York harbor, I'd find it 
                         more plausible.
                              (beat)
                         Houston wants Aerospace to send out 
                         a search and rescue team, investigate 
                         the source of the transmission. If 
                         it really is the Event Horizon, 
                         they'll attempt a salvage.
                              (beat)
                         We need you to prepare a detailed 
                         briefing on the ship's systems for 
                         the salvage crew...

                                     WEIR
                         A written briefing can't possibly 
                         anticipate the variables on a mission 
                         like this. I have to go with them.

               Lyle looks at Weir, stunned by the request.

                                     LYLE
                         Dr. Weir, you have no experience 
                         with salvage procedures.

                                     WEIR
                         I designed the ship's propulsion 
                         system. I am the only person capable 
                         of evaluating the performance of the 
                         gravity drive. You can't send a Search 
                         and Rescue team out there alone and 
                         expect them to succeed. That would 
                         be like... like sending an auto-
                         mechanic to work on the shuttle.

                                     LYLE
                         I can understand your desire to redeem 
                         your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it 
                         doesn't factor into this.

                                     WEIR
                         This is not about my reputation! 
                         This is not about me at all!
                              (beat, passionate)
                         The Event Horizon was created for 
                         one reason: to go faster than light. 
                         Imagine mankind exploring new solar 
                         systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven 
                         years ago, we didn't just lose the 
                         ship and the crew. We lost the dream.
                              (beat, quiet and 
                              relentless)
                         I have to go.

                                     HOLLIS
                         It's not that simple.
                              (off of Weir's 
                              expression)
                         Lyle, play the recording for Dr. 
                         Weir.

                                     LYLE
                         Navigation Control tried to hail the 
                         vessel. This was the only response.

               Lyle presses a button on Hollis' desk. An unholy GARBLE rips 
               from office speakers: STATIC and NOISE and INHUMAN VOICES. 
               Alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck. Together, 
               they are unbearable.

               The sound mercifully cuts off to STATIC. Lyle stops the tape.

               Weir sits there, stunned.

                                     LYLE
                         Since the initial transmission, 
                         there's been no further contact. 
                         Just the beacon, every two minutes.

                                     WEIR
                         The crew? Could they still be alive?

                                     LYLE
                         The ship had life support systems 
                         for eighteen months. They're been 
                         gone seven years.

                                     WEIR
                         Someone sent that message. Admiral, 
                         you have to put me on that ship.

               Hollis stares at Weir, judging the man with his eyes.

                                     HOLLIS
                         It's against my better judgement, 
                         but I'll run this by the Man 
                         downstairs. You'll know my decision 
                         by the end of the day.

                                     WEIR
                         Thank you.

                                     HOLLIS
                         Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing 
                         you any favors.

               Weir leaves. The door closes behind him.

                                     LYLE
                         You're not seriously considering 
                         sending him?

                                     HOLLIS
                         You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. 
                         The man held Oppenheimer's chair at 
                         Princeton. If the Event Horizon had 
                         worked, he would have gone down in 
                         history as the greatest mind in 
                         physics since Einstein.

                                     LYLE
                         The official inquiry blamed Weir's 
                         design for the ship's loss.

                                     HOLLIS
                         That doesn't mean a damn thing. They 
                         were looking for a scapegoat and 
                         Weir fit the bill. But he's not 
                         responsible for what happened to the 
                         ship.

                                     LYLE
                         Does he know that?

                                     HOLLIS
                         What's on your mind?

                                     LYLE
                         He doesn't belong on this mission. 
                         Responsible or not, he blames himself. 
                         He's too close to it.
                              (beat)
                         And then there's his wife.

                                     HOLLIS
                         It's been two years since she died. 
                         He's over it.

                                     LYLE
                         Some things you don't get over.

               Beat.

                                     HOLLIS
                         I want our best people on this. 
                         Where's Miller?

                                     LYLE
                         The Lewis and Clark just returned

                         she's docked in bay four.

               EXT. DAYLIGHT STATION/EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK

               The Lewis and Clark pulls away from Daylight station, turns 
               towards the depths of space. It is a tough-looking spacecraft, 
               all engine.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               MOVE IN on thick quartz windows near the ship's nose: the 
               bridge...

               Split level. Above: avionics, navigation, flight control. 
               STARCK (female, Navigator, sharp mind, sharp tongue) checks 
               the navigation data on her screen as SMITH (male, Pilot, 
               wrapped too tight) punches in the course.

                                     SMITH
                         I can't believe this, I haven't gotten 
                         more than my hand in six weeks and 
                         now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, 
                         Mars has women...

                                     STARCK
                         Smith's right. Neptune? There's 
                         nothing out there. If something 
                         happens, we'll be on our own.

               The captain's chair drops from above, swivels to reveal MILLER 
               (male, Captain, intense).

                                     MILLER
                         I don't like it either, but you know 
                         the rules: we get the call, we go. 
                         Is the course locked in?

                                     SMITH
                         Locked and cocked.

                                     STARCK
                         We're past the outer marker, we can 
                         engage the ion drive whenever you're 
                         ready.

                                     MILLER
                         Justin?

               Below: the bridge's "war-room" -- ship's systems and mission 
               stations. JUSTIN (male, Engineer, young hot-shot).

                                     JUSTIN
                         Everything green on my boards, 
                         Skipper.

                                     MILLER
                         Start the countdown.

                                     STARCK
                         Ion drive will engage in... T-minus 
                         ten minutes.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's go.

               Miller slides down a ladder into the war-room. The others 
               follow into...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

               Bulky EVA (extra-vehicular activity) suits line the walls. 
               MUSIC blares from a JAMBOX, built into a storage locker.

               An Emergency Tech stows safety lines: COOPER -- male, the 
               resident pain-in-the-ass. He SINGS along with the music.

                                     MILLER
                              (not breaking stride)
                         Kill it.

               Cooper reaches up, turns off the box.

                                     COOPER
                         Time to play Spam in the can.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't start with me, Cooper.

               Cooper falls in as the crew continues into...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

               Evidence of long term habitation. Personalized lockers. Fold-
               down bunks, chairs, tables; currently stowed for docking. A 
               modular galley.

               PETERS (female, Emergency Technician, the crew's denmother) 
               and DJ (male, Doctor, a cold perfectionist) load CO2 scrubbers 
               into a bin in the floor.

               Weir stands to the side like a fifth wheel.

                                     WEIR
                         Captain Miller, I just want to say...

                                     MILLER
                         The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If 
                         you'll follow the rest of the crew, 
                         they'll show you to the gravity tanks.

               Weir hesitates, then follows the crew into Medical. Miller 
               hangs back.

                                     MILLER
                         What's the hold up?

                                     PETERS
                         Just loading the last of the CO2 
                         scrubbers.
                              (to Miller, accusatory)
                         Good for four months.

                                     MILLER
                         I put in for a replacement for you 
                         but no one...

                                     PETERS
                         No, no, its alright. I talked to my 
                         ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas 
                         and I'll get him this summer.
                              (beat)
                         Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen 
                         him in two months.

                                     MILLER
                         I am sorry. But now we have to go to 
                         work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL

               A high tech operating room. Modular equipment. Vertical tanks 
               line the walls, each large enough to hold a human being: 
               gravity couches.

               The crew stands before the gravity couches, almost nude, no 
               room for modesty.

               Starck catches Cooper looking at her ass as she strips to 
               her undergarments. Cooper grins. She flips him off, not 
               bothering to turn around.

                                     COOPER
                         Is that an offer?

                                     STARCK
                         It is not.

               Miller disrobes. Two service tags hang around his neck. He 
               does not remove them. Weir approaches him.

                                     WEIR
                         Captain Miller, I appreciate this 
                         opportunity...

                                     MILLER
                         Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on 
                         your mission because we want to. We 
                         were pulled off a well deserved leave, 
                         to be sent out to the middle of 
                         nowhere, and no one's even told us 
                         why.

                                     WEIR
                         I've been authorized to brief you 
                         and the crew once we reach Neptune 
                         space.

                                     MILLER
                         Until then, do what you're told and 
                         stay out of my way.

               Weir nods, moves to an empty couch bearing his name, written 
               on a piece of tape. Peters watches him.

                                     PETERS
                         First time in a grav couch?

                                     WEIR
                         Yes.

               She checks Weir's couch, helps him climb in. Weir keeps one 
               eye on Miller.

                                     PETERS
                              (Off of Weir's glance)
                         Don't worry about it. He's hard, but 
                         he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping 
                         out with him. He's one of the few 
                         Captains in the service with 
                         experience in the Outer Reach.

                                     WEIR
                         He's been past Mars?

                                     PETERS
                         He served on the Goliath.

                                     WEIR
                         Wasn't that ship destroyed?

                                     PETERS
                              (nods)
                         They attempted to rescue a supply 
                         shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's 
                         oh-two tanks ruptured during the 
                         rescue, flooded both ships with pure 
                         oxygen. There was a spark and both 
                         ships were incinerated. The Skipper 
                         and three others just made it to a 
                         lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...

                                     DJ
                              (interrupting)
                         He doesn't like to talk about it.

               DJ swathes one of Weir's arms with alcohol.

                                     DJ
                         You didn't eat anything in the past 
                         twelve hours?

               Weir shakes his head.

                                     DJ
                         When the Ion drive fires, we'll be 
                         taking about 30 gees. Without a tank, 
                         the force would liquefy your skeleton.

               DJ injects Weir. The scientist winces.

                                     WEIR
                         I've seen the effect on mice.

               The overhead lights change to red.

                                     MILLER
                         Five minutes.

               DJ hands him the breathing mask.

                                     DJ
                         Put this on.

               Weir does. DJ checks the fit.

                                     PETERS
                         You'll be fine. You'll wake up and 
                         we'll be there. Watch your fingers.

               DJ closes the tank. It begins to fill with green gel. Weir's 
               eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits. His 
               eyes close. His body draws into a fetal position.

               dead. A distant SOUND echoes though the ship, the unholy 
               garble of human and inhuman voices -- it is the Event Horizon, 
               calling to him -- the sound refines into a WOMAN'S VOICE, no 
               more than a WHISPER:

               A naked WOMAN sits at the helm, her back to us. Completely 
               still. Her skin is very pale. Water pools around her chair. 
               Weir stands behind her.

               She does not answer. She does not move. Weir reaches out to 
               touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid.

                                     WEIR
                         Claire? I'm sorry. Claire?

               He reaches out again. He touches her hair. She doesn't move. 
               Weir catches her reflection in the computer monitors. 
               Something wrong with her face... He starts to spin her around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL

               Weir awakes with a jolt, in his grav couch. His mask has 
               slipped. His tank has filled with blood. He is drowning.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL

               Reality. Weir's eyes open. He presses against the glass of 
               the tank, trying to force it open, panicked. The others are 
               already stepping from open tanks.

               Weir's tank opens with a HISS. He tumbles to the floor, 
               gasping, fluid streaming from his mouth.

               Peters rushes to him.

                                     WEIR
                              (gasping)
                         Claire...

                         DJ!
                              (to Weir)
                         It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.

               Weir catches his breath. He looks up. The crew surrounds 
               him, concerned.

                                     WEIR
                         I'm alright now. I'm alright...

               DJ helps him to his feet.

                                     DJ
                         Move slowly. You've been in stasis 
                         for fifty-six days. You're going to 
                         experience a little disorientation.

               Weir nods.

                                     COOPER
                         Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like 
                         that. Coffee?

                                     WEIR
                         What?

                                     COOPER
                         Coffee.

                                     WEIR
                         No, thank you.

               Cooper, still butt-naked and proud of it, grabs a metal 
               cylinder from the wall and pours a mug for himself.

                                     COOPER
                         Hey, Starck. You wanna dry my back?

               Starck gives him a cool once over.

                                     STARCK
                         Maybe when you finish puberty.

               Miller zips up.

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?

                                     STARCK
                         I just finished drying...

                                     MILLER
                         Then what are you doing here? Come 
                         on, people, let's go!
                              (to Cooper)
                         And Cooper... Put some pants on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SILENCE. The Lewis and Clark drifts towards Neptune.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

               The crew has secured the quarters from flight status. Bunks 
               have been folded down, each alcove personalized with 
               photographs and pin-ups.

               DJ moves around the cabin, checking the crew's radiation 
               badges.

               Cooper and Justin sit on their bunks, tossing a handball 
               across the cabin.

               Peters holds a "Watchman" video unit, watching a "video 
               letter"...

               Weir sits huddled in a blanket. Miller takes a seat next to 
               him.

               Starck and Smith enter. Starck sits next to Miller.

                         That's good to know. Justin, you 
                         wanna stow that?

               Justin catches the ball, holds onto it.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, listen up. As you all know by 
                         now, we have an addition to our crew. 
                         Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; 
                         Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --

                                     COOPER

                         This is Cooper, what the hell do you 
                         do on this ship, anyway?

                         I am your best friend. I am a

                         He's a rescue technician. Peters, 
                         medical technician. DJ...

                         And this is mission specialist Dr. 
                         William Weir. We all know where we're 
                         going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us 
                         why.

               Miller and the crew look at Weir, waiting. Weir clears his 
               throat.

                                     WEIR
                         What I am about to tell you is 
                         considered code-black by the NSA.

               The crew look at each other: they haven't heard that in a 
               mission briefing before.

                                     JUSTIN
                         That means top-secret, Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                         I heard it.

                                     WEIR
                         The USAC intercepted a radio 
                         transmission from a decaying orbit 
                         around Neptune. The source has been 
                         identified as the Event Horizon.

               STUNNED SILENCE. Then everyone talks at once:

                                     STARCK
                         That's impossible! She was lost with 
                         all hands, what, seven...

                                     JUSTIN
                         Seven years ago, the reactor blew...

                                     PETERS
                         How can we salvage...?

                                     SMITH
                         Let the dead rest, man...

                                     COOPER
                         ...cancel our leave and send us out 
                         on some bullshit mission...!

                                     MILLER
                         EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.

               In the quiet that follows:

                                     WEIR
                         What was made public about the Event 
                         Horizon, that she was a deep space 
                         research vessel, that its reactor 
                         went critical, that the ship blew 
                         up... None of that is true.
                              (beat)
                         The Event Horizon was the culmination 
                         of a secret government project to 
                         create a spacecraft capable of faster-
                         than-light flight.

               The crew stares at Weir: he has just dropped another bomb on 
               them.

                                     SMITH
                         You can't do that.

                                     STARCK
                         The law of relativity prohibits faster-
                         than-light travel...

                                     WEIR
                         Relativity, yes. We can't break the 
                         law of relativity, but we can go 
                         around it. The ship doesn't really 
                         move faster than the speed of light; 
                         it creates a dimensional gateway 
                         that allows the ship to 
                         instantaneously "jump" from one point 
                         in the universe to another, light 
                         years away.

                                     STARCK
                         How?

                                     WEIR
                         Well, in layman's terms, you use a 
                         rotating magnetic field to focus a 
                         narrow beam of gravitons; these in 
                         turn fold space-time consistent with 
                         Weyl tensor dynamics until the space-
                         time curvature becomes infinitely 
                         large and you have a singularity...

                                     COOPER
                         Laymen's terms.

               Weir thinks of another way to explain it. He rips a pin-up 
               from Smith's locker.

                                     SMITH
                         Hey...

                                     WEIR
                         Say this paper represents space-time, 
                         and you want to get from "point A" 
                         here...
                              (marks it on the photo 
                              with a pen)
                         ...to "point B," here.
                              (marks point B)
                         Now: what's the shortest distance 
                         between two points?

               The crew stares at him. Starck decides to play.

                                     STARCK
                         A straight line.

                                     WEIR
                         Wrong. The shortest distance between 
                         two points...

               Weir folds the paper, lining up point A over point B... then 
               THRUSTING his pen through both, skewering the pin-up.

                                     WEIR
                         ...is zero. That's what the 
                         singularity does: it folds space, so 
                         that point A and point B coexist in 
                         the same space and time. After the 
                         ship passes through this gateway, 
                         space returns to normal.
                              (hands the ruined pin-
                              up back to Smith)
                         It's called a gravity drive.

                                     JUSTIN
                         How do you know all this?

                                     WEIR
                         I built it.

               Even Cooper is impressed.

                                     COOPER
                         I can see why they sent you along.

                                     JUSTIN
                         So if the ship didn't blow up, what 
                         happened?

                                     WEIR
                         It was the ship's maiden voyage, to 
                         test the drive. The Event Horizon 
                         moved to safe distance using ion 
                         thrusters. They received the go-ahead

                         And the ship vanished from all our 
                         scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced 
                         optical, no radio contact of any 
                         kind. They disappeared without a 
                         trace.
                              (beat)
                         Until now.

                         That's what we're here to find out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. INTERPLANETARY SPACE - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark flashes silently past, heading deeper 
               and deeper into space.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The crew assembled.

                                     WEIR
                         We haven't been able to confirm any 
                         live contact, but TDRSS did receive 
                         a single transmission from the Event 
                         Horizon.

               Weir punches a button on a console. The transmission BLARES 
               from the bridge's speakers, STATIC and NOISE and, underneath 
               all, INHUMAN VOICES.

               The crew listen, look at one another. The recording ends 
               abruptly.

                                     SMITH
                         What the hell is that?

                                     PETERS
                         It doesn't sound like anything human.

                                     WEIR
                         Houston has passed the recording 
                         through several filters and isolated 
                         what appears to be a human voice.

               He activates a different file. The resulting WAIL is more 
               human but no less terrifying, a cry of despair. The last 
               message from a drowning man...

                                     SMITH
                         Jesus...

                                     MILLER
                         What is that?

                                     DJ
                         It sounds like Latin.

                                     COOPER
                         Latin? Who the fuck speaks Latin?

                                     STARCK
                         No one. It's a dead language.

                                     DJ
                         Mostly dead.

                                     MILLER
                         What does it say?

                                     WEIR
                         NSA encryption specialists have 
                         deciphered some of the message...

               Weir plays the HELLISH INCANTATION for a third time.

                                     WEIR
                         There: "...liberatis me..." They 
                         haven't been able to translate the 
                         rest, it's too distorted.

                                     DJ
                         "Liberatis me." "Save me."

                                     COOPER
                         From what?

                                     MILLER
                              (to Weir)
                         You're convinced the crew could still 
                         be alive? After seven years?

                                     WEIR
                         The Event Horizon only had life 
                         support for eighteen months. It seems 
                         impossible, but in light of the 
                         transmission... I have to think that 
                         someone has managed to endure until 
                         now.

                                     COOPER
                         Skipper, do we get hazard pay for 
                         this?

                                     MILLER
                         You heard the tape, Smith. We're 
                         looking for survivors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               RCS thrusters pivot and fire as the ship enters Neptune orbit,

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The ship begins to rock as it encounters atmosphere, a growing 
               vibration.

               GRAPHICS flash across the main window's HUD. Neptune's dark 
               shadow fills the screen.

                         We have a lock on the Event Horizon's 
                         navigation beacon. It's in the upper 
                         ionosphere, we're in for some chop.

                         We're all on edge, Smith. We're a 
                         long way out...

                                     SMITH
                         That's not it. That ship was built 
                         to go faster than light... That's 
                         just wrong, it goes against everything

                         Something like that, yeah.

               Miller grins grimly.

                         I guess we're about to find out. 
                         Keep us slow and steady.

                                     SMITH
                         Yes, sir.

                         Dr. Weir...!

               Weir sticks his head into the bridge.

                                     MILLER
                         I think you want to see this.

               Weir climbs up the ladder to the flight deck.

                                     WEIR
                         Where is she?

                         Dead ahead, 5000 meters.

               Suddenly, the ship SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY.

               Weir braces himself in the doorway, staring out the forward 
               window into the roiling azure clouds.

               Smith grimaces, his knuckles white at the controls.

                                     SMITH
                         We've got some weather.

                         I noticed. Starck, anybody home?

                         If they are, they're screening their 
                         calls.

               Only turbid clouds of methane ice whirl past the Lewis and

                         1500 meters. We're getting too 
                         close...

               A red warning light begins to flash in time with a shrill 
               BEEP.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The turbulence subsides. The bridge crew stares at the massive 
               craft. The only sound, the PROXIMITY WARNING. Finally:

                         She's not ugly.

               Miller reaches over Smith's shoulder, turns off the proximity 
               warning. Smith snaps back to business.

                                     SMITH
                         Range 500 meters and holding.

                         Look at the size of that thing.

               Weir explains the view out the cockpit window.

                                     WEIR
                         Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, 
                         medical and science labs, hydroponics, 
                         what have you. That central section 
                         connects the forward decks to the 
                         Engineering containment area. Can we 
                         move in closer?

                                     SMITH
                         Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna 
                         need a rubber...

                                     MILLER
                         Do it.

               Smith grimaces. His hands move carefully over the controls.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark moves even closer. Vanishing into the 
               shadow of the Event Horizon.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The crew stares at the ship rushing past the viewport. A 
               huge spherical structure looms eerily ahead.

                                     WEIR
                         That's the engineering containment. 
                         And there's the main airlock. We can 
                         dock there.

                                     MILLER
                         Smith, use the arm and lock us onto 
                         that antennae cluster.

                                     WEIR
                         Be careful. It's not a load bearing 
                         structure...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark carefully maneuvers in close to the Event 
               Horizon's airlock.

               A mechanical boom-arm extends from the smaller ship to latch 
               onto the Event Horizon. Its clawed hand grabs the antennae 
               cluster. The cluster buckles under the stress.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

                                     SMITH
                              (to Weir)
                         It is now.
                              (to Miller)
                         We're locked in.

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, give me a read.

               A scan of the Event Horizon appears across Starck's screen.

                                     STARCK
                         The reactor's still hot. We've got 
                         several small radiation sources, 
                         leaks probably. Nothing serious.

                                     WEIR
                         Do they have pressure?

                                     STARCK
                         Affirmative. The hull's intact... 
                         but there's no gravity and the thermal 
                         units are off line. I'm showing deep 
                         cold. The crew couldn't survive unless 
                         they were in stasis.

                                     MILLER
                         Find 'em, Starck.

               Starck frowns at her display.

                                     STARCK
                         Something's wrong with the bio-scan.

                                     MILLER
                         Radiation interference?

                                     STARCK
                         There's not enough radiation to throw 
                         off the scan. I'm picking up trace 
                         life forms, but I can't get a lock 
                         on the location.

                                     WEIR
                         Could it be the crew? If they were 
                         in suspended animation, wouldn't 
                         that effect the scan?

                                     STARCK
                         If they were in stasis, I'd get a 
                         location, but these readings, they're 
                         all over the ship. It doesn't make 
                         any sense.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by 
                         deck, room by room. Starck, deploy 
                         the umbilicus. I believe you're up 
                         for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your 
                         bonnet on.

                                     JUSTIN
                         Yes, sir!

               Weir starts to follow Justin from the bridge.

                                     MILLER
                         Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.

                                     WEIR
                         Captain, I didn't come out here to 
                         sit on your bridge, I need to be on 
                         that ship...

                                     MILLER
                         Once the ship is secured, we'll bring 
                         you on board --

                                     WEIR
                              (interrupting)
                         That is not acceptable --

                                     MILLER
                              (overlapping)
                         -- once we've secured the ship, that's 
                         the way it is!
                              (beat)
                         I need you to guide us from the comm 
                         station. This is where I need you. 
                         Help us to do our job.

               Weir exhales.

                                     WEIR
                         Very well.

               The docking collar umbilicus extends to the Event Horizon's 
               airlock.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

               Miller, Peters, Justin and Cooper in EVA; Cooper and Justin, 
               without headgear.

                                     COOPER
                         ...come on, Skipper, I already put 
                         my shoes on...

                         You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's 
                         Justin's turn. Stay on station. If 
                         anything happens...

                                     COOPER
                         I'll be all over it.

               Miller nods to Peters.

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         Opening inner airlock door.

               The inner airlock door opens: CH-THUNK. Miller, Peters and 
               Justin enter the airlock. Justin attaches his safety line. 
               Miller and Peters do not.

                                     COOPER
                         You still need the rope? I thought 
                         you were one a those spacemen with 
                         ice in ya veins.

                                     JUSTIN
                         I'd rather be on the rope and not 
                         need it than need it and not have 
                         it. Now step aside, old man.

               Cooper puts Justin's helmet on. It seals tight.

                                     COOPER
                              (serious now)
                         You just keep your nose clean, Baby 
                         Bear. Clear the door.

               Cooper backs out, allowing the inner airlock door to shut, 
               ECHOING through the ship.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS

               Miller, Peters and Justin float down the brightly lit 
               umbilicus into the Event Horizon, all in EVA suits. Justin's 
               safety line trails out behind him.

               The OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR of the Event Horizon waits for them.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Weir has taken over Justin's station. He watches the POV 
               monitors like a kid watching Christmas. Smith and Starck 
               keep tabs over his shoulder.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS

               Peters attaches a thumper -- a device using sound waves to 
               measure pressure -- to the inner airlock door.

                                     PETERS
                         We've got pressure.

                                     MILLER
                         Clear and open on my mark. Three... 
                         two... one... mark.

               Peters inserts a zero-G drill into the panel beside the door. 
               The door slowly opens...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The immense corridor stretches away into darkness in both 
               directions. Distantly spaced windows manifest as remote pools 
               of blue light amidst endless black, adding to the vast sense 
               of scale.

               The light from their dual spotlights on the team's helmets 
               reflects off tiny ice crystals of frozen atmosphere. They 
               are ants in a tomb built for giants.

                         Ice crystals everywhere. This place 
                         is a deep freeze.

                         You're in the central corridor. It 
                         connects the personnel areas to 
                         Engineering.

                         Peters and I will search the forward 
                         decks. Justin, take Engineering. No 
                         hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?

                                     JUSTIN
                         Not a chance, sir.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               The group separates. Justin kicks off from the wall, shoots 
               down the corridor at immense speed.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               Miller and Peters move in the opposite direction. They use 
               magnetic plates on their boots and gloves to cling to the 
               walls as they slowly make their way down the dark shaft. 
               Their journey seems endless. The darkness almost seems a 
               living thing as it surrounds them.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller spots something at a coupling, where two sections of 
               the corridor join...

                                     MILLER
                         Dr. Weir, what's this?

               Miller indicates a box nestled against the coupling. The 
               universal symbol for explosives is on the cover.

                                     PETERS
                              (ahead at the next 
                              coupling)
                         Here's another one. They're all over 
                         the place.

                              (radio)
                         They're explosive charges.

                                     MILLER
                         I can see that, what're they for?

                                     WEIR
                         In an emergency, the charges detonate 
                         in series, destroying the central 
                         section and separating the personnel 
                         areas from the rest of the ship. 
                         That way, if the gravity drive 
                         malfunctions, the crew could use the 
                         foredecks as a lifeboat.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Peters and Miller keep moving.

                                     PETERS
                         That means they didn't abandon ship.

                                     MILLER
                         So where are they? Starck, any luck 
                         with the bio-scan?

                         I'm running diagnostics now,

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller and Peters unconsciously look around. Sweat beads 
               their faces.

                                     PETERS
                         There's no one in the corridor but 
                         us.

                         Not according to the computer.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters is right, no one's here.

                                     PETERS
                         I don't know, this place is really 
                         dark, I can't see a thing...

               She starts to wave her searchlight around wildly.

                                     MILLER
                              (calming her down)
                         Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. 
                         Let's finish the sweep.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         Captain Miller, the foredecks are 
                         just ahead.

                                     PETERS
                         I can see the hatch.

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, you still showing those 
                         readings?

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         That's an affirmative.

                                     MILLER
                              (to Peters)
                         Keep your eyes open.

               She nods as he reaches for the hatch...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               The hatch opens, allowing Peters and Miller entrance into 
               the forward decks. These areas were intended for human 
               habitation, and seem similar in design to the Lewis and Clark, 
               only larger.

               Gravity couches line both walls, eighteen in all. Empty.

                                     PETERS
                         We found the gravity couches.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Weir peers eagerly at the monitors.

                         Any survivors?

                         Negative.

               Hope drains from Weir's face.

                         They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving 
                         forward.

               Miller and Peters split up, each taking a separate exit from 
               the chamber.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Weir looks at Justin's POV screen: a grainy image of the 
               First Containment Seal.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR (BY FIRST SEAL)

               Justin stands before a thick pressure door. Justin checks 
               the door with his thumper, his boots are now on.

                         You've reached the First Containment 
                         Seal. The engineering decks are on 
                         the other side.

                                     JUSTIN
                         We still have pressure. The radiation 
                         count's steady at 7 millirads an 
                         hour.

                         Background radiation. Perfectly safe.

               Justin touches a panel beside the door. It opens. He enters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               ...a long corridor shaped like a tube. It rotates like a 
               turbine, causing vertigo. Justin's BREATH echoes in his helmet 
               as he moves forward...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

               Cooper stares at Justin's safety line in the airlock.

               THE SAFETY LINE

               counts off silently, passing 150 meters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

               The corridor ends at a pressure door.

                                     PETERS
                         Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?

                                     WEIR (O.S.)

                         You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. 
                         You still haven't seen any crew?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Miller, moving through a deserted lab. Empty operating tables. 
               Stainless steel surgical instruments float in zero-G. A glove 
               floats up behind him, brushes his shoulder. He wheels... the 
               glove is empty. It spins away.

                                     MILLER
                         If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd 
                         know about it.
                              (looking around)
                         I'm in Medical. No casualties, it 
                         looks like this place has never been 
                         used.

               He finds a computer console.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

               Peters opens the door.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

               Peters enters. Looks around: a small antechamber for crew 
               briefings, with chairs and a display table. Red crystals 
               float in a crimson mist around her.

                                     PETERS
                         I found something.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Weir peers at the monitors, trying to make out the red haze.

                                     WEIR
                         Yes, we can see some kind of mist. 
                         What is that?

                                     PETERS (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         Blood. Looks like arterial spray.

                                     PETERS
                              (confused)
                         There's no one here.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         The blood came from somewhere, 
                         Peters...

                                     PETERS
                         There's no one here, Skipper.

               Peters takes a sample container from her belt. Carefully 
               tries to capture a suspended crystal...

                                     PETERS
                         Come on...

               CLOSE UP OF THE BLOOD CRYSTAL

               and the Container; Peters' brow furrowed with concentration.

               WIDER AS A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES THE ROOM, 
               REVEALING...

               ...THE WALL BEHIND PETERS, CASED IN A FROZEN EXPLOSION OF 
               BLOOD AND TISSUE. Someone died here in a violent and terrible 
               way.

               Peters starts to look up but the flash dies away. She never 
               saw the horror behind her.

               Peters turns her attention back to her tiny crystal. She 
               traps the it, returns the container to her belt.

               She moves from the antechamber into...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Her helmet lights sweep the room. Every surface a control 
               panel.

                                     PETERS
                         Okay. I'm on the bridge.

               Peters examines the other consoles -- most are dark but for 
               a few dim lights.

                                     PETERS
                         Everything's been shut down. 
                         Conserving power, I guess. Green

               On her monitor, Peters' POV shifts as she complies.

               Peters reaches towards a small video deck. Touches the eject 
               button. Nothing happens.

                                     PETERS
                         It's stuck.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               Justin's light bounces off an even larger pressure door, 
               built like a bank vault. The Second Seal.

                                     JUSTIN
                         I've reached another containment 
                         door. This thing's huge...

                              (radio)

                         I'm going in.

               Justin opens the seal. It releases SLOWLY, inching open. 
               Justin squeezes through.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Peters takes a small probe from her belt, inserts it into 
               the video deck.

               A small laser disc emerges partway from the deck. Peters 
               pulls on it. It doesn't move.

                                     PETERS
                         It's really jammed in there.

               A shadow crosses the window behind her. Someone -- something -- 
               is in there with her...

               Peters pulls harder. Nothing. Another effort. The disc pulls 
               free. Peters spins in the zero-gravity, spinning into...

               ...A BODY floating at the helm, the face illuminated by 
               Peters' helmet lights. His swollen tongue clogs his gaping, 
               screaming mouth. His cracked and crystallized skin is crossed 
               by a network of bloated veins. He has no eyes. Just like 
               Weir's dream.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Peters' monitor shows the CORPSE'S face, its mouth open in 
               mute agony. Weir GASPS.

                         Decompression wouldn't do that.

               Weir just stares at the ruined face, rapt. Starck notices.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               The Second Seal is open. Justin's safety line snakes into 
               darkness.

               FOLLOW the safety line into the dark...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               An alcove, opening into a vast chamber. Once pristine, all 
               the surfaces have been coated in a dark gray slick. Globules 
               of fluid hang motionless, sticking to Justin's suit, leeching 
               away his light and swallowing him in darkness.

                                     COOPER (O.S.)
                              (radio)

                         Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.

                                     COOPER (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck 
                         are you?

                                     JUSTIN
                         I'm in the Second Containment area. 
                         It's pitch black in here. There must 
                         have been a coolant leak. Man, this 
                         shit is everywhere. I can't see a 
                         damn thing.

               A lighted console blocks Justin's view of the chamber beyond. 
               He drifts over to it, wipes the console clear of coolant, 
               revealing dim lights: the station has power.

                                     JUSTIN
                         The reactor's still hot. Coolant 
                         level is on reserve, but still in 
                         the green.

               TIGHT ON JUSTIN'S FACE AS THE LIGHTS COME ON

               His expressions changes as he looks past the console and 
               sees... something.

               JUSTIN'S POV - THE CORE

               A massive sphere, 10 meters in diameter, dominates the center 
               of the second containment. Intricate machinery surrounds the 
               sphere but the globe itself is featureless, smooth; a 
               enigmatic monolith. Black ice encrusts it, giving it the 
               seeming of a living thing.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               They stare at Justin's monitor.

               Justin reaches towards the Core with his pressure sensor.

               His helmet light flickers. He hesitates...

               Justin places the pressure sensor against the Core. Touching 
               it.

               The Core turns deepest black. A darkness that light cannot 
               penetrate. For a second, Justin's white suit is captured 
               against the hungry void...

               the briefest suggestion of a SCREAMING FACE, obscured by

               The rest of the crew's POV screens go dead as...

               ...the wave hits them, threatening to tear the Lewis and

               place with a HISS.

               The inner airlock door opens. As Cooper enters the airlock,

               fills the Bridge. The frozen corpse floats before her. No 
               longer a man.

               A young boy, maybe five years old. His legs are withered, 
               useless things. The skin remains a crystallized surface, but

               Cooper catches him, holds him tight as the wave carries them 
               towards the wall. Cooper sees a control rod -- a long metal 
               spike -- coming at them. He twists his body so that they 
               miss -- barely -- before slamming into the wall.

                         we just bought.

                         We haven't tested the air yet. It

                         No time. We need whatever's left in 
                         our suits to repair the Clark. Like

                         for three billion kilometers.

               Miller pulls his helmet off with a HISS. He breathes deep. 
               Starck does the same, coughs.

                         we take. And the CO2 filters on the

                         I thought of that, with the filters 
                         from the Clark, we've got enough 
                         breathable air for twenty hours. 
                         After that, we'd better be on our 
                         way home.

                         What about the life readings you 
                         picked up?

                         The Event Horizon sensors show the 
                         same thing: "Bio-readings of 
                         indeterminate origin." Right before 
                         that wave hit the Clark, there was 
                         some kind of surge, right off the 
                         scale, but now it's back to its 
                         previous levels.

                         What's causing the readings?

                         I don't know, but whatever it is, 
                         it's not the crew.

                                     MILLER
                         So where is the rest of the crew? 
                         We've been over every inch of this 
                         ship and all we've found is blood. 
                         Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?

               Weir just stares at the bloodstained wall.

               The Lewis and Clark clings to the giant craft, as 
               insignificant as a tick. An even smaller figure clings to

               It's Smith, EVA in full protective gear. His magnetic boots 
               hold him to the Lewis and Clark's hull. He kneels over a 
               hole in the hull, where the metal has buckled and torn. Vapor 
               still leaks from the hole into space.

                                     SMITH
                         Captain Miller, you copy?

                         I've found a six inch fracture in 
                         the outer hull. We should be able to 
                         repair it and re-pressurize, it's 
                         gonna take some time.

                         Understood.

               Smith uses a foam applicator to fill the hole. The gel freezes 
               in place. Smith reaches to his belt, pulls out a ZERO-G 
               NAILGUN. Presses it to the patch and begins to rivet it into 
               place.

                                     DJ
                         His vitals are stable, but he's 
                         unresponsive to stimuli. He might 
                         wake up in fifteen minutes. He might 
                         not wake up at all.

                                     PETERS
                         What happened to him?

               DJ shakes his head. Miller eyes the bloodstain above them.

                                     MILLER
                         DJ, take samples from these stains, 
                         compare them to medical records, I 
                         want to know whose blood this is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Gravity has scattered debris and freeze-dried blood about 
               the room. The crew (Justin and Smith excepted) tries to relax 
               on the chairs of dead men. Their faces are wan and haggard.

               Weir relaxes at the table. Unlike the others, he seems almost 
               at ease. DJ remains forever stoic; Starck, animated and 
               nervous. Cooper bounces the handball on the floor, a reflex 
               action.

               Miller stares at a video monitor, watching Smith repair the 
               Lewis and Clark. He turns from the window.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, people, there's been a change 
                         in the mission. In less than eighteen 
                         hours, we will run out of breathable 
                         air. Our primary objective is now 
                         survival. That means we focus on 
                         repairing the Lewis and Clark and 
                         salvaging whatever will buy us more 
                         time.
                              (pause)
                         Our secondary objective is finding 
                         out what happened to this ship and 
                         its crew. Two months from now, I 
                         fully intend to be standing in front 
                         of the good Admiral giving my report, 
                         and I'd like to have more than my 
                         dick in my hands.

               Grim smiles all around.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters, I want you to go through the 
                         ship's log, see if we can't find 
                         some answers.

                                     PETERS
                         I can use the station in Medical, 
                         keep an eye on Justin...

                                     MILLER
                         Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat 
                         the bio-scan...

                                     STARCK
                         What's the point? I'll just get the 
                         same thing...

                                     MILLER
                         Not acceptable. I want to know what's 
                         causing those readings. If the crew 
                         is dead, I want the bodies, I want 
                         the crew found.

                                     STARCK
                         I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, 
                         amylase proteins.

                                     MILLER
                         Do it. Dr. Weir...

                                     WEIR
                         Yes.

                                     MILLER
                         One of my men is down. I want to 
                         know what happened to him.

                                     COOPER
                         I told you. He was inside the Core...

               Weir starts shaking his head.

                                     COOPER
                         It was like... nothing was there... 
                         and then Justin appeared and the 
                         Core... became metal...

                                     WEIR
                              (cutting him off)
                         No, he didn't.

                                     COOPER
                         You weren't there. I saw it.

                                     WEIR
                         Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you 
                         really see, because what you're 
                         describing is not physically 
                         possible...

               Cooper throws the ball at him, hard. Weir ducks. It bounces 
               wildly around the room. Miller catches it.

                                     MILLER
                         Cooper! Enough!

               Cooper sits down.

                                     MILLER
                              (turning on Weir)
                         Dr. Weir, Justin may die. Whatever 
                         happened to him could happen to all 
                         of us.

               Beat.

                                     WEIR
                         I don't know what happened to Justin.

                                     COOPER
                         I'm telling you, I saw it...

                                     WEIR
                         What you saw could have been an 
                         optical effect caused by gravitational 
                         distortion.

                                     COOPER
                              (turning on Weir)
                         I know what I saw and it wasn't a 
                         fucking "optical effect!"

                                     MILLER
                         Hold on, what's this "gravitational 
                         distortion?"

                                     WEIR
                         It's possible that a burst of gravity 
                         waves escaped from the Core, 
                         distorting space-time. They could be 
                         what hit the Lewis and Clark.

                                     MILLER
                         What could cause them?
                              (Weir doesn't answer)
                         What's in the Core?

                                     WEIR
                         It's complicated...

                                     MILLER
                         How much time do you need? We have 
                         seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. 
                         Now: what is in the Core?

               Beat. Here comes another bomb...

                                     WEIR
                         A black hole.

               The crew stares at him, stunned.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Miller, Starck and Weir stand before the Core. Dark ominous 
               structures loom around them, glistening with coolant. The 
               PULSE of the ship is loud here, a deep THRUM that steals 
               their breath. Weir's voice is a reverent WHISPER:

                                     WEIR
                         That's how the gravity drive works, 
                         you see: it focuses the black hole's 
                         immense gravitational power to create 
                         the gateway. That's how the Event 
                         Horizon travels faster than light.

                                     STARCK
                         I can't believe we built this.

                                     MILLER
                         It's insane.

                                     WEIR
                         "Insane?" The finest astronauts fought 
                         to be posted to this ship. It would 
                         take the Lewis and Clark a thousand 
                         years to reach our closest star. The 
                         Event Horizon could be there in a 
                         day...

                                     MILLER
                         If it worked.

                                     WEIR
                         If it worked, yes.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - 3RD SEAL

               They stare at the Core, the surrounding machinery moving in 
               a slow giant's dance. A trick of the eye, or does the Core 
               stare back at them?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

                                     MILLER
                         I want this room sealed. The Second 
                         Containment is off limits.

                                     WEIR
                         There's no danger. The black hole is 
                         contained behind three magnetic 
                         fields, it's under control.

                                     MILLER
                         Your black hole damn near ripped my 
                         ship apart. It may have killed one 
                         of my men.
                              (beat)
                         No one goes near that thing.

               MOVE IN ON THE CORE

               until its darkness fills the screen...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Peters sits before the computer workstation, running the 
               ship's log, forwarding through hours of boring footage. Rubs 
               her eyes.

               The lights flicker.

               Peters hears something RUSTLING behind her. She turns...

                                     PETERS
                         Justin...?

               Justin lies unmoving on the nearest examination table. 
               Comatose. Peters reaches out and picks up a scalpel.

               Peters hears the sound again, FINGERNAILS ON PLASTIC. She 
               moves past Justin...

               ...past several empty tables, covered with clear plastic...

               ...to the last table. She stares in shock.

               THERE'S SOMETHING UNDERNEATH THE PLASTIC COVER

               She slowly reaches out. Lifts the cover.

               Her son DENNY looks at her and GIGGLES. She GASPS. The scalpel 
               drops to the floor at her feet.

               Denny reaches up to her, to be picked up...

                                     DENNY
                         Mommy...

               ...but the plastic that still covers his withered legs squirms 
               like a bag full of snakes...

               Peters drops the plastic and backs away.

                                     DJ (O.S.)
                         Peters?

               She turns. DJ stands in the doorway, holding blood samples.

               Peters turns back, but her son is gone.

               DJ reads her expression.

                                     DJ
                         What's wrong?

                                     PETERS
                         Nothing. It's nothing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 2

               The Airlock light turns red -- a warning. The Inner Airlock 
               door control flashes: "LOCKED." The Outer Airlock door opens.

               Smith enters. He closes the Outer Airlock door. Atmosphere 
               HISSES into the chamber. The Inner Airlock door flashes: 
               "PRESSURIZED."

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 2

               Cooper in EVA, getting ready to go outside. The Inner Airlock 
               door opens. Smith enters. Takes off his helmet.

                                     COOPER
                         You been out there a long time. Trying 
                         to break my record?

                                     SMITH
                         I'd rather spend the next twelve 
                         hours Outside than another five 
                         minutes in this can. This ship is 
                         bad. It watches you.

                                     COOPER
                         What?

                                     SMITH
                         You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: 
                         trying to go faster'n light, that's 
                         like the Tower of Babel.

                                     COOPER
                         Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical 
                         on me.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Starck programs the sensor workstation. She glances over at 
               Weir: sitting at a computer terminal, his face rapt as data 
               flashes by. His lips move, muttering to himself.

                                     STARCK
                         Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.

                                     WEIR
                         Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved 
                         the Event Horizon more than I loved 
                         her. I told her that wasn't true, I 
                         just knew the Event Horizon better, 
                         that's all.

                                     STARCK
                         Claire is your wife?

                                     WEIR
                         Yes.

                                     STARCK
                         It must be hard, being so far away 
                         from her.

                                     WEIR
                         Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years 
                         now.

                                     STARCK
                         I'm sorry.

               Weir keeps his attention focused on the screen.

                                     WEIR
                         These things happen.
                              (reacting to something 
                              on the screen)
                         Wait a minute, that's not right...

               He fingers fly across the keyboard, double-checking the data.

               Miller leans over Weir's shoulder.

                                     MILLER
                         You have something, Dr. Weir?

                                     WEIR
                         The date.

                                     MILLER
                         What about it?

                                     WEIR
                         The Event Horizon's computer think's 
                         it's 2034.

                                     MILLER
                         It's 2041...

                                     WEIR
                         Exactly. The ship's internal clock 
                         is off by seven years.

                                     STARCK
                         Maybe a power interruption crashed 
                         the system...

                                     WEIR
                         No, there's no evidence of a surge 
                         or spike of any kind. It's as if 
                         time just... stopped for seven years.

                                     MILLER
                         Explanation?

                                     WEIR
                         Intense gravitational fields effect 
                         the passage of time, it's possible...

                         it's all math, you see, but as to 
                         what really happened...
                              (he shakes his head)
                         The Event Horizon has passed beyond 
                         our plane of reality, and like 
                         Lazarus, returned from the dead.

               Miller freezes the frame. He squints at the screen...

               Obscured by static, the image is blurred beyond comprehension.

               Suddenly, the lights fade out. Dim emergency lighting snaps

                         We barely have enough power for life 
                         support as it is, if we can't stop 
                         the drain, we're not gonna make it.

                         The Core...!

               Weir heads for the door.

                                     MILLER
                         Wait!

               But Weir has vanished into the corridor.

                                     MILLER
                         The rest of you, stay here, I don't 
                         want anyone else going near that 
                         thing.

               Miller follows after Weir.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               The Second Containment Seal opens. Weir is about to enter 
               when Miller stops him. He checks a Geiger counter. It is 
               silent.

                                     MILLER
                         No radiation. What's causing the 
                         drain?

               Weir crosses to a console. Frowns.

                                     WEIR
                              (shakes his head)
                         The magnetic fields are holding. 
                         Maybe a short in the fail-safe 
                         circuit. I'll check it out.

               Miller assists Weir in removing bolts from an access panel. 
               The panel falls away, revealing a cramped duct leading into 
               the ship's circuitry.

               Weir climbs into the duct. Miller hands him a flashlight and 
               a toolkit.

                                     MILLER
                         We don't get the power back, our 
                         air's gonna go bad.

                         dioxide may be the least of our 
                         worries.

               Weir begins to crawl into the depths of the ship.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

               Weir's breath ECHOES in the cramped shaft. He counts off 
               circuit panels as he goes:

               Miller slogs through the coolant to the Core. Stares at it. 
               It remains metallic, mundane.

               He pulls out a Geiger counter and crosses to the reactor 
               shell. Examines a gleaming weld. The Geiger counter CLICKS 
               slowly: no leak.

               Justin's eyes remain unfocused, unseeing as he tries to speak.

               DJ leans in close, trying to hear him speak...

               Justin arches in agony and the words come in a strangled,

               POPPING.

                         There you are.

               He uses a screwdriver to open up the module. Reveals a series 
               of circuit boards. One SPARKS. Weir plucks the damaged chips 
               and starts running a by-pass.

               His flashlight flickers. He bangs it against the duct wall. 
               It grows dimmer. Goes out.

                                     WEIR
                         Um. Captain Miller? I, uh, I seem to 
                         have a problem with my light.

               A single DRIP of water in the darkness...

               Another DRIP, then a woman's VOICE like a distant echo:

                         Billy.

               Weir starts at the sound. He recognizes the voice.

               She speaks again, no longer far away, but a close WHISPER in 
               his ear:

                                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
                         Billy. Help me. I'm so cold.

               Weir's eyes open wide in hope and fear.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Even the emergency lights go out. Total darkness.

                                     MILLER
                         We just lost all power in here. Dr. 
                         Weir...?

               Miller's voice trails off as he looks towards the Core. A 
               red glow reflects across his eyes. He takes a few steps away 
               from the reactor. He stares...

               ...at the BURNING MAN, standing before the Core. The deep 
               ROAR of its conflagration fills the containment.

               It slowly turns and raises its arm and points at Miller in 
               accusation.

                                     BURNING MAN
                         Don't leave me...

               Miller stares as the Burning Man turns and vanishes into a 
               bulkhead, leaving the wall blackened and burned with his 
               passing.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

               Total darkness. Weir's breath ECHOES in the cramped metal 
               space.

                                     WEIR
                              (a whisper)
                         Claire...?

               Weir bangs his flashlight. Again. Again...

                                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
                         Help me. I'm so cold.

               The flashlight flickers...

               Claire's face is inches from Weir's.

                                     CLAIRE
                         So cold.

               His flashlight flickers again, snaps on...

               She is gone. Weir lets his head fall to the floor of the 
               deck, breathing in ragged SOBS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

               The crew, except for Cooper. DJ whets a scalpel against the 
               leg of his jumpsuit, an unconscious gesture. FLICK. FLICK. 
               FLICK.

                                     DJ
                         Carbon dioxide poisoning produces 
                         hallucinations, impaired judgement...

                                     MILLER
                         Goddammit, DJ, it was not a 
                         hallucination! I saw a man, he was 
                         on fire. And then he disappeared.

                                     STARCK
                         Maybe one of the original crew?

                                     MILLER
                         No. It was someone else.

                                     STARCK
                         Who?

                                     MILLER
                              (ignoring the question)
                         Dr. Weir, you were right there, you 
                         must have heard something, seen 
                         something...

                                     WEIR
                         No. I saw nothing.

                                     PETERS
                         I did.

               All heads turn to her.

                                     PETERS
                         About an hour ago. In medical. I saw 
                         my son. He was lying on one of the 
                         examination tables and his legs 
                         were...
                              (she trails off)

                                     WEIR
                         Isn't it possible that you were 
                         traumatized by finding the body on 
                         the bridge?

                                     PETERS
                         I've seen bodies before. This is 
                         different.

               She falls silent, unwilling to say more.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters is right. Its like something 
                         reaching into your mind. Seeing your 
                         thoughts and making them real. Smith, 
                         did you or Cooper experience anything 
                         unusual?

               Smith, leaning against the doorway:

                                     SMITH
                         I didn't see anything and I don't 
                         have to see anything. This ship is 
                         fucked.

                                     WEIR
                         Thank you for that scientific 
                         analysis, Mister Smith.

                                     SMITH
                              (exploding)
                         Hey! You don't need to be a scientist 
                         figure it out...

                                     MILLER
                         Smith...

               Weir's face is stone.

                                     SMITH
                         ...you break all the laws of physics, 
                         you think there won't be a price? 
                         You already killed the first crew...

                                     MILLER
                         That's enough!

               DJ lays one hand on Smith's shoulder to calm him...

               Smith reacts violently, turning on DJ, shoving him back. DJ 
               uses Smith's momentum to spin the pilot into the wall. He 
               presses his scalpel just below Smith's ear...

                                     MILLER
                         DJ!!

               DJ freezes. The scalpel falls from his hands. He releases 
               Smith.

                                     DJ
                         I'm sorry, I... I don't know why I 
                         did that.

                                     WEIR
                              (wry)
                         Carbon dioxide.

               Smith goes for Weir.

                                     SMITH
                         He's fucking lying, you know 
                         something...!

               Miller heads him off, grabs him.

                                     MILLER
                         That's it, that's enough for one 
                         day, Smith! I need you back on the 
                         Clark, I need you calm, I need you 
                         using your head, you make a mistake 
                         out there, none of are getting home, 
                         you understand?

               Smith calms.

                                     SMITH
                         Sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Get outside, go back to work. I'll 
                         join you shortly.

               Smith leaves.

                                     MILLER
                         We're a long way from home and we're 
                         in a bad place. Let's not make it 
                         worse. If anyone has any constructive 
                         suggestions, now is the time.

                                     WEIR
                         I think I can stabilize the fields 
                         around the singularity, that should 
                         prevent another power drain.

                                     MILLER
                         Do it.

                                     DJ
                         To conserve our oxygen, we should 
                         severely restrict our activity. Anyone 
                         who can should get some sleep.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't need sleep, DJ. I need 
                         answers.

               Miller exits. Starck follows.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               STARCK TRAILS MILLER:

                                     STARCK
                         Miller...

                                     MILLER
                              (not slowing)
                         What is it, Starck?

                                     STARCK
                         ...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA 
                         filter. The results were bio-readings 
                         of indeterminate origin...

                                     MILLER
                              (simultaneous)
                         "...bio-readings of indeterminate 
                         origin," don't you have anything 
                         useful to tell me?

                                     STARCK
                         I've got a theory.

               Miller stops.

                                     MILLER
                         Go ahead.

                                     STARCK
                         There was a another surge in the bio-
                         readings right before you... you saw 
                         what you saw. We picked up a similar 
                         readings right before the Clarke was 
                         damaged. What if there were a 
                         connection between the two? The 
                         gravity waves, the hallucination, 
                         all part of an defensive reaction, 
                         like an immune system...

               Miller starts walking again.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't need to hear this.

               She rushes to follow.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 2

               Miller and Starck enter the Airlock Bay:

                                     STARCK
                         You've got to listen...

                                     MILLER
                         To what? What are you saying? This 
                         ship is alive?

                                     STARCK
                         I didn't say that, I said the bio-
                         readings correspond to what happened 
                         to you, the ship is reacting to us...

                                     MILLER
                         We're hanging on by our fingernails 
                         and you're giving me bullshit 
                         stories...

               She grabs him by the arm.

                                     STARCK
                         It's not bullshit, it's the only 
                         conclusion the data supports...

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, do you know how crazy that 
                         sounds? It's impossible.

                                     STARCK
                         I know that.

               Beat. Miller allows himself to relax.

                                     MILLER
                         If you knew it was impossible, then 
                         why'd you waste my time?

                                     STARCK
                         I thought you wanted an answer. And 
                         that's the only one I have.

               Miller pulls an EVA suit from the wall, starts putting it 
               on.

                                     MILLER
                         What I want is to survive the next 
                         ten hours.

                                     STARCK
                              (checks her watch)
                         Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm going outside to work on the 
                         Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone 
                         what you just told me. We've got 
                         enough to worry about.

               She nods. He locks his helmet into place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANOTHER ANGLE. The ship seems to breathe. The lights 
               flicker...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Peters has fallen asleep in her chair.

               On the threshold of hearing, a distant POUNDING. Not a 
               heartbeat. Metal on metal. Something trying to get out. 
               Something trying to get in.

               Peters wakes with a start.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin...?

               She turns. Justin lies on the floor in a heap, completely 
               covered by his sheet. She crosses to him. Pulls back the 
               sheet...

               Revealing empty nitrogen tanks.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin!

               She looks up, eyes widening, as...

               The IV bottles fill with blood. Blood fills the X-ray 
               lightboxes, it surges up from gutters in the floor...

               And the pounding grows louder... LOUDER... almost to 
               Medical...

               The spell breaks and she RUNS...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Peters sprints, the SOUND BOOMING after her, almost on her 
               heels...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

               Peters darts into the Bridge Antechamber. She SLAMS the 
               pressure door shut behind her, CUTTING OFF the sound.

               She turns. Weir, DJ, Starck look up from their work, staring 
               at her.

                                     DJ
                         What's wrong?

                                     PETERS
                         You didn't hear it? You must have 
                         heard it!

                                     STARCK
                         Heard what?

               Beat. Peters starts to LAUGH, part hysteria, part relief.

                                     PETERS
                         Oh... nothing...

               DJ crosses to Peters, concerned.

                                     DJ
                         Sit down...

               As he reaches out to touch her...

               BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. POUNDING ON THE DOOR ITSELF

               Peters SCREAMS. DJ clutches her to him, backs away from the 
               door.

               The POUNDING grows louder. LOUDER. The door vibrates with 
               each blow Starck puts her hands over her ears. Peters SCREAMS 
               at the door.

                                     PETERS
                         Stop it! Stop it!

               But the POUNDING intensifies, metal GROANING under incredible 
               pressure.

                                     DJ
                              (shouting to be heard)
                         What is it?

               Weir slowly walks to the door.

                                     STARCK
                         What are you doing?

                                     WEIR
                         It wants me. I have to go.

               He reaches for the door.

                                     STARCK
                         No...!

               Starck grabs him. He tries to shake her off, but she traps 
               his arm in a wrist-lock. He turns on her, his face furious...

               ...and the POUNDING stops. They remain frozen for a moment. 
               Afraid to breathe.

               Weir shakes the trance.

                                     STARCK
                         In our current environment, Dr. Weir, 
                         self-control is an asset.

                                     WEIR
                         I'm alright. Please.

               In the distance, the POUNDING begins again. Moving away from 
               them.

               The ship systems station BEEPS. A warning light flashes on 
               the console.

                                     STARCK
                         What is it?

                                     WEIR
                         The forward airlock.

                                     STARCK
                              (into radio)
                         Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in 
                         the airlock?

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         That's a negative, Starck.

                                     PETERS
                              (realization)
                         Justin.

               Peters, Starck and DJ rush from the Bridge, leaving Weir 
               behind.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR NO. 2 - WITH 
               AIRLOCKS

               Peters leads Starck and DJ down the corridor towards the 
               Forward Airlock bay. They round a corner in time to see a 
               figure moving in the Airlock.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               They race into the bay even as Justin steps into the Airlock. 
               He is naked.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin, no!

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Justin turns and stares through them with cold eyes. He 
               reaches out to the airlock control.

               The pressure door shuts with a HISS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

               Miller, Smith and Cooper cling to the Lewis and Clark's hull. 
               They carefully remove an access panel, revealing scorched 
               wiring.

                                     COOPER
                         We'll have to re-route through the 
                         port conduit to the APU.

                                     SMITH
                         What about the accumulator...?

               Starck's VOICE breaks in:

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)

                                     MILLER
                         What's going on in there, Starck?

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         Justin's in the airlock.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               Starck at the intercom. The others huddle by the door.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         What?

                                     STARCK
                         He's awake, he's in the airlock, 
                         he's not wearing a suit.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

                                     MILLER
                              (to Cooper)
                         Stay here! Don't stop working!

                                     COOPER
                         But Justin...

                                     MILLER
                         I'll get him.

               Miller swings his body around, heads across the umbilicus to 
               the Event Horizon. He moves in great leaps, using the magnetic 
               plates in his gloves and boots to keep from drifting off 
               into Neptune's thin atmosphere.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               Starck works the airlock control panel without success.

                                     STARCK
                         He's engaged the override.

                                     PETERS
                         Can you shut it down?

               She opens the Airlock access panel.

                                     STARCK
                         I'll try. DJ, you better get your 
                         bag of tricks.

               DJ nods, runs off. Peters bangs on the Airlock door.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin! Open the door!

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Peters' voice barely penetrates the pressure door:

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         Open the door!

               Justin turns off the artificial gravity. He begins to float 
               gently.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Miller moves like a frantic spider across the surface of the 
               Event Horizon.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm on my way, Starck.

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         You better hurry. He's engaged the 
                         override, we can't open the inner 
                         door.

               Miller curses under his breath, moves even faster...

                                                                   BACK TO:

               Peters, against the window:

                              (muffled)
                         The door, Justin! Open the door!

               He fixes his gaze upon the outer airlock door. And beyond 
               it, space. He speaks in a flat monotone:

                                     JUSTIN
                         Did you hear it?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               They are stunned to hear his voice. Peters answers:

                                     PETERS
                         Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.

                                     STARCK
                         Keep him talking.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Weir sits alone, listening to the VOICES on the intercom.

                         The dark inside me.

               A LOW MOAN escapes Weir's lips. He cradles his head in his 
               hands.

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING)

               Miller races across the surface of the Event Horizon, the 
               only sounds, his LABOURED BREATHING, and Justin's tortured 
               VOICE, patched through on his radio:

                         Justin, look at me. Look at me. Open 
                         this door.

               DJ runs up with his medkit.

                                     STARCK
                         I don't think she can talk him down. 
                         We need a sedative.

                                     DJ
                         If he opens the outer door he'll 
                         turn inside-out.

               Starck's hands fly as she re-wires the circuits. Sweat beads 
               her face.

                                     STARCK
                         Almost got it.

                         Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...

               Justin looks at her with dead eyes. He reaches out to gently 
               touch the glass between them.

                                     JUSTIN
                         If you could see the things I've 
                         seen, you wouldn't try to stop me. 
                         You'd come with me.

               Justin's hand moves to the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR control. 
               Hesitates... then floats to the OUTER AIRLOCK control. Hits 
               it.

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         NOOO!

               A yellow warning light flashes. A warning klaxon WHOOPS, 
               deafening.

               Justin jerks his hands to his ears, closes his eyes...

                         Hey, Mama-Bear... what are doing...?

               And then he realizes where he is...and what is about to 
               happen.

                                     JUSTIN

                         I can't! The inner door can't open 
                         once the outer door has been 
                         triggered, it would decompress the

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING)

               Miller moves through the Event Horizon superstructure, 
               recklessly leaping from one beam to another, trying to build 
               up speed.

                                     MILLER

                         They can't do that Justin, now listen 
                         carefully...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Miller moves faster and faster, his BREATH echoing in his 
               helmet. He can see the exterior airlock just beyond a deep 
               chasm in the ship's superstructure. If he misses this jump, 
               Justin will not be the only man to die today.

               He doesn't hesitate but leaps, soaring across the chasm 
               towards the airlock.

                                     JUSTIN
                              (radio)

                         You're not going to die! Not today! 
                         I want you to do exactly as I say 
                         and I'm gonna get you out of there,

                         Justin. I won't let you die.

               Miller's words give Justin hope. He regains some control.

                                     JUSTIN
                         Okay... okay...

               Justin breathes hard and follows Miller's hurried 
               instructions:

                                     MILLER

                         Tuck yourself into a crouched 
                         position, shut your eyes as tight as 
                         you can!

               Miller lands on the superstructure opposite the exterior 
               airlock.

                                     MILLER
                              (radio)
                         Exhale everything you got, Baby Bear, 
                         we can't have any air in those lungs, 
                         blow it all out...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Justin goes into a fetal crouch and covers his eyes.

                                     JUSTIN
                         Oh god --

               He wheezes out all his air...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Miller squats on the girder, ready to push off. He focuses 
               on the 5 meters of space between him and the airlock...

               The outer doors OPEN...

               The rush of escaping atmosphere carries Justin's body out...

               Miller pushes off... catches Justin's body... sending them 
               both back towards the open Airlock...

               Ice forms on Justin's body. His veins bulge. Blood fountains 
               from his noise and mouth, forming a red icicle over his face.

               Miller pulls him into the Airlock. Five seconds have passed 
               since the airlock door opened.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Miller closes the Airlock behind them. Air HISSES into the 
               chamber. Justin's body hits the deck as "normal" gravity 
               exerts itself.

               Miller opens the Inner Door. Peters and DJ rush in.

                                     PETERS
                         Oh God... Justin...

               DJ puts a tube in the Justin's mouth immediately, feeding 
               him oxygen.

                                     PETERS
                         I've got a pulse, he's alive...

                                     DJ
                         Pressure?

                                     PETERS
                         90 over 50 and falling... .

                                     DJ
                         He's crashing...

               Blood bubbles from Justin's mouth and eyes. He GASPS, then 
               SCREAMS, spraying blood from his mouth.

                                     DJ
                         He can breathe. That's good. Let's 
                         get him to Medical, go, go!

               Starck helps DJ and Peters carry Justin from the Airlock. 
               Miller sits there, exhausted. Reaches up and pulls his helmet 
               off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               One of the tanks has been activated. Swaddled in bandages, 
               Justin floats within, suspended in green gel. The others -- 
               DJ, Starck, Peters, Miller, Weir -- look exhausted.

                                     DJ
                         He'll live... if we ever make it 
                         back.

                                     MILLER
                         We'll make it.

                         in four hours.

               Peters stands, looking at Justin's ravaged form floating in 
               the tank.

                                     MILLER
                              (gently)
                         Peters. We need to know what happened 
                         to the crew. Before it happens to 
                         us.

                                     PETERS

                         I'll get back to the log. But on the 
                         bridge, I won't go back, back in 
                         there...

                         Justin said something about, "The 
                         dark inside me..." What did he mean?

                                     WEIR
                         It means nothing.

                                     MILLER
                         Is that your "expert opinion?" The 
                         only answer we've had out of you is 
                         "I don't know."

                                     WEIR
                         Justin just tried to kill himself. 
                         The man is clearly insane.

                                     DJ
                         How would you explain your own

                         What?

                         On the bridge. You said "it" wanted 
                         you.

               Weir glances at Justin...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY -- POV OF CLAIRE

               But it's not Justin in the tank. It's his wife CLAIRE, naked, 
               wet, dead. Weir stares at her.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY

                                     WEIR
                         I said that?

                                     DJ
                         Yes. You did.

               Weir blinks. Justin floats in the grav couch. Weir turns 
               back to the others.

                                     WEIR
                         I don't remember saying that.
                              (covers with a joke)
                         Maybe I'm insane, too.

               Weir exits.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Miller follows Weir out of the Gravity Couch Bay.

                         I want to know what caused that noise. 
                         I want to know why one of my crew 
                         tried to throw himself out of the 
                         airlock.

                         Thermal changes in the hull could 
                         have caused the metal to expand and 
                         contract very suddenly, causing 
                         reverberations --

                                     MILLER
                              (exploding)
                         That's bullshit and you know it! You 
                         built this fucking ship and all I've 
                         heard from you is bullshit!

                                     WEIR
                         What do you want me to say?

                                     MILLER
                         You said this ship creates a 
                         gateway...

                                     WEIR
                         Yes...

                                     MILLER
                         To what? Where did this ship go? 
                         Where did you send it?

                                     WEIR
                         I don't know...

                                     MILLER
                         Where has it been for the past seven 
                         years?

                                     WEIR
                         I don't know...

                                     MILLER
                         The "Other Place," what is that...?

                                     WEIR
                         I DON'T KNOW!
                              (beat, calm again)
                         I don't know. There's a lot of things 
                         going on here that I don't understand. 
                         Truth takes time.

                                     MILLER
                         That's exactly what we don't have, 
                         Doctor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Miller moves through the maze of the ship, heading for the 
               Bridge.

               As he reaches a junction, he hears...

               ...A DISTANT CRY...

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Don't leave me...!

               Miller wheels like a cat, staring wildly down the branching 
               corridors.

               Nothing. He is alone. Miller leans against the wall, sinks 
               to the floor, rests his head in his hands.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL

               The grotesque ship continues it's orbit as the moon Triton 
               eclipses the sun. Darkness swallows all.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               DJ enters, checks Justin's display.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                         Any change?

               DJ turns, surprised. Miller sits, barely visible in the dark.

                                     DJ
                         No. No change.
                              (beat)
                         I've analyzed Justin's blood samples. 
                         There's no evidence of excessive 
                         levels of carbon dioxide. Or anything 
                         else out of ordinary.

               A grim LAUGH from Miller.

                                     MILLER
                         Of course not. Justin just climbed 
                         into the airlock because he felt 
                         like it. Just one of those things.
                              (beat)
                         I swore I'd never lose another man. 
                         I came close today. Real close.

                                     DJ
                         "Another man?" Who?

               Miller nods, pulls his service medal from beneath his 
               jumpsuit.

                                     MILLER
                         It was on the Goliath. There was 
                         this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a 
                         lot like Justin. Edmund Corrick, 
                         from Decatur, Georgia. He got caught 
                         when the pressure doors sealed, one 
                         closed on his arm. Severed it at the 
                         wrist. The pain of that must have 
                         been... He passed out and...

               Miller trails off. DJ waits patiently. Finally:

                                     MILLER
                         I, I tried to go back for him, to 
                         save him, but I couldn't get to him 
                         in time. The fire... Have you ever 
                         seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like 
                         a liquid, it slides over everything. 
                         It was like a wave breaking over 
                         him, a wave of fire. And then he was 
                         gone.
                              (beat)
                         I never told anyone until now. But 
                         this ship knew, DJ. It knows about 
                         the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. 
                         It knows our secrets. It knows what 
                         we're afraid of.
                              (beat, wan smile)
                         And now you're going to tell me it's 
                         carbon dioxide.

                                     DJ
                         No.

               Miller sees something in DJ's expression.

                                     MILLER
                         What is it?

                                     DJ
                         I've been listening to the 
                         transmission. And I think Houston 
                         made a mistake in the translation.

                                     MILLER
                         Go on.

               DJ plays the recording again. Stops it abruptly.

                                     DJ
                         They thought it said, "Liberatis 
                         me," "Save me," but it's not "me." 
                         It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."

                                     MILLER
                         It's not a distress call. It's a 
                         warning.

                                     DJ
                         It gets worse.

               Miller stares at him.

                                     DJ
                         It's very hard to make out, but listen 
                         to this final part.

               He plays the recording again.

                                     DJ
                         Do you hear it? Right there.

                                     MILLER
                         Hear what?

                                     DJ
                         It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," 
                         from; "infera," the ablative case of 
                         "inferi." "Hell."

                                     MILLER
                         "Save yourself. From Hell."
                              (beat)
                         What are you saying, are you saying 
                         that this ship is possessed?

                                     DJ
                         No. I don't believe in that sort of 
                         thing.
                              (beat)
                         But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship 
                         has passed beyond the boundaries of 
                         our universe, of reality. Who knows 
                         where this ship has been... What 
                         it's seen...
                              (beat)
                         And what it's brought back with it.

               DJ looks at Miller. He does not have an answer. The intercom 
               CRACKLES:

                                     COOPER (O.S.)

                                     MILLER
                              (into intercom)
                         On my way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Miller stands in his EVA suit in the darkened bridge. He 
               twists a manual valve.

                                     MILLER
                         Alright, Cooper.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

               Cooper looks at Smith.

                                     COOPER
                         Cross your fingers.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               A moment later, mist flows from the vents into the bridge, 
               filling it with atmosphere. Miller watches the pressure rise 
               on his suit gauge.

                                     SMITH (O.S.)

                         You got it, Coop.

               Miller removes his helmet. Breathes deep.

                                     MILLER
                         Back in business.

               Peters sits in front of the screen. The log is still 
               distorted.

               Frustrated, she types in a series of instructions. Get to 
               her feet.

                                     PETERS
                         You got any coffee?

                                     STARCK
                         It's cold.

                                     PETERS
                         I don't care.

               Behind Peters, the process refines, accelerates... pieces 
               coming together like a jigsaw...

               Peters turns around. Sees the screen. The coffee slips from 
               her hand to the floor.

                                     PETERS

               Starck turns, sees the screen.

                         Sweet Jesus. Miller... MILLER!

               Miller, Starck, DJ watch the video. Peters turns away, 
               miserable. Unable to watch...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE THE VIDEO SCREEN

               still distorted by static and roll, but finally lucid: FOUR 
               ORIGINAL CREW of the Event Horizon. On the Bridge.

               ONE MAN dislocates his shoulder with a WET POPPING sound as 
               he shoves his arm down his own throat. Blood bubbles from 
               his nose. With a SHUCKING sound, he pulls his stomach out 
               his mouth...

               Behind him, a MAN and WOMAN fuck, covered with blood. She 
               bites through his neck. His head lolls to the other side. 
               She buries her face in the torn flesh as he thrusts into her 
               again and again...

               Presiding over them, KILPACK. His eyes are bloody holes. His 
               hands reach out in offering. In the palms of his hands, his 
               eyes.

               Kilpack opens his mouth and speaks with an INHUMAN VOICE.

                                     KILPACK
                         Liberatis tutemet ex infera...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Miller switches off the video. No one says anything.

                         We're leaving.

                                     WEIR
                         You can't, your orders are specific...

                                     MILLER
                         "...to rescue the crew and salvage 
                         the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. 
                         Weir. This ship killed them. And now 
                         it's killing us.

                                     WEIR
                         You're insane. You've lost your mind.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe you're right. But it's still 
                         my command, and I have leeway to 
                         abort when I feel there is an 
                         unacceptable threat to my crew. And 
                         I think there is.

                         It's done.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK

               Peters enters, carrying heavy CO2 scrubbers. Smith stops 
               her.

                                     SMITH
                         What's going on, sweethearts?

                                     PETERS
                         CO2 scrubbers for the Clark. Miller 
                         pulled the plug on the mission.

               Smith smiles.

                                     SMITH
                         About goddam time.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               Weir follows Miller down the Corridor.

                                     WEIR
                         What about my ship?

                                     MILLER
                         We will take the Lewis and Clark to 
                         a safe distance and then launch tac 
                         missiles at the Event Horizon until 
                         I am satisfied that she has been 
                         destroyed.
                              (beat)
                         Fuck this ship.

                         You... You can't do that!

                                     MILLER
                         Watch me.

               Miller turns to walk away. Weir grabs Miller, wheeling him 
               around, almost frenzied.

                                     WEIR
                         You can't kill her, I won't let you! 
                         I lost her once, I will not lose her 
                         again...!

               Miller shoves Weir back into the wall. The two stare at each 
               other. Adversaries...

               The lights cut to emergency lighting.

                                     STARCK (O.S.)

                         Miller, come in ...

               Miller finds the intercom:

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, what the hell is going on?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Starck peers at the Engineering board:

                                     STARCK
                              (into intercom)

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               Miller and Weir are barely visible in the darkness.

                                     MILLER
                         Goddammit! Starck, get those files 
                         and vacate. I want off this ship.

               He releases the intercom.

               Weir's voice is a WHISPER as he backs into the shadows.

                                     WEIR
                         You can't leave. She won't let you.

                                     MILLER
                         Just get your gear back onto the 
                         Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll 
                         find yourself looking for a ride 
                         home.

               Weir is swallowed by the darkness.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                         I am home.

               REGULAR LIGHTING snaps on...

               Miller looks around. Dr. Weir has vanished.

                                     MILLER
                         Weir? WEIR!

               He slams the intercom:

                                     MILLER
                         All hands. Dr. Weir is missing. I 
                         want him found and restrained.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Starck gathers all the files and disks. Shuts down the 
               consoles, one by one.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Smith and Peters finish removing CO2 scrubbers from panels 
               in the walls.

                                     SMITH
                         Let's go, let's go, this place freaks 
                         me out...

                                     PETERS
                         Last one.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               Peters follows Smith down the First Containment towards the 
               Main Access Corridor, carrying the last case of scrubbers. 
               She begins to lag behind.

               A GIGGLE echoes down the First Containment.

                                     PETERS
                              (whisper)
                         Denny?

               She turns back to the Second Containment...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT POV PETERS

               A SMALL FIGURE dashes through the darkness in the Second 
               Containment. Denny...?

                         Smith.

               Peters turns, but Smith is already out of sight. She 
               hesitates. Moves back towards Second Containment.

               Again, Peters hears the GIGGLE of a child. The SCRAPE of 
               metal on metal. She slowly moves forward...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               ...into the darkness of the Second Containment. Peters sees 
               an open access panel. She looks inside.

               PETERS' POV - ACCESS DUCT

               A narrow tube, vanishing into darkness. A YOUNG CHILD'S VOICE 
               echoes from far away:

                                     DENNY (O.S.)
                         Mommy...

               PETERS

               ducks her head and enters the access duct.

                                     PETERS

               The bridge lights flicker, illuminate...

                         around, she's gone. She could be 
                         anywhere.

                                     MILLER
                         Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. 
                         I'll find her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT

               Peters moves through the duct. Reaches a junction. Anything 
               could be with her, there in the dark.

               A child's WHISPER, too faint for words. Peters turns...

               Behind her, FOREGROUND, a YOUNG CHILD dashes across the 
               corridor.

               Peters turns back. Too late to see. Again, the child's WHISPER 
               draws her onward.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny? Denny, come to Mommy...

               FAINT LAUGHTER is her only answer. She follows the sound, 
               now climbing into a vertical shaft that takes her higher and 
               higher...

                                     PETERS
                         Hold on, Denny, Mommy's coming...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT - CATWALK

               Peters pulls herself up from the vertical shaft onto a catwalk 
               that snakes between huge oily machinery, just in time to 
               see...

               A SMALL CHILD running, disappearing into the gloom ahead.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny?

               She runs forward into a junction. The lights flicker red.

               Her son can barely be seen in the flickering darkness ahead.

               He reaches his arms out to her...

               Peters steps forward, reaching for her son...

               ...falling into an open access hatch, hidden in the dark...

               Peters hits hard, lies before the Core, an offering of flesh 
               and blood. Her legs twist beneath her, shattered; blood pools 
               around her head. Her chest heaves: still alive.

                                     PETERS

               Denny peers down from the top of the shaft and GIGGLES. CLAPS 
               his hands in childlike glee.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Weir wanders into First Containment, brooding.

                              (to himself)

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Weir enters the Second Containment. Freezes as he sees...

               Peters body lying twisted and broken before the Core.

                                     WEIR
                         Oh no. Peters...?

               He rushes to Peters. Reaches out to touch her but pulls his 
               hand back. Her eyes are black, eight-ball hemorrhage darkening 
               the irises. She is dead.

                                     WEIR
                         Why did you do that? You didn't have 
                         to do that...

               Weir looks up from Peters' corpse.

               CLAIRE stands before the Core. She is naked. Her skin is 
               pale and beautiful and cold and wet. Her hair hangs in her 
               face, covering her milk-white eyes...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               Claire stands naked before the bathroom mirror. Behind her, 
               the tub steams...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - (SEX AND SUICIDE 
               INTERCUT)

               Weir stares at Claire in shock. She walks to him. Slowly.

               She stops in front of him. Her arms hang at her sides. He 
               must reach for her.

               He does, putting his hands on her hips. He slides from his 
               chair to the floor to his knees. He presses his face to her 
               pale belly and cries. SOBS wrack his body...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...and in the bathroom, she clutches Weir's straight-razor...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               She reaches down. Slowly, her arms cradle his head. She slides 
               down on him. Straddles him.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...Claire slips into the steaming water...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               He raises his head to her breasts. His eyes, closed. She 
               remains unnaturally still, only her hips rocking back and 
               forth.

               Weir's mouth opens, GASPS as he enters her...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...and the razor bites her skin...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               She caresses his face. Lifts his face to hers. Her mouth is 
               slack. Her hair hangs in front of her eyes.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...Claire floats dead in the red water, eyes open, hair 
               billowing around her head like a halo...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Weir gazes up at her, transfixed. He takes her hand and raises 
               it to his face. She caresses his cheek. And reaches for his 
               eyes...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               A MUFFLED SCREAM rips through the Second Containment Seal. 
               It begins as a human sound and ends as something else, an 
               alien CRY of rage.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               The CRY echoes down the Main Corridor.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               DJ packs up blood samples. He raises his head at the sound 
               of the CRY.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Starck GASPS as the CRY resounds through the bridge.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller turns in the direction of the CRY. He begins to move 
               down the Corridor, towards the source.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

               Cooper examines the weld on the baffle plate. It's solid.

                                     COOPER
                         Solid as a rock.
                              (into his radio)
                         Hey, Smith...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK

                                     COOPER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm 
                         coming in.

                                     SMITH
                         Roger that.

               Smith carries another load of supplies. Movement out of the 
               corner of his eye...

               He turns in time to see Weir disappear around a corner inside 
               the Event Horizon.

                                     SMITH
                         Dr. Weir! Hey, get your ass back on 
                         board! Dr. Weir!

               No response.

               Smith keys the radio.

                                     SMITH
                         Skipper, come in...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller jogs down the Main Corridor. An INTERCOM gets his 
               attention:

                                     SMITH (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Skipper...

                                     MILLER
                              (into intercom)
                         What is it, Smith?

                                     SMITH (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         I just saw Weir, I think he was 
                         messing around on the Clark.

               Something SPARKS and SIZZLES in the dim light, catching 
               Miller's eye. He looks up...

               One of the EXPLOSIVE CHARGES has been removed from the its 
               mounting in the Corridor.

                                     MILLER
                         Smith, get out of there...

                                     SMITH (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Come again, Skipper?

                                     MILLER
                         One of the explosives is missing 
                         from the corridor. I think Weir may 
                         have put it on the Clark.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK

               Smith's eyes open wide.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Get off the Clark now and wait for 
                         me at the airlock.

                                     SMITH
                         No, no, we just got her back 
                         together...

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Get out of there now!

               But Smith has already left the airlock...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

               ...entering the Quarters, tearing through storage lockers.

                                     SMITH
                         Where is it, where is it...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

                                     MILLER
                         Smith? Smith! Fuck!

               Miller races down the corridor towards the airlock, towards 
               his ship...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

               A BEEPING sound catches Smith's attention. He follows the 
               sound to a storage compartment. Rifles through it.

                                     SMITH
                         I gotcha... I gotcha...

               The BEEPS are coming closer and closer together.

               Smith grabs a duffel.

                                     SMITH
                         I gotcha.

               Opens it. He sees the EXPLOSIVE CHARGE from the Event Horizon 
               even as the BEEPS become a steady TONE. He closes his eyes 
               and SIGHS...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLOSION

               WHITE LIGHT. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

               Miller enters the docking bay even as a HUGE BLAST knocks 
               him back.

                                     MILLER
                         NOOO!

               Safety doors close, sealing off the airlock and preventing 
               loss of pressure.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

               The SILENT EXPLOSION tears the Lewis and Clark into two 
               pieces, spiralling away from each other and from the Event 
               Horizon. Metal shards, like confetti, fill the space between 
               them.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION

               Cooper clings to the forward section, watching the Event 
               Horizon recede as he tumbles into space. His FRENZIED 
               BREATHING is the only sound.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

               Miller gets to his feet. Stares out the window upon the 
               wreckage of his ship, spiralling away. He hits the intercom 
               with his forearm.

                                     MILLER
                         DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper 
                         are dead.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

                                     DJ
                         What happened?

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Weir. He used one of the explosives 
                         from the Corridor.

               The door opens behind DJ. The lights go out. DJ turns...

               Face to face with Weir...

               Blood crusts Weir's cheekbones, his mouth. He has no eyes. 
               Only clotted, empty sockets.

               DJ opens his mouth to SCREAM. Weir grabs DJ by the throat, 
               cutting him off.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

                                     MILLER
                         DJ, you read me?

               DJ does not answer. The CRASH of glass and steel resonates 
               over the intercom.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Too dark to see... glimpses of violent motion in the stainless 
               steel cabinets... the sounds of STRUGGLE continue...

               ...then something WET... and the struggle stops.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         DJ? DJ, come in...

               Finally, Weir emerges from the gloom. He searches among the 
               surgical instruments until his blood caked hands find a 
               needle... and thread...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

               Miller, at the intercom. He tries another channel.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Peters body lies before the Core. The intercom CRACKLES.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Peters, are you there?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 1 - (TATTERED UMBILICUS)

                                     MILLER
                              (growing panic)
                         Starck, do you read me? Starck...?

               But it is Weir who answers. His voice sounds thick, choked 
               with dirt.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         I told you... She won't let you 
                         leave...

                                     MILLER
                         Son of a bitch!

               Miller yanks open a storage locker full of zero-G tool. Lifts 
               a nailgun. Chambers a round.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION

               Cooper watches the Event Horizon fall farther and farther 
               away.

               He checks his oxygen gauge. One tank full, one tank at half.

               Cooper twists his backpack around, giving him access to the 
               oxygen tanks. He seals off his primary hose and disconnects 
               the full tank. His gauge immediately goes to "Yellow - 
               Reserve."

               Cooper points the full tank away from the Event Horizon and 
               OPENS IT...

               The blast of pressurized air pushes him towards the ship, 
               leaving the wreckage of the Lewis and Clark behind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               ...and finds DJ, suspended above the table, neatly dissected. 
               His organs have been laid out carefully before him on the 
               steel table.

                                     MILLER
                         Oh my God.

               DJ raises his head.

                                     DJ
                              (whisper)

                         Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do 
                         I...

                                     DJ

                         Oh God...

               Miller raises the nailgun with trembling hands. FIRES.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

               Miller approaches the door to the Bridge. It is open...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Miller stands in the doorway. A figure sits at the helm. 
               Miller aims the nailgun.

                                     MILLER
                         Weir.

               The figure doesn't move. Miller slowly circles around the 
               helm...

               It's Starck. Bound with wire in a sadomasochistic pose, 
               unconscious.

                                     MILLER
                         Hold on... Get you outta these...

               Miller kneels in front of her, puts down the nailgun, loosens 
               the cords. She BREATHES in ragged gasps, opens his eyes...

               Then stops. She stares over Miller's shoulder like a deer 
               caught in the headlights.

               Miller looks behind him...

               WEIR STANDS THERE, STARING WITH EYES SEWN SHUT.

               Miller reaches for the gun...

               Weir hits him, sending Miller across the bridge into a 
               bulkhead. Weir picks up the nailgun, examines it.

               Miller slowly gets to his feet.

                                     MILLER
                         Your eyes...

                                     WEIR
                         I don't need them anymore. Where 
                         we're going, we won't need eyes to 
                         see.

                                     MILLER
                         What are you talking about?

                                     WEIR
                         Do you know what a singularity is, 
                         Miller? Does your mind truly fathom 
                         what a black hole is?
                              (beat)
                         It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal 
                         NOTHING. And if God is Everything, 
                         then I have seen the Devil.
                              (a dead man's grin)
                         It's a liberating experience.

               With his free hand, Weir reaches for the navigation console. 
               Flips a series of switches with gore caked fingers.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE (ENLARGED CONSOLE)

               The display lights up.

                                     COMPUTER
                         Gravity drive primed. Do you wish to 
                         engage?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

                                     MILLER
                         What are you doing?

               Weir grins as he flips the final switch.

                                     COMPUTER
                         Gravity drive engaged. Activation in 
                         T-minus ten minutes.

               Miller lunges for the nailgun. Weir raises the nailgun to 
               point at Miller's face. Miller slowly backs away.

                                     MILLER
                         If you miss me, you'll blow out the 
                         hull. You'll die too.

                                     WEIR
                         What makes you think I'll miss?

               Miller sees something out of the corner of his eye...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Cooper. Outside, braced in the viewport bracket.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Weir spins and FIRES at Cooper. The nail lodges in the thick 
               quartz glass. A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, 
               the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.

               Weir takes a step towards the window, raises the gun to fire 
               again.

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Miller dives for the door. Before Weir can fire,

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW (HANGING SECTION)

               the window EXPLODES outward.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               The ship HOWLS as air rushes out, ripping Weir off his feet. 
               Weir catches himself in the broken window, trying to pull 
               himself back in...

               A monitor tears free, SMASHES into him. HE IS SUCKED OUT.

               Miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut. 
               He is safe...

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                         Don't leave me!

               Miller turns. Starck clings to a console, barely able to 
               resist the winds that try to suck her into the void.

                                     STARCK
                              (gasping for air)
                         Please... help, help me...

               Miller hesitates, looking from Starck back into the safety 
               of the ship. The door continues to shut. In seconds, he will 
               be safe. And she will be dead.

               Miller YELLS and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it 
               in the door to keep it open. He keeps one hand on the door, 
               reaches the other hand to Starck.

                                     MILLER
                         Give me your hand! Your hand!

               She does. Frost forms on their bodies as the air cools. Their 
               veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses. He YELLS 
               with exertion...

               ...drags her to the door... through the door...

               ...as the compressor tears free, sucked into space...

               ...and the door SNAPS shut, missing them by a fraction.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

               Starck and Miller collapse against the door. A moment passes 
               between them. Just happy to be breathing...

               ...and then the AIRLOCK KLAXON goes off.

                                     MILLER
                         The forward airlock.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Starck and Miller race towards the Forward Airlock Bay.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FORWARD AIRLOCK BAY NO. 4

               They enter, see a humanoid shape moving in the strobing light 
               of the airlock.

                                     STARCK
                         Weir can't be alive.

                                     MILLER
                         Whatever was on that bridge wasn't 
                         Weir.

               Miller looks around for a weapon. Pulls a zero-G bolt cutter 
               from the wall. Wields it like a bat.

                                     MILLER
                         Stay behind me.

               The inner airlock door releases with a HISS. Swings open...

               Cooper tumbles through, clawing at his helmet.

                                     STARCK
                         Cooper!

               Starck rushes to him, takes his helmet off.

               He SUCKS air in, COUGHS it out.

                                     COOPER
                         Let me breathe, let me breathe...

                                     STARCK
                         You're okay now, it's over...

                                     MILLER
                              (sees something)
                         It's not over. It's just starting.

               Starck follows Miller's gaze to a workstations's flashing 
               display: GRAVITY DRIVE ENGAGED. ACTIVATION 00:06:43:01...

                                     MILLER
                         Weir activated the drive. He's sending 
                         us to the Other Place.

                                     STARCK
                         We've got to shut it down, we've got 
                         to...

                                     COOPER
                         How? The Bridge is gone.

                                     STARCK
                         There must be a way! What about 
                         Engineering?

                                     COOPER
                         Can you shut it down?

                                     STARCK
                         I don't know the process, Dr. Weir 
                         was the expert...

                                     COOPER
                         I don't want to go where the last 
                         crew went. I'd rather be dead.

                                     MILLER
                         BLOW THE FUCKER UP.

                                     STARCK
                         Blow it up?

                                     MILLER
                         We blow the Corridor. Use the 
                         foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it 
                         from the rest of the ship. We stay 
                         put...

                                     COOPER
                         ...and the gravity drive goes where 
                         no man has gone before.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

                                     MILLER
                         You prep the gravity couches. I'm 
                         going to manually arm those 
                         explosives.

                                     COOPER
                         Will it work?

                                     MILLER
                         It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.

               Cooper nods, heads for the gravity couch bay. Starck follows 
               Miller to the steel pressure door.

                                     STARCK
                         I'll do it --

                                     MILLER
                         No. I'll be right back.

               Miller opens the door.

                                     MILLER
                         Close it behind me. Just in case.

               Beat. Starck stares at Miller as if memorizing his face.

                                     STARCK
                         Don't be long.

               Miller smiles wanly. The door slides shut with a dull THUNK.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller runs down the corridor. Stops at a bulkhead coupling. 
               Kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge, 
               switch it to MANUAL detonation.

               Miller runs to the next coupling. Repeats the process...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               Starck and Cooper check the gravity couches. One by one, 
               they slide open...

                                     COOPER
                         I'm gonna activate the emergency 
                         beacon.

                                     STARCK
                         Hurry.

               Cooper exits down a ladder. Starck turns to the console, 
               activates three gravity couches. Behind her, two begin to 
               fill with blue gel...

               ...and one begins to fill with blood... the hint of dark 
               shapes moving within...

               Starck doesn't see it, concentrates on the console.

               THUMP. THUMP. Starck turns. Sees the bloody tank. Sees 
               something moving inside it.

               She slowly crosses to the tank. Peers at it...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY (TANK)

               THUMP. A FACE PRESSES AGAINST THE GLASS, STARING BACK AT 
               HER. WEIR. Bone and muscle are exposed where the skin hasn't 
               finished forming.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               Starck SCREAMS and backs away.

                                     STARCK
                         Cooper...!

               The glass BURSTS in an EXPLOSION OF BLOOD...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR BELOW GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               A corridor beneath the Gravity Couch Bay. Cooper searches 
               through circuit panels until he finds the EMERGENCY BEACON 
               breaker. He runs a by-pass, activating it manually. The lights 
               begins to STROBE...

               DRIP. DRIP. A bloodstain spreads over his shoulder. He follows 
               the drip to the ceiling...

                                     COOPER
                         Starck?

               No response. He slowly moves to peer up the ladder...

               ...as Starck CRASHES down, bloody but alive.

                                     COOPER
                         What...?

                                     STARCK
                         Run!

               She shoves him away...

               Weir appears at the top of the ladder, crawling down headfirst 
               like a spider...

               Starck gets to her feet, staggers away...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST 
               CONTAINTMENT

               Miller kneels, removing the cover from the last explosive. 
               Flips a switch.

               A small cover pops open. Miller reaches in, removes a RADIO 
               DETONATOR.

               He arms the explosives. Watches the red lights on the 
               explosives wink on in the darkness.

               He reaches for an intercom.

                                     MILLER
                         We're armed. This fucker's ready to

                         you, who was in the tank?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               A figure seems to coalesce from the shadows behind Miller.

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         You have to get back here now, he's 
                         out there now, if he finds you...

               The figure moves forward into the light... Arcane runes etch 
               Weir's face; his eyes, now restored, blaze with unholy zeal.

                         He's dead...

               Miller glances over his shoulder. His jaw drops in surprise 
               as he sees...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Weir grinning at him... then SMASHES the intercom with his

               Miller backs away.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Weir stands between Miller and safety.

                                     MILLER
                         You're dead, I saw you die.

                                     WEIR
                         Weir is dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Then who the fuck are you?

                                     WEIR
                         Your fear. Do you remember the 
                         Goliath, Miller?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               FLAMES SPREAD OVER WEIR'S BODY, TRANSFORMING HIM INTO THE 
               BURNING MAN.

                                     BURNING MAN
                         Do you remember me?

                                     MILLER
                         Corrick...

                                     BURNING MAN
                         You left me behind.

                                     MILLER
                         That's not true...

                                     BURNING MAN
                         I begged you. I begged you to save 
                         me and you did nothing. You stood 
                         there and watched me burn...

                                     MILLER
                         SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

               The Burning Man YELLS and raises his arm in accusation...

               ...and FIRE RACES OUT FROM BEHIND HIM, flowing over the walls, 
               the ceiling, the floor, racing for Miller like a rising 
               tide...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST 
               CONTAINMENT

               Miller runs. Dead ahead, the First Containment...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               Miller runs fast. The fire is faster, flooding in behind 
               him.

               Miller dashes for the Second Seal as IT BEGINS TO CLOSE. The 
               fire gains on him, surrounding him.

               Miller dives through the Second Seal...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               ...barely makes it...

               ...SLAMS into the engineering console. Miller looks back at 
               the Second Seal. It's still open by a fraction when the fire 
               hits it...

               ...SENDING A LANCE OF FLAME stabbing out towards Miller. He 
               rolls aside as the fire hits the console. The console 
               EXPLODES.

               The Second Seal shuts tight, cutting the fire off. The paint 
               on the Second Seal begins to bubble and scorch... and then 
               cools as the fire subsides.

               Miller gets to his feet. Almost allows himself to relax. 
               Then he sees his shadow before him, dancing in the growing 
               red light. He turns...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               The Second Containment is a holocaust. Fire swarms over the 
               walls. Burning jelly drips from Control Spikes. The Core 
               itself is a blazing orb; the gyroscope that holds it glows 
               red-hot.

               Miller stares at the blazing Core.

                                     BURNING MAN (O.S.)
                         Don't leave me!

               Miller turns. The Burning Man stands RIGHT BESIDE HIM.

               He SMASHES Miller with a backhand that ignites Miller's 
               clothes and sends him flying. The detonator falls from 
               Miller's grasp, lost beneath two feet of coolant. Miller 
               comes up CHOKING and SPLUTTERING.

               The Burning Man stalks towards Miller. The coolant STEAMS 
               and SIZZLES at his feet.

               Miller stares at the Burning Man as he approaches. Slowly 
               rises to his feet.

                                     MILLER
                         You're not Edmund Corrick.

               The Burning Man's flames wane, revealing Weir's misshapen 
               form.

               Miller throws a wicked right. Weir catches Miller's fist. 
               SQUEEZES until blood wells up between his fingers. Then slings 
               Miller against a cooling tank with BONE CRACKING force. Miller 
               collapses into the slime, barely able to raise his head to 
               breathe.

               Weir slowly approaches.

                                     MILLER
                         What are you?

                                     WEIR
                         You know.

                                     MILLER
                         You want me to believe you're the 
                         Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!

                                     WEIR
                         I'm not the Devil.

                                     MILLER
                         Then what, what are you? Tell me...

                                     WEIR
                         Better if I just show you.

               Weir's hands reach down and he grabs Miller by the skull. 
               Miller GASPS as he sees...

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               Faster than the eye can see. More than mind can accept...

               MILLER writhes in Weir's grip. His hands flail out to the 
               sides. One hand brushes a long steel cannister sunk in the 
               muck. A CO2 scrubber...

               THE VISIONS CONTINUE:

                                     MILLER
                         NO!

               His hand closes on the scrubber and he swings it across Weir's 
               head. Weir reels back, stunned.

               Miller gets to his feet.

                                     MILLER
                         You can't have them!

               He hits Weir again. HARD. Blood gushes from Weir's skull, 
               filling the runes on his face.

               Weir staggers. Miller attacks. Again and again and again...

               This time Weir is ready. He catches the scrubber and tears 
               it from Miller's grasp. SMASHES Miller to the floor with a 
               single blow. Miller GROANS.

                                     WEIR
                         I'm not the Devil. I'm much, much 
                         older. I watched the Beginning and I 
                         will see the End. I am the dark behind 
                         the stars. I am the dark inside you 
                         all.

               Miller gets to all fours, trying to get up.

                                     MILLER
                         ...not the Devil...

               Weir kicks Miller savagely. Miller slides through the coolant, 
               comes to rest beneath a walkway. He attempts to rise, 
               collapses back into the sludge.

               Weir slowly stalks towards him.

                                     WEIR
                         There is no Devil. There is no God. 
                         There is only... NOTHING.

                                     MILLER
                         You're lying...!

                                     WEIR
                         I'm not asking you to believe me. 
                         You'll see for yourself... and so 
                         will your crew. You're all coming 
                         with me.

                                     MILLER
                         Starck... Cooper...

               Weir's grotesque face is inches from his. He reaches down 
               and pulls Miller from the dripping ooze...

                                     WEIR
                         They are mine. And so are you...

               ...as Miller clears the surface, he holds something in his 
               fist.

               Miller stares dead-on into Weir's hellish face...

               ...and raises his right hand. HE'S HOLDING THE DETONATOR.

                                     MILLER
                              (a grim smile of 
                              triumph)
                         You can't have them. Go to hell.

                                     WEIR
                         NOOO!

               MILLER DEPRESSES THE DETONATOR.

               A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as 
               the gateway opens... A BLACK HOLE...

               The black hole begins to shrink, imploding. As it collapses, 
               it sucks Neptune's blue clouds with it, creating a TITANIC 
               WHIRLPOOL with the black hole at its center...

               The SHRIEKING winds carry the foredecks back towards the

               The foredecks teeter on the edge of oblivion...

               The black hole collapses utterly, vanishing to a point. An

               The foredecks ride the wave away from the implosion and out 
               of Neptune's atmosphere to safety...
