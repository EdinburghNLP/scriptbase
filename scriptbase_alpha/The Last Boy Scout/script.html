</b>Bang bang bang
Down you go
It's just a job I do
                             Genesis
                             Just a Job to Do


You wanna be a detective? Here's what you
do: Take a trusted friend, and imagine the
worst thing, the most despicable thing, the
thing it would never even cross their minds
to do. Then assume they've already done it
twice.
                             Joseph R. Hallenbeck
                             Private Investigator



When you consider that a career in pro foot-
ball means maybe ten years, after which you
got no legs left, and during which you're a
painkiller drug addict, a million a year
sounds about right. So when people bitch
at me about the money I made, I have a pat
response: Go fuck yourself.
                             James Alexander Dix
                             Former quarterback,
                             L.A. Stallions
<b>
</b><b>                    THE LAST BOY SCOUT
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT. DARK BEDROOM
</b>The only light, that of a flickering TV screen.
A big MAN lies, shirtless, on the bed.
Watching a sports program. We hear:
<b>                         SPORTS FIGURE (V.O.)
</b>                  (on TV)
           Eliminating the draft? Worst
           thing ever happened to pro
           football. Already you got Eric
           Dickerson, no team's good enough
           for him... You got Dion Sanders,
           this guy, Bosworth, bunch of
           peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him
           play for 25 bucks a game. And he
           woulda played for free, you get
           me? He loved the game. Nowadays?
           Forget about it.
The TELEPHONE SHRILLS in the stillness.
The Man On the Bed answers it. Speaks haltingly.
<b>                           MAN ON BED
</b>           Hello...?
<b>                           MALE (V.O.)
</b>           Hello, Billy.    Do you know who
           this is?
Silence.

<b>                         MALE (V.O.)
</b>           Kid from Ohio is looking real
           good, Billie...
The Man's hand unclenches. A container of pills spills
over the blanket. He stammers:
<b>                         MAN ON BED
</b>           I'm... I'm gonna... try real
           hard...
<b>                         MALE (V.O.)
</b>           No, Billy. What you're gonna do
           ... is rush for 150 yards against
           Chicago.
<b>                         MAN ON BED
</b>           That's... too much. I can't...
<b>                                              (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                    2.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                       MALE (V.O.)
</b>         You can. And you  will. This is a
         business, Billy.  You don't make
         one fifty, you're history, the kid
         steps in. No more  job... and no
         more pills, Billy.
<b>                       MAN ON BED
</b>         Please... Just give me time...
<b>                       MALE (V.O.)
</b>         One hundred and fifty yards.
         Goodbye.
The PHONE CLICKS off. NFL running back Billy Cole stares
straight ahead, mouth working spastically.
<b>                                          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>AERIAL SHOT - SNOWSTORM
</b>OVER Chicago, Illinois, as the CAMERA SPIRALS DOWN TOWARD
a teeming football stadium. We hear crowd noise and
marching band music, deafeningly loud, as we SUPERIMPOSE
the legend:
<b>         SOLDIER FIELD, CHICAGO   NOVEMBER 14
</b>
<b>INT. ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH
</b>The BROADCAST TEAM huddles inside the quilted jackets,
squinting through the snow. Speaking into headset mikes.
<b>                       ANNOUNCER
</b>         Good afternoon and welcome to
         Soldier Field, Chicago, site of
         today's confrontation between the
         L.A. Stallions and the Chicago
         Bears. This is Vern Lindquist
         with Terry Bradshaw, and, yes, my
         friends, it is that cold.

<b>INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>Billy Cole sits, alone, in front of his locker.
Eyes glazed. Face bathed in sweat.
He takes a bottle of pills from the locker. Pops three.
Hisses a stream of air through his teeth as we --
<b>                                          CUT TO:
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                      3.
</b><b>EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (FOURTH QUARTER)
</b>A deafening CRUNCH as a defensive back hammers a wide
receiver, nearly decapitates him. The ball rolls free.
The back recovers it.
<b>                       ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>         ... Big Ray Walton puts a
         devastating hit on Bricmont, so
         Chicago turns over the ball with a
         minute and forty seconds left.

<b>EXT. SIDELINES - SAME TIME
</b>The injured player goes by on a stretcher, moaning.
Cheerleaders jump and frolic.


<b>BILLY COLE
</b>gets up off the bench. The rest of the offensive unit
sprints onto the field. Cole walks. Straight ahead,
eyes front. Like a robot. His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the
soundtrack.
<b>                       COLOR MAN (V.O.)
</b>         And so L.A. has a chance to ice
         the game, no pun intended... And
         you gotta be thinking, give the
         ball to Billy Cole. He has had an
         outstanding day, racking up 138
         yards against a tough defense.

<b>DOWN ON FIELD
</b>The huddle breaks.
The L.A. team trudges through the snow to the line of
scrimmage.
Cole adopts a three-point stance.
Everything happens in hyper-real SLOW MOTION:
The snow falls. The receivers breeze past, in motion to
begin their patterns. Moving like gazelles.
Cole's fingers paw the cold earth. Gouging it.
He is like a spring. Coiled and ready.
The ball is snapped.
Turf and snow. Erupting.
A firecracker series of POPS as linemen collide.
Legs churning.
<b>                                             (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                       4.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>The ball floats through the snowy air. Pitch-out to
Cole.
He takes it on the run. Tucks it under his arm.
Behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled.
Cole turns the corner. Picks up a blocker.
Feet pounding. Arms pumping.
Up ahead, the free safety barrels toward him.    Low and
hard.
Cole does not blink. He reaches beneath his jersey.
Pulls out a GUN.
Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safety's head.

The bullets go straight through. On the back of his
helmet.
A mixture of blood and fiberglass.
Cole keeps going, jogging for the end zone.
Around him, sound. Fury. Impact. Confusion.
Another defensive back. Straight ahead.
Reacts with almost comical terror. Dives to one side.
Cole FIRES. Blows out the guy's knee. Ends a career.
Keeps going.
We are now in full-scale panic.
The players are fleeing the field. Shouts. Pandemonium.
A few brave men gather around the fallen players.

<b>POLICE
</b>are on the field now. Running full out. They've got
riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the
snow.
Cole crosses the goal line.   Touchdown.
Drops the ball.
Turns, facing the cops.   His eyes are insane.
The crowd is screaming. People are running back and
forth like extras in the Keystone Cops.
The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and
wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost.
The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing
like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice.
Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him.    He
smiles and says:

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                       COLE
</b>         I'm going to Disneyland...
Puts the GUN to his helmet.   FIRES.

</b>
<b>EXT. L.A. STREET - IN SHADOW OF FREEWAY - MORNING
</b>We SUPERIMPOSE the legend:
<b>       WEST LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA    DECEMBER 20
</b>Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the ships at
sea. Welcome to another lackluster morning in Southern
California. Palm trees limp. Windless silence. 80
degrees at 8:00 AM.
CAMERA CRANES DOWN PAST a huge, rotting billboard. On
the billboard, a girl in tight jeans. Grabbing her own
butt. A surprised look on her face. Yes, honey, that's
your butt.
MOVE IN ON a tiny, weather-beaten bungalow. In the
shadow of the 405 Freeway. A shingle hangs from a
wrought iron post: JOSEPH R. HALLENBECK, CONFIDENTIAL
<b>INVESTIGATIONS.
</b>On the lawn, a late-model Plymouth.
The sprinkers come to life. Fling water across the car.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Inside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo.
Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams
V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music.
Picture the  tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch
self-hating  loser you can.
Now give him  a two-year-old suit from C &amp; R Clothing.
Such is the  aforementioned HALLENBECK.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>THREE neighborhood KIDS have gathered around the car.
Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk.
One tosses a baseball from hand to hand. One picks his
nose.
<b>                                           (CONTINUED)

</b><b>                       KID #1

<b>                       KID #2
</b>         Shit, we should do something to
         him.
Kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs.   It looks like his
entire fist is up there. Pause, then:
<b>                       KID #3
</b>         I know where there's a dead
         squirrel.


<b>ANOTHER ANGLE - BUNDLE OF PAPER TOWELS - SOME MINUTES
</b><b>LATER
</b>with a tail sticking out.
The youngest Kid holds it aloft reverently.
Looks in the open car window at Hallenbeck.
Still snoozing.   Dead to the world.
<b>                        KID #1
</b>         Do it.
They heave the squirrel into the car and run away.
A pause. Another pause.    The sprinkler goes round.
Nothing happens.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Hallenbeck snores. The mashed squirrel perches on his
chest. A shadow falls across him as --

<b>KIDS
</b>return, scratching their heads.   Staring in at him.
<b>                        KID #2
</b>         Goddamn.   Dude's trashed.
<b>                       KID #3
</b>         Take his bottle.
Kid #1 smiles nervously.   Reaches in with infinite
patience.
Trembling hand inches closer and closer --
And closes on the bottle as, without warning --

</b><b>                                                       7.
</b><b>HALLENBECK
</b>sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38
revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Hey, motherfucker.
The Kid, of course, shrieks.
And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes.
He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid.
Swears under his breath. Watches    the boys flee in
terror. Notices a dead squirrel    in his lap. Scowls.
Heaves it out the window. Pumps    a Camel into his mouth.
Lights it. Rescues the bottle of    Seagrams.

Thus begins his morning.
He opens the car door. The sprinkler douses him.
He gets out. Stands on the lawn.
One of the Kids, the toughest one, is standing on the
sidewalk.
<b>                       KID #3
</b>         I'm not scared.
Hallenbeck scowls.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         You're on my property, kid.
<b>                       KID #3
</b>         Sidewalk belongs to the
         government.
Hallenbeck stares at him.   Smiles weakly.

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Excuse me.
He leans over and vomits on the lawn.
One hand gripping the car fender.
The sprinkler goes round and round.

<b>EXT. MALIBU BEACH FRONT - MORNING
</b>A redwood beach house, mellow in the morning sun.
There was a party here last night.
Banners. Balloons and streamers. Tawdry in the light of
day.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        8.
</b><b>INT. BEACH HOUSE - SAME TIME
</b>A plush bedroom.   Sun streams in the window.
A YOUNG MAN sits, straddling a backwards chair.     Bare-
foot, bare-chested. Blond hair, perfect tan.
He is nursing a beer.   Smoking and staring at --

<b>BED
</b>where a tawny golden girl lies, serene and innocent.
Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast
exposed. No tan line.
The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the
sleeping girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old,
former National League heartthrob.
He shakes his head and mutters:
<b>                       JIMMY (YOUNG MAN)
</b>         Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so
         damn ugly.
He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass
vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it
up a nostril.
For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror.
<b>                                           FLASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>FLASHBACK - FOOTBALL FIELD
</b>Seventy thousand people screaming.
Jimmy in the middle. Younger Jimmy.    Fresher Jimmy.
It's a night game at the Coliseum.   He's the quarterback.
The snap. Jimmy fakes the draw. Rolls right.      Around
him, all is impact. Sound and fury.
He targets a receiver and unleashes a rocket.   Sixty-
yard toss, hits the guy between the numbers.

<b>JIMMY'S FACE
</b>Covered with dirt and mud. Blood, too.
Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he's
alive. He makes a difference.
<b>
</b><b>                                                      9.
</b><b>BACK TO PRESENT
</b>Alone in the bathroom... leaning on the counter.    Head
down. A voice calls softly from the bedroom:
<b>                       SLEEPY VOICE (O.S.)
</b>         Jimmy, are you still here...?
Pause, then:
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>         I don't know.
He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard
stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes.
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>         Yeah.    I guess I am.
He sniffs, clearing his nose.

<b>INT. WEST L.A. BUNGALOW - MORNING
</b>Hallenbeck opens the door and shambles in.
Dark. Depressing. Sprawl of furniture. Stack after
stack of sports magazines. Drop all your belongings out
of a plane. They will land like this.
He flicks on the light. Crosses to the couch and flops
down. Plucks a bottle of aspirin from an end table.
Next to the bottle, we see --

<b>TWO FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS
</b>side by side. In one, younger Hallenbeck is kissing
younger bride. Smiling.
In the other, the President of the United States presents
Hallenbeck with a medal. They are both smiling beneath
the Presidential Seal.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>Hallenbeck scowls and chews three aspirin.    Swallows.
The PHONE RINGS. He groans. Chain-lights another smoke,
stubs out his old one. Chins the receiver and says:

Hallenbeck catches his reflection in the mirror over
the TV. His face is ashen grey. Hollow eye sockets.
Blotchy skin.

<b>EXT. BUNGALOW - MORNING
</b>Hallenbeck emerges into the blinding glare. His tie is
crooked. His cuffs are too short. He looks like a
grouchy bear.
He looks up at the girl on the billboard.

</b>         'Morning, gorgeous.
Gorgeous does not respond:   Coy.   Very coy.
Hallenbeck slides behind the wheel of his Plymouth.     KEYS
the IGNITION. Phil Woods' SAXOPHONE fills the air.      He
looks at himself in the mirror.

<b>INT. MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
Jimmy Dix leaves the bedroom. Pads barefoot down a hall
littered with beer cans, food wrappers. A sleeping guy.
Stops at a door, peeks in: all-night poker game in
progress. Four bleary-eyed men. Unshaven. Stack of
wrinkled money on a card table.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         'Morning, boys.
They all grunt. One of them, name of HENRY, looks up at
him. Holds out a half-smoked doobie:

Everyone plays cards.    No one looks at him.   He frowns.
Leaves.


<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
</b>Jimmy is seated in the devastated living room. Putting
on shoes. He hears a COMMOTION outside: A woman scream-
ing. Water splashing. He frowns, puzzled. Gets up.
Pads out onto a redwood deck.

<b>EXT. REDWOOD DECK - SAME
</b>A six-foot behemoth is seated in a jacuzzi at the far end
of the deck. He is dunking a terrified female head under
the water and laughing.
Jimmy clears his throat.

<b>                       JIMMY

beneath the surface again.

<b>                       JIMMY

</b>         Ray, she's gonna drown.
<b>                       RAY

Jimmy's eyes are smoldering. He steps to the right.
Casually scoops up a football lying on the deck.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Last chance, Ray.
<b>                        RAY

Jimmy turns, as if to walk away.
Instead, he spins back and launches the football.
It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it
smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the
ball.
The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose.
The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking.
Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the
water.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Get out of here. Go.
She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair.
The guy is bleeding. Delirious.
Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Best arm in the National League,
         you son of a bitch. Remember that.
He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious.
The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside.

<b>EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>Jimmy gets into the car. Takes out his vial.
Spoons some powder, sucks it up.
A voice in the background: "Hey, someone shit on my car!"


<b>EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</b>Joe Hallenbeck slides his Plymouth to the curb in front
of a cozy stucco dwelling. Gets out, crosses the lawn.
A fat NEIGHBOR is watering shrubs next door. He waves.

a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Hey, Furry Tom.
He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night

load the gun.

A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns:

         a goddamn raccoon. She comes in
         late at night, I think, 'Christ,

         twice.

He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet.
Walks back out into the bedroom.

Frowns.
Straightens and says, very conversationally:

Sarah stops dead.   Spins and stares at him.

         See, first I noticed how tense you
         were, but I let that pass. Then
         I noticed there was steam in the

A silence hangs between them.    Sarah just stares.   Shakes
her head.

An awkward pause.   Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says:

Everything freezes. She looks at him.    He looks at her.
Understanding occurs.

Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet.
None other than MIKE MILLER, Joe's early morning phone call.

           You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts.
He pulls the trigger.
The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room.
Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself.
The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head.
On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the
one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead
center.
Blows it to pieces.
Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor.
Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless
eyes.
<b>                         HALLENBECK

</b>Miller's car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is parked at the curb.
Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard.
Holsters his gun.
A neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail.
Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

         Gut.
Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back
foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's
gut.
Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch.
Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         If I see you again, I'll kill

</b>Hallenbeck says nothing. Miller turns and stumbles to
his car. Hallenbeck's face betrays nothing. A dead mask.
He walks back toward the hedge.
The neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth.
Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird.
Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. Throws it.
The DOG BARKS and bounds after it.
Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition.
The CAR BLOWS to pieces.
An ERUPTION OF FLAME.
Flying glass and metal. The car becomes airborne.
Engulfed in fire. Does a lazy spin. Comes down.
The shockwave catches Hallenbeck.   Slams him ass over
teacups.
Windows blow in up and down the street.
Smoke and fire roll to the sky.
The DOG cowers, HOWLING in fear.
Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire.
Hallenbeck rolls to his feet. Covered with twigs and
leaves. Clothing scorched. Stares. Eyes glazed.

<b>NAKED, GYRATING BODY
</b>Female, for the record.   Signaling us that we are now:

<b>INT. "BOTTOMLESS PIT" CLUB - NIGHT
</b>Rowdy strip club in   West Hollywood. Just like the      name
suggests; if it's a   virus, you're sitting on it.      After
three drinks, every   girl on stage looks like your     high
school sweetheart.    Was your sweetheart fat? Did      she
have excessive body   hair?
FUNK MUSIC, played LOUD. The Monday crowd stomps and
claps. Onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm
usually reserved for standing in line at the DMV.
Jimmy Dix sits at the bar, hooting and whistling. Behind
the bar, a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks. His
name is HARP.
Off to one side, a twenty-five-year-old BEANPOLE speaks
into a microphone:
<b>                       EMCEE (BEANPOLE)

Harp raises his own glass.

She stops at a table against the wall. Puts down a
Seagrams V.O. in a rocks glass.
Seated at the table is a broad-shouldered man in a bad

head. Mr. Joe Hallenbeck, no less.

Hallenbeck.

Only Hallenbeck's eyes move. He looks up, regards Jimmy
coolly. They size each other up. Hallenbeck sighs.

Jimmy throws a short jab at Hallenbeck's chin.

<b>INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
</b>Joe Hallenbeck is pounding an already-dented cigarette
machine. No dice. It has eaten his money. He shakes
his head, muttering.
Looks at his watch. Looks at the dressing room door.
Shakes his head again. Walks to the end of the corridor.
Goes through the fire door. Out into:

<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Starry, moonlit night.   A chill breeze.   Joe draws a
breath.
In front of him, on the wall of the club, is a poster:
BAYNARD FOR SENATE, it reads. Above the logo, a picture
of a benevolent-looking gray-haired man.
Hallenbeck regards it balefully.

ground:
A half-smoked cigarette butt.
Just sitting there.

Starts to walk away. Stops.

</b>He bends to pick up the butt.
A steel sap whistles over his head, missing by inches.
Hallenbeck spins, startled. Reflexively lashes out with
a flattened palm. Misses, chops the air.
Two more men, behind him. Nowhere to go.
A sap pops him behind the left ear. A sickening thud.
The world spins out of focus. He goes down.
Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks.
Rolls over, staring up.
Vision muddy, indistinct.

<b>HALLENBECK'S POV
</b>
Three silhouettes hover over him, backlit by streetlamps.
Their voices are fuzzy.

The men disperse. One of them drags Joe to his feet.
A stocky, crag-faced man. He jams a silenced pistol
in Joe's kidney and points him toward a vacant lot
nearby.
<b>                         HITMAN #2
</b>           Start walking. I'm right behind
           you.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>The two other Hitmen return to their gray, late-model
sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the
nightclub.
Waiting.

</b><b>EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
</b>A rusty chain-link fence separates the lot from the boule-
vard. Choked with weeds. Broken glass. A rusted-out car.
A towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to
drink Scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell.
Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot.
The crag-faced man follows behind him.
<b>                       CRAG-FACE (HITMAN #2)
</b>         Wrong place at the wrong time,
         buddy, that's all it is. Just
         want you to know it's nothing
         personal.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         That's what you think. Last night
         I fucked your wife.
The gunman cracks up.   Hallenbeck grins drunkenly.
<b>                       CRAG-FACE
</b>         Oh, you did, huh? How'd you know
         it was my wife?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         She said her husband was a
         greaseball with bad breath.
The guy cracks up again.
<b>                       CRAG-FACE
</b>         You're pretty cool for a guy gonna
         take a bullet.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         After fucking your wife, I'll take
         two.
The hitman wheezes laughter.   Joe just grins.
<b>                       CRAG-FACE
</b>         You're a funny guy. It's a shame
         to take you off. Here, kneel down.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Are you kidding? We barely know
         each other.
The hitman is now giggling, shaking his head.
<b>                       CRAG-FACE
</b>         This is wild. I never shot no
         funny guy before.

<b>                       HALLENBECK

         Enough is enough.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

</b>         How fat is she?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         She's so fat I had to roll her in
         flour and look for the wet spot.
         You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap
         her thigh and ride the wave in.
                (the hitman loses it)
         Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except
         when you poke her in the stomach,
         she farts. I got a buddy he's an
         archaeologist, organized an
         expedition to her chin. They got
         lost in her nasal hair. But
         seriously, her eyes are like the
         streets of Paris: crossed.
         They're so crossed when she cries
         the tears run down her back.
         She's got back-tearia.

<b>                       CRAG-FACE
</b>                (can't stop laughing)
         Oh, that's awful. Buddy, you're a
         fucking rio --
From a kneeling position, Hallenbeck flings a handful of
gravel at the man's eyes.
The man cries out. Stumbles backward.
And Hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring. Not drunk at
all. He takes  the broken bottle he's been clutching and
cuts the guy's throat like a knife through butter.
The hitman stands with a shocked look on his face.
Blood bubbling.
FIRES the GUN once, into the ground. Drops it from nerve-
less fingers. Stares at Hallenbeck, aghast.

</b><b>                          CRAG-FACE

Hallenbeck meets his gaze.    A savage, feral gleam in his
eye.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         And then some.
The guy pitches over dead.
Hallenbeck kneels beside him.
Retrieves his .38, holsters it.       Slips the hitman's pistol
into his waistband.

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th.
He takes off running.

<b>EXT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
</b>Cory and Jimmy emerge from the club into the parking lot.
She scans the area, shaking her head.
<b>                       CORY
</b>         I can't believe it. The bastard
         split on me.
                (sighs)
         I'm staying at a motel for a couple
         days. Will you follow me?
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>         Sure.

He heads for his car.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>The Hitmen wait in the darkened sedan.
Watching Jimmy and Cory.
The driver keys the ignition. Starts the car.
In his lap is an automatic rifle.

<b>EXT. BOULEVARD - NIGHT
</b>Joe Hallenbeck is running full out.
Headlong down the sidewalk.       Gasping for breath.
<b>                          HALLENBECK

</b>He slams into a man. Knocks him flat. Groceries fly.
Joe doesn't care. He stumbles. Keeps going.

<b>EXT. NIGHTTIME STREET - SAME TIME
</b>Jimmy Dix is behind the wheel of a silver Jag.
Cory is driving a spanking new Ford Fiero.
Jimmy follows behind Cory, watchdogging. Humming with
JOE COCKER on the RADIO.
Cory comes to a red light.    Pauses.   Turns right onto a
sidestreet.
Jimmy slows, pausing at the intersection.


<b>GRAY SEDAN
</b>passes Jimmy. Accelerating. ENGINE REVVING.
Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car.
It's enough:
Everyone inside is armed to the teeth.
The SEDAN ROARS around the corner, cutting in front of
Jimmy.
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>            Oh God. This is a hit this is a
            fucking hit!!

<b>GRAY SEDAN
</b>comes up behind Cory. Comes up fast.
Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile:


<b>JIMMY
</b>frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch
-- And stalls out.
He roars with anger.
Flings open the door.
Leaps out and runs forward, screaming:
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>            Cory, get out of there!!
Too late.    Cory is already out of her car, yelling:
<b>                          CORY
</b>            Hey, can't you fucking drive??

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>Her eyes go wide with shock.
The Hitmen burst from their car.    OPEN UP on full auto.
Cory is cut down. Blown backward over the hood of her
Ford. Flung to the street.
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>         Oh Gooood!!
And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn --
And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy.
He takes a running start.
Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap.
BULLETS DICE the metal behind him.

He lands, hard.   Sucks the ground.    Huddled behind his
car, as:

<b>TWO HITMEN
</b>move toward him, triggering THREE SHOT BURSTS.
The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without
warning --

<b>JOE HALLENBECK
</b>charges into the intersection.     Screaming bloody murder.
He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING.
One Hitman dies immediately:
Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire.
Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD.

The second Hitman turns and OPENS UP on Hallenbeck.
Too late. Joe rolls behind a mailbox.
BULLETS chase him, blowing apart the metal box.
The Hitman swears. Turns, running for the sedan.
He knows when a getaway is in order.
Just one problem.     He forgot about Jimmy Dix.
A SCREECH of TIRES.
As Jimmy's Jag slews around the corner, laying rubber.
Rockets toward the Hitman, pins him in its headlights --
The Hitman screams as Jimmy plows through him --
And CRUNCHES into the gray sedan.

</b>Shatters the Hitman between the two cars...
And holy Christ, the guy's still alive.
Pinned like a butterfly, legs broken...
He raises his rifle, screaming.
Jimmy dives flat on the front seat.    The WINDSHIELD ERUPTS.
The Hitman.   Still pinned.   Still screaming.
He FIRES SHOT AFTER SHOT into Jimmy's car.
Hallenbeck walks up behind him.
Puts a BULLET in his head. He stops screaming.


<b>JIMMY
</b>is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken
glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window.
<b>                        HALLENBECK
</b>         Hey.
                (as Jimmy looks up)
         Back up.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car backs up.
Steam pouring from the crumpled hood.
The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street.
Like a sack of flour.

Hallenbeck limps toward him, wheezing.
He stops as:

<b>MOTEL MANAGER
</b>stands outside a door marked OFFICE.
Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck.
Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         It's all over, compadre.
<b>                       MANAGER

         Sidewalk belongs to the government.
He turns and looks at Jimmy. The kid is in pain.
Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body. Eyes glazed.
Hallenbeck says nothing. He crosses to the shattered
Hitman. Kneels  down, fishes through the guy's coat
pockets. Comes  up with a bloody pack of cigarettes.
Extracts one.  Lights it.
SIRENS fill the air.
And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his
coat -- Takes out the vial of coke. Ditches it.
Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight.
No one sees him do it.

<b>POLICE CRUISERS
</b>come SQUEALING up, flashers turning.
Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless --
And Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon.

<b>INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</b>SERGEANT BENJAMIN BESSALO sits behind his desk, scanning
a stack of typed pages. A tired-looking cop named McCASKEY
lounges in the doorway. A Christmas tree in the corner
sheds needles.

Through the glass window, we can see Hallenbeck and Jimmy
seated outside in the squad room proper. Bessalo stops
reading. Sniffs the air. Frowns:
<b>                       BESSALO
</b>         Something stinks in here.

<b>INT. SQUAD ROOM - SAME TIME

Outside the office Hallenbeck and Jimmy are perched side
by side on a wooden bench. Jimmy is crumpling pieces of
paper and tossing them at a wastebasket. He throws with
unerring accuracy. Beside him Hallenbeck frowns, deep in
thought. Finally, Jimmy speaks:

         out and threw the case in my lap.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         He handed it to you... without
         telling you how dangerous it was?
Hallenbeck stares straight ahead.    Sighs and says:

</b>         He was fucking my wife, Jimmy.
                (beat)
         I die. He gets my wife.

Jimmy just looks at him.
At that moment, McCaskey pokes his head out of Bessalo's
office.
                       McCASKEY
         Okay, you guys are cleared to go.
         Pick up belongings at the property
         desk.

<b>INT. PROPERTY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>Hallenbeck is collecting his firearm from the property
clerk. Jimmy lounges against the wall. Winks at a
hooker as she goes by in the hall, followed by a patrol
cop.
Jimmy eyes his rumpled trousers.    Ripped shirt.
<b>                      JIMMY
</b>         Shit. This shirt cost me eighty
         bucks.

         straight.
<b>                       JIMMY

They start down the hallway, side by side.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         You know something, Joe, for a
         private eye, you sure don't go in

A passing PATROLMAN stops.   Eyes Jimmy thoughtfully.
Frowns:

</b>         You look real familiar.     Do I know

Jimmy grins, shrugs.   Obviously flattered.
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>         You might.    Some people recognize
         me.

As the two cross the muster room toward the front doors,
they pass the hooker we saw earlier. She is talking to
her pimp.
There is a heated exchange.     The pimp slaps her.   Hard.
Suddenly, Jimmy lunges forward.     Balling his fists.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         That son of a bitch!
He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck
grabs him, spins him bodily. Propels him out the front
doors.
Away from trouble.

Broken furniture, shredded clothing. Everywhere.
It looks like a combat zone.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         I think someone disturbed some
         stuff, Joe.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Well, shit. Looks like somebody
         beat us to it.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Beat us to what?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Whatever evidence Cory was
         holding.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Assuming there was any.     Stay here
         a minute.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Where you going?
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Bathroom. You wanna come with me?
         Doctor said I shouldn't lift
         anything heavy.
<b>                        HALLENBECK
</b>         I'll pass.
Hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage.

</b><b>INT. CLUTTERED BATHROOM
</b>Jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him.
He scans the floor, covered with clothes, bottles, etc.
Picks up a carelessly discarded can of Right Guard
deodorant.
Turns it upside down, and unscrews the bottom.
Inside, the can is hollow and empty. The perfect hiding
place.
Jimmy heaves a sigh of relief. Removes a little plastic
Baggie filled with white powder. Stashes it in his
shorts.
Starts to replace the lid. Stops. Frowns.
Reaches into the can a second time --
And pulls out a yellow envelope.
He looks at it, perplexed.
Puts it in his pocket. Replaces the lid. Tosses the can
on the floor. Flushes the toilet. Leaves.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>Hallenbeck, meanwhile, is prowling the living room,
looking at photographs on the walls.
The girl in the photos seems young, beautiful, and naive.
One shot depicts Cory and a friend in cheerleader outfits.
On it is scrawled, GOOD LUCK IN HOLLYWOOD BABY! LOVE,
<b>JANIS
</b>Hallenbeck gazes around the devastated cottage.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Looks like you made it, baby.
Jimmy emerges from the bathroom.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Find anything?
<b>                       HALLENBECK

</b>         What?
<b>                        JIMMY
</b>         Later.   Let's get out of here.

<b>EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>The two men emerge from the house. Joe heads for his
car. Jimmy peels off toward a battered GMC Pacer parked
at the curb.

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Where the hell are you going?
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         As long as we're here, I might as
         well take Cory's car.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         You got the keys?
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>         Yeah.    I'll follow you.
Hallenbeck starts to turn away.      Jimmy gets in the car.
Hallenbeck stops. Frowns.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Cory has two cars?
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Yeah. This one's just sitting
         here until she can sell it.
The color drains from Hallenbeck's features.
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>         Jimmy, no!!
He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the
driver's seat before he can key the ignition.
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>         Ouch -- !     What's your problem?

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE

</b>Swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires, glinting
in the moonlight.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         They used a car bomb on Mike, it
         figures they'd try it on her, too.
                (stands)
         Except they wired the wrong car.
Jimmy pales noticeably.
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>         Oh.   Shit.    Oh. Jeez.
Hallenbeck claps him on the back.

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Easy, kid. No harm, no foul.     We
         caught it in time.
He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling.
Cheerfully unaffected.
Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard.
Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other
way.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         What are you doing?
Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Gotta disconnect the fucker.
<b>                       JIMMY

He isolates one wire.    Turns and offers the cutters to
Jimmy.

Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath
the wheel well. Plucks at the wire tentatively. Cuts.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Oh, shit not that one!
Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass.
Hallenbeck is chuckling softly. Shakes his head as he
walks around to release the hood.
<b>                       JIMMY

Hallenbeck tosses the car keys to Jimmy.

          You're right. Let's leave it

Jimmy opens the trunk. As he does, however, a voice
rings out suddenly from the darkness.
<b>                        VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Hold it right there, gentlemen.
They stop.   Slowly they turn.

<b>TWO MEN

One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy.
The other carries a silenced Beretta.

</b>Working quickly, Hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside
of the truck lid. Slams it shut. Turns, facing the new
arrivals.
The MEN wear tailored suits with matching ties.
One is tall and lean. The other is a bruiser, short and
stout. They both have the seasoned look of professional
mob hitters.
The Taller Man speaks, gun held rock steady.
<b>                       TALL MAN
</b>         Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late

</b>Jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles.
Steps up and delivers a looping right to Hallenbeck's

Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his gun.
<b>                       TALL MAN
</b>         Perhaps we can dispense with the
         fun and games now, yes?
Jimmy rushes forward, snarling. The Beretta swivels.
Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut.

         You like that word?

Another fist to the head.   Hallenbeck grunts.   Spits more
blood.

Jake steps forward, drawing a .38 silenced pistol.
He is going to shoot open the lock.

<b>ANGLE ON HALLENBECK
</b>This is what he's been waiting for. He tenses, looking
to one side: next to him is a sloping hillside, angling
down and away. He grips Jimmy's wrist, signalling to get
ready.
Jake raises the PISTOL.    Take aim at the lock and FIRES.
The SHOT is SILENCED.    What follows is not.
Because the bullet blows through the trunk --
And hits three sticks of live dynamite.

<b>SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
Hallenbeck is already moving, pitching to one side,
throwing himself and Jimmy down the hillside.
The night lights up like a SUNBURST.
A tower of fire...
Climbs up and outward from the car.
The TRUNK LID is BLOWN fifty feet in the air.
The tires are pulped.
GLASS SPRAYS for fifty yards in every direction.
And, most importantly:    both hitmen are engulfed in
flame.

</b>SOUND. Fury.
Flames, rolling skyward.
TINKLE of raining GLASS.
Bits of falling metal.
All in all, a helluva blast, and meanwhile:

<b>JIMMY AND JOE
</b>continue to careen down the hillside.
Bouncing like rag puppets. Out of control.
Lurch to stop at the bottom.
Covered head to toe with dirt.      Bruised.   Bloody.
Alive.
They lie side by side, sucking air --
Until they both hear an odd noise:
The sound of CRUMPLING METAL.
The sound is GETTING LOUDER.
They both crane their necks in time to see --
The flaming car, tumbling end over end
Coming down the hill.
Heading straight for them.
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>            Jesus fucking Christ!

They both dive for cover, out of the way.
Barely make it.
The CAR plows past them in a shower of dirt.
CRUMPLING. Heaving. Spitting fire.
Finally SLAMS to a halt against a palm tree.
Burns.
The night is filled with SHOUTS and CURSES.
The sound of DOORS OPENING. The crackle of flames.

</b>         If you thought there was dynamite

Hallenbeck reaches into the envelope and extracts a

Both are older, distinguished-looking.
Joe suddenly looks very pale.

         It's fucking vomit, okay? This is
         bad.
Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette.
Stares straight ahead through the windshield.   Begins to
talk:
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         When I was thirty, I was on the

         way home from a late session. I'm
         on the highway just outside of
         Georgetown when I see something
         up ahead.

<b>MEMORY FLASH
</b>Another time. Another night.
A younger-looking Hallenbeck.
Rugged features. Clipped military haircut.
He is driving.
Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist.
Up ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog:


<b>WRECKED CAR
</b>is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass.
He SCREECHES to a stop.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>In a dream-like SLOW MOTION, he approaches the overturned
car.
There are two dead bodies inside.
A woman. A little boy.
In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with
suction cups to the remaining glass. The furry cat is
splattered with blood.

         Both cars were totaled. The woman
         and the boy were dead. The driver
         of the other car wasn't.

<b>STAGGERING DRUNK
</b>is weaving toward Hallenbeck.
Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes.
He wears an $800 suit. Tan Cordovan loafers.   Silk tie.
<b>                       DRUNK
</b>         Fuckin' bitch... She got in front

</b>         Do you know who I am...? I'm
         Louis Baynard, my father is
         Calvin D. Baynard, man. Call my
         father, he'll take care of it.
The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck.
Clutching at Joe's lapels. Wheezing liquor fumes.
He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joe's hand.
<b>                       DRUNK
</b>         You'll tell 'em what happened,
         right...? Bitch swerved in front

<b>                       HALLENBECK (V.O.)
</b>         I could smell bourbon on him, big
         time. He was  standing there, not
         a scratch on him. I went a little
         nuts. I hit  him.
In SLOW MOTION, Hallenbeck backhands the rich drunk,
with a head-snapping impact that bursts lips. Breaks
teeth.
We see the Drunk's head slowly strike the asphalt.
A sickening concussion.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         The blow was non-lethal. But when
         he fell, his head hit the pavement
         funny. Put him in a coma.

           dad fixed everything with the cops.
           The accident report disappeared. A
           week later the police found half a
           kilo of crack cocaine planted in

         behind.
<b>                       DARIAN
</b>         You'd probably like it.
Hallenbeck takes her by the arm and drags her out of the
chair. Toward her room.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

That stops him.   He looks at her, stricken.

         When?

</b>         Uncle Jay? Ohh, Christ, I'm a
         fuck-up, but Uncle Jay, now
         there's a real stand-up guy.
         Shit, the bastard cheats on his
         tax form, I'm surprised he hasn't
         done time! Why don't you ask your

She goes into her room and shuts the door.
Hallenbeck rubs his eyes. Leans against the wall,
exhausted.

Hallenbeck   crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of
Seagrams.    Swigs.  Hands it to Jimmy. As Jimmy drinks,
he notices   a photo on the wall: Hallenbeck shaking
hands with   George Bush.

bottle.

He raises the bottle.

He drinks.   Hallenbeck frowns, watching him.

         her pregnancy. Shooting up. There
         were complications. She died.
         Alex lived for seventeen minutes
         in the incubator. Fell asleep.
         Died before he woke up.
                (takes a drink)
         He was born... He had time for
         one dream... and then he died.

He exits.    Hallenbeck watches him go.     Says nothing.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Jimmy enters and shuts the door. Turns on the shower.
Makes no move to undress.
Instead, he reaches inside the waistband on his pants.
Removes a vial of coke. Dips a spoon.
The door opens.
Hallenbeck is standing there with a handful of fresh
towels. He stops. Staring at Jimmy. They freeze in
tableau.
Then Hallenbeck crosses the floor with two quick strides
and slugs Jimmy with all his might. Decks him.
The kid goes over backward into the shower, head striking
the porcelain. He swerves. Claws his way out, drenched.

He exits. Shuts the door behind him.
Darian goes into her room, fuming. Shuts the door.

Joe is alone.    He turns.   Sees his reflection in the hall
mirror.

<b>INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAWN
</b>The first light of day streams through the window.
Hallenbeck pushes Furry Tom to one side.
Sits on the bed.
Regards his sleeping wife with hooded, lifeless eyes.
She is peaceful. Serene. He reaches out to touch her.
Stops. Withdraws his hand.
Crushes out the cigarette. Stands. Leaves.

<b>INT. DARIAN'S ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
Hallenbeck enters. Crosses to Darian's bed.
She is asleep. She looks vulnerable. Helpless.
He leans over and kisses her.
She stirs in her sleep.
Murmurs:
<b>                         DARIAN
</b>         Billy...
Hallenbeck recoils.
Stares at her.
The DOORBELL RINGS.
Startling him. He mutters under his breath.
Stalks out of the room.

</b>Down the hall to the front door.   Flings it open, pissed
off.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Goddammit, Jimmy, I told you -- !
It isn't Jimmy.
Standing on the porch is a tall, thin man with blond
hair. The man removes a TASER GUN from his overcoat.
<b>                       MILO
</b>         Good morning, Joseph.
He FIRES point-blank.
The electrode hits Hallenbeck in the chest.
A CRACKLE of electric current. Hallenbeck jerks
spastically.
The world spirals away.
He plunges down into darkness.

<b>INT. CLUTTERED APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>Jimmy looks bad.
Sprawled out on a tangle of dirty sheets.
Jeans. Bare feet.
Smoking.
Staring at a football card.
A duplicate of the one Darian showed him.
He swings his legs off the bed.
Stands, crushes out his cigarette.
Moves into the bathroom.
The Baggie of coke is on the counter.
He stares at it with bloodshot eyes.
Swallows hard.
Acts before he can think.
Grabs the Baggie. Tosses it in the toilet.
Flushes. Watches as it goes down the drain.

<b>EXT. CASA LOMA APARTMENTS - MORNING
</b>Another Goddamned day.
A chill drizzle. The palm trees look forlorn.

</b>Jimmy buys a paper. Trudges along Ventura Boulevard.
Huddled against the chill.

<b>SLEEK, BLACK SEDAN

Two men get out:
One is Pablo, who last we saw wielding a chainsaw in
Milo's snuff film; the other is an ugly piece of hired
muscle who we'll call CHET.
The two men flank Jimmy and walk alongside him.
He looks up, startled.

And, with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms.
Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence.

</b>         Please, guys, don't do this...

They toss Jimmy over the fence.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances.
In this case, however --
A fifty-foot drop...

Awaits him beyond the fence.
A huge, looming pit dug into the earth.
Foundation for a new parking garage.
Jimmy plummets like a stone.
Under normal circumstances, he'd be dead.
But since it rained last night, he's got three feet of
water to land in.
He hits with a splash.   Disappears beneath the water.
Surfaces, screaming in pain.
Thrashes in the muddy water, and only when he looks down
does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his
skin at a crazy angle.

<b>LONG SHOT - JIMMY
</b>Alone in the pit.
Huddled in a pool of muddy water.
His screams of pain ECHO in the chill, morning air.

</b>Ben Bessalo's office, to be precise.
Bessalo reclines grumpily at his desk. Scanning reports.

Bessalo looks up, intrigued.    McCaskey continues:

         Now, according to Hallenbeck, Mike

Rocks his head to one side.

<b>INT. ELEGANT BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Thick carpet. Polished, wood furniture.     Window walls.
Outside, the sea is angry and grey.


<b>PABLO AND CHET

Both hitmen wear holstered sidearms.
Chet leans over and slaps Hallenbeck again.
The big detective begins to stir.
His eyelids flutter.

</b>         I think he's awake.
<b>                         PABLO
</b>         Make sure.
Chet's hand flashes out for a third slap --
And from nowhere, Joe Hallenbeck's hand magically
appears.
Intercepts the blow.
Clamps onto Chet's hand and wrenches it.
A cry of pain.
Chet stumbles backward, cradling the wrist.
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>         I'm awake.
His eyelids creak open.

<b>                          CHET
</b>         Sure, buddy.     I got a cigarette.
He reaches into his shirt pocket. Extracts a Marlboro.
Hands it to Hallenbeck. Takes out a lighter.
Hallenbeck places the cigarette between his lips.
Leans forward for a light --
And Chet slugs him in the face.
The cigarette goes flying.
Hallenbeck's head snaps back.
Blood creeps from his lower lip.

<b>                       CHET

Leans forward and says:

A pregnant pause.
The challenge hangs in the air.
Slowly, Chet takes the lighter from his pocket.
Pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features.
Hallenbeck leans forward for a light.
Chet extends his arm --
And slugs Hallenbeck in the face again.
Rocks him.
Chet howls with laughter.
Pablo grins.
<b>                        CHET

Hallenbeck takes a deep breath.
Stands up.
Strikes with a flattened palm.
Breaks Chet's nose.
Drives it up into the brain.
Chet stands, pole-axed. Blinks once.
Pitches over dead.

And suddenly Pablo isn't laughing.
He stares at Hallenbeck, incredulous.
Stares at Chet, lying on the carpet.

smoke.

A tense moment... and then Milo does something un-

chuckling.

Marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment.
<b>                       MARCON
</b>         I'm glad you're here, Joe. We
         got a few things to discuss.

He takes a moment to gather his thoughts.
<b>                       MARCON
</b>         For starters, I'm sure you're
         aware that professional football
         is changing, and not for better.
                (lights a cigar)
         Used to be, you went to the local
         stadium come Sunday, you saw
         heroes. Guys who fought for
         their hometown. Anymore, no one
         gives a shit. Ever since Sonny
         Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe
         Namath back in '66, the sons of
         bitches just got greedier.
         Playing only for themselves.
         Giving nothing back to the game.

         Players Organization. Eliminates
         the draft, reduces all athletes
         to free agents. Reduces football,

Her hair is a tangled mess.
She hands him the piece of paper, and promptly bursts
into tears.
Buries her head in his chest, sobbing.

Awkwardly unfolds the crumpled paper and reads:

At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock.
Whistling cheerfully.

</b>            Careful, Pablo. We don't want to
            get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in

He squats next to Joe.

            die. Capisce? You determine your

He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet.
Propels him toward the boat.
As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out:
<b>                          SARAH
</b>            Joe...!

He stops.    Turns.   Looks at her.
Boys and girls, there is, within Joe Hallenbeck, a spark:
Tiny. Fizzling. Almost gone.
But now, looking at his wife, that spark unexpectedly
kindles --
And eight years melt away.
Just like that.
The old Joe Hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and
says, with deadly calm:

</b>            You're wasting my time, Joseph.
            Let's go.
Hallenbeck turns. Dirty. Tired.        Unshaven.   Bloody.
He looks at Milo... and grins:

They stare into each other's eyes.
Hallenbeck does not give an inch.
Milo hits him again.

Well, Henry is seated in a big, lived-in den watching

There is a KNOCK at the door. He gets up.
Crosses to the door. Opens it.

People with six-figure incomes.
Pretending they're important.
Mingling. Schmoozing.

A sudden commotion near the front door.
FLASHBULBS POP. People crane their necks.

Grabs a tuxedo from the closet.
Stands, dressed, in front of the mirror.
Opens a box. Removes a 9 millimeter Baretta.

Stashes it in the waistband of his pants:
In back. Concealed by the tuxedo.
Studies his own grim face in the mirror.

He points to the identical twin.

         to kill the passengers, not enough
         to sink the craft.

         And when we place your charred
         corpse amidst the wreckage, the
         police will draw the inevitable
         conclusion: a down-on-his-luck
         P.I. makes a suicide strike
         against the man who cost a

</b>         That sounds lovely, but how is my

With a flourish, Milo pulls aside a tablecloth.
Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline.

</b><b>EXT. YACHT - ON DECK - NIGHT
</b>Milo's yacht is anchored about a half mile offshore.
Island lights blink in the distance. Fog rolls in.
Milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck.
Crosses to the railing, looks down at:

<b>FISHING BOAT
</b>bobbing in the water about thirty yards away.
A FISHERMAN is waving his arms. Hailing them.
Beside him, his wife and seventeen-year-old son.
<b>                       FISHERMAN
</b>         Hey! Buddy, I got a cracked engine
         casing, I'm dead in the water!
         Can I get a tow?
Milo swears under his breath.    Calls out:
<b>                       MILO
</b>         I'm sorry, sir. This boat is
         Island Security, we're under

<b>                       MILO

<b>                       FISHERMAN
</b>         Goddammit, now I gotta call the

Milo's crewman steps up to the rail.    Speaks urgently:
<b>                       CREW MEMBER
</b>         Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast
         Guard down on top of us.
Milo ponders for maybe three seconds.    Then he calls out:
<b>                          MILO
</b>         Excuse me.     Sir?
The Fisherman turns.    His family beside him.

Pulls out an Ingram model MACHINE GUN.

Milo ceases fire.   Turns to his crewman.

He saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred.

<b>EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>Jimmy is strolling along a hedge behind the house.
Looking for a back entrance.
He hears VOICES, approaching.
Pulls up short. Ducks into the shadows.
Senator Baynard goes by, with two bodyguards.
Brisk. Businesslike.
<b>                       SENATOR

Makes a decision: heads for the boats.
Following Baynard.

Jimmy looks up:
The Senator's boat, a sleek, powerful Marlineer, is even
now pulling out of the cove.
<b>                           JIMMY
</b>         Okay.     Shit.   Okay.   Easy.   Shit.

The sound of THUNDERING ROTORS, as a refitted Bell Cobra

Banks sharply, cruises offshore.

                (points to
                 Hallenbeck)
         Gag him and stash him.
As Milo goes topside, one of the men tapes Joe's mouth.
The other opens a cramped storage compartment.
They stuff him inside.   Shut and lock the door.

<b>EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT
</b>About two miles offshore. The Senator's Marlineer cuts
through the waves, converging with Milo's yacht.
The two boats pull up alongside.    The lines are made fast.
One of Milo's crewmen greets Senator Baynard's AIDE, a
slick-looking Italian in a $1,000 overcoat.

Baynard's man hops from one boat to the other.
Boarding Milo's yacht. Meanwhile --

He bangs his fist in frustration.

<b>INT. MILO'S YACHT - CABIN - SAME TIME
</b>
The payoff is in progress.
One of Milo's crewmen carries the suitcase over to the
wall. Places it on a built-in counter. Underneath the
suitcase is a half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Off to one
side is a half-empty coffee container.
The case is opened.   Greenbacks galore.
Baynard's Aide whistles softly.
Examines the stacks of bills. Nods, satisfied.
<b>                        AIDE
</b>         Okay.   We're cool.
Just then Milo enters the cabin.   Adopts a harsh New York

</b>As Baynard's man assumes the position --
Milo hits a concealed button.
It happen in less than a second: the built-in counter
rotates into the wall, only to be replaced by an
indentical counter.
Identical half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Identical coffee
cup. And, of course, the identical suitcase.
The indignant Aide turns around, pat-down concluded.
<b>                        AIDE
</b>         Okay?   Satisfied?

Milo smiles apologetically.
<b>                       MILO
</b>         We're cool, baby.
He hands over the suitcase.

<b>BACK TOPSIDE
</b>Baynard's man emerges onto the deck, carrying the suitcase.
Steps over the rail, crossing to the Senator's boat.
Gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there.
They cast off the lines.   Freeing the two boats.
<b>INT. MILO'S YACHT - BRIDGE
</b>Milo watches, tense.
As the lines are freed, he says:

<b>INT. SENATOR'S CABIN - SAME TIME

The words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a
throbbing NOISE, growing louder... Darian looks up
puzzled.
<b>                        DARIAN

And with that --

bursts from the fog.
Directly in front of them.
Hovers like an avenging angel, TURBINES SCREAMING --

Rotor wash sprays in every direction.

Fifty years to starboard is the Senator's Marlineer.

</b>          Oh, wow.    We're fucked.
He GUNS the ENGINE.     Spins the wheel, banks to port.

the roof --
Jimmy, wrestling the wheel, and meanwhile --

<b>INT. BAYNARD'S CABIN

Full throttle, heading for shore, as --

Calls out:
<b>                        MILO

</b>          There's a little girl with him!
With that, he goes berserk.
Draws his legs back, thunders them against the compart-

like a crazed horse, as:

<b>BACK TOPSIDE
</b>Air One does a flyby, circling, awaiting instructions.

</b>Works his bound hands over his knees so they're now tied

Everybody's topside; for the moment, at least, he is

He half crawls, half lurches over to the kitchen nook.
Worms beneath the table... awkward, desperate...
Drags out the can of gasoline.
Tries to unscrew the top.   No dice.   Can't get a grip.
Finally, in frustration, he tips the can on its side.
Brings his legs up in the air --
Slams them down on the can.
Over and over until, with a metallic pop -- ! it bursts.
Floods gasoline over the carpet, meanwhile:

<b>BACK TOPSIDE
</b>Milo's yacht is plowing ahead, gaining on Jimmy's
Hatteras. The crew members take up positions on the
prow. OPEN FIRE.

<b>WITH JIMMY
</b>As he throws Darian to the deck, shields her with his

The wheelhouse is RAKED by GUNFIRE.
He grits his teeth. Reaches beneath his tux.
Yanks out the BERETTA and returns FIRE, BAM -- BAM -- !
and meanwhile:

<b>INT. YACHT CABIN
</b>Hallenbeck is opening a box of kitchen matches with his
teeth.
Dozens of matches fall scattered on the carpet.
He releases the box. Bends. Picks up a single match in

Presses his face to the wall.   Gives his neck a wrench --
Lights the match.
He drops the match on top of the GAS CAN.

</b>A WHOOSH of combustion.    It bursts into flame.

Thrusts his legs into the fire.
Strains. Pulls. Sweat runs in rivers.
Until the ropes binding his legs snap.
He lurches to his feet, lets free.
Now there's only one problem: He's on fire.
The legs of his pants are soaked with gas.
Flames race up his legs.
He plunges headlong up the stairs.


<b>ON TO DECK

into the sea, swallowed by the waves.
A CREWMAN suddenly screams:

Fire, indeed.    It's a rapidly-spreading blaze.
The pursuit is momentarily forgotten as the crew races to
put out the fire, and meanwhile:

And, sure, his left arm isn't his good arm --
But, boy, does he heave that anchor.
It soars through space, chain playing out behind it...
Hits water, thirty yards past Hallenbeck --
Who turns, sees the anchor skimming toward him over the
waves.

<b>EXT. MILO'S YACHT
</b>Milo, meanwhile, has also spotted Hallenbeck.
He growls in rage.   Hefts the Ingram machine gun, as:

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around
the passing anchor and whoosh -- !

He is catapulted forward, jerked like a rag puppet.
BULLETS CHOP the water where he just was.
He skims over the waves. Bounced. Battered.
Trailing behind Jimmy at fifty miles an hour.
Jimmy and Darian begin to haul him in.
Struggling. Straining.
The boat rushing headlong, driverless.
With a last, desperate surge of energy --
They drag Hallenbeck over the side. Into the boat.

is behind them again. The fire is out.      The chase is on.
It steadily cuts the distance.

<b>JIMMY'S BOAT
</b>Hallenbeck staggers to his feet.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Get below, Darian. And stay
         there.
He stumbles into the wheelhouse.   Dazed.   Barely
conscious.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Got any ideas?
<b>                       HALLENBECK

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on.
Into the fog they go, and, folks --
This is really scary.
Because you can't see a foot in front of your face.
They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour.
Hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield.

</b>And then a shape materializes off to port:
Milo's yacht.
Running alongside. Drawing closer.
Hallenbeck wrestles the wheel. No dice.
The yacht draws ever closer... men on deck... machine
guns...
Joe looks over... and his face tells the story:
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         We're dead.
Except, just then, a strange thing happens:
Milo's yacht veers off to the left. Away from
Hallenbeck. Jimmy stares, dumbfounded.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         What the fuck? They're peeling
         off. Why?
A pause... then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt:
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         'Cause they got sonar, that's why!
         Hard to port!

</b>         Port?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Left, Goddammit.
The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog --

The Catalina ferry looms right in front of them.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Shit fuck piss!
They almost make it.
As it is, they avoid a head-on.   Instead, they hit
broadside.
A sickening CRUNCH -- !
Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet.
A momentary glimpse of faces rushing past -- Horrified
tourists -- And then the ferry is behind them.
Jimmy gets up. Staggers to the controls.
Pushes the throttle. The boat lurches forward --
Then SPUTTERS. Fizzles.
He swears violently.

Jimmy flicks off the lights. Grabs the mike. As he
does, a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit, causing him
to pause... and then stare in shock as their boat emerges
from the fog --
And Air One hovers directly overhead.
<b>                        JIMMY
</b>         Fuck me.
The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends,
the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket.
<b>                        HALLENBECK
</b>         Get down!
They both hit the floor.    Hands over their heads --
And then the pilot makes a costly error:
He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht.
With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out
of the fog --
PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER.
Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it
to shreds.
Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix
erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. Turns night
into day.

Pause. They look up. Bewildered.

Stare in disbelief. Joe looks at Jimmy. Jimmy at Joe.
Debris rains down.

<b>EXT. CRASH SITE - MINUTES LATER
</b>Jimmy, Joe and Darian are on deck, chugging through the
wreckage. Darian clings to her father's arm, in shock.
Hallenbeck sees something in the distance.    Squints:

</b>         What's that?
Jimmy looks:    A bright object... going in circles...

Speaks over his shoulder to Jimmy.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Hand me the pole.
Jimmy hands him a long, wooden pole with a hooked end.
He fishes in the water. Snares a large, floating object.
Swings it aboard. Drops it at Jimmy's feet.
The suitcase.
<b>                         JIMMY

</b>He turns away.    Jimmy bends to open the suitcase.
Joe heads into the cockpit, Darian beside him.
Steers the boat away from the crash site. Toward the

O.S., Jimmy suddenly yells:

<b>EXT. BAYNARD'S BOAT - SAME TIME
</b>The once-mighty Marlineer runs aimless circles in the
mist. Half the cockpit is blown away, probably by a LAWS

The Hatteras pulls up alongside, and Hallenbeck steps to
the rail, carrying the Baretta.

pocked.

No need. It's a slaughterhouse.
The walls are perforated. Baynard and his men are dead.
The suitcase's evil twin lies unopened on the table.
Hallenbeck walks over to Baynard's lifeless body.
Stares into the wide-open eyes.

</b>Across the street, Hallenbeck's house is dark.       Deserted.
Truly a sight: Jimmy, in a white shirt and tuxedo pants,
nursing a broken arm; and Joe, drenched to the skin,
pants hanging in scorched tatters.
Joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand. They stop.
Crouched behind a eucalyptus tree. Joe points:

Opens the door to dump it out.

Grabs the can, throws it back in his face.

A thoroughly unnerving stare.

Then Joe does something very odd.

Pablo overcomes his shock.

         You're gong to make Pablo eat all
         his teeth, Mr. Hallenbeck.

</b>Pablo can't help it.   He bursts out laughing.
<b>                       PABLO
</b>         That's amazing, man!
Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom. Inserts his hand, makes
the furry head bob back and forth.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>                (as Furry Tom)
         Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're
         laughin' at me. That's not very
         nice.
By now, all three hoods are in hysterics.

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Are you mad, Furry Tom?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>                (as Furry Tom)
         I don't get mad. I get even.
And, with that, Furry Tom's mouth opens --
And EXPLODES, showering stuffing.
One of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half
his throat is gone...
And Furry Thomas BELCHES FIRE again, and the second goon
goes down in a spray of blood, and if you haven't guessed
already --
Joe has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas.
Pablo is a little sharper. A little quicker.
He dives forward, knocks the puppet from Joe's hand.
Joe drives upward, into Pablo's gut.
They reel across the room. Locked in combat.
Lamps topple. GLASS BREAKS.
Pablo slams Joe's head into the wall.   Leaves a dent.
Does it again, a sickening impact...
Starts to strangle Joe --
And the truth is, Joe's not thirty anymore.
He's not going to make it. The world swims away.
Then, as if through a tunnel, Joe notices something
beside him... something hanging on the wall.
Fights to focus. Breath gone.    Strength gone.
Identifies the object:

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>His Presidential Medal of Valor.
Shiny medal. Shiny ribbon. His name...
It hits him quite suddenly:
The medal has sharp edges.
With the last of his strength, he plucks it from the
wall. Drives it into Pablo's throat.
The big man stumbles backward. Eyes wide. Gurgling.
He thrashes, the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely
from his gushing neck.
Drops to the dusty carpet.    Dies.

Hallenbeck takes a deep breath. Eyes wide. Insane.
He is surrounded by corpses. He takes another deep
breath.
Picks up the sniper rifle.
Slings it over his shoulder.
Heads for the door.

<b>INT. CONRAD MARCON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>Jimmy Dix is on the floor, and Marcon is kicking him
savagely. Pointed alligator boots lashing out. Again
and again.
<b>                       MARCON
</b>         You know I don't enjoy doin' this,

Jimmy curls up in a fetal ball.    Marcon paces, shaking
his head.

<b>                       MARCON
</b>         I remember how much you hated the
         pain... You got hooked on Demerol,

         with you. Tell me who you talked
         to, and I'll give you all the

</b>He crosses to the fireplace.   Removes a poker.
<b>                       MARCON
</b>         And ain't nothin' more important
         than my ball club, 'cept maybe my

         footballs. Got one of yours, you

                (softly)
         Who'd you talk to, Jimmy?
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Nobody...
Marcon raises the poker.
Brings it down on Jimmy's broken arm.

<b>EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
</b>Hallenbeck leaves the rented Subaru by the side of the
road.
He is dressed in combat black. Government issue.
Rifle over one shoulder. Hunting knife in a hip
scabbard.
Like an angel of death, he moves into the brush.
Heading down the canyon.

<b>EXT. MARCON'S HOME - SAME TIME
</b>An armed sentry patrols the grounds.
Below him, nighttime L.A. stretches to the Pacific.
Joe Hallenbeck emerges like a wraith from the trees.
Clamps a gloved hand over the sentry's mouth.
Drives the hunting knife into his back.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>Marcon stirs the fireplace logs, stoking the blaze.
Replaces the poker. Crosses to his desk and sits.
Jimmy is on the carpet, delirious.   Out of it.
Marcon presses a button.   An armed HARDGUY appears.
<b>                       HARDGUY
</b>         Mr. Marcon?

         Take him somewhere and kill him.
<b>                         HARDGUY
</b>         Yes, sir.
The Hardguy crosses the room.      Grips Jimmy by the
shoulders.
With a soft SPIT of sound, his forehead blooms crimson.
He collapses, lifeless.
At his desk, Marcon whirls, stunned, as:


<b>JOE HALLENBECK
</b>steps through the French doors behind him.
He resembles nothing human. A demon in black.
Eyes burning. Gun held loosely. An extension of his
arm.
Marcon reaches for the button to summon help.
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>         Don't.
He jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly
crushing his larynx. Hisses:
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin'
         kill you. Where's my wife?
<b>                       MARCON
</b>         I... I don't remember, I...
Joe shoves on the gun.   The barrel chokes him.
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>         My wife.
Grabs a pen.   Shoves it in Marcon's hand.
<b>                         HALLENBECK

</b>He speaks over his shoulder:

</b>            Jimmy, you okay...?
Jimmy stirs.
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>            Hurts like hell.
Marcon finishes writing. Hallenbeck snatches up the
address. Stows it in his pocket.
<b>                          HALLENBECK
</b>            Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us
            out of here, nice and easy, got
            it?

            Can you walk, Jimmy?
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>            Yeah... I think so -- Joe, behind
            you...!
Too late.    A revolver is cocked a foot from Joe's head.
<b>                         STRANGE MAN
</b>            Drop it.
It's the same odd voice we heard earlier.
The man with the speech impediment.
<b>                          HALLENBECK
</b>            You drop it, asshole, or I kill
            Marcon.

The Strange Man chuckles.
<b>                          STRANGE MAN
</b>            Sorry, but that won't work. I
            don't care if he lives or dies,
            now drop the gun.
A pause. Once more, Joe calculates the odds.     No dice.
He places the rifle on the desk.
<b>                          STRANGE MAN
</b>            Walk over there by your friend,
            Joe.
Hallenbeck turns around... and, for once, his jaw drops.
He's looking at a man he never thought he'd see again. A
man who suffers from facial paralysis ever since his head
bounced off the Georgetown turnpike eight years ago.

</b><b>                                                        145.
</b><b>LOUIS BAYNARD
</b>Son of the late senator. The right side of his face
doesn't quite match the left. The muscles don't work.
Hallenbeck recovers his composure. As Jimmy climbs to
his feet, Joe walks over and stands next to him. Two
gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Well, Goddamn. How's the head,
         Lou?
<b>                       BAYNARD (STRANGE MAN)
</b>         Aside from permanent facial
         neuralgia, just lovely.

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Next time, Lou, just say no.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Shit. This is the drunk guy you
         slugged, look what you did to his
         face!
Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid.   He snaps at
Baynard:
<b>                       MARCON
</b>         You son of a bitch, you were gonna
         let him kill me!
<b>                       BAYNARD
</b>         Nothing more or less than you'd do
         for me, Conrad.
                (turns)
         I never thought I'd see you again,
         Joe.

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Speaking of which, what the fuck
         are you doing here?
<b>                       BAYNARD
</b>         Call it a financial partnership.
         For a price, I agreed to connect
         Mr. Marcon to the necessary
         people in Washington.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

         But imagine my delight this morning,
         Joe, when Mr. Marcon informed me
         of a golden opportunity: a chance
         to kill my father and frame you for
         the crime... What can I say,
         inherit a fortune and humiliate you
         in the bargain, who could resist?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Do I also have you to thank for
         dragging me into this mess?
<b>                       BAYNARD
</b>                (sighs)
         It was I, unfortunately, who
         bought a forty-dollar bottle of
         champagne... spoke a little too
         freely to that hooker.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         She wasn't a hooker, dickhead.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         He should know, Jimmy. With a
         face like that, he's gotta be
         paying for it.
<b>                       BAYNARD
</b>         You can die fast or slow, so watch

Jimmy chimes in:
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         We'd rather watch yours.   It's
         goofy-lookin'.

Jimmy sweats. He's scared shitless underneath.
Hallenbeck clears his throat:

</b>         You know of course, Connie, that

The gunmen lower their weapons.

<b>                       MARCON

         are you talking about?
<b>                       HALLENBECK

         way in.
<b>                       MARCON

Marcon stares at him.   Blinks.

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         See, Connie, every year, the mob
         rakes in two and a half billion
         from football bookmaking. If you
         succeed in making gambling legal,
         all that money goes to the

He once again looks Marcon in the eye.

<b>                       HALLENBECK

A pause. Then, without warning, Jimmy turns --
And slugs Hallenbeck with his good arm. Decks him.

</b>         Sure.   Slow and easy.
Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls
something out, concealed in his fist.
We see, but Marcon doesn't:
It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist.

<b>                       JIMMY

         See, it's one of those new plastic

And, with that, he hurls it into the fire.
So fast that nobody can see just what he threw.

The two hardguys rush to the fireplace.

One of them grabs a pair of tongs --
and the SHREDDER EXPLODES.
Sprays the two hardguys.    Cuts them to ribbons.
Then, several things happen at once:
Everybody goes for a gun.
Hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol --
As Marcon draws his GUN and FIRES, missing --
Joe RETURNS FIRE, BAM-BAM -- !
Catches Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile --

He rolls aside just in time. It THUNDERS past.
Staggers to his feet, frantic --

says:

She FIRES again, and Milo reels backward.
Leaves a bloody smudge on the billboard.
She DROPS the HAMMER again and again.     Empties the gun.
Milo jerks and twitches.     Racked by gunfire.
Paints a bloody stripe across the billboard, making

Clutches himself.     Looks over at Hallenbeck.

Bullet-scarred.
Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe.
They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says:

Out strolling in the poverty that exists in the shadow of

Quite suddenly, without warning --
A football drops out of the sky.
Hits and bounces, very high --
Comes down. Settles. Rocks, back and forth.
The kids look up, puzzled.      Searching the sky.

The ball sits there.    Only slightly scorched.
Tentatively, almost like he's afraid of being caught,
one of the boys bends down... looks both ways...
Picks up the ball.    Smiles.
Then, as if by some unspoken agreement --
The other boy starts to run.
Slowly at first, then faster... faster still...
A slant pattern, heading for the mailbox...
And at 12 midnight on December 22nd, the San Pedro Street
quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass.
Their laughter is joyful.    Innocent.    Fervid.
They will grow up to be sports heroes.

Hallenbeck nods.
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>         Some of it.
<b>                                             (CONTINUED)

</b><b>                                                       163.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                         JIMMY
</b>         How much?
Hallenbeck frowns. Opens the case. Reaches in --
And plucks out two crisp $100 bills. Stuffs them in a
pocket. Jimmy stares at him.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>                (shrugs)
         My fee.
He shuts the case.    Shoves it toward Jimmy.
Jimmy leans forward, eyeing the suitcase.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Shit, Joe... I got all the money
         I need.
He shoves it back into the center.    Joe nods.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         I'm thinkin' I could use a partner.
                (beat)
         Think you could handle that for
         awhile?
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         I maybe could handle that.        For
         awhile.
He pours a drink.    Raises his glass on high:
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Alex the detective.

He drinks.

<b>INT. CANCER RESEARCH CENTER - DAY
</b>A uniformed man is emptying the PLEASE GIVE jar when he
notices a suitcase lying against the wall. Under a
poster that says THE GOAL: A CURE IN OUR LIFETIME.
He bends down. Opens the suitcase.
When the money is counted, there will be $1,999,800.
A note is taped to the inside:
<b>                     SO HURRY UP ALREADY
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                      164.
</b><b>EXT. PALM-LINED L.A. STREET - DAY
</b>Jimmy and Joe walk side by side. Away from us. Slightly
drunk. Palms wave lazily. A sweaty Santa rings a bell.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         See, Jim, the thing is, life sucks.
         But you still can't be hangin'
         around Satan Claus, you know why...?
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Why?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         'Cause someday, compadre... Satan
         Claus and Santa Claus are gonna
         have a big fight, and you know
         what...?
                (beat)
         Santa's gonna kick some royal ass.
He puts a fatherly arm around Jimmy's shoulder, grins:
<b>                        HALLENBECK
</b>         Hey.   Smile, you fuck.

<b>                                          FADE OUT.
