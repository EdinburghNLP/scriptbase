24 hours in L.A.; it's raining cats and dogs.
Two parallel and intercut stories dramatize men about to die: both are estranged from a grown child, both want to make contact, and neither child wants anything to do with dad.
Earl Partridge's son is a charismatic misogynist; Jimmy Gator's daughter is a cokehead and waif.
A mild and caring nurse intercedes for Earl, reaching the son; a prayerful and upright beat cop meets the daughter, is attracted to her, and leads her toward a new calm.
Meanwhile, guilt consumes Earl's young wife, while two whiz kids, one grown and a loser and the other young and pressured, face their situations.
The weather, too, is quirky.
