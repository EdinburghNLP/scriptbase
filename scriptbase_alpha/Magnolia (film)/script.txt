CAMERA moves through the scene as POLICEMAN and DETECTIVES
question the OLDER COUPLE.  Neighbors and lookie-loos around.

     some figuring out for the officers on
     the scene of the crime, Fay Barringer
     swore that she did not know that the gun
     was loaded.

          FAY BARRINGER
     I didn't know -- I didn't know --

          ARTHUR BARRINGER
     She always threatens me with the gun,
     but I don't keep it loaded --

          DETECTIVE
     -- and you didn't load the gun?

          ARTHUR BARRINGER
     Why would I load the gun?

INT. APARTMENT/HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA moves through as OFFICERS are talking to and getting
statements from VARIOUS NEIGHBORS...CAMERA closes in on
an EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY, speaking with a DETECTIVE.

     A young boy who lived in the building,
     sometimes a vistor and friend to Sydney
     Barringer said that he had seen,
     six days prior the loading of the shotgun --

The DETECTIVE turns his head and calls to another --

          DETECTIVE
     C'mere a minute --

                         CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK.

CAMERA moves into a bedroom area where we see a FIGURE from
the back sitting on the bed --

          NARRATOR
     It seems that the arguing and the
     fighting and all of the violence was far
     too much for Sydney Barringer and knowing
     his mother and father's tendency to fight,
     he decided to do something --

CAMERA reveals that it is Sydney Barringer who is loading
the shotgun. The YOUNG BOY is sitting nearby, watching Sydney
mumble to himself as he loads shells into the shotgun.

                         CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT/HALLWAY - PRESENT

CAMERA moves in on the YOUNG BOY, who looks INTO CAMERA.

          YOUNG BOY
     He said he wanted them to kill
     each other, that all they wanted to
     do was kill each other and he would
     help them if that's what they wanted to do --

                         CUT TO:

EXT. BUILDING/ROOFTOP - DAY - FLASHBACK

This is a WIDE ANGLE REPLAY of the whole event.  We see the whole
bui1ding...Sydney starts to jump and the film suddenly slows down...

A diagram is made to reflect the narration...this is done like NFL
coverage where the x's and o's and arrows and lines are drawn to
indicate placement and moves, etc.)

An x appears on the top of the building over Sydney.

          NARRATOR
     Sydney Barringer jumps from the ninth floor rooftop --
     His parents argue three stories below --

An o is marked to indicate their position. Image goes into MOTION
with Sydney jumping...an ARROW is drawn that displays the PATH of
his fall --

          NARRATOR
     Her accidental shotgun blast hits Sydney
     in the stomach as he passes the arguing
     sixth floor window --

Freeze Frame shows Sydney, hanging mid-air -- the glass shattering and
starting to fall to the ground -- an X marks the spot where he is hit.

          NARRATOR
     He is killed instantly but continues
     to fall -- only to find, three stories
     below -- a safety net installed
     three days prior for a set of window washers
     that would have broken his fall and saved
     his life if not for the hole in his stomach.

A squiggly line with an arrow is drawn from Sydney to the net to
indicate the path -- UNFREEZE frame and watch Sydney fall into the net

                         CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

CAMERA moves in on the PARENTS then over to some DETECTIVES and OFFICERS
who are making sense of this, they nod to each other as if to say,
"well we know what we have to do..."

          NARRATOR
     So Fay Barringer was charged with the
     murder of her son and Sydney Barringer
     noted as an accomplice in his own death...

CAMERA moves towards the little EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY as he watches
the older couple CRY and SCREAM as detectives begin to cuff them --

          NARRATOR
     ...and it is in the humble opinion of this
     narrator that this is not just "Something
     That Happened."  This cannot be "One of those
     things..." This, please, cannot be that.
     And for what I would like to say, I can't.
     This Was Not Just A Matter Of Chance.

CAMERA pushes in towards the MOTHER as she screams and screams and the
officer's fight to regain control of her -- in the scuffle, the
apartment door is shut directly in the face of the CAMERA.

CUT TO BLACK.

          NARRATOR
     Ohhhh. These strange things happen all the time.

     No you don't: But I'm gonna ask

     No one else in here?

     OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else,
     besides me and besides you in this house?

          MARCIE
     No.  I said that.

          JIM KURRING
     Are you lyin' to me?

          MARCIE
     I live alone.

          JIM KURRING
     Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one
     more time: Is Anyone Else In This House
     Right Now?

          MARCIE
     No I Said.

          JIM KURRING
     Ok. What's your name?

     Ok. Marice why don't you take
     a seat for me?

          MARCIE

          JIM KURRING
     I'm not askin', Marcie.

Marcie sits down.

          MARCIE
     I didn't do anything.

          JIM KURRING
     Maybe you didn't, but I'm here
     to find out about a disturbance.
     Some neighbors called said they
     heard screaming and a loud crash.

          MARCIE
     I don't know a loud crash.

          JIM KURRING
     And what about screaming?

          MARCIE
     I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just
     come in here and start pokin' around --

          JIM KURRING
     What's this, how did this happen?

INSERT, ECU. THE FLOOR.
An ashtray has fallen on the floor, cigarette butts all around.

          MARCIE
     An ashtray fell, I don't know, maybe
     last night, I just woke up.

          JIM KURRING
     You just woke up.  And what'd you have
     a party last night, the way this place
     looks?

          MARCIE
     I went out last night.

          JIM KURRING
     Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you
     to have a new attitude with me.  The more
     you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna
     become that you've been up to something.

          MARCIE
     It's a free country, you can
     think anything you want.

          JIM KURRING
     Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you
     start givin' me some straight
     answers: I'm gonna assume that some
     mischief has been goin' on here.

          MARCIE
     Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin'
     about, mischief?

          JIM KURRING
     Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean.
     Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been
     doin' some drugs today?

          MARCIE
     No.

          JIM KURRING
     You on any medication?

          MARCIE
     No.

          JIM KURRING
     Been drinkin' today?

          MARCIE
     It's ten o'clock in the morning --

There's a small THUMP noise OC. Jim turns his head quick and
looks and Marcie freezes.

          JIM KURRING
     --- What was that?

          MARCIE
     I didn't hear anything.

Marcie stands up.

          JIM KURRING
     No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit
     back down on that couch --

          MARCIE
     I don't have to do a god damn thing.

Kurring gets his handcuffs out and handcuffs her wrist to the
couch, she goes crazy, screaming and yelling the whole time;

          MARCIE
     WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN
     BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --

          JIM KURRING
     Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN
     and don't do this. I want you to stay --

Continue with that until he's got her cuffed to the couch.
He removes his REVOLVER from his holster and starts to move
slowly down the hall to the back bedroom --

          MARCIE
     WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT?
     WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, MOTHERFUCKER?
     MOTHER-GOD-DAMN FUCKER.  WHERE ARE YOU GOIN'?
     DON'T GO IN MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.

Kurring keeps moving slowly, gun drawn, CAMERA behind him;

          JIM KURRING
     This is the LAPD. If anyone is
     back here I want you to come out
     and I want you to show yourself
     to me with your hands in the air --

          MARCIE
     THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT
     OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.

Kurring moves into the BEDROOM now and sees that the CLOSET is
closed and probably the only place for someone to be hiding;

          JIM KURRING
     This is the LAPD, if anyone is in
     the closet I want you to come out
     and show yourself to me, slowly and
     with your hands up --

          MARCIE (OC)
     THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!

          JIM KURRING
     Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone
     is in the closet, come out now --

          MARCIE (OC)
     THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN
     CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM,
     STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.

          JIM KURRING
     -- do not do this -- my gun is drawn
     and If I Have To Open That Closet
     you will get shot -- Step Out Now.

Jim inches towards the closet, flips it open real quick and
stands back, ready for something to jump out -- nothing.

          MARCIE
     I told you there was no one in there!

Jim looks down the hall at Marcie who has physically dragged
the large couch handcuffed behind her;

          JIM KURRING
     Marcie - Do not drag that couch any further!

JIM'S POV, CAMERA DOLLIES IN SLOWLY TOWARDS THE CLOSET.
He pushes some sheets aside and burries around to reveal:

A DEAD SKINNY WHITE MAN (50s) curled up in a ball on the
floor of the closet.  He'd dead and he's been covered in dirty
laundry.  He has a gag around his mouth.

HOLD on Jim for a moment, he panics a little and swings his REVOLVER
towards Marcie:

          JIM KURRING
     What the hell is this Marcie?

          MARCIE
     THAT'S NOT MINE.

Jim swings the aim of his gun back at the dead body.

     I reach out for it -- no --

He mimes the action, gets nowhere near the pen.

          EARL
     ...no...no goddamn use.
          (beat)
     I have a son, y'know?

          PHIL
     You do?

     don't know...he's a tough one...very....
     Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?

          PHIL
     No.

          EARL
     Get a girlfriend.

          PHIL
     I'm trying.

          EARL
     And do good things with her...share
     the thing...all that bullshit is true,
     y'know...find someone and hold on all
     that...Where's Linda?

          PHIL
     She went out.  She said she went
     out to run some errands.  She'll be back.

          EARL
     She's a good girl.  She's a little
     nuts, but she's a good girl I think.
     She's a little daffy.

          PHIL
     She loves you.

          EARL
     ...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...

          PHIL
     When was the last time you talked
     to your son?

     but not so -- right there -- y'know?

          PHIL
     Yeah.

          EARL
     "yeah."  the fuck do you know?

          PHIL
     I've seen it before.

          EARL
     Other fuckin' assholes like me.

          PHIL
     There's no asshole like you.

          EARL
     ...cocksucker....

          PHIL
     How come every word you say is either
     "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"

          EARL
     Do me a personal favor --

          PHIL
     Go fuck myself?

          EARL
     You got it.

EARL gets hit with something and starts to MOAN a bit.  Sharp
pain hitting him and he touches his hand to his face....

          EARL
     ...I can't hold onto this anymore...

          PHIL
     I'll get you another pain pill.
     Another morphine pill --

          EARL
     ...gimme that fuckin' phone...

          PHIL
     Who are you gonna call?

          EARL
     I wanna see this...where is he,
     do you know?

          PHIL
     Who?

          EARL
     Jack.

          PHIL
     Is Jack your son?

Earl doesn't answer.  He's drifting a bit more now.

          PHIL
     You wanna call him on the phone?
     We can call him, I can dial the
     phone if you can remember the number --

          EARL
     -- it's not him. it's not him.
     He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...

Phil leans in closer to Earl.

          EARL
     This is so boring...so goddamn...
     and dying wish and all that, old
     man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:

          PHIL
     It's ok.

Earl hallucinates a bit, cries a little, tries to form the sentences;

          EARL
     ...find him on the...Frank. His name's
     Frank Mackey --

          PHIL
     Frank Mackey.  That's your son?

          EARL
     that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that,
     give it --

Earl tries to grab something near Phil's head that is not there.
He's hallucinating more now, falls asleep a bit, mumbling;

          EARL
     ifyougimmethat....overonthe....fuck....
     I can't hold ontothis anymore...

He gives Phil make an imaginary object and falls asleep.  BEAT.
Stay with Phil a moment as he turns his head, looking around the
house a moment, looks back to Earl.

FRANK steps into a CLOSE UP and holding a mic, says:

          FRANK
     Respect the cock and tame the cunt, boys.

REVERSE, THAT MOMENT. The crowd of fifty GUYS who are taking the
"Seduce and Destroy Seminar" that Frank is teaching today laugh and
play along;

Frank is on a slightly elevated stage.  vBehind him a huge banner for,
"Seduce and Destroy," whose logo is a scared pussycat and a large wolf
with a big buldge in his fur.  It reads: "No Pussy Has Nine Lives".

          FRANK
     And you did hear me right.  Tame it.
     Take it on, head first -- with your
     skills at work and say, "No.  You will
     not control me.  You will not take my
     soul and you will not win this game."
     'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna
     think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard
     and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect
     the cock -- you are embedding this thought:
     I'm in charge.  I'm the one who says yes,
     no, now or here.  Shit, man.  Sad but true.
     Sad But True.  And you wanna know what?
     It must be the way.
     The thing about chicks and the thing
     about this course that we're going
     through today is how universal the whole
     thing is.  I mean: I wish I could sit here
     and say that it's not -- because the reality?
     If each chick had something new, something
     really new that I'd never seen before?
     Fuckin' hell: I'd be in the money!  Because
     I'd have to create a hundred new cassettes,
     a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars
     and hundred new videos just to deal with each
     and every situation a chick could create -
     but that is just not the case.  They are universal.
     They are sheep. They are to be studied and
     watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped,
     interupted and resisted. I'd be makin' a fuckin'
     butt load if they were actually as much of
     a challenge as they want you to think they are!
     Reality: They Are All The Same.
     Each and every one of them.  And once you learn
     these methods: You're Set.  You Don't Have To Come Back.
     That's it. In solid. Boom.  Done.  Over.  Why?
     Because all women are the same.  Period.
     End of discussion.  Sorry.  It's true.  Sad But True.
     And anyone who wants to say that these methods
     we work by are "unfair?"  Yes, they are.
     Guilty as charged.  And so's the world.
     It's a harsh, hard unfair place, but it's not
     gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie --
     Period.  Sorry.  End of discussion.

     reach into your packet, you'll see I've
     been nice enough to include one, 'cause
     that's the kind of prick I am --
     You're gonna need this calendar and I know
     it sounds like a small thing, but having it
     makes all the difference in the world:
     If you meet a girl and you're
     gonna work an A-3 Interuption --
     let's say an eight day waiting period before
     the next call -- how you gonna know when those
     eight days are up?  Buy a calendar.
     Next move?  Mark the calendar.
     Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did I pay my eight
     hundred dollars for?  To hear Frank tell me
     to buy a calendar and mark it?  Just stick
     with me and stick by the calendar.  Mark it
     up -- use it to set goals -- If you wanna

     Denise?

          GUY
     That's right --

          FRANK
     -- and she hurt you didn't she?
     I know, I know.  I know how that
     can be brother, but let me tell you loud
     and clear what we will be teaching
     Denise when we put our calendars to work and
     set goals:

Frank hops back up on the stage;

          FRANK
     Little Denise, I say this:  I mark it
     up and I write it down and you've been warned:
     "By the end of May, you will know I'm not gay."
     "On the fourth of June, Denise, you're
     gonna be lickin' my spoon."
     "And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat
     Sausage."  I've SET GOALS FOR MYSELF.
     And what?  I've said "enough is enough."
     Because why?  She's not gonna be your pal.
     She's not gonna be your friend.  You think
     she's gonna be there for you the second
     you need something?  Think again - this fuckin'
     bitch Denise!
          (audience cheers)
     But: Listen up:  That is not to say that we don't
     all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna
     learn later on in Chapter 23 that having a couple
     of chick-friends laying around can come in
     real handy in setting Jealousy Traps.
     But we'll get to that.  Number One (this is page 18
     in your booklets, blue cover - go to it and
     follow along with me.)

The guys flip open their little blue booklets and follow along.

     Create a crisis -- simple and clean,
     and if done properly can be quite
     effective in getting some bush.

Frank and the Girl sit down on the couch together.

     "What could I have done different?"
     "How should I behave to get this back?"
     And if they think that way -- then they
     are asking for you to hurt them and
     That Is What You Must Do.  That is what
     you must do which is punish them many,

     as we're sitting here and there
     isn't a fucking thing -- jesus,
     how can you tell me to calm down?

          DR. LANDON
     I can help you through this the
     best I know how but there are certain
     things you are gonna have to be
     strong about and take care of, now
     we can go over them, but I need to
     know that you're listening to me, ok?

          LINDA
     I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just
     in a fucking state, I know he's
     going and it's like I don't know how
     -- just tell me practical things --
     What the fuck do I do with his body?
     What happens when he dies? That next moment:
     What? What do I do?  Then What?

          DR. LANDON
     Well that's what Hospice will take care of
     for you.  They will send a nurse, someone
     who can take care of all of that for you --

          LINDA
     He has Phil right now.

          DR. LANDON
     Phil's one of the nurses from the service?

          LINDA
     Yeah.

          DR. LANDON
     If you're happy with Phil taking care
     of him and helping you, that's fine,
     but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --

          LINDA
     -- you don't understand: it's more pain
     than before and the fucking morphine pills
     aren't working, he's -- past two days it's
     like he can't really swallow them and I don't
     know if they're going down -- I can't see inside
     his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring
     at him and I don't think the pills are going
     down and he moans and he hurts --

          DR. LANDON
     We can fix that, because I can give
     you -- are you listening?

          LINDA
     I'm listening.  I'm getting better.

          DR. LANDON
     Do you wanna sit down?

          LINDA
     I need to sit down.

          DR. LANDON
     Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it.
     He's dying. He is.  He is dying very,
     very rapidly --

She breaks a bit more.

          DR. LANDON
     Now the thing here is making that experience
     as painless and easy as possible for him,
     you understand?  Now you need to get in touch
     with Hospice care because they can take care of
     all those practical things that you're asking
     me about -- they are who you call when he dies.

He writes a number on his bussiness card, hands it over as they speak;

          DR. LANDON
     This is the number for Hospice.
     Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go,
     there is something else to consider that
     can take the pain away that he is in,
     there is a very strong and very potent solution
     of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle,
     with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in
     his mouth and drop on his tounge and
     it will certainly diminish the pain that
     he is in but you have to realize that
     once you give it to him; there really
     is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly
     cure his pain, but he will float in and
     out of consciousness, even worse than he
     is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the
     recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --

          LINDA
     -- how the fuck can I say anything
     to that -- I don't know what to say to that --

          DR. LANDON
     The job here is to make him as comfortable
     as possible -- right now -- our job is to just
     try and make it as painless as possible.
     Right?  You understand?

     She's asleep.

BEAT.

          JIMMY
     Are you her boyfriend?

          MIDDLE AGED GUY
     You're Jimmy Gator, right?

          JIMMY
     Yes.  What's your name?

          MIDDLE AGED GUY
     I'm Bob.

          JIMMY
     You're her boyfriend?

          MIDDLE AGED GUY
     No, I'm just a friend.  What are you
     doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?

          JIMMY
     I'm her father.

The Middle Aged Guy looks a bit confused.

          JIMMY
     Can I come in?

          MIDDLE AGED GUY
     Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --

Jimmy steps inside, looks around the place, sees the coke and some pot
and pills sitting out on the coffee table.

          MIDDLE AGED GUY
     Want me to wake her up?

          JIMMY
     I'II go....is it...back here?

The Middle Aged Guy points Jimmy to the back bedroom.

INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

Claudia is asleep. Jimmy enters, stands near the edge of the bed.
After a moment, Claudia's eyes open, look over and see Jimmy.

          CLAUDIA
     ...what the fuck is this...?

          JIMMY
     It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.

She sits up a bit, covers herself, looks past him and sees the
Middle Aged Guy, sitting in his underwear in the living room,
watching them.  She looks back to Jimmy;

          CLAUDIA
     What do you want? Why are you here?

          JIMMY
     I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend
     let me in, I just knocked on the door --

          CLAUDIA
     He's not my boyfriend.

Jimmy hesitates a beat, then:

          CLAUDIA
     Wanna call me a slut now, something?

          JIMMY
     No.  No.

She starts to move towards tears, nervousness;

          CLAUDIA
     What the fuck do you want?

          JIMMY
     I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.

          CLAUDIA
     Don't sit down.

          JIMMY
     ...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia.
     Maybe we can just talk to straighten
     our things out....there are so many
     things that I want to tell you --

          CLAUDIA
     I don't wanna talk to you.

          JIMMY
     Please.  It doesn't have to be now.
     Maybe we can make a date to sit down,
     I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --

          CLAUDIA
     Why are you here, why are you doing this?
     Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?

          JIMMY
     I don't want you to think that I'm that
     way to you -- I'm not gonna call you
     a slut or something --

          CLAUDIA
     Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are
     doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?

          JIMMY
     Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --

          CLAUDIA
     I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.

          JIMMY
     I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --

          CLAUDIA
     I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're
     the one who's wrong.  You're the one --

          JIMMY
     I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia.
     I'm sick.

          CLAUDIA
     Get out of here, get the fuck out of
     my house --

          JIMMY
     Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now.
     I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell
     down and I'm Not...DON'T --

          CLAUDIA
     GET THE FUCK OUT.

          JIMMY
     I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer.
     I have cancer and I'm dying, soon.
     It's metastasized in my bones and I --

          CLAUDIA
     FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.

          JIMMY
     I'm not lying to you, I'm not --

          CLAUDIA
     FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

          JIMMY
     baby, please, please --

          CLAUDIA
     I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL.
     I'm not your fuckin' baby --

She moves up in the bed, exposes a bit of her breast, tries to
cover herself --

          JIMMY
     Please put your clothes on, please --

          CLAUDIA
     YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell
     and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.

          JIMMY
     Honey.

          CLAUDIA
     GET OUT.

BEAT.  He stands a moment.

          JIMMY
     Your mother wants to hear from you --

          CLAUDIA
     GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

He walks out of the bedroom, past the MIDDLE AGED GUY, who's
sitting on the couch.

          JIMMY
     I'm sorry.

          MIDDLE AGED GUY
     It's alright.

Jimmy exits.  Claudia is shaking and crying and holding herself
in the covers of the bed.

The Middle Aged Guy snorts a line of coke, looks into her;

          CLAUDIA
     Can you get your shit and leave, please?

                         CUT TO:

INT. SOLOMON AND SOLOMON ELECTRONICS - DAY

CAMERA pushes in as Donnie Smith runs in the door, brushes his
hair back, etc.  This is a "Good Guys" type electronics place.
He rushes towards the back.

ANGLE, DOOR TO BACK ROOM.
CAMERA pushes in real quick and tilts down as Donnie reaches
to his belt and his KEY HOLDER (one of those attached to string
on the belt) He inserts the KEY.

                         CUT TO:

INT. BACK HALLWAY - SOLOMON AND SOLOMON - THAT MOMENT

Donnie enters, walks swiftly down the hall to another door.
Just before he reaches it, AVI SOLOMON (30s) appears at the
end of the hall.

          AVI
     Don.

Donnie stops short, looks.  Avi gives him the "follow me" finger.

          DON
     Hey, Avi.  I'll be right there.

Avi goes back in the room he came from.  Donnie does the
KEY and CODE thing now on this door.

                         CUT TO:

INT. DRESSING ROOM/EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

Donnie is changed into his Solomon and Solomon Electronics vest
and name tag.  He brushes himself up, sweating a bit. (Note:ON HIS BACK)

                         CUT TO:

INT. SOLOMON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Donnie sitting across the desk from SOLOMON SOLOMON (40s) owner

          DONNIE
     ...please...

          SOLOMON
     Don't Donnie. Don't do it.

Donnie swells up a bit, about to cry.

          DONNIE
     This is so fucked, Solomon.
     I don't deserve this.

          SOLOMON
     Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making
     sense, this making a lot of sense.
     You are not doing the job, the job
     I ask you to do, a job I give you.
     Over and over and over and I'm sorry.
     But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that
     much more.

          DONNIE
     Solomon: I am in the middle of so much.
     So much in my life and this is --
     If you do this, if you fire me: I Am Fucked.
     I can't really explain much, but please,
     please, I've worked here for four years,
     four years I've given you and I'm, I'm,
     I mean what?  I'm sorry I was late.
     I had a car accident.  I accidentaly
     drove into a seven-eleven. It was not
     my fault.

          AVI
     Who's fault was it, Don?

          SOLOMON
     Avi, please, shut the fuck up for
     one second. Don, how much further
     do you want me to go in showing you,
     showing you what I've done for you
     in four years and what you've done
     back?  Do you want me to do it? I can.
     The loans I've given, how much your sales
     are, how late you are, over and over, loosing
     the keys to the Covina store --

          DONNIE
     I don't have any money, Solomon.
     If you fire me --

          SOLOMON
     -- I give you money, I give you a paycheck.
     Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give.
     When I find you, when I meet you,
     what? I put you on the billboard,
     I put you in the store, my salesman,
     my fucking representation of Solomon
     and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith
     from the game show --

          DONNIE

          DONNIE
     I paid you back.

          SOLOMON
     Two years! Two years later and out of your
     paycheck, I never charge interest --

          DONNIE
     Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked
     here if you do this.  This is the worst timing.
     The worst timing I could ever imagine.
     I need to keep working.  I have so many
     debts, so many things, I have, I have,
     I have -- I have surgery -- I have my
     oral surgery coming --

          AVI
     What surery?

          DONNIE
     Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.

          SOLOMON
     What is that?

          DONNIE
     Braces.

          SOLOMON
     Braces?

          DONNIE
     Yes.

          SOLOMON
     You don't need braces.

          DONNIE
     Yes I do.

          SOLOMON
     Your teeth are fine.

          AVI
     Your teeth are straight.

          DONNIE
     I need corrective oral surgery.
     I need the braces.

          AVI
     Don, you got hit by lightning that
     time in Tahoe, you went on vacation,
     I don't think braces is a good idea --

          DONNIE
     I can't believe you're gonna do this
     to me, the situation I'm in, I don't --
     Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting
     doesn't matter for getting braces, ok?
     Now Solomon, let me just ask you once:
     Please. Please. Don't do this.

          AVI
     How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?

          DONNIE
     I don't know.

          SOLOMON
     And how much is braces?

          DONNIE
     It's...doesn't matter....

          AVI
     It's like five thousand dollars,
     I've seen it, I know --

          SOLOMON
     You're pissing me off, Don.  This is
     so unbelievable -- so fucking stupid,
     you're gonna spend five thousand dollars
     on braces you don't need --

          DONNIE
     I've been a good worker --

          SOLOMON
     Don't do this, Don.

          AVI
     No need for braces, Donnie.

          SOLOMON
     Where are you getting the money for this?

          DONNIE

          SOLOMON

          DONNIE

          SOLOMON
     GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.

BEAT.  Donnie tries to calm himself, hold back tears, stands up.
He struggles with his KEY CHAIN and finally after a bunch
of moments, hands over six or seven keys.

CU. INSERT, KEYS. placed on the desk.

INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX/NORTH HOLLYWOOD - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA hangs inside bedroom w/Detectives and Investigators and
County Coroner folks as we go through in a series of quick shots.
(Director's Note: very technical here. Snapshots, ECU's on body,
procedure, etc.) * See County Coroner videotape.

IN THE LIVING ROOM

CAMERA pushes in past DETECTIVES and OFFICERS who are exchanging
information...CAMERA moves towards Jim Kurring, standing off a bit
now, usless to the investigation as far as everyone else is concerned,
but listening carefully to what they say:

          OFFICER
     Identified as Porter Parker, aged 59.
     Better known as the dead guy in the closet.
     So says the building guy, this is her
     husband --

          DETECTIVE #2
     -- he's doesn't live here, but he comes
     around, raises shit, screaming, yelling,
     something or other --

          OFFICER
     There's a son, apparently.  And a kid.

          DETECTIVE #1
     Her son?

          OFFICER
     Her son, that's right...and the kid.
     And they were here and around and
     from late last night and through the
     morning, it's screaming and yelling --

          DETECTIVE #1
     And Where Are They?

          DETECTIVE
     -- they are not to be found.

          CORONER WOMAN
     -- she's got six hundred dollars and
     a large box of condoms next to the bed --

          OFFICER #1
     And three wedding rings.

          DETECTIVE #1
     Ok.

          CORONER WOMAN
     -- guys come in, out and around all day,
     this is the building guy talking --

          OFFICER
     The building guy says The Son and The
     Closet guy are always goin' at it --

          CORONER WOMAN
     That's right.

          DETECTIVE #1
     And what is she saying?

          OFFICER
     Not a god damn thing.

CAMERA lands CU on Jim Kurring.

ANGLE, COURTYARD AREA - THAT MOMENT
Another set of Detectives/Officers/Investigators are standing
over Marcie, who sits handcuffed.  She has her best, "I'm not
saying anything" face on.  Again, they're OC througout;

          OFFICER #2
     Why did you kill him, Marcie?

          DETECTIVE #3
     Did you kill him?

          OFFICER #2
     Did he hurt you, did he do something?

          DETECTIVE #4
     How long's he been in there?

          DETECTIVE #3
     You're hurting yourself, Marcie.

          OFFICER #3
     You have the dead body of your husband
     in the closet of your apartment, Marcie.

          OFFICER #2
     That Is Not Good.

          DETECTIVE #3
     You hit him with the ashtray,
     you strangled him --

          DETECTIVE #4
     -- tell us he fell and hit his head,
     but tell us something, Marcie.

          OFFICER #2
     Why did you kill him?

The Main Detective from previous steps into FRAME, says:

          DETECTIVE #1
     -- Marcie: Where's your son?  Marcie?
     Marcie?  Marcie tell us where your Son is now.
     Marcie tell us where your son is.

CAMERA arrives CU on Marcie.

          MARCIE
     I wanna talk to my motherfuckin' lawyer.

ANGLE, STREET OUTSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - LATER
The investigation is wrapping up now and CAMERA (STEADICAM)
moves with Jim Kurring as he heads towards his squad car,
talking into his WALKIE TALKIE. (Dir. Note: technical info re:
disturbance at adress/Jim takes call/etc.)

          WALKIE VOICE
     ...4277 Tujunga...

          JIM KURRING
     10-4.

Out of the group of neighborhood lookie-lo's comes a little black
kid who starts walking alongside Jim Kurring as they head away
from the scene -- this is DIXON, age 10.  He's very small for his age
and he carries one of those boxes filled with Candy Bars he's trying
to sell.  They walk/talk;

          DIXON
     How much you pay me for my help?

          JIM KURRING
     I think it's more complicated
     than that little man.

          DIXON
     Put me on the payroll, find out,
     find out wassup --

          JIM KURRING
     You don't just sign up to be a police
     officer -- it's about three years of
     training -- ok?

          DIXON
     I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna
     buy some candy to help underprivelaged
     youth in the --

          JIM KURRING
     Sorry, little man.

          DIXON
     You wanna take my statement, I'll
     perform for you, gotta get paid though,
     gotta get PAID.

          JIM KURRING
     Why the hell aren't you in school?

          DIXON
     No school today.  My teacher got sick.

          JIM KURRING
     They don't have substitute teachers
     where you go to school?

          DIXON
     Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?

          JIM KURRING
     That's confidential information, little man.

          DIXON
     Tell me what you know, I'll tell you
     what I know --

          JIM KURRING
     No Can Do.

          DIXON
     Leave this one to the detectives,
     they ain't gonna solve shit, I can
     help you, make you the man with a plan,
     give you the gift that I flow -- think
     fast -- you wanna know who killed that guy?

Jim Kurring stops at his Squad Car, turns to Dixon;

          JIM KURRING
     Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.

          DIXON
     No.

          JIM KURRING
     You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?

          DIXON
     I can help you solve the case,
     I can tell you who did it.

          JIM KURRING
     Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?

          DIXON
     I'm a rapper.

          JIM KURRING
     Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a
     record contract?

          DIXON
     Not yet -- "give you the clue for
     the bust if you show me some trust --"

          JIM KURRING
     Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?

          DIXON
     I ain't fuckin with you --

          JIM KURRING
     Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.

          DIXON
     C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --

          JIM KURRING
     Go. Hurry up. Let's go.

Dixon places his box of candy down and starts dancing around.
Jim Kurring stands beside his squad car.

          DIXON
     Presence - with a double ass meaning
     gifts I bestow, with my riff, and my flow
     but you don't hear me though
     think fast, catch me, yo

     butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --

          JIM KURRING
     -- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't
     need to hear that word --

          DIXON
     -- livin' to get older
     with a chip on your shoulder
     'cept you think you got a grip,
     cauze you hip gotta holster?
     Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just
     Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --

          JIM KURRING
     Alright, alright, cut it, coolio.
     That's enough with the mouth and
     the language.

          DIXON
     I'm almost done.

          JIM KURRING
     Finish it up without the lip.

          DIXON
     Check that ego - come off it -
     I'm the profit - the proffesor
     Ima teach you 'bout The Worm,
     who eventually turned to catch wreck
     with the neck of a long time oppressor
     And he's runnin from the devil, but the
     debt is always gaining
     And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth
     bringin' pain in -
     When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord
     bring the rain in.

HOLD ON KURRING.

          DIXON
     Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.

          JIM KURRING
     Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's
     real helpful Ice-T.

Kurring gets behind the wheel, Dixon hustles over;

          DIXON
     Did you listen to me?

          JIM KURRING
     I was listening --

          DIXON
     -- I told you who did it and you're not
     listening to me.

INSERT, CU. IMAGES of the book about weather.  CAMERA scans, dissolves
and moves around various images of ancient BAROMETERS, HYGROMETERS
from the 1700's.  We see 16th Century French comic strips regarding
weather as cartoon characters.  Aristotle pointing to the sky.
Scan past the words, "...our quest to understand and predict the
weather reaches back to the Stone Age..."

Rick helps him get the bags in the car.  CAMERA stays real TIGHT
following STANLEY'S FACE....he sits in the car....OC we hear Rick
getting in the driver's seat and starting the enqine...little droplets

     See you later --

Rick gives Stanley a pat on the head;

          RICK
     Go to it, handsome.

          STANLEY
     See you.

CAMERA holds with Rick, does a 180 around him, he turns his

          RICK
     It's fuckin cats and dogs out there --

CAMERA picks up with a young PRODUCTION KID who drops some coffee
off for JULIA'S MOM...follow him back out into the hallway -- CAMERA
branches off from him -- moves down another corridor and picks back
up with STANLEY and CYNTHIA as they walk and talk;

          STANLEY
     Where's the news department at this studio?

          CYNTHIA
     It's upstairs.

          STANLEY
     Have you ever been there?

          CYNTHIA
     Sure, why?

          STANLEY
     I'm wondering about the weather
     department. I'm wonderin' wether
     or not the weather people use outside
     meteorlogical services or if they
     have in-house instruments?

          CYNTHIA
     I can check on that for you, maybe
     we can take a tour --

          STANLEY
     Ok.

They pass CAMERA which picks up now with a woman MARY (40s)

     I feel afterwards, like I could walk out

     pootie I see that has even one second to stop --

     All it takes is one second?

          FRANK
     Just one look, one hesitation,

     tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped
     at these seminars and lemme tell you
     why: Because I Am What I Believe.
     I am what I teach, I do as I say,
     I live by these rules as religiously
     as I preach them: And you wanna know

     I'm gonna start rolling --

     And I'II tell you samethin' else:
     I'm not succeding in the bush because
     I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything,
     there are women out there that want
     to destroy me -- it makes it twice as
     hard for me, I run into some little
     muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes
     and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna
     fuck around, prove to her friends, say,
     "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he
     wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me?
     I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole
     fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and
     right from terrorist blonde beauties.
     But I'II tell you this: The battle of
     the bush is being fought and won by Team
     Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?

     Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple

heads away from him -- it moves to the bar area and into:

A young, handsome BARTENDER BRAD (20s) is pouring drinks.

DONNIE'S POV - The Bartender pours the coke, turns his attention towards
an old-freaky looking Thurston Howell/Truman Capote/Dorothy Parker
type guy (60s) at the end of the bar, who raises his glass, motions as
if to say, "Another one of these, please," while waving some money
and smiling/flirting with Brad the Bartender.

Donnie's face drops.  CAMERA DOLLIES back a little bit and blends from
40fps to 24fps.  The Cocktail Waitress arrives back;

          COCKTAIL WAITRESS
     Diet Coke.

          DONNIE
     I want a shot of tequila too.

          COCKTAIL WAITRESS
     -- what kind?

          DONNIE

          JULIA
     Do you still have to do homework?

          RICHARD
     Not as much as I used to.  Ever since
     we started, I haven't really gone in to
     school that much because I've been getting
     more and more auditions --

          STANLEY
     I don't have regular classes anymore.

          RICHARD
     What do you do?

          STANLEY
     They just let me have my own study-time,
     my own reading time in the library.

          RICHARD
     That's pretty cool.

          JULIA
     Do you have an agent, Stanley?

          STANLEY
     No.

          JULIA
     You should get one, I'm serious,
     you could get a lot of stuff out of this --

          STANLEY
     Like what?

          RICHARD
     What do you mean, "like what?"
     -- you could get endorsments and shit --

          CYNTHIA
     -- Richard.

          RICHARD
     Bite it, Cynthia.  You could get free
     things from people that want you to
     endorse their products.

          JULIA
     Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.

          STANLEY

     Was it a call back?

          JULIA
     No.  But I probably will get a call back.

          RICHARD
     If we beat the record, you might get
     a call back --

          JULIA
     I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.

          RICHARD
     Saucy-saucy.

          CYNTHIA
     C'mon guys, settle down --

          STANLEY
     Cynthia?

          CYNTHIA
     What?

          STANLEY
     How much time do we have?

          CYNTHIA
     Not enough, what do you want?

          STANLEY
     I should maybe go to the bathroom.

     Can you hold it?

          STANLEY
     I don't know.

          CYNTHIA
     Just hold it, you'll be fine.

They arrive and enter onto the stage -- CAMERA swings around, branches
away from them and BOOMS UP to reveal the set;

There is a LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE that's being settled into their seats.

It's a three-camera set up with a FLOOR DIRECTOR roaming around,
shouting orders, etc.

There's a spot for the announcer, an old-pro named DICK JENNINGS (60s)
Dick is in the middle of doing bad-comedy warm up for the studio
audience.  He's had a few drinks, etc.

The STAGE itself is a cross between JEAPORDY/NEWLEYWED GAME/PRICE IS
RIGHT.  There's a podium for Jimmy Gator.  One panel holds "The Kids,"
and one panel holds, "The Adults."  There are chaser-lights all around
and some of the design feels left over from the early days of the show.

CAMERA hangs out with the KIDS as they are ushered into their panel,
which at this moment faces away from the audience and is behind a
curtain.  Julia turns her head, sees something:

          JULIA
     Here they come --

The ADULT CHALLENGERS are brought out by an assistant type and loaded
into their panel.  The Adult Challengers are:

Black woman named MIM MacNEAL(40s)
White guy with glasses TODD GERONIMO (20s)
Puerto Rican guy named LUIS GUZMAN (40s)

The Adults give a couple small glares over to the Kids.

          RICHARD (sotto)
     Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep lookin'
     tough-old folks.

          STANLEY
     They look pretty smart, I think.

          JULIA
     No they don't --

          RICHARD
     What are they gonna do -- beat us?

          STANLEY
     Maybe.

          JULIA
     We're not going out two days before
     we set the record, it's not gonna happen.

          RICHARD
     When they want us done, they'll call
     in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.

CAMERA lands in CU on Stanley.  HOLD. BEAT. THEN:

INT. JIMMY'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

Jimmy and a woman named PAULA (3Os) sit in his office. SLOW DOLLY IN

          JIMMY
     You look great.

BEAT.

          PAULA
     What the fuck is this, Jimmy?

          JIMMY
     ...you know...

          PAULA
     Did your wife find out?

          JIMMY
     No.

          PAULA
     Then what?

          JIMMY
     It's just...too late for me to be
     fuckin' around.  I gotta stop.
     I gotta clean my brain of all the
     shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --

          PAULA
     -- that you shouldn't have done?
     That you regret, what? This? What's
     this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me
     like an asshole, but treat me like
     an asshole.

          JIMMY
     I don't wanna have to lie to anyone.
     I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.

She doesn't respond. BEAT. THEN:

          JIMMY
     Thirty fuckin' years I've been with
     Rose, don't -- y'know -- with
     this, and I know what you think --

          PAULA
     All your other fluzzies?

          JIMMY
     Yeah. Yes.

          PAULA
     You're making me feel so dirty and shitty.
     I feel like a big piece of shit right now.

BEAT.

          PAULA
     Are you gonna tell her what you've done?

          JIMMY
     Yes.

          PAULA
     Will you say my name?

          JIMMY
     If she asks me any question I want
     to tell her.  I want to tell her
     everything I've done.

          PAULA
     Well can you do me one favor and
     don't do that.

Jimmy doesn't answer.

          PAULA
     Come and tell me it's over and I'll
     walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you
     behind your wife's back for three
     years, and you've fucked teenage girls
     behind mine for the same amount of
     time -- I'll walk away, you need something
     for your life, for your conscience,
     but don't put me in the middle --

          JIMMY
     I won't.

          PAULA
     What happend to you?

          JIMMY
     I got in trouble at school.

She stands and walks over to him, moves to give him a hug.

          PAULA
     Are you ok?

          JIMMY
     Fuck no.

There's a KNOCK at the door and then it's opened by BURT RAMSEY (60s)
He's the producer of the show; (WHIP TO HIM)

          BURT
     Ready to run.  Paula.

          PAULA
     Burt.

Jimmy takes a quick shot, moves to Paula, gives her a tap on the
cheek and says;

          JIMMY (to Paula)
     You're a good one arentcha?

                         CUT TO:

     thirty years, Burt --

          BURT
     These adults are tough enough, I think
     you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's
     a bit of a question mark --

Jimmy FALLS STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR.

INT. CLAUDIA'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT. **

Claudia finishes throwing her drugs into a dirty t-shirt and throwing
that dirty t-shirt into her laundry basket.  Jim Kurring bangs away at
the door.

          JIM KURRING (OC)
     OPEN THE DOOR.

          CLAUDIA
     I'm coming!

She runs towards the door, takes a small fall on the way, recovers,
opens up;

          CLAUIDA
     Yeah. Hi. Hello.

REVERSE, CLOSE UP - JIM KURRING - 40fps.
CAMERA pushes in on him a little bit at his first sight of Claudia.

          JIM KURRING
     ...yeah...

          CLAUDIA
     I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.

Wider Angle reveals Jim Kurring, in a bit of a daze, standing with
his BILLY CLUB removed and at the ready.  He stands back...they have
SHOUT above the music;

          JIM KURRING
     -- you the resident here?

          CLAUIDA
     Yes.

          JIM KURRING
     You alone in there?

          CLAUDIA
     Yes.

          JIM KURRING
     No one else in there with you?

          CLAUIDA
     No, what's wrong?

          JIM KURRING
     You mind if I come in, check things?

          CLAUDIA
     For what?

          JIM KURRING
     Ok. For one thing, we're gonna
     need to turn that music down so
     we can talk, ok?

          CLAUDIA
     I'm sorry.

She turns and Jim Kurring moves to replace his billy club, but misses
the holster and it FALLS straight to the floor, slides down the steps.

Claudia turns the music down, turns back and sees that he is gone.

Jim Kurring grabs his billy club from the bottom of the steps and
bounces back up and into the apartment as if nothing happend;

          JIM KURRING
     You live alone?

          CLAUIDA
     Yes.

          JIM KURRING
     What's your name?

          CLAUIDA
     Claudia.

          JIM KURRING
     Claudia What?

          CLAUDIA
     Wilson.

          JIM KURRING
     Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?

          CLAUDIA
     What?

          JIM KURRING
     Did you hear what I said?

          CLAUDIA
     Yeah, but I don't know --

          JIM KURRING
     -- listenin' to that music so loud:
     You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?

          CLAUDIA
     No.

          JIM KURRING
     Well if you keep listenin' to the
     music that loud you're not only
     gonna damage your ears but your
     neighbors ears.

          CLAUDIA
     I didn't realize it was that loud.

          JIM KURRING
     And that could be the sign of a damaged
     ear drum, you understand?

          CLAUDIA
     Yeah.

          JIM KURRING
     You got the TV on too, keep those
     on at that same time usually?

          CALUDIA
     I don't know -- I mean.  What is this?

          JIM KURRING
     Have you been drinkin' today,
     doin' some drugs?

          CLAUDIA
     No.

          JIM KURRING
     I got a call of a disturbance, screaming
     and yelling, loud music.  Has there been
     some screaming and yelling?

          CLAUDIA
     Yes.  I had someone come to my door,
     someone I didn't want here and I told them
     to leave -- so -- it's no big deal.
     They left.  I'm sorry.

          JIM KURRING
     Was it a boyfriend of yours?

          CLAUDIA
     No.

          JIM KURRING
     You don't have a boyfriend?

          CLAUDIA
     No.

          JIM KURRING
     Who was it?

          CLAUDIA
     I was...he's gone...I mean it's not.
     It's over, y'know --

Jim Kurring snoops a bit, she rubs her nose, nervous.  Jim Kurring
heads closer to bedroom --

          JIM KURRING
     You mind if I check things back here?

          CLAUDIA
     It's fine.

Jim Kurring heads into the bedroom, looks around, stands by the
laundry basket --

          CLAUDIA
     What are you lookin' for?

          JIM KURRING
     Claudia: Why don't you let me
     handle the questions and you handle
     the answers, ok?

          CLAUDIA
     ok.

          JIM KURRING
     You just move in here?

          CLAUDIA
     About two years ago.

          JIM KURRING
     Bit messy.

          CLAUDIA
     Yeah.

          JIM KURRING
     I'm a bit of a slob myself.

          CLAUDIA
     Yeah.

          JIM KURRING
     You and your boyfriend have a party
     last night?

          CLAUDIA
     I don't have a boyfriend.

Donnie sits in his booth after two tequila's.  He's slightly fucked up.
He gets up, stumbles over to the bar and takes a seat uncomfortably
close to Thurston, who's now holding court among three or four other
PATRONS.  Brad the Bartender is washing glasses, keeps half an eye on
things...Donnie to Thurston;

          DONNIE
     You look like you've got money
     in your pocket.

          THURSTON
     Maybe I'm just happy to see my
     friend, Brad there.

The PATRONS laugh a bit, Brad nods, Donnie doesn't laugh or look
anywhere but Thurston;

          DONNIE
     Just throw some money around.
     Money, money, money.

          THURSTON
     This sounds threatening.

          DONNIE
     Do you have love in your heart?

          THURSTON
     I have love all over.  I even have
     love for you, friend.

          DONNIE
     Is it real love?

          THURSTON
     Well --

          DONNIE
     -- the kind of love that makes you feel
     that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach.
     Like a bucket of acid and nerves running
     around and making you hurt and happy and
     all over you're head over heels....?

          THURSTON
     Well you lost me with the last couple
     of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but
     I believe it's that sort of love.
     Sounds nice to me.

          DONNIE
     I have love.

          THURSTON
     A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.

          DONNIE
     No.  I mean, I'm telling you:
     I'm telling you that I have love.

          THURSTON
     And I'm listening avidly, fellow.

          DONNIE

     lot's of love to give.

     not sure who I should talk to or

          LINDA
     ...I don't....

          YOUNG PHARAMCY KID
     Interesting drugs.  Dexadrine's basically
     speed in a pill.  Y'know?  But I guess
     a lot of doctors are balancing out
     the prozac with the dexadrine, eh?
     That Liquid Morphine'll knock you down,
     out, around, up and down someone's
     not careful.....can't mix those up, y'know...
     ...Must have a lot goin' on in your life for
     all that stuff there.

The Older Pharamacist DINGS his bell and the Young Pharmacy Kid
gets the bag and starts to ring it up.  SLOW ZOOM IN ON LINDA as
he babbles away;

          YOUNG PHARAMCY KID (OC)
     Strong, strong stuff here, boy...wow....

LINDA snaps.  She starts to tremble and cry and build --

     ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --

Linda PUSHES a large DISPLAY over on it's side, SMASHES things on the
counter, throws things around, basically goes nuts.  The Older
Pharamacist comes rushing to the front to try and calm things --

          OLDER PHARMACIST
     Please, lady, why don't you just calm down --

          LINDA
     And FUCK YOU TOO.  Don't you call me "lady."
     I come in with these things, I give it
     over to you, you doubt, you make your
     phone calls, check on me, look suspicious,
     ask questions, "I'm sick." I HAVE SICKNESS
     ALL AROUND ME AND YOU FUCKING ASK ME MY LIFE?
     WHAT'S WRONG?  HAVE YOU SEEN DEATH IN YOUR BED
     IN YOUR HOUSE?  And where is your fucking
     decency?  That I'm asked questions "WHAT'S WRONG?"
     You suck my dick, that's what's wrong and you,

     They don't have the same last name.

          PHIL
     I know -- and I can't really explain that,
     but I have a feeling there's something,
     some situation between them, like they don't
     really know each other much or well, something
     like they don't talk much anymore --

          CHAD
     Uh-huh.

          PHIL
     Does this sound weird?

          CHAD
     Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.

          PHIL
     There's no number for Frank in any
     of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out

     dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.

          CHAD
     What kind of Cancer?

          PHIL
     Brain and Lung.

          CHAD
     My mother had breast cancer.

CAMERA pushes in on Earl, asleep in the bed, breathing becomes

     I know that maybe I sound ridiculous,
     like maybe this is the scene of the
     movie where the guy is trying to get
     ahold of the long-lost son, but this
     is that scene.  Y'know?  I think they
     have those scenes in movies because they're
     true, because they really happen.
     And you gotta believe me: This is really
     happening.  I mean, I can give you my
     phone number and you can call me back
     if you wanna check with whoever you can check
     this with, but don't leave me hanging on this --

     Like I said, yeah --

          GWEN
     And you went to Van Nuys High, right?

          FRANK
     I don't how much I went -- but I was
     enrolled.  I was such a loser back then.
     I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat.
     Not even close to what I am today.
     Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk
     to because I was swimming in what was as
     opposed to I wanted.

          GWEN
     Where does that name come from?

          FRANK
     What name?  My name?

          GWEN
     It's not your given name, right?

     My mother's name, actually.
     Good question.  You've done you're research.

          GWEN
     And "Frank?"

          FRANK
     "Frank" was my mother's father.

          GWEN
     Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating
     your school records at Berkely and UCLA.
     Your name change -- they had no official
     enrollment --

          FRANK
     Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --

          GWEN
     They wouldn't?

          FRANK
     no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't
     officialy enrolled, that's right.
     Was that unclear?

          GWEN
     Kind of.

          FRANK
     I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood:
     My enrollment was totally unoffical because
     I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up
     there.  But there were three wonderful men
     who were kind enough to let me sit in on
     their classes, and they're names are:
     Macready, Horn and Langtree among others.
     I was completely independent financially,
     and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit.
     So what we're looking at here is a true
     rags to riches story and I think that's
     what most people respond to in "Seduce,"
     And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not
     even be about picking up chicks and sticking your
     cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be
     In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and

     Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --

     I like iced coffee, generally, but a day
     like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --

          CLAUDIA

          JIM KURRING
     That's great, thank you.

She starts heating/preparing him some coffee.

     I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --

          JIM KURRING
     Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.

          CLAUDIA
     You take cream or sugar?

          JIM KURRING
     That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say,
     so I can get my role of LAPD officer
     out of the way before we enjoy our
     coffee (I never like to talk shop over coffee)
     I'm not gonna write you up or anything,
     I'm not gonna give you a citation here --
     but the real problem we have is that there
     are people around here, people that
     work from their homes, people tryin' to get
     some work done, and if you're listenin' to
     your music that loud:  They're incovenienced
     by that.  If you had a job you'd probably
     understand, but I see you like listenin'
     to your music and that's fine, you're just
     gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume,
     maybe memorize what number you see on the
     dial and just always put it to that --
     If it's the middle of the day -- that's
     what I do -- just put it on two and a half
     and that's a good listening level, alright?
     I see you like listenin' to your music loud,
     but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you
     end up damaging your own ears ok?

          CLAUDIA
     Yeah.

          JIM KURRING
     Arlight, then.  Cheers.

They clink coffee cups.  He makes a sour face at the taste;

          JIM KURRING
     The gentleman who came to the door --

          CLAUDIA

          JIM KURRING
     Many times, in damestic abuse situations
     the young lady is afraid to speak,
     but I have to tell you that, being
     a police officer, I've seen it happen:
     Young woman afraid to speak, next thing
     you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio,
     I got a 422 --

          CLAUDIA
     It's not -- what's a 422?

          JIM KURRING
     It's where situations like these
     lead, Claudia, unless you do something
     about it early, if and when the police
     call and come for help.  Now there
     are certain measures you can take --

          CLAUDIA
     It's not my boyfriend -- and it's
     not anything -- it's over.  Really.
     It's not.  He won't came back.

     I don't wanna have to come back here

     You won't.  You won't have to.

     go to the bathroom now.  You have
     exactly one minute before we're back
     on the air, this is NOT the time to go
     to the bathroom.

          STANLEY
     I'm, I need to go, I'm gonna --

          RICHARD
     Why does this kinda shit always happen, Stanley?

The Adult Challengers look over at the Kids section;

     What's the problem over there?

          RICHARD
     Mind yer bussiness --

          MIM

          CYNTHIA
     Alright, stop it, cool down, cool it. Please.
     Now: Stanley, you wait until the next commercial break
     and you can go then -- Just Hold It.

Earl continues to hallucinate and remains in major pain, but at
the same time he's very, very weak.  There are moments of strength
that pop and push into him and he's very angry with Phil, continues
to scream for someone named, "Lily," and generally treats Phil like
an enemy.

          EARL
     LILY.  FUCK. LIL, PLEASE. LILY.

Phil moves into the kitchen and gets the bottle of MORPHINE PILLS.
He drops them, the crash on the floor, picks them all up, except one...

          THURSTON
     You're a friend of the family I presume?

          DONNIE
     What?  What does that mean?

          THURSTON
     Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.

          DONNIE
     You talk in rhymes and riddles and
     ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean
     anything to me, see....see...see I used
     to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.
     I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --

          THURSTON
     Might of been before my time.

          PATRON #1
     I remember you.  I remember. In the 60's right?

          DONNIE
     I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.

          THURSTON
     ...like you said...

          PATRON #1
     Smart Kid!  Fuck, yeah, he-he.  You got
     hit by lightning that one time, right?

          DONNIE
     So what?

          PATRON #1
     I heard about that.

          PATRON #2
     Did it hurt?

          DONNIE
     Yes.

          THURSTON
     But you're alright now, so what's the what?

          DONNIE
     What?

          THURSTON
     That's right.

          DONNIE
     I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.

          THURSTON
     Brad, dear?

Brad turns and looks:

          THURSTON
     Who was it that said: "A man of genius
     has seldom been ruined but by himself."

          DONNIE
               (to himself)
     -- Samuel Johnson.

          BRAD
     I don't know.

Donnie looks up at Brad.  Brad smiles with his braces, Donnie looks
away quick --

          THURSTON
     It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who
     also spoke of a fella "Who was not only
     dull but a cause of dullness in others."

          DONNIE
     "The" cause of dullness in others --

          THURSTON
     Picky, picky.

          DONNIE
     -- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson
     never had his life shit on and taken from
     him and his money stolen -- who took his
     life and his money?  His parents?
     His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life
     like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on
     as a child and that scars and it hurts and
     have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts
     and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an
     electrical charge that finds it's way across
     the universe and lands in your body and your
     head -- and as for "ruined but by himself,"
     not if his parents take his friggin' life and
     his money and tell you to do this and do that and
     if you don't? well, what --

          PATRON #1
     You're parents took your money you won
     on that game show?

          DONNIE
     Yes they did.
           (turns quick to Thurston)
     What does that mean, "spoke in the wheel?"

          THURSTON
     Things go round 'n round, don't they?

          DONNIE
     Yes they do, they do, but I'll make
     my dreams come true, you see?  I will.

          THURSTON
     This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.

          DONNIE
     I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.

          THURSTON
     Shall we drink to that?

Donnie looks to the television for a moment, starts to tear up,
CAMERA pushes in slow to an EXTREME CLOSE UP.  He repeats line's from
his days on "What Do Kids Know?" and does his best Jimmy immitation;

          DONNIE
     "If a brick weighs one pound plus one
     half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?"
     "Well if subtracting the half of brick from
     the whole brick you got one half of brick,
     equals one pound so therefore the brick
     equals two pounds --" "A little more than
     kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius.
     "The sins of the father laid upon the children,"
     is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus
     20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not
     words," is Two Gentleman from Verona.
     Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?

          THURSTON

          STANLEY

     my own quiz show someday, Jimmy.
     Just like you!

The AUDIENCE laughs.  Jimmy clicks back with a chuckle and
a "isn't that cute," smile to the crowd and he walks over to
his podium; CAMERA stays for a moment with Stanley, notices him
continue to grab his crotch and make a face....

INT. HOLIDAY INN SUITE - THAT MOMENT

Frank and Gwenovier doing the telvision interview. CAMERA DOLLIES
IN SLOW ON EACH:

          FRANK
     -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M
     saying, that none of my competitors can say is
     this:  That there is no need for insight or
     understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done.
     Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is?
     How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and
     ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm
     talking about eliminating insight and understanding
     as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is
     no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for
     UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take
     any subjective human experience -- in other
     words -- all the terrible shit or all the
     great shit that you've had happen to you in
     your life -- and quickly and easily transform
     it in the unconscious mind through the subtle
     and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"
     (in other words: The Chick) settles into a very
     light, very delicate, conversationally induced
     state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE.
     A state that is brand new.  The System's state.
     What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put
     it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use.
     I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the
     seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party
     'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that
     will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --

          GWENOVIER
     Let's talk about --

          FRANK
     I just realized this is for television,
     isn't it?  I can't swear up and down
     like I just did.

          GWENOVIER
     It's fine.  I can bleep it out.

          FRANK
     I warned you -- I get on a roll...

          GWENOVIER
     -- let's talk more about your background --

          FRANK
     Muffy -- coffee?

Muffy moves to pour a cup, Gwen looks down at her clipboard, then:

          GWENOVIER
     I'm confused about your past is the thing.

          FRANK
     Is that still lingering?

          GWENOVIER
     -- just to clarify --

          FRANK
     So boring, so useless --

          GWENOVIER
     I would just want to clear some things up:

          FRANK
           (Muffy delivers coffee)
     Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is:
     This is an important element of,
     "Seduce and Destory:"
     "Facing the past is an important way
     in not making progress," that's something
     I tell my men over and over --

          GWENOVIER
     This isn't meant --

          FRANK
     -- and I try and teach the students to
     ask: What is it in aid of?

          GWENOVIER
     Are you asking me that?

          FRANK
     Yes.

          GWENOVIER
     Well, just trying to figure out who you are,
     and how you might have become --

          FRANK
     In aid of what?

          GWENOVIER
     I'm saying, Frank, in trying to
     figure out who you are --

          FRANK
     -- there's a lot more important things
     I'd like to put myself into --

          GWENOVIER
     It's all important --

          FRANK
     Not really.

          GWENOVIER
     It's not like I'm trying to attack you --

          FRANK
     This is how you wanna spend the time,
     then go, go, go -- you're gonna
     be surprised at what a waste it is --
     "The most useless thing in the world
     is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --

          GWENOVIER
     We talked earlier about your mother.
     And we talked about your father and his death.
     And I don't want to be challenging or
     defeatist here, but I have to ask and
     I would want to clarify something --
     something that I understand --

          FRANK
     I'm not sure I hear a question in there?

          GWENOVIER
     Do you remember a Miss Simms?

          FRANK
     I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.

          GWENOVIER
     She does.  From when you were a boy.

          FRANK
     Mm. Hm.

          GWENOVIER
     She lived in Tarzana.

          FRANK
     An old stomping ground --is this
     the "attack" portion of the interview,
     I figured this was coming sooner
     or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?

          GWENOVIER
     No, this is about getting something
     right and claryfying one of your answers
     to an earlier question --

          FRANK
     Go ahead and waste your time.

          GWENOVIER
     I was told that your mother died.
     That your mother died when you were young --

          FRANK
     And that's what you've heard?

          GWENOVIER
     I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms
     was your caretaker and neighbor
     after your mother died in 1980.

BEAT. Frank goes silent.

          GWENOVIER
     In my research I have you listed as
     the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge.
          (beat)
     And what I learned from Mrs. Simms is that
     your mother passed away in 1980.
          (beat)
     See:  It's my understanding that the information
     supplied by you and your company and answers
     to question's I've asked are incorrect, Frank.
     And if I'd like to get to the bottom of who you
     are and why you are then I think your family
     history -- you're accurate family history...well:
     this seems important...Frank...?

VIDEO CAMERA POV - THAT MOMENT
Frank lights his cigarette.  CAMERA zooms into CU.

          FRANK
     Are you asking me a question?

          GWEN
     Well I guess the question is this:
     Do you remember Miss Simms?

BEAT. HOLD, THEN:

Jimmy asks questions.  Stanley is visibly uncomfortable;

          JIMMY
     Kids, Adults, I'd like you to put
     yourself at a picnic.  Place yourself
     there with your family and friends
     if you'd like -- you'll hear three
     musical notes and you are to tell me
     what it might represent that you'd
     find at a picnic -- The First Three Notes:

OC we hear three musical notes.  The "Adults" panel lights up,
Todd answers;

          TODD
     Well, Jimmy, I know this, I have perfect
     pitch, you see -- and that would be A-D-E.
     And that would represent lemonade.

          JIMMY
     For 250.  Next notes, please:

OC musical notes: E-G-G.

          TODD (buzzes)
     Got it.  That's E-G-G which would be ~egg."

Richard and Julia glance at Stanley, like "why the fuck aren't you
answering these questions?" He looks straight ahead.

          JIMMY
     For 500 and the Third Set Of Notes:

OC musical notes: B-E-E.

          TODD (buzzes)
     B-E-E -- and don't get stung.

          KLIGMAN
     Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright.
     You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients
     and what you need to talk about won't leave
     this room, you have something you have to say --

          LINDA
     -- I have something to tell you.
     I have to tell you something.
     I want to change his will, can I change
     his will?...I need to ---

          KLIGMAN
     You can't change his will.  Only
     Earl can change his will.

          LINDA
     No, no....no, you see...I never loved him.
     I never loved him, Earl.  When I started,
     when I met him, I met him and I fucked
     him and I married him because I wanted
     his money, do you understand?
          (beat)
     I'm telling you this now...this I've never
     told anyone...I didn't love him.
     And now....I know I'm in that will,
     I know, I was there with him, we were
     all there together when we made that
     fucking thing and all the money I'II
     get -- I don't want it -- Because I love
     him so much now...I've fallen in love
     with him now, for real, as he's dying,
     and I look at him and he's about to
     go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...
          (beat)
     I took care of him through this, Alan.
     And What Now Then?

                         CUT TO:

INT. GAME SHOW STAGE - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA pushes in on Jimmy.

          JIMMY
     Let's listen:

There's an OC VOICE that speaks the clue;

          VOICE
     "Hello, Mary.  How are you and the
     seven kids?  As you probably heard by
     know, we sure gave that Pope a run for
     his money --"

The ~Adults" buzz.  Jimmy looks to Mim.

          MIM
     Well: That would be General Robert
     E. Lee.  His wife Mary Park Custiss.
     And he did have seven children and he
     would be talking about Pope, who he defeated
     at the Battle of Monasses --

                         CUT TO:

INT. PARENTS GREEN ROOM - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA pushes in on Rick, who sits back, starting to get real
pissed that Stanley isn't answering these questions.

          RICK
     C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, snap out of it.

                         CUT TO:

INT. GAME SHOW STAGE - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA moves from the AUDIENCE over to the Stage, listening
to another question that is spoken by the OC voice -- this
time in French;

          VOICE (in French)
     "Hello, Josephine,
     I'm speaking from Egypt --"

The Adults buzz again and Mim answers;

          JIMMY
     Mim --

          MIM
     Well that would be Napoleon speaking
     to Josephine.

          JIMMY
     That's right!

ANGLE, BURT.  He stands off, looking at the scoreboard as the
Adults have now pulled ahead by 200 points...he mumbles and
grumbles to himself.

                         CUT TO:

INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

Linda continued with the lawyer, Kligman.

          LINDA
     I don't want him to die, I didn't love him
     when we met, and I've done so many bad things
     to him that he doesn't know, things I want
     to confess to him, but now I do: I love him.
     I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.

          KLIGMAN
     What kind of medication are
     you on right now, Linda that's --

          LINDA
     This is not any fucking medication
     talking, this isn't -- I don't know.
     I don't know -- Can you give me nothing?
     You have power of attorney, can you see him,
     can you, in this final fucking moment, go see
     him and make sure --- change the fucking
     will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't
     live with myself, this thing I've done --
     I've fucking done so many bad things --
     I fucked around.  I fucked around on him,
     I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer,
     our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married.
     I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking
     cheated on him, many times over, I sucked
     other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck -
           ....fuck....
     Other Things I've Done..

          KLIGMAN
     Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something
     that can be used in a court to discredit
     the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.

          LINDA
     I can't.

          KLIGMAN
     You don't have to change the will,
     if what you want to do is get nothing
     you can renounce the will when it's time.

          LINDA
     Where will the money go?

          KLIGMAN
     Well.  Considering that there's no one
     else mentioned in the will...we'd
     have to go to the laws of intestacy,
     which is -- as if someone died without a will --

          LINDA
     What does that mean?

          KLIGMAN
     The money would go to Frank.  The court
     would put the money in the hands of a relative --

          LINDA
     -- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't
     want him to have the money, the things.

          KLIGMAN
     -- unless Frank is specifically ommitted
     as a beneficiary that's what will happen.

          LINDA
     This is so over-the-top and fucked-up
     I can hardly stand it.

          KLIGMAN
     Linda, you just have to take a moment
     and breath and one thing at a time --

          LINDA
     Shut the fuck up.

          KLIGMAN
     I'm trying to help, Linda --

          LINDA
     Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

          KLIGMAN
     You need to sober up.

          LINDA
     Now you must really shut the fuck up, please.
     Shut The Fuck Up.

          KLIGMAN
     Linda --

          LINDA
     I have to go.

She heads for the door.

          KLIGMAN
     Let me call you a car, Linda.

          LINDA
     Shut the fuck up.

She's out the door.

INT. GAME SHOW STAGE - THAT MOMENT

Three MEN in TUXEDOS and HARMONICAS have taken a place near
the band.  Jimmy, reading from his cards, introduces them and
asks the following question:

(Note: Jimmy's speech is starting to slur a bit more at this
point.  His motor skills seem to be fading quickly.)

          JIMMY
     Imagine you are attending a jam session
     of classical composers and they have
     each done an arrangment of the classic
     favorite, "Whispering."  Here are three
     variations on the theme, as three classic
     composer's might have written it -- you are
     to name the composer.  The First:

The Harmonica Fella's play an arrangment....CAMERA pushes in close
on STANLEY and TITLS DOWN CLOSE TO HIS PANTS....

Stanley begins to piss his pants.  He trembles and shakes and
holds back tears as the wet stain gets bigger.

OC through this we hear the Adults answer the question:

          TODD (OC)
     Well, Jimmy that sounded to me
     like Brahms, a bit like his Hungarian
     Dance Number Six, I believe.

          JIMMY (OC)
     Excellent. Next number:

The Harmonica Fella's play another arrangment of "Whispering"
that sounds like Ravel's "Bolero."

Stanley moves his arms down to his sides to cover his crotch
and pull at his pants -- and his BUZZER goes off with a brush
of the side of his arm --

          JIMMY
     Stanley the Man -- answer:

Stanley.  HOLD.  He starts to cry. Julia and Richard look over
at him and see his pants and they start to laugh a bit.

          STANLEY
     ...I don't know the answer...

Jimmy starts to STUDDER and SHAKE a bit....holds a tight grip on
the podium;

          JIMMY GATOR
     That is not right!  That's not right,
     Stanley, the answer is...Ravel....Ravel....
     ....xhjksndlsmnop.....

CAMERA WHIPS and pushes over to the FLOOR DIRECTOR.

          FLOOR DIRECTOR
     What the fuck is wrong with him?
          (into headseat}
     What do you wanna do here, he's
     fading fast --

podium and falls to the ground....taking the podium with him....

     This is, for not a fresh cup, a great
     cup of coffee, Claudia --

She sits down, ready to talk, lights a cigarette.

          STANLEY
     NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.

          CYNTHIA
     Don't tell me to go away, Stanley.
     I am the Co-ordinator in this show
     and you will answer the questions
     that I ask, you understand?

Rick comes over;

          RICK
     What's the problem, what's the problem here?

          STANLEY
     I'm fine. nothing.

          RICK
     Why didn't you answer those questions?

          STANLEY
     I didn't know the answer --

          RICK
     Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the
     answer to every goddamn question and
     I knew the answer to those questions
     and I'm not half as smart as you are so
     What Happened?

          STANLEY

     Tempural-something-mandibular,
     thing with something, I dunno.
     But it affects my ear, I don't even
     know if I have TMJ exactly but just
     very tight, like - it's like a muscle
     spasm and it's just gets so clenched --

She's interupted by the call on his RADIO.  He takes the call.
(Director's Note: Technical blah-blah-blah,etc.)

          JIM KURRING
     This is my job.

          CLAUDIA
     We were just gettin' warmed up.
     We were just getting started.

          JIM KURRING
     Well if you listen' to that music
     too loud again and that fella returns
     maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --

          CLAUDIA
     If you're not here for a 422 --

          JIM KURRING
     No. No.  Don't joke about that.

     What is it?  Did you forget something?

          JIM KURRING
     No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man.
     I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket
     doing this, considering that I came here
     as an officer of the law and the situation
     and all this but I think I'd be a fool
     if I didn't do something I really want
     to do which is to ask you on a date.

          CLAUDIA
     You wanna go on a date with me?

          JIM KURRING
     Please, yes.

          CLAUDIA

     No.

          JIM KURRING
     I don't know.  I haven't thought about
     it -- you know what -- that's not
     true -- I have thought about it.  I've

     Really?

          JIM KURRING
     Yeah.

     No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like,

     too late?  I don't get off and then --

          CLAUDIA
     Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners
     are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?

          JIM KURRING
     No, no, just casual maybe, maybe

     it's real nice that overlooks a golf course
     and the course is lit up at night --

          DONNIE
     I'm sick and I'm in love.

          THURSTON
     You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.

          DONNIE
     That's right.  That's the first time
     you're right.  I CONFUSE THE TWO
     AND I DON'T CARE.

Donnie looks to Brad, then:

          DONNIE
     HEY.  HEY.

Brad looks.  Donnie stands up, backs away from the bar as he talks;

          (beat, crying now)
     You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll
     be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you.
     And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what.
     I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong.
     I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.

          THURSTON
     Brad, honey, you have a special
     secret crush over here I think, don't
     take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --

          DONNIE
     You mind your own bussines.

          THURSTON
     Gently, son --

          DONNIE
     Brad, I know you don't love me now --

          THURSTON
     "It's a dangerous thing to confuse
     chidlren with angels..."

          DONNIE
     -- and you wanna know the common element for
     the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you
     the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that
     question.  I had that same question....Carbon.
     In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite
     and in coal, it's all mixed up with other
     impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.
          (Jimmy impersonation)
     "Well...all we were asking was the common
     element, Donnie...but thank you for all that
     unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of
     useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.
          (beat)
     And the book says: "We may be through with
     the past but the past is not through with us."
          (to Thurston)
     And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.

Phil comes over and takes a seat next to him.

          EARL
     I'm onna try and talk...I'm atryan
     say some thing some thing...

Earl begins to talk. (Director's Note: Following is the story
Earl tells, it is to be more broken and elliptical, factoring
in Earl's state of mind and health, etc, but here's the concept
in its entirety;)

          EARL
     Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?

          PHIL
     No.

          EARL
     ...Lily...?

          PHIL
     No.

          EARL
     She's my love...my life...love of it...
     In school when you're 12 years old.
     In school, in six grade....and I saw her
     and I didn't go to that school...but we met.
     And my friend knew her...I would say,
     "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?"
     "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with
     guys..."  My friend would say this....but
     then sometime...I went to another school, you see?
     But then...when high school at the end, what's
     that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?

          PHIL
     Graduation?

          EARL
     No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?

          PHIL

          EARL
     Yeah...So I go to her school for that
     for grade twelve...and we meet...she
     was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain
     doll...and the hips...child bearing
     hips...y'know that?  So beautiful.
     But I didn't have sex with anyone,
     you know?  I was not...I couldn't
     do anything...always scared, y'know...
     she was...she had some boyfriends...they
     liked her y'know...but I didn't like that.
     I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man,
     but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't
     make her feel ok about that....I would
     say, "How many men you been with?"
     She told me, I couldn't take it...take that
     I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had
     sex with women...like as many women as
     she had men...then I was weak...a boy....
     But I loved her...you understand?
     ....well, of course, I wanted to have
     sex with her...and I did and we were
     together....we met...age twelve, but then
     again...age seventeen...something, somethin...
     I didn't let her forget that I thought she
     was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call
     her and hit her....I hit her for what she
     did...but we married...Lily and me and we
     married...but I cheated on her...over and
     over and over again...because I wanted
     to be a man and I couldn't let her be
     a woman...a smart, free person who was
     something...my mind then, so fuckin'
     stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what
     would I think...did I think....?
     ...for what I've done...She's my wife for
     thirty eight years...I went behind her...
     over and over...fucking asshole I am
     that I would go out and fuck and come
     home and get in her bed and say
     "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother.
     His mother Lily...these two that I had
     and I lost .... and this is the regret that
     you make...the regret you make is the
     something that you take...blah...blah...blah...
     something, something.....
          (beat)
     Gimme a cigarettee?

Through the following Phil tries to give Earl a cigarette,
which Earl can't get to his mouth, but then mimes that he's
smoking as he starts to get more and more delusional, etc.

          EARL
     She had cancer...from her...in her
     stomach and I didn't go anywhere
     with her...and I didn't do a god thing...
     for her and to help her....shit...this
     bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch

     hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?

     He liked her though he did, his mom,
     Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died.
     She didn't stick with him and he thinks
     and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's
     then what you get?
     ....are you still walkin' in that car...?

          PHIL
     What?  Say it again...walking in the car?

          EARL
     ....getthat on the tv....there...

Earl starts to break down in tears, streaming out of his eyes,
his body isn't moving at all;

          EARL
     ...mistakes like this are not ok...
     sometimes you make some, and ok...not
     sometimes to make other one....know
     that you should do better....I loved Lily.
     I cheated on her.  For thirty five years.
     And I have this son.  And she has cancer.
     And I'm not there.  And he's forced to take
     care of her.  He's fourteen years old to take
     care of his mother and watch her die on him.
     Little Kid.  And I'm not there.  And She Dies.
     And I Live My Life.  And I'm Not Fair.
     Thirty eight years and she has cancer and
     I'm gone...I leave...I walk out, I can't
     deal with that...who am I?  Who the fuck
     do I think I am to go and do a thing?
     Shit on that and that lovely person.
     I'll go away...I'll go away...I can't
     hold this..you gotta take this fuckin'
     pen outta my hand...you fuckin' piss, cocksucker...
     .....atke this.....

Phil mimes as if he's taking a pen from Earl's hand.

          PHIL
     I got it.

CAMERA stays with PHIL.  Hold on him as Earl continues a moment.
SLOW DOLLY IN.

          EARL
     OH FUCK...THIS FUCKIN STORY HAS FALLEN APART
     and I don't even think I can...I got no
     punchline -- we had good times later,
     the best times, the love of my life,
     I thirty eight years -- but never the respect
     and the...she knew what I did...she knew...
     all the stupid things I've done but the

     Earl asked me, so I looked through
     the adress books and there was no number,
     nothing --

          FRANK
     Is Linda here?

          PHIL
     She's not here, she went out.
     I'm sorry.  This is all just so,
     I don't know what, what to do -- your
     Dad asked me to try and track you down.
     To get you and I did, I called the number --
     Do you wanna come in?

          FRANK
     Yeah let's...maybe just stand.

Dixon eats same pudding.  Worm mumbles to him, various jabs.
"...sit up straight..." "...world is hard..." "..little brat..."

HOLD.  Worm glances across the coffee shop -- he sees Stanley.

Worm HOLDS his look, thinks a moment.  He looks up at the
WOMAN behind the counter...she's doing a crossword puzzle.

Worm looks back to Dixon, subtle mumbles and gestures and
few moments later, Dixon stands from the booth and exits the
coffee shop.

HOLD w/WORM.  He sticks a finger down his throat, makes himself
well with tears.  He stands up OUT OF FRAME.

the window...

          DIXON

He looks around again, then gets in the passenger's side of the
car, shakes her same more.

Dixon reaches down and takes her PURSE, takes the MONEY out of the
WALLET and then reaches for her CEL PHONE and dials 911.

          DIXON

     I don't think I want that.

          ROSE
     It'll take the pain away.

          JIMMY
     It's not really pain.

She sets it on the coffee table.  Drinks a drink herself.

          JIMMY
     I gotta ask you for a cigarette, 'cause
     I don't wanna spend six hours tryin'
     to get it to my mouth --

     out and we do as we do, I guess...

          JIMMY
     Do you love me, Rose?

She smiles and moves closer to him.

          ROSE
     You're my handsome man.

          JIMMY
     I'm a bad person.

          ROSE
     No.  No.

          JIMMY
     No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now.
     You see?  You see I want to make
     everything clear and clean...and
     apologize for me....for all the stupid
     things I've done....that will eat me up....

          ROSE
     You feel like you want to be forgiven
     for your sins?  Honey, you're not on
     your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's
     gonna get you in trouble --

          JIMMY
     --- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just...
     listen to me...honey....
          (beat)
     ...I've done...I've cheated on you.

Rose doesn't move much.  Hold.

          JIMMY
     I've cheated on you and it kills me
     and the guilt of what I've done...I don't
     want you to think...maybe you knew,
     I think that maybe you've known...
     So I hope that I'm not saying this for
     me...for me to make myself feel better
     about what I've done...but for making
     you not feel like you're sitting there
     like a jerk...you've been the good one...
     You understand...I'm so sorry for all I've done
     wrong...and this is pathetic...what?
     "Dying man, confess the sins" something?
     Is it selfish for me to say this?  To
     say what I've done...I feel better already.
     I do...do you hate me?

Rose takes a long moment, then:

          ROSE
     ...No...I don't hate you.
          (beat)
     Do you want talk...do you really
     want to talk to me and say things
     and get things figured out, Jimmy?

          JIMMY
     Yeah.

          ROSE
     The question isn't wether or not
     you cheated on me, the question is
     how many times have you cheated on me?

          JIMMY
     Will that help?

          ROSE
     Yeah.

     DON'T GET MAD AT ME --
          (to Stanley)

     I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad
     at you and it's ok and please put it
     down and I won't be mad and I won't --

     a deal on a set of dentures, you're
     interested in that.  He's in training,

     he's real good at corrective oral

     ...alot of people think this is just
     a job that you go to.....take a lunch

     about it....and what most people don't
     see:  Just How Hard It Is To Do The Right Thing.
          (beat)
     People think if I make a judgment call
     that it's a judgment on them...but
     that's not what I do and that's not
     what should be done...I have to take
     everything and play it as it lays.
     Sometimes people need a little help.
     Sometimes people need to be forgiven
     and sometimes they need to go to jail.
     And that's a very tricky thing on my
     part...making that call...the law is the
     law and heck if I'm gonna break it...but
     you can forgive someone....?  Well, that's
     the tough part....What Do We Forgive?
     Tough part of the job.....tough part of
     walking down the street...

CAMERA stays with him and HOLDS as he puts the car into gear
and drives away....HOLD with him as he drives...he starts to
cry a little bit to himself.

enter her bedroom....a FIGURE from the back enters FRAME and walks
in and sits on the edge of the bed....from the back it is clear
that it's Jim Kurring. She tears a bit and looks at him...HOLD....

She turns her eyes from him and looks INTO THE CAMERA and smiles.
