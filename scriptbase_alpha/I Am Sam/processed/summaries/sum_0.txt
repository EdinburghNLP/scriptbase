Sam Dawson has the mental capacity of a 7-year-old.
He works at a Starbucks and is obsessed with the Beatles.
He has a daughter with a homeless woman; she abandons them as soon as they leave the hospital.
He names his daughter Lucy Diamond (after the Beatles song), and raises her.
But as she reaches age 7 herself, Sam's limitations start to become a problem at school; she's intentionally holding back to avoid looking smarter than him.
The authorities take her away, and Sam shames high-priced lawyer Rita Harrison into taking his case pro bono.
In the process, he teaches her a great deal about love, and whether it's really all you need.
