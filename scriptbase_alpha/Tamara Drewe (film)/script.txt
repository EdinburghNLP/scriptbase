          1 SUMMER. POSY DRAWING 1

                         

          2 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 2

           Andy Cobb, early thirties, is digging an English garden in
           the hot sun. He is lean, naked to the waist. It's hard to
           tell which century he inhabits. Only when he stops to drink
           from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time.

           TESS (V.O.)
           And love slipped the bonds of
           restraint...
           At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties,
           funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring
           at Andy.

           TESS (V.O.)(CONT'D)
           His touch was like a cosmic `yes'.
           Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a
           bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad,
           writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work.

           EUSTACIA (V.O.)
           `Fuck you,' screamed Kelly, `Fuck
           you to hell!' Scott stepped back
           from the cell door as the gob of
           spit flew.'

          1A INT. DAY. GLEN'S ROOM. 1A

           Sitting at a barn window is American academic Glen McCreavy ;
           a physically awkward man, more at home with his intellect
           than his body. He is surrounded by foolscap, post-it notes,
           books and markers - dominated by a poster of a dour Victorian
           - Thomas Hardy. He is writing. 

           GLEN (V.O.) 
           This complex contemporary matrix is 
           what Hardy meant by `the ache of 
           modernism.' 
           He regards it. 

                          GLEN
           Crap.
           He deletes it. He looks at his blank screen, breathing
           deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.)
           Inchcombe had seen it all before.
           He'd seasoned it: the metallic
           smell of blood and gunshot;
           forensics hunched like vultures.
           The dreadful mundanity of murder,
           he thought.



                         

                         

                         

          3 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 3

           Nicholas Hardiment writes fluidly with pencil and paper. A
           good-looking man of fifty. Dark hair, strong figure.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.)
           He approached Patel, who was
           stricken. She was one for whom a
           corpse was still an obscenity.
           Inchcombe realised a disturbing
           truth. His lack of feeling was
           almost...
           (He stops writing. Sighs)

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Pathological...

                         

          4 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE PLAYGROUND. 4

           A playground on the edge of an idyllic English village. Jody
           Long - fourteen, skinny, restless - is lying at the bottom of
           the slide gazing at the clouds. Casey Shaw, her shy, placid
           best friend, is sitting on a toddler toy, reading aloud from
           a magazine.

                          CASEY
           `I've been wearing the wrong size
           all my life,' said Katie. `I was
           always popping out. Turns out I'm a
           30GG,' she says. `Now my bras
           finally fit - though Simon prefers
           me without one.'
           Jody checks to see if her breasts have grown. She sighs.

                         

          4A INT. DAY. KITCHEN. 4A

           A woman in an upmarket apron is taking a tray of scones and
           biscuits out of the aga. It's Beth Hardiment. Once pretty,
           she's now mumsy and countrified.
           She examines her baking, satisfied with its perfection.
           Mary, the help, is doing the washing-up.

                          BETH
           Do you think I should be reminding
           them to drink enough? It's very hot
           out there...

                          MARY
           Beth - they're writers, not babies.
           You run round after `em too much.

          5 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 5

           Glen walks outside, breathing in the fresh air. Beth
           approaches with her tray of scones and biscuits.

                          BETH
           Can I tempt you, Glen?

                          GLEN
           Wow, thanks.
           Glen picks up a scone.

                          BETH
           I often take something snacky down
           to Nicholas at this time of day. I
           know how the brain needs feeding.
           How are you settling in?

                          GLEN
           Great. The last writer's retreat I
           stayed at kind of froze my balls off,
           you know?

                          BETH
           Oh.

                          GLEN
           Screeching firedoors, curried
           lasagne and a needy poet - from whom
           I still bear the scars.

                          BETH
           We try to keep it peaceful here;
           far from the madding crowd.

                          GLEN
           Well, it's paradise.

                         

          6 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - VILLAGE STREET. TRIANGLE. 6

           The blight on this rural paradise is a vandalised bus shelter
           near the only T-junction in the village. A twee shop, hanging
           baskets and Grade II listed buildings make up the view. It's
           shatteringly dull.
           Casey and Jody walk up towards the bus shelter. Their boredom
           is epic.

           An open-topped BMW goes past and halts briefly by the
           junction. The tones of Classic FM blare out, much to the
           enjoyment of the middle aged couple within.

                          CASEY
           Frock horrors. This weeks top of
           the shocks goes to Katie Pound in
           an off the shoulder lime by
           Roberto.

                          JODY
           She looks like a bug.
           (Car hoots) Wankers!

                          CASEY
           You wanna sack your stylist girl.

                          JODY
           Bet they did that on purpose,
           dressed her up like an insect.
           Casey agrees. They zoom away.

                         

          7 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS. 7

           Glen lowers himself into a comfy garden chair, his mouth full
           of cream and jam. Behind him, Nicholas' shed.

                          GLEN
           Perfect harmony.

                         

          8 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 8

           Nicholas is panicking down the phone.

                          NICHOLAS
           In Ewedown? Nadia, what the ffff
           are you doing there? I haven't told
           her yet.

          8A EXT. EWEDOWN. THE STREET NEAR THE BUS STOP. 8A

           Nadia is walking up the road from the station in her high
           heels, carrying an overnight bag. She is weeping into her
           phone.

                          NADIA
           Why not? You keep saying you want
           to be with me.
           Jody and Casey are all ears.

                          NICHOLAS
           I can't tell her just like that.
           It's twenty five years; a marriage.

                          NADIA
          Come on Nicholas. Or I'm going to
          get in a taxi and find your farm.
          Come up there and -

                          NICHOLAS

                         NO -

                          NADIA
          Drag you out -

                          NICHOLAS

           NO, NO DON'T!

                          NADIA
           I want to be with you. I thought
           you'd be pleased...

                         

          8B POV. EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD / INT. DAY. NICHOLAS' SHED 8B

           Through the window Nicholas sees Beth leaving a scone by
           Diggory, a sleeping poet in a pretentious hat.

                          NICHOLAS
           Of course I'm pleased... Nadia, go
           to the pub and stay there. I'll come
           when I can.

                          NADIA
           Are you going to tell her?

                          NICHOLAS
           Just give me a couple of hours -
           He ends the call just as Beth is nearing the door - panicking
           the phone back on to its holder.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Cock pie.
           Beth opens the door to see Nicholas apparently hard at it.

                          BETH
           How's the worker?

                          NICHOLAS
           Good actually. Just about to embark
           on forensics.

                          BETH
           Well give me your pages and I'll get
           started.
           Nicholas hands her several pages.

                          NICHOLAS
           Reckon I might pack it in a bit
           early today. Need to think about my
           blood smears. Might take a drive;
           have a pint. Stir the old grey
           matter up.

                          BETH
           Who were you talking to just then?

                          NICHOLAS
           Judy. She says the Impala contracts
           should be through in a day or two.

          Beth immediately knows he is lying. The lie pains her. She
          goes to the door.

           Beth decides to try and call his bluff.

                          BETH
           I could come with you.

                          NICHOLAS
           What?

                          BETH
           For a drive. I don't know when we
           last went out.
           Buying time by biting his scone:

                          NICHOLAS
           This is absolutely yummy.

                          BETH
           We could go into Hadditon, get a
           meal.

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes but. What about the guests?

                          BETH
           Mary's got Casey to help.

                          NICHOLAS
           But I'm supposed to be thinking,
           you know about the -

                          BETH
           You can run it by me. I'm good at
           forensics.
           Nicholas has run out of excuses.

                         

          9 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 9

           Beth approaches Andy with her scones and biscuits. Nearby,
           Glen is sitting back in a sun-lounger. Diggory sleeps on.

                          BETH
           Can I tempt you, Andy?
           Andy takes a scone with a wide smile.

           That's Glen, our new academic. Turns
           out he's working on Thomas Hardy.

           Nicholas, dreading his predicament, is staring out at a cow's
           arse. The cow starts to piss. He shuts his eyes in
           desperation.

          10A I/E. DAY. TAMARA'S CAR. 10A
           Shooting from inside the car, we pass the sign "Ewedown".

                         

          11 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - HALFWAY DOWN THE STREET. 11

           The same car drives through the village. Jody and Casey
           appear from behind a wall and chuck eggs at it. They both
           land on the windscreen.

                          JODY
           Fucking bingo!
           Jody and Casey run away, laughing.

           The driver brakes, swerves and comes to a halt. Tamara Drewe
           gets out. She's twenty eight, startlingly beautiful. She
           looks around shocked, for the culprit.
           The immaculate, picturesque street is deserted. Tamara takes
           it in, with an expression of such distaste that it might as
           well be a landfill site.

                          TAMARA
           What a dump.
           As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in
           her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette.

          12 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 12

           Tamara drives up to an old farmhouse. She gets out of the car
           and stands at the gate. Air of neglect; dark windows. Tamara
           looks at the place as if it stirs memories. She doesn't move.

          14 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 14

           At the back of the house Tamara walks through an overgrown,
           neglected garden. She peers through the back door into the
           kitchen. A thin layer of dust on the surfaces; a sense of
           recent abandonment.
           Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over
           her head. Tamara startles. It completely spooks her. She
           backs away. She doesn't know what to do.

                         

          13 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 13

           Jody and Casey are slouched on the bench at the bus stop.
           Three teenage boys are doing wheelies over the T-junction.
           One of them almost lands in the shop. An old lady comes out,
           shoo-ing them away.

                          JODY
           We could walk up the garage.

                          CASEY
           I'm supposed to be helping my mum
           up at Stonefield.

                          JODY
           They keep you busy.

                          CASEY
           Yeah.

                          JODY
           You never stop, you!
           Neither of them moves. The boys are yelling. Two try to put
           the third head first into the bin outside the shop. Jody and
           Casey are not impressed.

           The writers are sitting round a table lit with tea-lights in
           jars. Casey is helping her mum, Mary, an efficient local
           woman in her late thirties. She wobbles the heavy serving
           dishes dangerously.

           At an upstairs window we can see Beth hold a dress up to
           herself and then abandon the idea.

           Beth is looking at herself in a cheval mirror. She's full of
           hope that Nicholas will take her out - and dread that he'll
           find some excuse.

           The door to the garden is open, letting in the eveing air.
           Nicholas is waiting for Beth by the mirror. He is full of
           unease - but can't help finding himself handsome. His phone
           bleeps; a text. He reads it anxiously.

                          NICHOLAS

                          (CALLING)
           Beth, why don't I just pop out on
           my own?
           Beth, determined to force things, comes downstairs.

                          BETH
           But I'm ready. Come on.
           She's on her way to join him.

                          NICHOLAS
           Is that - I mean - are you wearing
           that?

                          BETH
           Oh.

                          NICHOLAS
           Just looks a bit... hot.
           Now Beth knows she is right. She takes her jacket off,
           gutted.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           You know, Haddition's always packed
           with pissed Londonites on a Friday. I
           doubt we'll get a table anyway. Let's
           do it properly next week; make an

           kick me really, but -
           He's about to leave. Beth speaks calmly.

                          BETH
           Who is she?
           The question hangs in the air. Nicholas' smile is frozen.

                          NICHOLAS
           What?
           For a moment, he tries to find a lie.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Oh come on, Beth.

                          BETH

           Look, it's nothing. It's been once
           or twice, that's all. Beth, it's
           not anything.
           Beth is raw with pain.

                          BETH
           (her voice raised)
           Who is she?!

           Just a researcher with Radio 4.

                          BETH
           What's her name?

                          NICHOLAS
           Nadia, Nadia Patel.
           This hits a nerve.

                          BETH
           Patel? She's in your book.

                          NICHOLAS
           No, no I met her when I was on
           Desert Island Discs.

                          BETH
           You put her in your book!

                          NICHOLAS
           Just the name.

                          BETH
           And Desert Island Discs was a year
           ago.

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes but -

           Shhh!...
           Beth's pained voice drifts out of the house.

           BETH (O.S.)

           A thrilled intake of breath goes round the table. The writers
           (with the exception of Glen, who is mortified) are poised
           like scavengers, waiting for more.

           Casey gawps, fascinated.
           Nicholas is following Beth outside. Her agony travels through
           the quiet evening air. The writers are open-mouthed.

                          NICHOLAS
           Calm yourself down!

           BETH (O.S.)

           Is she young?

           For heaven's sake.

                          BETH

           IS SHE?

                          NICHOLAS

           YES!
           The guests are hanging on every word. Beth retreats back into
           the house.

           BETH (O.S.)
           If you leave here tonight to be with
           her... Don't come back.

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth...
           For a moment, she hopes he'll apologise.

                          NICHOLAS
           You're making fools of us both.
           Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the
           door and hurls it, roots and all. It's a direct hit.

                          BETH
           Liar.
           Glen cringes. Beth slams the door.
           Nicholas wipes soil off his glasses; brushes it off his
           shirt. He realises with a sinking heart that he must pass the
           writers to get to his car.

           She even came up with the name Dr

           of her daughter and Nicholas. She is in shock.

                         

          20D EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO). 20D 

           Glen is mortified. 

                          GLEN 
           At the end of the day, this is why 
           I'm glad to be single. 

                         

          20E INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 20E

           Beth is going through agonies of self-criticism.

           BETH (V.O.)
           Nadia Patel. Gazelle eyes. Tantric
           sex.
           We see her thoughts: An exotic clinch. Nicholas in thrall to
           Nadia's confident passion.

                          BETH

                          (TO CAMERA)
           Why would he choose me?!

                         

          20F EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO). 20F 

           The gossip flutters round the table. 

                          TESS 
           Will she take him back, that's the 
           question.

          He's far too up himself. 

                          TESS 
          What about the farm though? 
          Splitting up all this? Must be 
          worth a fortune. I think she's 
          very rash, making him choose...

          22 EXT. NIGHT. EWEDOWN - OUTSIDE THE PUB. 22

           Nicholas is walking Nadia to his car. 

                          NADIA
           Thought you weren't going to come.

                          NICHOLAS
           I was busy. Rowing with my wife.

                          NADIA
           Where are we going?

                          NICHOLAS
           Home.

                          NADIA
           To your farm?
           A look of frustration crosses his face. He turns to her. 

                          NICHOLAS
           We could have gone on just as we
           were.

                          NADIA
           But you said you wanted to be with
           me...

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes. In London. Now and then.
           Nadia looks at him. The scales are beginning to fall. They
           get in the car. As they drive away, Tamara's car pulls up. 
           She gets out of the car and takes in the pub before entering. 

                         

          23 INT. NIGHT. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 23

           Tamara enters. Zoe, a buxom Australian, is behind the bar.

           Big glass of rioja please. And I

                          ZOE
           Sure, how many nights?

                          TAMARA
           Don't know. Just one.
          Zoe pours the wine. She's disarmingly friendly. 

                          ZOE
           You here on business?

                          TAMARA
           No. Business of a kind.

                          ZOE
           I don't mean to pry; I'm just
           really nosey.

                          TAMARA
           I'm from here. Sort of.

                          ZOE
           Nice place.
          Tamara smiles her disagreement.

                          ZOE (CONT'D)
           I keep meaning to leave but... Hard
           to get away.

                          TAMARA
           My mum's house is just up the road.

                          ZOE
           You're not staying with her?

                          TAMARA
           She's. She died.
          Zoe finishes pouring the wine.

                          ZOE
           Have that on me. And here's your
           key. Up the stairs, right in front.
           You can't miss it.
          Tamara utters her thanks, surprised at Zoe's kindness. She
          takes her drink and the key upstairs. Zoe remains, grinning.
          We see why.
          Andy Cobb has just walked in. Zoe pulls him a pint.

                          ZOE (CONT'D)

           Marriage. Remind me never to try it.

           Andy, you're just a sex object. No

           He grins back at her.

                         

          24 INT. NIGHT. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. TAMARA'S BATHROOM 24

           Tamara is in a deep bubble bath. She glances at herself in
           the mirror, scrutinising her beauty. She fingers her nose.
           Slowly a look of doubt steals over her - as if she's not
           quite comfortable in her own skin.

                         

          25 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 25

           Glen is eating his breakfast looking at all the Hardiment's
           family memorabilia in the kitchen. Andy is eating toast. 

                          GLEN
           So the Hardiments have lived here
           centuries, huh?

                          ANDY
           No, `bout twenty years. Still
           strangers by local standards.
           Beth comes in, tense, anxious and haggard.

                          BETH
           Andy, come and look at Ingrid. I
           think she's coming into heat.
           She goes out.

                          GLEN
           She's a nice lady.

                          ANDY
           Yeah, I owe her a lot.

           We'd say prick here actually. Or 
           wanker. 

                          GLEN 
           That's good. We might even call him 
           a Fuck.

                          ANDY
           That's good too.

                         

          26 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE CHICKEN RUN. 26

           Andy approaches Beth. She is cleaning out the hen coop with
           all the frenetic energy of an abandoned wife.

                          BETH
           This is going rotten underneath.

                          ANDY
           Shall we look at Ingrid?

                          BETH
           It's falling apart.

                          ANDY
           I can do that. Beth...
           Andy takes the shovel. Beth bites back tears.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           He won't last five minutes.
           Beth looks down embarrassed by (but grateful for) his
           support.

                         

          26A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 26A

           Glen wanders into Beth's office. The wall in front of him is 
           dominated by a framed newspaper profile of Nicholas, 
           surrounded by framed covers of Inchcombe books. The whole 
           room is a shrine to Nicholas' career. 
           Glen is in the hall looking at Beth's prints and pictures; 
           old maps, wildlife and framed letters from grateful writers 
           who have stayed at the retreat. He stares at a print of farm 
           workers in the nineteenth century. Glen sighs. 

           GLEN (V.O.)
           I know why I'm drawn to Thomas 
           Hardy. He writes about failure 
           better than anyone else. I need 
           this book to go well. I need a tiny 
           reward for my endeavours... 
           His stomach gurgles ominously.

          28 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE HALL/DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 28

           Glen walks down the corridor by the kitchen, to the
           downstairs cloakroom; a marvellous Victorian toilet of
           reassuring size. He shuts the door in relief.

                         

          29 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE HALL/DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM. 29

           Glen is on the loo. Even in this small room there are framed
           photographs of Nicholas receiving awards. He looks at them in
           wonder.

           NICHOLAS (O.S.)
           If that's the way you feel...
           Nadia, I'm devastated.
           Through the frosted window Glen sees Nicholas.

           NICHOLAS (O.S.)
           But if that's your decision, I'll
           have to learn to live with it.
           Beth comes in from the garden. Glen sees Nicholas quickly end
           the call. For Beth's benefit:

                          NICHOLAS
           (Into his phone)
           I told you. I love my wife. Don't
           ever phone me again.
           Glen is shocked by this duplicity.

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth...

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           No don't touch me, don't you dare.
           Glen panics, realising their reunion is going to be right by
           the door. He puts his hand on the flush, hoping to warn them
           - too late.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'm sorry.

                          BETH
           Not good enough. Not any more.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'm sorry.

                          BETH
           You do what you like and then you're
           sorry?

           NICHOLAS (O.S.)
           I hate myself. I hate myself.
          Glen opens the door a chink. They are feet away from him.
          Nicholas looks unshaven, shagged and guilty.

                          BETH
           Where were you?

                          NICHOLAS
           Drove her back to London. Took all
           night.

                          BETH
           You drove her home?

                          NICHOLAS
           She was in a state.

                          BETH
           Do you think she'll get over it?...
           Nicholas shrugs. To Glen's horror, he starts to cry.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'm sorry.
           Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms,
           holding each other.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           I don't know why I'm like this. I
           couldn't do without you.
           Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He
           opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks
           again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on
           the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again.
           Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating.
           He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas
           releases Beth. She wipes her eyes.

                          BETH
           I've got to go to the bottle bank.

                          NICHOLAS
           OK... Let's talk later.

                          BETH
           Yes. The goat's come into heat.

                          NICHOLAS
           Has it?

                          BETH
           I love you so much.

                          NICHOLAS
           Me too.
           Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange.
           He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas'
           lies.

           Glen flops into a sun-lounger near Diggory.

                          GLEN
           I've just seen the Hardiments kiss
           and make up.

           Looks like she's taking him back.

                          DIGGORY
           When the hat is on, it means don't

           So... Peace is restored.
           The sound of a burglar alarm suddenly blares over the garden.
           Diggory sits up, infuriated.

                         

          32 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LIMBURY). 32

           Glen is following Andy down the hill from Stonefield. The
           cows are too close for Glen's comfort. He hurries through.

                          GLEN
           I don't like cows. I mean really.
           They exude bovine malice.

           Yeah, these girls are killing

           Very funny.

                         

          32A EXT. DAY. FIELD AND COPSE. (LARKHAM) 32A

           Glen and Andy are in the valley between the two farms.

                          ANDY
           It's Winnards Farm. Lady there died
           a while back. Place is empty.

                          GLEN
           You think it's being robbed?

                          ANDY
           Prob'ly just kids. Nothing to do
           round here except make trouble.

                          GLEN
           What if it's bad guys? Don't you
           have a blunderbuss or a fowling
           piece or something?
           They climb up through a copse.

                          CUT TO:

          32B EXT. DAY. FIELDS (WINNARDS). 32B

           Glen and Andy are going up the hill towards Winnards.

                          ANDY
           Used to belong to my dad, this
           place.

                          GLEN
           Really?

                          ANDY
           But it all went tits-up. Land was
           flogged to a consortium and the house
           was sold to Londoners; the Drewes.

                          GLEN
           So this is your ancestral pile?

                          ANDY
           Was. Born in that room up there.
           He points up at the back bedroom window.

                          GLEN
           You must have been pretty resentful.

                         

          33 1995. EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE LANE. 33

           An eighteen year old Andy jumps off a stile into the lane
           behind a slim, fifteen year old girl on a horse.

                          ANDY
           Hey.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 21A.

                         

                         
          The girl turns. She has a huge nose.

                          ANDY
           This farm's mine, big nose.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 22.

                         

                         
           The girl kicks the horse into a trot, her nose in the air.

                         

          34 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 34

           Andy and Glen turn the corner to the back of the house.
           Tamara is up a ladder wielding a hammer at the alarm box.

                          ANDY
           Hey, what're you doing?
           Tamara gives the alarm box a great whack.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           Who are you??

                          TAMARA
           Andy, you moron; it's me.
           Andy looks more closely. A disturbing spark of recognition.

                          ANDY
           Tam?... Hardly recognise you. 
           Another whack. The noise becomes a high-pitched squeal.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           You won't do it that way.

                          TAMARA
           Then help me!

                         

          35 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 35

           Andy turns the alarm off. Tamara enters the dusty kitchen.

                          ANDY
           Used to do bits of work for your mum.
           Been keeping an eye on the place
           since she died.

                          TAMARA
           What sort of work, graphics?

                          ANDY
           I do horticulture now.

                          TAMARA
           You're a gardener?
           Andy says nothing. He stares at her nose. Glen has come in.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 23.

                         

                         

                          GLEN
           This is a great old house.

                          TAMARA
           Would you like to buy it?

                          GLEN
           I'm not really the property-owning
           kind. Prefer my life to fit into hand 
           luggage. 

                          ANDY
           That's why you're back, to flog it?

                          TAMARA
           Yes.

                          ANDY
           Make a nice second home for some
           banker wankers.

                          TAMARA
           Andy if you want it, why don't you
           make me an offer?

                          ANDY
           Because sadly I'm still prey to the 
           economic forces that threw the
           peasant classes off the land.

                          TAMARA
           Unlucky.
           Tamara opens a cupboard. It's full of empty wine bottles. 

                          ANDY
           Tam.
           Their eyes meet.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           What the fuck have you done to
           yourself?
           Tamara's face falls.

                         

          36 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 36

           Glen and Andy are walking back. Andy is brooding.

                          ANDY 
           She's completely different. 

                          GLEN 
           How was she before? What's the 
           story?... 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 24.

                         

                         

                          ANDY 
           There isn't one. 

                          GLEN 
           Come on. 

                          ANDY 
           Was nothing. Decade ago. Just a 
           teenage thing. 

                         

          37 1996. INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - A SHED. 37 

           Tamara pulling down her pants; Andy unbuttoning his jeans.
           She jumps up on the worktable, pushing a stack of turnips out
           of the way. They kiss passionately.

                          ANDY
           You should find someone you're in
           love with.

                          TAMARA
           You stupid prick.
           Andy looks at her. She is sincere.

                          ANDY
           You saying you love me, frosty tits?

                          TAMARA
           You first.

                          ANDY
           You say it; You're the girl.

                          TAMARA
           Fuck off.
           She kisses him. As they start to make love:

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I love you. Fuck off. I love you. 

                         

          37A EXT. DAY. A FIELD. 37A 

           Glen looks over at Andy, interrupting his thoughts. 

                          GLEN 
           Romeo and Juliet, huh? 
           Andy carries on down the hill, shaking his head. 

                         

          38 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 38 

           Tamara is watching Andy walk away with Glen. Her eyes follow 
           him curiously - then she firmly turns her back. 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 24A.

                         

                         
           Tamara rips a bin liner off the roll and shakes it out.
           She takes a deep breath. She opens the cupboard and begins to
           bin the distressing mountain of empty wine bottles. 

                         

          39 EXT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 39

           Beth is standing at the hedge looking down at the valley with
           Nicholas at her side.

                          BETH
           Thinking of the first time we saw
           this place...

                          NICHOLAS
           You've made it a wonderful home
           Beth.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 25.

                         

                         

                          BETH
           Not wonderful enough.
           She starts to walk away. Nicholas holds her back.

                          NICHOLAS
           If you can't put this behind you,
           then we're stuck.

                          BETH
           Well I'd better sort myself out then. 

                          NICHOLAS
           What has to happen? I am sorry -
           Beth brings her arm up to push him away. Nicholas catches it;
           draws her to him. He kisses her insistently. Beth's
           resistance diminishes. Soon it has gone. We begin to see the
           depth of Beth's physical love for him.
           At that moment, Glen walks round the corner. He tries to
           backtrack, mortified by his intrusion on their passion. Too
           late. They part. Nicholas turns away in frustration.

                          GLEN
           Just taking the air.
           Flustered, he knocks into a tub of lobelias. Beth and
           Nicholas remain. The moment between them is gone. Round the
           corner, Glen is cringing.

           Jody and Casey are reading a celebrity magazine.

                          JODY
           Would you do him?

                          CASEY
           No.

                          JODY
           What about him?

                          CASEY
           He's gay, you dobbin.

                          JODY
           So?
           They turn to a big spread on a band called Swipe.

                          CASEY
           Swipe.

                          JODY
           Ben Sergeant...
           I'd walk through fire to do him.

                          CASEY
           The drummer?

                          JODY
           He's not just the drummer. He writes
           the lyrics; it's his band. He's the
           fucking genius, not Steve Culley or
           any of these wankers. It's Ben.

                          CASEY
           OK. I'd do Ben.

                          JODY
           I wanna be her, in that dress with
           him licking my teapot lids.

                          CASEY
           Yeah... me too.

                         

          42 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 42

           Casey is still carrying this image as she serves a tray of
           nibbles on the patio. She stands among the writers, watching 
           a fly get caught in one of the vol-au-vents.

                          DIGGORY 
           People talk about the muscularity in 
           prose. I want a similar muscularity 
           in my verse. I don't want a poetry 
           that's flabby or obese - that's why I 
           adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes: 
           Diggory picks the vol-au-vent up and without looking, puts it 
           in his mouth. Casey moves over to Nicholas and Glen.

           So has the muse shone on you, Greg?

                          GLEN
           I've been pretty distracted. Most
           recently by those delicious cookie
           things that Beth brought round this
           afternoon.

                          NICHOLAS
           Oh yes. Of course we call them

                          GLEN
          And by the place itself, the people.

                          NICHOLAS
          Sometimes wish I could get
          distracted. Ten page a day man,
          rain or shine.

                          GLEN
           Wow, that's scary. Ten pages; how 
           do you do that?

                          NICHOLAS
           Well, Greg -

                          GLEN

                          GLEN -

                          NICHOLAS
           I wouldn't presume to give an
           academic tips.

                          GLEN
           Matter of fact I read one of your
           books. Another distraction but I
           thought it was decent stuff.

                          NICHOLAS
           Well.
          He's offended.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           How do I do it? I just get on with
           it, Greg.
          Nicholas walks away leaving Glen smarting. The female writers
          surround Nicholas. He tops them up, full of charm. Under his
          breath, Glen impersonates:

                          GLEN
           `We call them biscuits, here.'
          Nicholas raises his glass for a toast.

                          NICHOLAS
           To the muse, however you find her.
          He is looking at Beth. She is gratified. Then his eye shifts,
          his glass still in the air.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Who's that?
          Tamara Drewe is climbing the stile at the bottom of the
          garden in a low cut T-shirt, tiny pair of denim shorts and
          bare feet. The evening light bathes her in a golden sheen.

           No it isn't.

                          GLEN
           I met her with Andy.

                          NICHOLAS
           Good God. What's happened to her?

           She's had a nose job, Dad.

                          NICHOLAS
           She's completely different.

                          GLEN
           That's what Andy said.

                          BETH
           Poor Tamara. Such a sad girl. She
           used to come and help you wash the
           car, didn't she Nicholas? I think
           she liked a bit of family after her
           dad left.

                          TESS
           Is that Tamara Drewe who writes the
           column in one of the Sundays?

                          BETH
           Used to. Writes for the Independent
           now.

                          TESS
           She spent weeks going on about her
           nose job. Smart way to pay for it I
           suppose. Was her old one an awful
           conk?

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes.

                          BETH
           She's poured herself into those
           shorts. I hope they don't give her
           thrush.

                          TESS
           What's the etiquette with nose
           jobs? Do we mention it, or...
          Tamara has arrived in earshot. Absolutely everyone, including
          a very curious Casey, is staring at her nose.

                          TAMARA
           Hello. Sorry to intrude.
          Her hand defensively brushes her nose. Poppy walks towards
          her, full of warmth.

                          POPPY
           Hey, Tamara.

                          TAMARA
           Poppy, how are you?

                          POPPY
           Love your new hooter.

                          TAMARA
           Thanks. It isn't actually new; just
           smaller...

           At last Beth remembers her manners.

                          BETH
           Tamara, so sorry about your mum.

                          TAMARA
           Thank you...

                          BETH
           Are you staying down for a while?

                          TAMARA
           I'll have to. There's so much to be
           done.

                          BETH
           You must let us know if we can help.

                          TAMARA
           Actually, I was going to ask if you
           could spare a pair of strong arms.
           I've got a skip coming tomorrow and -

                          BETH
           Nicholas? -
           Nicholas is opening another bottle of prosecco. It pops its
           cork over his trousers. He mutters a swear word.

                          GLEN
           I'm available. I do skips.

                          DIGGORY
           I... No.

                          TAMARA
           Well thank you. You're very kind...
           Is Andy around at all?
           Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers.

                          BETH
           Oh, I can't spare Andy. He's making
           a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons.

                         

          43 EXT. NEXT DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 43

           Tamara and Glen are carrying junk out to a skip. Tamara is in
           big boots and a slightly more practical pair of shorts.

          44 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 44

           Beth is preparing lunch, talking to Poppy. Nicholas is going 
           through his typed-up manuscript; not really listening.

                          BETH
           She's had the writers down there 
           helping her all day. I hope she 
           realises they're here to work... 

                          POPPY
           Can't believe what a difference 
           her nose makes. 

                          BETH
           Well I think it's a mistake; taken
           away all her character.

                          POPPY
           Come on; she looks ten times
           better.

                          NICHOLAS
           Huh. 

                          BETH
           And she knows it. I found those
           shorts really irritating. Going
           around with half her bum hanging
           out. I mean, why?

                          POPPY 
           To annoy people like you. Might get a
           pair myself.

                          NICHOLAS
           Of course you won't.

                          POPPY
           Why not?

                          NICHOLAS
           Because you're not desperate, are
           you? Always something a bit
           desperate about Tamara Drewe.
           Beth looks at him puzzled as he works on.

                         

          45 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 45

           Tamara and Glen are having a rest.

                          GLEN
           So why did you change your face?

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 30A.

                         

                         

                          TAMARA 
          Changing my face is the best thing I
          ever did. And I don't care what 
          anyone thinks. 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31.

                         

                         

                          GLEN
           Would it work for me? 

                          TAMARA
           Maybe; if you did the wrinkles too.

                          GLEN
           Oh, you're just coming on to me...
           Tamara laughs. She starts work again.

                          GLEN
           In your column, you write about 
           yourself... Does that come easily? 

                          TAMARA
           No... But it feels right. My first 
           novel's definitely going to be
           autobiographical.

                          GLEN
           Your first novel? You're going to
           dash one off just like that?

                          TAMARA
           Ideally, I'd like to make it into 
           fiction before I'm thirty.

                          GLEN
           And then maybe a swimwear collection,
           a chat show, a pasta sauce range?

                          TAMARA
           What? 

                          GLEN
           Life sure is easy for the beautiful.

                          TAMARA 
           You know before I got the nose job 
           I had no trouble getting taken 
           seriously. Maybe, when they removed 
           that bit of cartilage, they pulled 
           my brain out by mistake - what do 
           you think? 
           Glen smiles, won over. 

                         

          46 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 46

           Glen is coming from the bar with a pint for Andy and a half
           for himself. He has just been served by Zoe.

                          GLEN
           She's single, man.
           Andy looks over at Zoe.

                          ANDY
          Well it's not exactly a
          relationship; we just have an
          occasional thing. Zoe doesn't want
          to be tied down and -

                          GLEN
          Not Zoe! Tamara... You should get
          in there. Marry the girl. Then you
          get to live back in your ancestral
          home.

                          ANDY
          No way. Not her type.

                          GLEN
          The trouble is Andy, you think like
          a loser. And I know that because
          I'm the loser that losers turn to
          for tips. I'm the losers loser.

                          ANDY
           I'm a pedigree loser. I had a
           graphics business; went bust. And
           then with my great business acumen
           I invested in a polytunnel full of
           ganja.

                          GLEN
           Wow. How'd that go?

                          ANDY
           Made a tit of myself. Spent about
           six years stoned out of my box and
           I'm only just getting it back
           together. Besides, even if I was
           the last man in the world, Tamara
           Drewe wouldn't have me.

                          GLEN
           Why not?

                          ANDY
           I dumped her.

                          GLEN
           Oh, you are a loser.

                          ANDY
           I was twenty. My mates thought I
           was cradle snatching... And they
           used to call her Beaky.

                         

          47 1996. EXT. DAY. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 47

           Tamara in her school uniform, is gutted.

                          TAMARA
           Beaky?...
           We see her stricken face as she turns away. Then she turns
           back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood.

                         

          48 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 48

           Glen is preparing to leave.

                          GLEN
           You told her the truth... The time
           might come when she respects that.
           Andy, as your love guru, I suggest
           you ask Tamara for a date. But take a
           shower first, OK?

          49 EXT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 49

           Tamara is in her shorts and boots, chucking empty bottles and
           old saucepans into the skip, like an Amazon.

                         

          50 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 50

           Nicholas is at the hedge, looking down the valley towards
           Winnards Farm. He is watching Tamara like a hawk - as if he
           can't quite believe what he is seeing.

                         

          51 1996. EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 51 

           Nicholas and Tamara are polishing Nicholas' car. 

                          TAMARA 
           Boys know nothing. 
           Nicholas looks up at her, smiles indulgently. Tamara stops 
           work. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           I've been reading `Inchcombe's 
           Dose.' 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Have you? 

                          TAMARA 
           The bit where Doctor Inchcombe 
           finds himself having thoughts about 
           the dead guy's daughter. 
           Tamara walks around the car, bringing her polishing cloth 
           closer to his. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           You describe her light smattering 
           of freckles and her striking 
           profile. So... 
           She turns her head. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           Who did you base her on? 

                          NICHOLAS 
           What? 

                          TAMARA 
           Have you noticed me? 
           Nicholas looks at her in surprise. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           Because I've noticed you... 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33A.

                         

                         
          She waits, hoping for a kiss, a hug, anything. She puts out a 
          hand - almost touches him. He steps back. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Think it's time you went. 
          Tamara is mortified. 

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D) 
           You're making yourself ridiculous. 
          This really hurts. Tamara takes the bucket of soapy water and 
          throws it over the car - and Nicholas. 

                          TAMARA 
           Nicholarse. 

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)

          52 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 52

           Nicholas is still staring at Tamara, who is jumping on the
           stuff in the skip. Glen is strolling up the hill from the
           pub. He follows Nicholas' gaze.

                          GLEN
           A man can dream, huh?
           Nicholas looks at him affronted - as if he doesn't know what
           he's talking about.

                         

          53 INT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 53

           Tamara, hot and dirty, runs up the stairs with her roll of
           bin liners. She opens the door to her mother's bedroom.
           She is completely unprepared for it. A neat, womanly room
           covered in photographs of Tamara as a child, teen and young
           woman. On the dressing table is a lipstick; the lid lying
           next to it as if it has just been used. Tamara picks it up.
           She sits, suddenly exhausted. For the first time, she looks
           lost.

                         

          54 EXT. DAY. ANOTHER FARM - THE GOAT PEN. 54

           Tamara still looks slightly shaken as she walks up to Andy.
           He is watching Ingrid meet Darcy, a billy goat.

                          ANDY
           Go on Ingrid; have some kids.

                          TAMARA
           Pretty direct isn't he? He's not
           even bought her a coke.
           Andy turns. Sees her.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           And he stinks.

                          ANDY
           She doesn't mind; it's like Lynx to
           her. If she's ready she'll stand for
           him, if not she won't.

                          TAMARA
           That's disturbing human.

                          ANDY
           Refreshing basic.
           Darcy is up and at it.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           Thought you'd have gone back to
           London by now.

                          TAMARA
           I wish. Looks like I'm stuck here for
           a while. Actually, I've got a
           proposition for you.
          Andy glances at the goats; bad idea.

                          ANDY
           We should go for a drink
           sometime, Tam. You know, for old
           times sake.

                          TAMARA
           So we can reminisce about how I
           smashed your nose?

                          ANDY
           You didn't smash it.

                          TAMARA
           Yes I did.

                          ANDY
           It just bled.
          The memory is between them.

                          TAMARA
           I've got to do the house up before I
           sell it. It looks like an eighties
           timewarp. Would you like the job?
          He just looks at her.

                          TAMARA
           Painting it and tidying the garden?
           Good hourly rate.

                          ANDY
           It can't be easy down there, Tam.

                          TAMARA
           What d'you mean?

                          ANDY
           All the memories and stuff. Your
           mum...

                          TAMARA
           I'm fine.

          Is it that you want someone around?
          Like when you look up I'd be there
          too?

           Jesus Christ, the goats are giving

                          YOU IDEAS

                          ANDY
           OK it's bollocks -

                          TAMARA
           That's very sweet of you Andy -

                          ANDY
           Of course you wouldn't want to
           fraternise with your gardener.

                          TAMARA
           So... is that a yes?
           Andy doesn't reply.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Come on, goat whisperer - I thought
           I'd be doing you a favour. I thought
           you needed the work.
           It's all over with Ingrid and Darcy.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           She's had a shit time but she'll
           still call him. He'll lose her
           number. He won't ring her back...
           Andy's face cracks into a smile. He is won over.

                         

          54A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. GLEN'S ROOM. 54A 

           Glen types a sentence. He reads it. He deletes. He stares at 
           the blank page. It stares back at him. 

                          GLEN 
           No. 
           He stands. He paces. He sits. 

                          GLEN 
           Just write, you numbskull. You 
           moron, you dumb fuck - write! 

                         

          55 EXT./INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - BETH'S OFFICE. 55

           Glen is passing Beth's office. She's working through a stack
           of fan mail. She smiles when she sees him.

                          BETH
           How's Thomas Hardy?
           Glen unburdens himself.

                          GLEN
           I'm wasting my sabbatical.

                          BETH
           Oh dear.

                          GLEN
           I've been working on this book
           forever; why can't I finish it? I'm
           two years past my delivery date and
           Fantail could ask for their
           chickenshit advance back. I can't
           write. I'm fucking constipated.
           It's a disaster.

           I do a couple of sessions a week,
           to keep on top of it. Pretty good
           at forging Nick's signature.
           Glen looks awed - and defeated.

                          BETH 
           Would you like me to read it? 

                          GLEN 
           You'd do that? 

                          BETH 
           Be glad to. If you think it would 
           help. 
           Beth suddenly sees Andy out of the window. He's leaving.

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Sorry Glen. Just need Andy -

                          GLEN
           Barging in on you; What an idiot.

           Beth catches up with Andy.

                          BETH
           If you're going into Hadditon -
           we're really low on chicken feed.

                          ANDY
           I'll get it tomorrow. I'm on my way
           down to Winnards. Doing one or two
           jobs for Tamara.

                          BETH
           She's got you helping her too?

                          ANDY
           Just painting, decorating, sorting
           the garden.
           Beth is quite put out.

                          BETH
           Andy, that sounds like a lot. I
           need you here.

                          ANDY
           I can easily do both.

                          BETH
           As long as you're not working for
           her in the hours that I pay you.
          Without thinking, she has made Andy feel like a servant.

                          ANDY
           Sure, Beth. I won't rip you off.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 38.

                         

                         
           He walks on, leaving Beth feeling very uncomfortable - and
           somehow slightly bereft.

                         

          57 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GROUNDS / KITCHEN. 57

           Andy comes in. He shouts into the house.

                          ANDY
           Tam? Got some colour charts for you
           to see.
           He sets out all the colours charts and plans he has been 
           working on. Tamara appears. She is dressed to kill. 

                          TAMARA 
           What would you choose for in here? 

                          ANDY 
           Well... I'd have this one. And then 
           upstairs in the bedroom - 

                          TAMARA 

           OK. 
           She starts gathering her things. 

                          ANDY 
           So what d'you have to do to get a
           cup of tea round here?

                          TAMARA
           Make it.

                          (SHE POINTS)
           Tea bags. Sugar. Fridge.

                          (SHE GRINS)
           I'm off to work.
           Andy stares. Suddenly Tamara is no longer just a blast from
           the past. He sees a future - a future that he wants. He
           slowly smiles back - but she's already striding away.

                         

          58 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE PERIMETER FENCE. 58

           Pounding rock music, slightly distorted by distance. Jody and
           Casey are trying to get in over the boundary fence. A
           security guard is already running towards them.

                          JODY
           This is our village. Our fucking
           field.

                          JODY

           COME ON YOU BASTARD LET US IN!
           Jody is ready for a fight but Casey pulls her back.

          59 CUT. 59

                         

          60 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS 60

           Beth is tending to Ingrid - making sure she's not scared by
           the noise. Ingrid looks as if she couldn't give a damn. Over
           by the barn she sees Glen, unaware that he's being watched,
           breaking out of a mournful walk to groove to the music. She
           smiles.
           At the other end of the farm, Nicholas is staring over the
           hedge with tissue paper ear-plugs. He pretends his arm is a
           rifle, like a little boy. He aims at the cows. He fires.

                         

          61 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE MAIN STAGE. 61

           Swipe are playing; bit like The Libertines in their prime.
           There is one girl in the band, bass guitarist Fran Redford.
           The drummer, Ben Sergeant, is also vocals. The lead singer,
           Steve Culley, is mixed-race; confident and charismatic.
           He is getting very up-close and personal with Fran. Ben is
           getting more and more furious.
           In the wings, we see Tamara talking to a publicist, trying to
           make herself heard above the roar of the music. She is
           pointing at Steve and Fran. The publicist nods.
           Suddenly Ben leaps up and takes hold of Steve, pulling him
           away from Fran. There is a scuffle, Fran trying to separate
           the boys. Ben takes a microphone.

                          BEN
           Sorry people. I resign. Swipe is no
           more. Steve Culley is a cunt.
           Ben storms off the stage. The audience are in uproar.

                          PUBLICIST
           Ben! Ben! What's happening?

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 40.

                         

                         

                          BEN
           He's seeing Fran. I won't work with
           that tosser again.

                          FRAN
           Steve! Don't!
           Steve is coming into the wings. He punches Ben.

                          STEVE
           You fucking baby.
           Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the
           ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name.
           Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara.

                          TAMARA
           Hello. I'm Tamara Drewe.

                          BEN
           What?

                          TAMARA
           I'm supposed to be interviewing you
           - for the Independent.
           She smiles sweetly, smoothing his hair.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           It was scheduled for later but
           maybe now's a better time...

                         

          62 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 62

           Jody, Casey and the boys are sharing a bottle of cider.

                          JODY
           They should let us in free.

                          RYAN
           Too right. They come here, drink our
           water, use our fields, they leave
           all their crap in our drains -
           Tamara's car sweeps past with the roof down. It is closely
           followed by a bright yellow Porsche. Ben is driving and his
           boxer dog, Boss, is in the passenger seat. Jody clocks him.

                          JODY
           Ben! Ben!
           She jumps up and down in the road with both arms waving.

           Jody and Casey scream with delight, chasing the car.

                         

          63 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 63

           Ben skids his Porsche to a halt right next to Tamara's car.
           He jumps out. Boss follows. Tamara is walking towards the
           door. The distant festival is still audible. Tamara backs
           towards the door, with Ben inches away.

                          BEN
           That's Boss.

                          TAMARA
           Hi Boss.

                          BEN
           You're not allergic are you?

                          TAMARA
           To indie drummers? Maybe. Who are
           your influences, Ben?

                          BEN
           Everyone asks that. This your place?

                          TAMARA
           I'm selling. D'you want it?

                          BEN
           No, I want something else.
           Tamara grins. Jody and Casey arrive at the brow of the hill,
           breathless. They see Ben pin Tamara against the door.

                          JODY
           Who the fuck's she?

                          CASEY
           I seen her up at Stonefield. She's
           got a nose made of plastic.

                          JODY
           How come she gets Ben? I've loved
           him since March.
           Just as Ben's about to kiss her, Tamara coolly opens the door
           and draws him into the house.

                          CASEY
           Wow...
           Jody is gutted; feeling the full injustice of her life.

           Tamara leads Ben to the kitchen. The hall has been stripped.

                          TAMARA
           Would you like a beer?

                          BEN
           Yep. Maureen Tucker.

                          TAMARA
           Who?
           Tamara opens the fridge. Ben is inches away. He still hasn't
           kissed her and he's just about to.

                          BEN
           Moe Tucker, with the Velvets. Five
           foot nothing. Used to stand up to
           play. Put the snare drum on its side
           and hit it with mallets. Mentalist.

                          TAMARA
           You write all the songs; that's
           pretty rare for a drummer.

                          BEN
           Everything you've ever heard about
           drummers is total shit.

                          TAMARA
           You mean you don't spontaneously
           combust?

                          BEN
           Only sometimes.
           She goes in to kiss him. But Ben grabs a pair of chopsticks
           from a utensils jar. He starts to play around Tamara, hitting
           the surfaces, the shelves and everything on them; a brilliant
           rhythm. He gets closer and closer. Tamara is utterly
           mesmerised. Ben stops. He still doesn't kiss her.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Any more questions?
           Tamara is speechless. He kisses her.

                         

          65 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD AND THE COPSE - NEXT MORNING (LARKHAM).


                          65
           Andy is walking in the copse up to Tamara's. He spots a
           couple of wild mushrooms and picks them. In the distance he
           sees Glen bending and stretching. A cow is looking at him
           over the fence. Glen sees it and startles.

           The sight makes Andy smile. He carries on towards Winnards
           Farm in high spirits.

                         

          66 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 66

           Andy comes up to the house. He sees the yellow Porsche; then
           a large boxer dog sitting by the front garden. It starts
           barking at him. Andy calms him right down.

                          ANDY
           Hey, hey - who are you, mate -
           lost, are you?
           Andy strokes Boss.

                         

          66A EXT. DAY. BACK OF WINNARDS. 66A

           Andy takes a key from under a flower pot.

                         

          66B INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. KITCHEN / HALL. 66B

           Andy opens the kitchen door.

                          ANDY
           Tam? You want breakfast?
           Boss bounds inside and disappears.

                          ANDY

                          WOAH -
           Andy is puzzled. He steps into the hall.

                          ANDY
           Do you know about this dog, Tam -
           He notices two half-drunk beers. He wanders into the hall. He
           sees Ben's boots and most of Tamara's clothes, abandoned. The
           unmistakable moans of lovemaking are coming from Tamara's
           room.
           He turns on his heels, pained.

                         

          67 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD. (WINNARDS). 67

           Andy strides back across the field, chucking the mushrooms in
           the mud on his way.

           Postcard of Winnards Farm. The exterior is half-decorated. 
           Two cars parked - Tamara's and the yellow Porsche, which 
           looks more like a permanent fixture. The garden has been 
           cleared and dug, ready to plant. 
           Andy is stoking a bonfire. He is smouldering like the embers. 
           He gives the yellow Porsche an angry look. 

                         

          68AA EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE FIELD. 68AA 

           Nicholas and Glen are both walking in the field. They pass 
           each other, each managing a painful smile. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           How goes the opus? 

                          GLEN 
           Fine Nicholas, just fine... 
           Their smiles fade. Nicholas descending into deep gloom, Glen 
           into deep anxiety.

          69 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 69

           Beth is mending the engine of her huge mower. Glen, now
           wearing a scarf, is sitting on the seat watching her work.

                          GLEN
           It's his most obscure novel `The Well-
           Beloved'. Most people have never even
           heard of it. About this guy of twenty
           who falls in love with a beautiful
           young woman. Then when he's forty, he
           meets the woman's daughter and he
           falls in love with her. And finally,
           when he's sixty he meets the

                          GRANDDAUGHTER -

                          BETH
           Oh he doesn't.

                          GLEN
           Yeah. Falls in mystical love. Hardy
           was like that in his life, too. Even
           as he aged, he only had eyes for
           young women. Like, in one essential
           way he never grew up.

                          BETH
           In his trousers.

                          GLEN
           He was still at it in his eighties.
           You know? Snow on the rooftop but
           fire in the cellar...

                          BETH
           Why won't it come for you Glen?
           The way you talk about it's so
           engaging.

                          GLEN
           Yeah but there's an academic style,
           you know?

                          BETH
           Who are you writing for? Who's your
           ideal reader?

           Glen can't answer.

                          BETH
           Because if you wrote the way you
           spoke... it would make me want to
           read Hardy.

                          GLEN
           Really?

                          BETH
           Yes. If you wrote like you were
           talking to a friend... Pass me that
           thing.
           Glen passes it, looking at Beth as she tightens a bolt.

                          BETH
           Try it now.
           Glen turns the key. The engine starts. Glen starts to drive
           the mower, delighted. Beth watches him, amused.

          70 INT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE DINING ROOM. 70

           A cosy dinner for all the writers - more ladies in their
           forties and fifties. Nicholas is topping up his glass.

                          NICHOLAS
           I simply pander to popular taste.

                          CAITLIN
           Oh your books are far more than that.

                          NICHOLAS
           Just airport fodder...
           Glen at the foot of the table, finds this modesty rich.

                          CAITLIN
           Your prose is so vivid. And Inchcombe
           - for all his flaws - is a man with
           total integrity.

                          GLEN
           Who did you base him on, Nicholas?

                          NICHOLAS

                          (IGNORING GLEN)
           My books don't say anything
           profound. I can't pretend to be an
           intellectual - not like Glen here,
           illuminating our ignorance with his
           critical glow - but I do love prose.
           And I think I can turn a reasonable
           story.
          Glen peers into the kitchen. Beth is serving desserts.

                          GLEN
           Excuse me.
          He goes to help her, leaving the ladies around Nicholas like
          cups around a teapot.

                          GLEN
           Let me help.

                          BETH
           They need dusting with this.

                          GLEN
           I went to my room and I wrote for
           three hours. The time just
           vanished.

                          BETH
           That's great, that's brilliant.

                          GLEN
           I feel like a man who's just passed
           a gargantuan stool.

                          BETH
           Super. Sprig of mint on the top.
          Glen returns to the dining room with two desserts. He listens
          to Nicholas as he serves them.

                          NICHOLAS
           The real secret of being a writer
           is learning how to lie.
          A frisson of shock goes round the lady writers.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Because that's what storytellers
           are. Thieves and liars...

                          GLEN
           (as he serves Nicholas)
           `The basis of all excellence is
           truth.' Samuel Johnson.
          Glen's intellect wins the day. Nicholas smarts.

           Tamara is sitting at it, tapping away on her PC, almost
           pained with concentration. Ben is bored.

                          BEN
           Are you done yet?

                          TAMARA
           I'm just starting something.

                          BEN
           That poxy column? Can't it wait?

                          TAMARA
           Not the column. Just stuff coming
           out. Don't want to stop it.

                          BEN
           Do it later. Play with me.
           Ben strums his guitar, determined to get her attention.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           She is such fun she's sexy
           And she lives on an old farm
           But something gnaws away at me
           It's causing me real harm.
           Tamara, what can you do with it?
           What can you do with her name?
           Its stands there lonely and
           rhymeless It's driving me nearly

           Andy is planting a bed. Ben's boxer dog is digging up work
           he's just done. Andy swears at him under his breath.

           BEN (O.S.)
           Hey - Andy?
           Andy looks up. Ben is at the bedroom window, naked.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Can you let my dog in? Thanks mate.
           Jody and Casey watch from behind the hedge as Andy angrily
           goes to let the dog in.

           He doesn't love her. He's just on
           the rebound from losing Fran;
           numbing his pain with loads of
           empty, rampant sex. What he really

           Very good-looking, isn't he? Poppy
           You-Tubed him and we both got quite

                          ZOE
           Don't know if I can stick a winter
           here. The way the light disappears;
           it's doing me in. I'm a blue sky
           girl. Got to have some warmth.
           Andy just looks up at her, smiling his understanding.

                          ANDY
           We all need a bit of that, don't we.

                         

          76AA EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 76AA 

           Boss is outside, sniffing round the front door. Sounds of the 
           end of an epic shag from the upstairs window. He sits, bored. 
           He hears the noise of crows in the field. 
           He is off like a shot. 

                         

          76A EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE FIELD IN FRONT OF NICHOLAS' SHED.


                          76A
           Boss is having the time of his life chasing the cows. Penny
           Upminister, an uppercrust landowner in a horrible coat is
           trying to catch him.

                          78 
           The whole herd is now on the rampage, Boss in pursuit, Penny 
           bringing up the rear. Nicholas sees them heading straight for 
           his shed. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Fuck Soup. 

                         

          77 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 77

           Tamara is opening a Tiffany's box. There is a ring inside it.
           She looks at Ben, almost in disbelief. Boss can be heard,
           barks fading in the distance.

                          TAMARA
           What's this?

                          BEN
           What's it look like?

                          TAMARA
           Ben... For which finger?

                          BEN
           Whatever one you like. That's a
           nice one. Why not put it on that?
           He's pointing to her ring finger. Tamara is moved.

           Penny Upminister has managed to get Boss on a bit of rope.
           She is handing him over to Beth at the top of the field.

                          PENNY

           Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out.
           Nicholas is approaching.

                          PENNY
           It beats me why you people want to
           live in the country. You've got no
           sense of responsibility.

                          BETH
           It's not our dog!

                          NICHOLAS
           Hello, Penny. How's tricks?
           Penny is suddenly all coy.

                          PENNY
           Oh - Nicholas...

                          NICHOLAS
           You're looking great. Terrific coat.

                          PENNY
           What, this old thing?

                          NICHOLAS
           You look like royalty.

                          PENNY
           (laughs, delighted)
           Well, I try... Can't wait for your
           next book. Inchcombe's such a sauce-
           pot. Giles is always says `What are
           you reading Penny? You've got steam
           coming out of your ears...'
           She laughs like a drain. Nicholas joins in. Beth is striding
           away with the dog, infuriated.

                         

          80 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM 80

           Ben has put a ring on Tamara's finger.

                          TAMARA
           So what's the ring saying, Ben?

                          BEN
           It's saying hello I'm a ring. Will
           you marry me?
           Tamara looks at him, searchingly.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           What's up?

                          TAMARA
          I didn't know.

                          BEN
          Didn't know what?

                          TAMARA
           That you were in love with me.

                          BEN
           The ring says I'm platinum with a
           long guarantee. So give me a reply.
           Tamara is grinning from ear to ear.

                          TAMARA
           You're the best fun in the world.
           I'd love to marry you.
           She throws her arms around his neck.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Can I say it then?

                          BEN
           Say what?

                          TAMARA
           I love you.
           Tamara holds him, profoundly affected. Something akin to fear
           flickers across Ben's eyes. The phone rings.

                          BEN

                          (ANSWERING IT)
           What? She's being proposed to.

                         

          81 EXT. DAY. TEN MINUTES LATER. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 81

           Ben's Porsche skids to a halt, music blaring. Diggory is 
           looking on in irate astonishment. The hat is on. 

                          BETH
           Shhh! There are writers here, trying
           to write.
           Beth is in the hen enclosure, a hen in her arms. 

                          BETH 
           This is a Buff Orpington. She's 
           looking a bit peaky today. Not a 
           great layer but she's very 
           decorative. 
           Beth puts down the hen. 

                          BETH 
           We're fully organic - but I like to 
           think that our champion product is 
           the written word. 
           Nicholas approaches, his hand held out, heartily.

                          NICHOLAS
           The famous Ben - Swipe, eh?
          Ben just about manages to shake it.

                          BEN
           Swipe's over. Thought the whole
           world knew that.

                          NICHOLAS
           It wasn't on Newsnight, no.

                          BETH
           Ben is engaged to Tamara. Isn't
           that lovely? He'd just popped the
           question when I rang.

                          NICHOLAS
           She said yes?
          Nicholas can't hide his disbelief. Ben is insulted.

                          BETH
           We're delighted for you both.
          Boss leaps up, straining against a chain.

                          BEN
           Why's he on a chain?

                          BETH
           He was out of control.

                          BEN
           How'd you like to be chained up?

                          BETH
           He was chasing livestock. He
           could've got shot.

                          BEN
           They shoot him; I'll fucking shoot
           them. 
          He takes Boss. Beth and Nicholas are left alone.

                          NICHOLAS
           I think the word is gobshite.

                          BETH
           I hope he makes her happy. It's hard
           for girls when their dads walk out.
           Gives them bad taste in men.

                          NICHOLAS
           What's that supposed to mean?

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 53.

                         

                         

                          BETH
           Just saying her father left when she
           was a girl and -

                          NICHOLAS
           That is ten pence psychology! You
           don't know what you're talking
           about, do you? 
           He walks away. Beth is completely taken aback.

                         

          82 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED/ EXT. WINNARDS 82

           Nicholas, wearing a woolly hat and scarf, is writing.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.)
           Patel's eyes were open, eloquent in
           death...
           He looks up. In the distance, he can just see Tamara talking
           to Andy in the garden at Winnards Farm.
           Nicholas opens his desk. He finds a pair of old binoculars.
           He focuses them on Tamara. She holds out her hand with the
           ring on it. Andy has his arms wrapped around himself, his
           shoulders hunched. He nods, affecting congratulations.
           Nicholas tries to close in on Tamara. But she turns and goes
           indoors. Also the yellow Porsche arrives. Nicholas puts the
           binoculars down.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He knelt down - forensics be damned -
           and closed her eyes, forever.

                         

          83 INT. DAY. 10 MINUTES LATER. WINNARDS FARM - KITCHEN. 83

           Tamara is turning the ring around her finger.

                          BEN
           `Mai Buff Orpingtons. Oh, the
           written word. That's what the

                          TAMARA
           It's a shame it doesn't fit. Perhaps
           you should have taken one of mine
           with you when you went to buy it.

                          BEN
           Yeah but I didn't know you then.

                          TAMARA
           So... when did you buy it?

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 54.

                         

                         
           Ben realises his mistake. Tamara laughs, shocked.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Was this for someone else?
           Ben shrugs, not wanting to admit. The truth dawns.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           You gave it to Fran didn't you?

                          BEN
           So? It's yours now. She never wore
           it. She didn't want it.

                          TAMARA
           You asked her to marry you...?

                          BEN
           It was a gesture, OK, when she
           started seeing Steve. Backfired,
           anyway. Look, I love you now.
           Tamara doesn't believe him. She is devastated.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           It's not the ring that matters. I
           mean fuck the ring. It's just a
           consumerist piece of zinc. What
           matters is I want to marry you.

                          TAMARA
           Do you?

                          BEN
           Yeah. With my whole heart. And all
           the other stuff. Like my brain and my
           entrails and my whatever, pancreas.
           It all wants to marry you.
           He hugs her, starts kissing her but Tamara hardly responds.

           Nicholas is staring out at the darkness. Beth is organising
           things around him.

                          BETH
           She wondered if you had a delivery
           date in mind. I told her Easterish.
           Mind that cocoa, it's hot.
           Across at Winnards, Tamara's bedroom light comes on. For a
           moment, she gazes out. Nicholas gazes back.

           to go to.
           Ben wraps his arms lovingly around Tamara. She draws the
           curtains as he pulls her away.

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           And Tim wants to know if you'll do
           your Christmas signing in Hadditon. I
           know he's always ungrateful but I
           think it's so important to keep these
           little bookshops open, don't you?

                          NICHOLAS
           Uh huh.
           Beth is on her way out. She turns and kisses him.

                          BETH
           Come in soon, my love.
           Nicholas stares out into the darkness. He isn't working. He
           isn't doing anything.

           From the field, Nicholas is an ageing, isolated figure in a

           Mud, frost and gloom add to the sense of neglect. Jody is
           smoking. Casey is eating Pringles. They share a magazine.

                          CASEY
           Look at that cellulite...

          87 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE BUS SHELTER - FIVE MINUTES LATER. 87

           The bin is on fire. Casey chucks in the Pringles box. They
           warm their hands, watching one of the boys wheelie his bike
           and fall off right into a freezing puddle. Casey giggles.

                          JODY
           What a dick.

                          CASEY
           I think he's cute.

                          JODY
           No you don't. Would you snog him?

                          CASEY
           Maybe.

                          JODY
           Be like having a slug in your mouth.
           Ben's yellow Porsche speeds right through the puddle, further
           soaking Ryan. Ben and Tamara are both wearing designer shades
           despite the gloom; Boss in the back.
           Jody and Casey are both on their feet in a second.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Ben! Ben!

                          CASEY

           BEN!!!

                          RYAN
           Wankers.
           Ben gives them a grin and a wave. Jody's heart soars.

                          JODY
           Come on.

                         

          88 MERGED WITH 87. 88

                         

          89 EXT. DAY. 10 MINUTES LATER. WINNARDS FARM. 89

           Jody is outside the back door. She lifts a flowerpot and
           takes the key from underneath.

                          JODY
           She keeps this here for Andy.

                          CASEY 
           What if she's got an alarm? 

                          JODY 
           Soon find out. 
          Jody opens the door. They go in. The alarm is hanging off the 
          wall, the wires pulled out. Jody grins at Casey, satisfied.

                          CASEY
           What if they come back?

                          JODY
           If you're too chicken, go home.
           The girls wander in, awed. Jody turns and grins, her eyes
           like a cat's.

                         

          90 INT. NIGHT. HADDITON - A BOOK SHOP. 90

           Nicholas is doing a book signing. There's a good crowd.

                          NICHOLAS
           Is that Claire with an `i'?
           Beth has a tray of mince pies. Glen is at her side.

                          BETH
           What about you, Glen? Where will you
           be?

                          GLEN
           In London with a collection of spare
           academics. I guess we'll be decking
           the halls in our own erudite way.

                          BETH
           I'll miss our chats. 

                          GLEN
           I've been in a state of writerly
           bliss these last weeks. I hope I
           get to come back.

                          BETH
           Me too. We'd love to have you.
           Glen doesn't want Beth to move away.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           You know, this is the best mince pie
           I've ever had.

                          BETH
           Oh?

                          GLEN
           If it was possible to have an orgasm
           from mere food, this mince pie would
           do it.

                          BETH

                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Golly.
           She moves away. Glen heads for the wine, kicking himself.

          Tamara and Ben walk in. Ben looks at the country casuals in
          undisguised horror.

                          BEN
           What the fuck are we doing here?

                          TAMARA
           It's kind of research; I want to
           write about them. They're funny, Ben -
           come on.
          They move through the crowd.

                          VINTNER
           The 2001 was the best. Someone just
           bought my last three cases...

           So I've got her this gorgeous
           Rajastani gagara skirt...
          Arriving at the mulled wine.

                          TAMARA
           Besides, I want to show you off.

                          BEN
           What am I - arm candy?

                          TAMARA
           More like arm fungus with that face
           on. Ben, meet Glen. Glen, meet Ben,
           my fiance.

                          GLEN
           You're getting married?

                          TAMARA
           Uh huh.

                          GLEN
           OK. Beautiful dress, magazine
           photoshoot - everything the
           aspiring novelist needs.

                          TAMARA
           I knew you'd be pleased.

                          GLEN
           Have a mince pie.

                          BEN
           Can we get out of here?

                          TAMARA
           Wait.

          She abandons him. Glen has turned away. Ben stands amid the
          nice chat, like a man being tortured.
          Meanwhile, Tamara is jumping the queue at Nicholas' desk.

                          ARMY GEEK
           In Field of Tares, you made Fred a
           corporal. But there's no such thing
           in the Royal Artillery. They call
           them bombardiers.

                          NICHOLAS
           Oh, thank you for that...

                          TAMARA
           Sorry.
          She flashes a smile at the Army Geek and puts her copy down
          in front of Nicholas.

                          TAMARA
           Could you do it for Ben? He's my
           fiance. We're getting married in
           the summer.

                          NICHOLAS
           So I hear. You have my heartiest
           commiserations, Tara.
           He hands her the book dismissively. Tamara is smarting.

                          TAMARA
           Well merry Christmas. Nicholarse.
           She turns away.

                         

          91 INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 91

           Jody sniffs Ben's aftershave, longingly. Casey plucks his 
           guitar. They listen to the note in hushed awe. 
           Jody puts her foot into one of Tamara's killer stilettos. She 
           picks up Ben's drumsticks and kisses them, reverently. 

                          JODY
           We gotta live the dream, Casey.
           Live the dream...
           Jody and Casey jump up and down on the unmade bed. Jody pulls 
           a black T-shirt from under a pillow. She holds it to her
           face.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Ben...
           Casey is looking out of the window. The yellow Porsche is
           heading up the lane.

                          CASEY
           Omigod!
           A wild panic. They put things back where they found them.

                          JODY
           Go! Go! Go!
           She nicks the T-shirt.

           The girls sprint down the stairs and out.

          91B EXT. NIGHT. WINNARD'S FARM. 91B

           They dive behind a bush as the car pulls in. They lie on the
           ground splitting their sides with hushed laughter, as Ben and
           Tamara disappear into the house.

                         

          92 INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 92

           Tamara and Ben are having a heated discussion.

                          BEN
           Why don't you sell it like you keep
           saying?

                          TAMARA
           Because... I've started writing.

                          BEN
           You can write anywhere.

                          TAMARA
           But this is proper. Not just stuff
           for the paper. 'It's about my teens -
           and is working for me here.

                          BEN
           Well it might be memory lane for you
           but it's doing my fucking head in. I
           want London. I want some Urban, OK?
           Are you with me or what? Cos I've had
           it with this place.
           Tamara is hurt - and deeply disappointed.

                          TAMARA
           Of course I'm with you...

                          BEN
           It's drab. It's depressing. And every 
           time I look out of the window I see
           Andy's arse - what's that about?

                         

          93 EXT. NEXT DAY. STONEFIELD - ANDY'S CORRUGATED SHACK. 93

           Andy is bending down, the top of his arse peeking out in the
           morning sun. Ben stares at it with distaste. Andy is plucking 
           a goose, putting all his frustration into it.

                          BEN
           We're leaving. Thank God. 
           Andy looks at him. 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 61.

                         

                         

                          BEN
           Tamara says you sell Christmas geese.

                          ANDY
           Yep.

                          BEN
           Can I have one?

                          ANDY
           Right now?

                          BEN
           Yeah.
          Andy smirks, pointing at a big white duck.

                          ANDY
           That one's spare.

                          BEN
           Is that a goose?

                          ANDY
           You can take it now if you like.

                          BEN

                          (DISGUSTED)
           Oh come off it.

                          ANDY
           What?

                          BEN
           It's fucking alive.

                          ANDY
           Oh, you want it from Tesco, all
           plucked and headless sitting on a
           bandage.
          Ben's curiosity gets the better of him.

                          BEN
           How d'you do it then?
          Andy points towards an upturned traffic cone, held in place
          by a metal frame.

                          ANDY
           Gently put it's head down there; then
           quick in the skull with an air rifle. 
           Pluck it while it's warm, little pot 
           to catch all the blood -

                          BEN
           Do you enjoy doing that?

                          ANDY
           No, but in my low wage economy, this
           flock's worth a lot.

                          BEN
           You're a sick fuck, Andy.
          Andy has had enough.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 62.

           Grow up.

                          (SQUARING UP)
           What did you say?
           Andy stands. He's at least two inches taller than Ben.

                          ANDY
           I said grow up, little drummer boy.
           Ben thinks about it. He walks away. Glen appears with his
           suitcase on wheels containing most of his worldly goods.

                          ANDY
           Tamara rang me this morning. Said 
           to finish the house. It goes on the 
           market in the spring and that's it;
           over.

                          GLEN
           Why does the asshole always get the
           girl?
           He stands with Andy; comrades. Andy slaps him on the back.

                          ANDY
           Come on. Or you'll miss that train.

                         

          94 INT. SIX WEEKS LATER. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 94 

           Snow falling outside. Jody and Casey are in school uniform.
           Jody curled up on the bed; Casey at Tamara's PC. The room has 
           been redecorated. 

                          JODY
           It won't be just a shag, Case. It'll
           be an event. I'll be wearing like a
           gossamer slip with a bra bit; Prada.
           Or like a filmy, linen shirt, and...
           We see Jody's thought bubble. Ben is leaning against the door 
           frame, giving her a smouldering look. 

           JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He'll be wearing a black T-shirt all
           taut over his buff bod and underneath
           Calvin Klein Boxers, black.
           Jody moves towards Ben. He buries his face in her neck as if
           he's found the love of his life.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 62A.

                         

                         

           JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And he'll have like one tattoo of my
          name and lush pecs and we'll have
          candles and white sheets and I'll
          smell of Allure by Chanel.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 63.

                         

                         
           Ben lifts Jody on to the bed. They marvel at each other. He
           bends down to kiss her.

           JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And he tries to stop himself but I'm
           a vision and he gets drawn into my
           power and it'll be like Uhhh... But
           also respectful. And my `V' plates
           will melt into nothing.
           She looks up. Casey is reading at the PC.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Are you listening?

                          CASEY
           I like this.

                          JODY
           What?

           There's this bit right, where her dad
           takes her for dinner and she thinks
           it's some big treat but what he's
           doing, right, is telling her he's
           leaving them. And she, right, she's
           gutted and she yaks all her food into
           a napkin and puts it on his plate.

                          JODY
           So?

                          CASEY
           It's painful. But funny. It's about
           her; Plastic Fantastic. She's sad,
           Jode.

                          JODY
           Sad? She's a lucky cunt.

           Outside the farm the snow falls.

                         

          95 INT. DAY. LONDON - BEN'S WAREHOUSE FLAT. 95

           Tamara is trying to write. Ben is playing his drum kit, high
           as a kite. The noise is deafening. Tamara sits back, looking
           around the boyish pad. It feels alien. The phone rings.

                         

          96 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM 96

           Andy is on the phone, examining the decrepit shed. Nothing 
           has changed in a decade.

           TAMARA (V.0) 
          Hang on... 

                          ANDY
          Am I dismantling it - or mending it?

           FARM.
           Tamara takes the phone out onto the balcony to escape the
           noise. She slowly smiles, knowing what he's thinking. 

                          TAMARA
           I don't know; the shed... What do
           you think?

                          ANDY
           I recommend preserving it.

                          TAMARA
           Really?

                          ANDY
           Always useful, a good shed.

                          TAMARA
           Well then. Keep it...
           Andy puts the phone down, grinning. Tamara is grinning too,
           sharing the same memory.

           Beth is decorating a little pink valentine cake. She's on the 
           phone to Nicholas.

           Beth looks at the cake. It says To My Valentine in piped 
           lettering around the edge. She picks up her icing bag, full 
           of unease. 
           In the middle of the cake she ices a big question mark. Then 
           she quickly looks up a number and dials. 

                          BETH 
           Hello, Judy?

           Oh - actually - don't worry - I've 
           just found it. 
           Beth puts the phone down, biting her lip. She is relieved, 
           ashamed and ultimately not reassured. She looks to camera. 

                          BETH 
           Nicholas has been telling the truth 
           a lot recently.

           Jody, dressed in Tamara's leopard skin coat, is admiring
           herself in Tamara's mirror, swigging from a bottle of wine.
           We hear Casey reading the card.

           CASEY (V.O.)
           You are so fit
           I wanna shag you.
           Love from Ben pfwoor!!!
           Jody takes another swig with a wicked grin, she sits at
           Tamara's PC.
           We hear Casey knock three times on the back door.

           Outside Casey is waiting. Jody lets her in. She has
           accessorised the leopard print coat with red stilettos, a
           Chloe bag and bright red lipstick.

           one from Ben.

                          CASEY
           I sent you that.
           Jody takes another swig from the bottle of wine.

                          CASEY (CONT'D)
           Is that theirs?

                          JODY
           It's my mum's; they don't drink this

           She hands it to Casey.

           Don't ever, ever send that.

           Why don't you believe me? I didn't

           The drumming leads up to a massive crescendo and stops.

           Can you go to the farm? Just take a

           He pushes her away, harder than he meant to. She lands on the
           sofa, shocked.

           He grabs the lead and opens the door. It slams shut. Tamara's
           dread overwhelms her.

                         

          106 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 106

           Poppy is reading a print-out of Tamara's email. Beth is
           folding sheets.

                          POPPY
           Oh come on mum. She's just stirring
           shit. Tamara's always done that.

                          BETH
           Why's your father on there - and
           poor Andy? It's so tasteless.

                          POPPY
           (helping with the sheets)
           You know how subversive she is. She
           once sent me a valentine from
           Prince Harry - and I believed it.
           It's her sense of humour; she likes
           causing trouble. At school she used
           to give us first years tips on how
           to shoplift.

                          BETH
           She taught you to shoplift?

                          POPPY
           Mum, she's marrying Ben Sergeant.
           Why would she look at an old git
           like dad?
           Nicholas is in the shadowy hall, listening with interest.
           Poppy helps Beth upstairs with the laundry. Nicholas steps
           into the kitchen. Poppy has left the email on the table.
           Nicholas picks it up, deeply curious.

           Nicholas is walking up the field wearing his red scarf. Andy 
           is outside his shed, doing heavy work.

           It don't make any sense. Her London

           that's my theory. 
          Andy carries on working.

           Casey and Jody are pouring over a gossip mag; pictures of
           celebrity blonde with new man.

                          CASEY
           How come she's with a different bloke
           every week and when Lesley Hunt's

           once, after he lied he loved her -
           she gets called a dirty slag.

           Tamara's car zooms past. Her expression is black.

           Tamara arrives outside her house. Depressed. She remains in 
           the car, reluctant to go in, to face her isolation. 
           She looks at herself in the mirror. The face that stares back 
           seems like that of a stranger.

           Tamara is lying in bed with her brand new nose bandaged up. 
           He face is covered in bruising. She is panicking - 
           experiencing a loss of self. 

                         

          109B EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 109B 

           The mask drops. All her old insecurities come back. She gets 
           out of the car and slams the door, unable to stand the sight 
           of herself. She lets herself in. 

                         

          109C INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 109C 

           The inside of the house has been transformed by Andy. The 
           drab gloomy shades of her mother have gone, replaced by warm 
           tones which bring out the beauty of the house. 
           Tamara wanders through. She turns around taking it all in. 
           She never knew the house was so beautiful.

           I'll never see Ben again... And it's

           Nicholas sees Tamara. He waits while she emerges from the
           copse.

                          TAMARA
           I'm looking for Andy.

                          NICHOLAS
           He's not up at Stonefield.
           Tamara is about to turn back. 

                          NICHOLAS
           So what about this shag I've been

           Tamara's car pulls up. Jody and Casey wheel around closer on
           their bikes. Tamara tries the door. The pub is shut. She
           looks in through the glass and sees Zoe up on the bar,
           clinging to Andy in a long embrace. Tamara is frozen. Andy
           kisses Zoe, long and tender.
           Tamara turns.
           She gets back in her car, trying to hide her distress - which
           has taken her completely by surprise. Jody and Casey stare
           mutely as she drives away.

           Tamara is playing with the ill-fitting ring that Ben gave
           her. She puts it a jar and closes the lid. There's a knock on 
           the front door. She startles, her face falling. She answers 
           it. Nicholas is on the threshold.

           Hello.

                          TAMARA
           So. Nicholas.
           She lets the door fall open. She backs into the hall.
           Nicholas walks in. He closes the door. They look at each
           other. Neither of them moves.

                          NICHOLAS
           You can tell me to leave.
           Tamara says nothing. 

                          NICHOLAS
           You can throw me right out.
           Nicholas slowly takes his red scarf and coat off. He hangs
           them on a coat hook, bringing himself closer to her.

                          NICHOLAS
           Just say and I'll go.
           She still can't speak. Nicholas takes her in his arms. He is 
           big and fatherly and comforting.
           Tamara feels a sense of relief, of not being alone. Her arms 
           go around him. When he kisses her, he's surprisingly real,
           vulnerable even, as if he's left his lordly persona at the
           door. Tamara closes her eyes.
           Their kisses become more urgent.

                         

          117 INT. DUSK. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 117

           Tamara is lying in Nicholas' arms in the growing darkness. He
           looks blissfully post-coital. Tamara is gazing ahead. A tear
           rolls down her cheek. It lands on Nicholas' chest.

                          NICHOLAS
           Are you crying?

                          TAMARA
           No.
           Nicholas is taken aback. He instinctively holds her.

                          NICHOLAS
           Don't cry. Am I really that bad?
           Tamara shakes her head, glad of him.

                          TAMARA
           I'm just not myself.

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes you are.
           She looks up at him.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           You're relentlessly, rudely,
           uncompromisingly yourself.
           A smile appears on Tamara's face. 

                          TAMARA
           I used to watch you out of my window
           helping your daughter learn to
           skateboard up the lane. Bit of an
           obvious crush, wasn't it.

                          NICHOLAS
           Is that why you're crying?

                          TAMARA
           No.

                          NICHOLAS
           Am I here as revenge on your ex?

                          TAMARA
           I don't know why you're here. Why are
           you here, Nicholas?

                          NICHOLAS
           Because... since you climbed over
           that stile in the summer I haven't 
           thought about very much else.
           She doesn't believe him.

           Nicholas is putting his coat on. Tamara is uneasy.

                          TAMARA
           Isn't life complicated enough?
           Nicholas shakes his head. He kisses her.

                         

          119 INT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 119

           Nicholas strolls in. He's ecstatically happy. Beth is getting
           something out of the Aga.

                          BETH
           Oh poor you - was it awful?

                          NICHOLAS
           Bloody terrible. Didn't move till
           well past Chiswick. But look, I
           nipped into Fortnums...
           He hands her a package.

                          BETH
           All my favourite teas - Oh!
           He embraces her. He is affectionate, magnanimous in his
           bliss. Beth is taken aback by his warmth.

                          BETH
           My goodness. You feel like my buzzy
           toothbrush just after I've charged it
           up. You should go up to London more
           often.

                          NICHOLAS
           Maybe I will...
           Nicholas goes to the table. The writers greet him as he sits.

                          NICHOLAS
           Sorry everybody; traffic was a pig.
           Do carry on...

                          LUCETTA
           I'm trying this magic realist bit
           at the end of chapter three, where
           the characters slowly turn into

                          BIRDS -

                          NICHOLAS
           That sounds very innovative...

                          LUCETTA
           Do you think so? It's sort of the
           key to the structure, which I'm
           thinking of as a nest shape...

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 78.

                         

                         
           Nicholas listens benevolently as Lucetta shares. His good
           humour is so out of his recent character that Beth watches
           him with increasing unease. There is something in her eyes
           akin to suspicion.

          122 EXT. DAY. HADDITON - THE STATION / BETH'S CAR. 122

           Beth is putting Glen's luggage into the boot.

                          GLEN
           So after two years of radio silence
           I contact my editor. And she loves -
           I mean loves the chapters I did in
           the fall.

                          BETH
           Oh Glen.

                          GLEN 
           I tried writing at the library but 
           I could feel that awful paralysis 
           descending again. 

                         

          122A EXT. DAY. THE ROAD TO EWEDOWN / INSIDE BETH'S CAR. 122A 


           GLEN (V.O.) 
           I missed everything that I've been, 
           you know, finding here. 
           (Seeing the view) 
           Oh my god - it's so beautiful! 
           They are now in the village driving down the main drag. 

                          BETH 
           I'm glad you've come back.

                          GLEN
           A few solid weeks should - holy cow!
           An egg hits the windscreen (shot the same way as the earlier
           scene). Casey and Jody hide. Beth gets out of the car to
           clean the window.

                          GLEN
           Idiots! Morons! Hey, writers! Let's
           egg the self-regarding sacks of shit.

           Glen is helping Beth prepare the evening meal. They are both
           animated, enjoying one another's company.

           There's this theory he gave his
           wife syphilis, right? No evidence
           but the symptoms fit. The poor
           woman gets kind of eccentric and
           moves her bed up to their attic -

                          BETH

           Meanwhile, Hardy falls in love with
           a woman who is thirty nine years
           younger than him.

           That's right, a Hardy book. Coming
           well?

                          GLEN
           Yes, actually.
          Nicholas returns to the paper.

                          BETH
           He gave his wife syphilis.

                          NICHOLAS
           Jolly good.
          He goes. Beth is ashamed of his condescension.

                          BETH
           He's completely distracted. He's up

          124 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 124 

           Nicholas is reading, hunched over a computer. He glances 
           round. Tamara, wearing a robe, is awaiting his opinion. 

                          TAMARA 
           Is it any good? Because I keep - 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Shush. 
           (Points at the screen) 
           This is brutally candid. You lay 
           yourself completely bare. 

                          TAMARA 
           I'm well-known for it. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Seriously. It's very moving. 
           Tamara knows this is praise indeed. She is deeply gratified. 

                          TAMARA
           Thank you.

                          NICHOLAS
           So... have I done my duty?

                          TAMARA
           Admirably.

                          NICHOLAS
           Now do I get my treat?
           Tamara, almost in his arms, is crestfallen.

                          TAMARA
           You are so cheesy.
           Tamara is staring at him with something akin to distaste.

           Jody and Casey share a magazine and a spliff in the bus stop.

           She's probably topped herself. I

           We see Jody's thought bubble of Tamara luridly dead, her
           mouth coated with dried froth and vomit.

                          JODY
           D'you think she might be lying there
           all choked in vomit and drug froth?

                          CASEY
           That'd be dire.

           If we find her we'll get in the

           Andy is outside the farm beside his landrover. He walks up to 
           the front door. Hesitates. 
           Behind the railings, the girls arrive. 

                          CASEY 
           What's Uncle Andy doing here?

          127 I/E. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE HALL. 127
           Tamara opens the door in some deshabille. To her surprise, 
           she sees Andy on the threshold, looking spruced up and 
           handsome. The contrast with Nicholas couldn't be more 
           apparent. She finds herself genuinely pleased to see him. 

                          TAMARA
           Andy... 
           Behind the railings, the girls can't help their look of

           Haven't seen you for a while. Thought
           you might be ill or something. Or
           depressed or -

                          TAMARA
           I've had my head down, writing.

           Come for a drink. Let's lighten up. 

                          TAMARA 
           I'd love to, but... 

                          ANDY 
           Shake off the winter blues. Come 
           celebrate the spring. 

                          TAMARA
           I can't... I'm kind of on one with 
           my writing.
           Over her shoulder, Andy sees Nicholas' red scarf and coat
           hanging on the coat hook. He hides his shock. Tamara is 
           unaware that he has seen. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Can we do it soon though? I'd 
           really like to; just not right now. 
           He nods at her in disbelief. 

                          ANDY 

                          (COOLLY) 
           Sure. 
           He turns on his heels and goes. Tamara closes the door. 
           Outside, Andy is leaning over his land-rover, sickened. 

                          JODY 
           D'you think he's in with a chance? 

                          CASEY 
           No way. 

                          JODY 
           Why not? He's fit. I'd do him.

           Nicholas is creeping down the stairs. Tamara is troubled.

           What's he doing here? 

                          TAMARA

           Casey is looking back at Tamara's door. Tamara is peering
           out. Nicholas joins her, putting his coat on. He kisses her
           passionately. He wants to stay. She's insisting he leaves.

                          JODY
           Oh. My. God.

           out of her hair. She sits, full of apprehension.
           We see her fears: Beth, in her apron, pulling Tamara's hair
           back and coming at her face with an electric hand-held whisk.

                          BETH
           You fucking little slut.
           She puts her head in her hands.

                         

          131 INT. EVENING. JODY'S BEDROOM. 131

           Jody and Casey have Googled Nicholas. They are outraged.

           Fucking `D' list. How could she do
           that after Ben?

                          CASEY
           Maybe she's numbing the pain.

                          JODY
           He's not even a proper celeb.

                          CASEY
           Maybe older guys know more... you
           know, bed stuff.

                          JODY
           Eww! He's a perv. I hate him.

                          CASEY
           Jode, I know who I feel sorry for.

          132 EXT. NEXT DAY. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 132

           Beth is walking to the post box. Jody and Casey are at the
           bus shelter, gazing at her with keenest pity.

                          BETH
           Hello Casey. How are you?
           Jody nudges her. Casey nods. Beth posts her mail.

                          JODY
           Bus got scrapped.

                          BETH
           So it did. Well. Hope it doesn't
           rain.
           She turns for home.

                          CASEY
           Gutted for her.

                          JODY

           she?

          135 EXT. DAY. A SECLUDED LANE (HALSTOCK). 135

           Casey and Jody stroll down a lonely lane. Misty. Rooks caw. 

                          CASEY 
           There'll be the divorce and like 
           acrimony and her world'll fall 
           apart... 

                          JODY 
           Yeah. 

                          CASEY 
           But maybe one day, she'll put the 
           bitterness behind her and find a 
           new love... 

                          JODY 
           Don't be daft. She's old, you big 
           sop. 
           A parked 4x4 looms out of the mist. 

                          CASEY
           See? That's D-List's car. 

                          JODY 
           So this is where he hides it when he 
           goes to shag Plastic.

           He's a rotten cheater. 

                          JODY 
           Like my dad. Come on Case. Let's 
           fuck him up.

                         

          135A EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 135A 

           Nicholas looks to see if the coast is clear - then lets 
           himself out.

          136 EXT. DAY. A SECLUDED LANE. 136

           Nicholas is striding purposefully back to his car with a smug 
           post-coital grin. Then he sees that one of his tyres has been 
           let down. 

                          NICHOLAS
           Shit salad.
           He gets out his phone. Jody and Casey are in the trees
           watching, satisfied.

                         

          136A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 136A

           Beth is on the phone preparing to cook.

                          BETH
           Oh poor you. What a drag.

                         

          137 EXT. DAY. A SECLUDED LANE. 137

           Tamara is half-running down the track with a foot pump.

                         

                         138 CUT 138

                         

          139 EXT. DAY. A SECLUDED LANE. 139

           The rooks are cawing.

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes, it's a frightful bore.

           BETH (O.S.)
           Well I'll hold off on the paella.
           Tamara arrives, breathless. Nicholas signals her to keep
           quiet. She looks guilty, anxious.

                          NICHOLAS
           You're a marvel. See you soon.

                         

          140 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 140

           The line goes dead. Beth is disconcerted. Glen walks in.

                          GLEN
           Beth, could I use your printer?

                          BETH
           Nicholas is on the motorway with a
           flat tyre. But I couldn't hear
           traffic. Just rooks...

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 87.

                         

                         
           She snaps out of it. But she knows.

                          BETH
           Did you ask me to read something?

                         

          141 EXT. DAY. A SECLUDED LANE. 141

           The tyres are done. Nicholas is about to get in the car.

                          TAMARA
           Nicholas, someone knows. Maybe we 

                          SHOULD -

                          NICHOLAS
           Who cares?
           He kisses her, passionately. She is troubled but eventually
           responds. Jody nudges Casey.

                          JODY
           Casey, pap them. Pap them!
           Casey holds out her mobile and takes a picture. Then Tamara
           extricates herself from his embrace. 
           Jody peers at Casey's photo. A close-up clinch.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Fucking bingo.

          141A EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GARDEN / LANE. 141A

           Tamara, dressed for a walk, heads down the lane. She looks
           preoccupied.
           Jody appears from behind the hedge. She heads for the door,
           motioning Casey to follow.

                         

          142 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 142

           Jody is at the computer. Casey is keeping a nervous watch.

                          CASEY
           This is wrong, Jode.

                          JODY
           She's asking for it; slut. I'm 
           going to email D-List's wife. 

                          CASEY
           We should send the photo and be done
           with it.

          Jody suddenly startles.

           What?

                          JODY
           While I was sitting here. Look. An
           e-mail from Ben come in. Just like
           that, when I'm here.

                          (SHE READS:)
           `Tamara, Fran's baby has come.'

                         

          143 INT. DAY. LONDON - BEN'S WAREHOUSE FLAT. 143

           Ben is play-fighting with Boss.

           BEN (V.O.)
           And as it's a cute little brown girl
           with curly black hair I think we can
           safely say it's Steven Culley's and
           not mine. Truth is, I feel released.
           I am free! New band up and running.
           Done three songs about me and you.
           Ben throws a treat lovingly at Boss. Boss catches it.

           BEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Big favour to ask. We're recording in
           Paris. Would you have Boss?

                         

          144 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 144

           Jody continues to read.

                          JODY
           `Could drop him off next week. And
           when I'm back, maybe we could dot dot

                          CASEY
           He's coming back.

                          JODY
           Tamara doesn't deserve him, Case.

           Casey tries to stop her pressing send. Jody digs her nails
           into Casey's hand. Casey yowls. Jody presses send.

           Nicholas is writing. Beth approaches.

           There's the festival brochure. You're

           You're a marvel. Cheers.
           He kisses her and prepares to leave. She is suspicious. 

                          BETH
           I could come with you.

           Oh, don't. You hate festivals.

           But it's only Hadditon. I'll come. 

                          NICHOLAS
           It's completely boring. You'll hate

           Her suspicion will stay silent no longer.

           Have you got anything to tell me,

           Like what?
           Nicholas attacks; the best form of defence.

                          NICHOLAS
           God, it's like living with the
           effing moral police. Are you ever
           going to trust me?
           He goes.

           Nicholas drives through a huge puddle in his 4X4, splashing
           Casey. He roars on, oblivious.

           Well, things were different then.
           She had no choice. 
          Beth's mobile bleeps. She picks it up.

           She couldn't just walk away. I mean
           who'd put up with that now?

           (Looking to Andy)
           How do I find out who sent this?
          Andy takes the phone, sees the photo.

                          ANDY
           It says number withheld.
          He returns the phone.

                          BETH 
           Did you know?
          Andy nods guiltily. Beth acknowledges what this means.

                          ANDY
           Couldn't tell you. I'm sorry Beth. 
          He leaves.

                          BETH
           Her...
          Glen looks at the photo; Nicholas and Tamara's clinch.

          Oh My God. This is just - this is
          horrible.

          Right under my nose. I feel sick.

           It's so shitty, so insulting. You 
           do not deserve to be treated -

                          BETH
           If you're kind to me, I'll cry. I
           don't want to cry. I must be very
           clear.

                          GLEN
           If there is anything I can do...

                          BETH

                          (MOVING AWAY)
           I have to do it myself.
           Beth's face cracks into distress.

                          GLEN
           Hey, come on.

                          BETH
           I trod in the sponge mix.

                          GLEN
           It's OK. It's OK.

          150 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. ANDY'S CORRUGATED SHED. 150

           Tamara is out on a walk. She approaches the shed; sees Andy's
           landrover parked beside it.

                          TAMARA (CALLING)
           Andy?
           Andy emerges. Tamara smiles tentatively. 

                          TAMARA
           Hey. How are you? 
           Andy says nothing.

                          TAMARA
           Would you like to have that drink? I 
           could do with a friend / at the 
           moment and - 

                          ANDY 
           You and Nicholas Hardiment. That's a
           nice piece of work isn't it?

          Tamara is utterly dismayed.

                          ANDY
           I get it from his point of view. He's
           always been a cheating wanker. He
           loves having his cake and eating it - 
           But since when did your standards
           drop so low? You could have anyone.
           All you have to do is bat your eyes.

                          TAMARA

                          ANDY -

                          ANDY
           I care a lot about Beth. She helped
           me out when I was at rock bottom.

                          TAMARA
           I'm not going to split them up. It's

                          JUST -

                          ANDY

                          (WITH CONTEMPT)
           A bit of fun?
          Tamara is covered with shame. 

                          TAMARA 
           It's none of your bloody business. 

                          ANDY 
           I reckoned I could still see the 
           blazing girl you used to be. But now? 

                          TAMARA 
           Shut up! 

                          ANDY 
           I don't know who you are. 
          She turns away, her eyes stinging.

           Jody falls off her bed.

           That's right, yes... I love dogs.

           So I'll meet you at Winnards Farm,

           Jody is haranguing with her mum.

           It's a nice dog, Mum!

                          MUM
           Well I don't like `em. Dog-hair and
           slobber all over the place.

                          JODY
           But I said yes.

                          MUM
           No dogs, no way and that's final.
           Jody is devastated.

                          JODY
           You loser. I hate you. You want to

           RUIN MY LIFE!!!
           Jody slams her bedroom door. She stares at herself in the
           mirror. She steels herself.

           Tamara pulls Nicholas into a quiet corner.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Andy Cobb has rumbled us.

                          NICHOLAS
           Cock pie. Has he told Beth?

                          TAMARA
           I don't know. But he might. And I
           wouldn't blame him.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 94.

                         

                         

                          NICHOLAS
           Well, I suppose it has to come out 
           sometime.

                          TAMARA
           Does it? 

                          NICHOLAS
           It's a good thing. Feels like a 
           relief. Means you and I can start to 
           think about our plans. For the
           future...

                          TAMARA
           Nicholas?... 

                          NICHOLAS
           I know it's been hard, sharing me 
           with Beth. But I'm yours now. I'm 
           going to leave her. I want a new 
           life - and I want it now. With you. 
           Tamara is appalled. A minder interrupts. 

                          MINDER
           Mr Hardiment? It's time.

           During the interview, Tamara takes a seat at the end of the
           front row. The audience listens attentively.

                          NICHOLAS
           It all runs very smoothly. I start a
           book in the summer, publish it the
           following spring. Bit of a factory, 
           really. 

                          INTERVIEWER
           So you've just finished `Like The
           Night', Inchcombe's seventeenth
           adventure. Are you already planning
           the next?

                          NICHOLAS
           There won't be a next one. Frankly 
           I'm sick to death of Inchcombe. In 
           fact, I'm about to kill him off.
           There's a gust of dismay in the crowd, as though a real death
           has been announced.

                          INTERVIEWER
           That's a bombshell for your fans.

                          NICHOLAS
           (all for Tamara)
           Yes, but I'm moving on to fresh
           pastures.

           LADY IN THE CROWD
           No!

                          NICHOLAS
           Inchcombe will be meeting a very
           sticky end. And it's one murder I'm
           really looking forward to.

           LADY IN THE CROWD
           How could you?

                          INTERVIEWER
           This might be a good moment to take a
           few questions. Yes, the lady in the
           apron...

                          BETH
           You write a lot about adultery. Is
           that from personal experience?
           Tamara turns round. Nicholas' colour drains. Beth is with
           Glen, close by - glaring at him. He tries to make a joke.

                          NICHOLAS
           Madam, what a saucy question!

                          BETH
           Why do you cheat persistently on your
           wife?
           Nicholas considers whether he wants to be publicly
           humiliated. He decides not.

                          NICHOLAS
           Because she lets me.
           Beth takes this like a blow. Even Tamara is shocked by it.

                         

          156 EXT. DAY. HADDITON - THE GROUNDS BY THE MARQUEE. 156

           Tamara is striding away from the Marquee, red with shame.
           Nicholas is at her side almost jogging to keep up. 

                          TAMARA
           It's got to stop, Nicholas.

                          NICHOLAS
           You're right. I can't go on using 
           her, lying to her. Won't be fun but
           I've got to do it.

                          TAMARA

                          LISTEN -

                          NICHOLAS
           I don't feel alive with Beth! I
           haven't been living for years. She's 
           had me smothered in a comfy blanket - 

                          TAMARA
           Nicholas, listen to me.
          She makes him look at her.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           We had fun. But it's wrong. And
           it's over. 

                          NICHOLAS
           But... I'm in love with you.

                          TAMARA
           I'm sorry. 
          Nicholas looks as if he's just been punched.

                          NICHOLAS
           No. You can't end it. Tamara - Fuck
           supper!

                          TAMARA
           Will you keep it down? 

                          NICHOLAS
           My God, you're cold hearted.

                          TAMARA 
           Please don't shout. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           You don't feel a thing, do you? 

                          TAMARA
           I do feel. I feel like I'm blazing
           away inside all the time. Why do I do
           these things? What am I doing with
           you?
          The question hangs between them.

                          NICHOLAS
           There's someone else isn't there...

                          TAMARA
           Oh for God's sake. 

                          NICHOLAS
           Not that narcissist drummer? 

                          TAMARA
           Goodbye.

                          NICHOLAS
           It's that ignorant lunk isn't it?
           That muscle-bound wastrel Andy Cobb.

                          TAMARA
           Andy Cobb is a far better man than
           you!
           In saying it, Tamara realises it's true. She walks away.
           Nicholas bends almost double in pain, letting out a great
           moan from the soul. A fan has been waiting at a respectful
           distance. He approaches.
           Nicholas numbly takes his book. Instead of signing, he tears
           it to pieces. He hands the tatters back to the fan.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Thank you.

          Jody enters Tamara's bedroom. She stares at the bed. She runs
          her hand over the cotton percale. She puts on Tamara's slip
          and looks at herself in the mirror.

                          BEN
           Hello Jody...
          Jody spins round.
          The door closes. Ben is standing behind it. He is wearing a
          tight black T-shirt; the man of her dreams.

                          BEN
           Dog minder? I guessed you might be
           the somebody who's been getting in
           here, pissing about, sending e-mails
           and fucking people up. D'you know

           in.

           I didn't break in. Used the key.

           What key?

                          JODY
           Found it under a pot.

           Took it as a souvenir. I'm sorry!
          Jody is very scared. She is crying.

           gives you the right?

                          JODY
           I just... like I always wanted to
           meet you...just once...just to tell
           you stuff...

                          BEN
           What stuff?

                          JODY
           Like... I love you.

                          BEN
           So that's nice. Least someone does.

                          



                         

                         

                          JODY
           I used to lie awake thinking about
           you being here... in Ewedown, the
           bumhole of nowhere. It was the
           best thing to happen ever. I've
           been so in love with you. And when
           you left I couldn't bear it. I
           thought the valentine would make
           you come back...

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           D'you still love me, Jody? Even
           though I wanna lock you up in a
           young offenders institution?
           Jody nods, unsure.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           What would you do for me then?
           Would you do anything, like a
           proper fan?
           Jody looks at him, scared. She manages a nod. Ben approaches
           her.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Let's see then shall we?
           We see Jody's phone flashing on the bed. 

           CASEY (V.O.) 
           Jody! What are you doing not
           fucking answering?

                         

          158 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. 158

           Casey is at the triangle leaving a message on Jody's phone. 
           Boss is running round and round it.

                          CASEY
           Ben's dog. It's here. Means Ben
           must be - 
           Casey suddenly realises where Jody is. The dog runs off up 
           the street. Casey sets off towards Winnards, full of 
           apprehension.

                         

          159 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 159

           Beth is taking Nicholas' awards down and chucking them in a
           box. Glen is trying to save them from smashing.

                          BETH
           I bet that bitch wants a baby. Well
           she'll find out; Nicholas doesn't
           do children.

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           He'll leave it all up to her.

           They do, these men, second time
           round. They get all nappy-happy.
           I was barely twenty when I got
           pregnant. I've never done
           anything! Oh God! God!

                          GLEN
           Yes you have. Look at this place!

                          BETH
           I hate him - I've wasted my life! 

                          GLEN
           No... What about all the work you do
           here?

                          BETH
           Breeding goats? Baking fucking
           biscuits? It's meaningless!
          Beth bawls. Glen holds her.

                          GLEN 
           Beth... When I was lost with my
           book you helped me more than you
           know. You asked who I was writing
           it for...
          He starts to really hold her. The sobbing subsides.

                          GLEN
           You.
          He kisses her. Beth looks at Glen; a revelation. The future
          opens up. She kisses him back.

                          NICHOLAS
           Excuse me.
          Nicholas is standing in the doorway, looking grey.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           May I speak with my wife?
          Glen releases Beth.

                          BETH
           No. You may not.
          She walks away.

           Beth walks outside towards the chicken coup. Nicholas pursues
           her. She sees Boss running across the grounds chasing birds.

                          NICHOLAS
           It's over.

                          BETH
           That's Ben Sergeant's dog. Perhaps 
           he's come to beat the shit out of 
           you - good! 

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth - I finished it. She's been

                          BETH 

                          LIAR - 

                          NICHOLAS 
           There's something desperate about 
           her, something almost unhinged - 

                          BETH
           Good God, even when you try and 
           tell the truth you lie. YOU LIE!!
           Nicholas is falling apart.

                          BETH
           I want you to leave. I want a
           divorce. I want Stonefield.

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth...Don't. You can't.

                          BETH
           I will.

                          (TO BOSS)
           And you - Go home! Bugger Off!!
           She throws a handful of chicken feed at him. Boss runs away.
           Beth storms off.
           Nicholas looks profoundly shocked; like a man who has just
           realised he's in danger of drowning.

           Right. Now put two sugars in and
           stir it. OK. That's a decent cup.
           Which is lucky Jody cos if it had

           Boss is lolloping round. He stops. The whole herd of cows is
           staring at him. Boss regards the animals with curiosity. He
           wags his tail. Will they play? He starts to bark.

                         

          163 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS. 163

           Nicholas sees Glen sitting on the edge of an old rusting
           trough. Fury overwhelms him. 

                          NICHOLAS
           Oy! Greg! I want a a word with you.

                          GLEN
           It's Glen, asshole.
           Nicholas is stomping through the mud and cowshit. 

                          NICHOLAS
           You fucking devious bastard.

           And I fucking pay for it. I've 
           given Beth all this. What can you

           wouldn't be so proud.

                          NICHOLAS

                          (SHOVING HIM)
           You cunt.

                          GLEN
           Fuck you.
          Glen grabs him round the middle. They struggle like overgrown
          schoolboys.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Beth'll come to her senses. You
           need an income to run Stonefield.
           And mine's bigger than yours!
          Glen nuts him. Nicholas slips backwards in the mud. He whacks
          his skull on the sharp, rusting corner of the trough. He
          falls to the ground. Glen is astonished at his own prowess.

                          GLEN
           Now... get up, Nicholas. Let's talk
           about this like grown men.
          Blood trickles from the wound on Nicholas' head. He moans.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           Oh my God. Nicholas...
          Glen becomes aware of a sound like a drumbeat, the drumming
          of hooves. The herd of cows come over the brow of the hill
          and down towards them. Boss is chasing them, barking. The
          beasts are terrified, stampeding.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 104.

                         

                         
           They are heading straight for the trough. Nicholas is trying
           to get up on his knees.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           Nicholas! Get up! Run!
           Glen puts out a hand to help him. But before Nicholas
           notices, he instinctively retrieves it.
           Glen turns on his heels and runs, terrified. He throws
           himself into the hedge as the cows thunder past. They
           disappear down the hill, Boss still behind them.
           Glen looks back towards the water trough. Nicholas is lying
           on his front, his face pressed into the mud, unmoving.
           Glen walks over. He gingerly peers at him. The back of
           Nicholas' skull is broken open. Blood is pooling in the mud
           and shit. Glen panics. He looks all around. Has the accident
           been seen?
           No human is visible. Has his part in it been noticed? He
           bends down as if to turn the body over, in case by some
           miracle Nicholas still lives. He cannot bring himself to
           touch him. Fear overwhelms him. He runs away.

           It was you?
           Jody can't look her in the eye.

           Tamara... 
           It's an apology. Tamara takes Ben's hand and leads him 
           through to a dresser in the hall. She opens it.

           Boss is still worrying the herd. He's got them against a
           gate. The animals are very distressed. Behind them we see
           Andy's Landrover appear.

          165A EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM) 165A

           Andy gets out of his Landrover, takes out his rifle, comes

           As his finger tightens on the trigger.
           Bang. A shot rings out. He looks round, off right.

           Up on the ridge of the hill, Penny Upminster is standing in a
           straw hat and flowery wellies, with a smoking gun.

                          PENNY
           Got `im. The beast.

           Beth, chucking fan mail into the bin, stops in her tracks.

                         

          167A EXT. DAY. WINNARD'S FARM. 167A

           Tamara's head appears at the front door.

           Beth is coming down the field where Nicholas lies. She sees a
           figure in the distance. She squints, the sun in her eyes.

                         

          168D EXT. DAY. COPSE (LARKHAM'S) 168D

           Opposite her she sees Tamara descending through the copse.

                         

          169 EXT. DAY. FIELD. (LARKHAMS) 169

           Tamara, walking down by the trough, discovers Nicholas' body.
           She drops to her knees, light-headed with shock.

                         

          170 EXT. DAY. FIELD. 170

           Beth walks into the field. She sees Tamara kneeling, looking
           at something on the other side of the trough.

                          BETH
           Bitch.
           Tamara looks up.

                          TAMARA
           Beth - no -

                          BETH
           Brazen. That is brazen.
           Beth carries on walking towards her.

                          TAMARA
           Beth. Don't.
           Tamara is running towards Beth. She cannot bear her to see.
           She throws her arms around her, protecting her.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Don't look. Don't look...
           It is too late. Beth is seeing the corpse. A great wave of
           shock hits her. Tamara holds her tight, trying to contain it.
           Another great wave of shock.

                          BETH
           Nicholas. No.
           Her cries of grief soar over the valley.

                         

          171 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD - LATER. 171

           Tamara, ashen, is on the phone to emergency services. 

                          TAMARA 
           You'll get to it through Byley farm. 
           His skull is broken. It's smashed. No 
           I haven't but... it's obvious. His 
           wife. Yes she is. Thank you. Thank 
           you. I will. 
           Beth has turned Nicholas over. She is washing the mud from 
           his face with water from the trough.

                          TAMARA 
           They're on their way... 
           Beth seems totally closed off. Tamara gingerly approaches. 
           She touches Beth's shoulder.

                          TAMARA
           Beth? Help is coming - 
           Beth cannot bear to be touched. Her hand involuntarily flies
           out. It slams into Tamara's face.
           Tamara steps back. Her nose is broken, pouring blood.

                          TAMARA 
           It's broken! - 
           She gasps, riding the pain, knowing she deserves it. It's the 
           biggest wake-up call of her life.
           Beth stares at her, at first astonished at what she has done -
           then satisfied. Tamara stumbles away.

                         

          171A EXT. DAY. IN THE COPSE. LATER. 171A 

           Tamara sits beside a dewpond, gingerly washing the blood off
           her face.

                          ANDY
           Tamara...
           Andy is watching. She turns away from him. He approaches. 

                          TAMARA 
           I'm sorry. 
           She starts crying bitter tears.

                          ANDY
           Tam, come on. It was an accident.
          Still Tamara cries. He comforts her. She lets him. He holds 
          her for some time. 

                          ANDY
           I'd better get up to Stonefield. Come
           with me. We'll get this sorted.

           Tamara shakes her head. She separates herself from him and
           stands.

                          ANDY
           Then get Ben to take you to London. 
           Make sure he looks after you.
           Tamara walks a few paces away. She stares straight ahead.

                          TAMARA
           I don't want to be with Ben. 
           She looks back at Andy. He begins to understand. She walks 
           off.

                         

          171B INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. GLEN'S ROOM. 171B 

           Glen, sick with dread, is drying his face with a towel. He 
           picks up his muddy shoes and clothes, wraps them in a bag and 
           shoves them in his case. 
           His eyes alight on his poster of Thomas Hardy. He pulls it 
           down. 

                         

          172 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GARDEN. 172 

           Ben and the girls have dug a grave for Boss. Casey is putting
           flowers on the top. Ben starts to cry like a broken-hearted 
           little boy. Jody instinctively puts her arms round him. The
           girls are immensely moved. Jody looks over at Casey. She

                          MOUTHS:

                          JODY
           Pap me! Pap me!
           Casey waits until Ben is not looking. Then she takes pictures
           with her mobile phone. Jody cradles Ben in her arms, doing
           her best moved-but-sultry pose. Casey tries not to laugh.
           Jody is ecstatic. The man of her dreams is in her arms. Her
           wish has come true.

                         

          172A EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE COURTYARD. 172A

           An ambulance and two police cars are in the courtyard. The
           police are carrying the corpse, covered in blankets. Andy
           crosses the yard to the barn. He bumps into Glen furtively
           coming out of the door. Glen's case is packed.

                          ANDY
           What are you doing?
           Glen can't look him in the eye.

          I figured I'd best, you know, take
          myself off. She doesn't want
          writers around the place now. And

           I'm not running away! I just
           finished my book; my time here is
           up. Destiny calls.

                          ANDY
           Beth is asking for you.

                          GLEN
           She's... Really?

                          ANDY
           She's on her own over there. Glen,
           she doesn't need a writer around
           the place. She needs a man.

           Beth is sitting, still pale with shock, her hands around a
           mug of tea. Glen approaches.

                          GLEN
           I'm so sorry.
           Beth looks up at him despairingly.

                          GLEN
           Do they... suspect anyone? I mean
           of like Foul Play?

                          BETH
           It was my fault. I let the dog go!

           No, no...

                          BETH
           I shooed him away! The police said
           it was an accident but...

                          GLEN 
           It wasn't your fault! 

                          BETH 
           What I don't understand is why was
           he in that field anyway? He hated
           cows. And when they were coming,
           why didn't he get out of their way?

           For a moment, confession and silence hang in the balance.
           Glen opens his mouth to speak.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           You live in the country. You share
           it with those dangerous beasts. And
           when they're scared, they run. Like
           we do...
           Glen is full of horror at his lie.
           But Beth is only grateful.

                          BETH
           Glen. Stay with me.
           Her eyes, still red with grief, are full of their future
           together.
           Glen nods. He will stay. He wants it all.
           Beth leans into him, seeking comfort. He puts his arms around
           her, his face ashen with the weight of his secret.
           As he holds her, he looks around the room. Nicholas is
           everywhere, glaring down at him from photographs.

                         

          176 EXT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM - THE GARDEN. 176

           Tamara is in the garden, a strip on her nose. She sees Andy
           in the dusk. He's leaning against the gate watching her.

                          TAMARA
           Don't say anything.

                          ANDY
           Kind of suits you. And I always did
           like the old one.
           They are in each others arms. The embrace lasts and lasts.
           Tamara is leading Andy up to the house.

                          TAMARA
           You did it on purpose, didn't you?

                          ANDY
           What?

                          TAMARA
           Made it so beautiful I'd never be
           able to leave.

                          ANDY
