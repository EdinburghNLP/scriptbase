<b>          1 INT. CAR ENGINE - NIGHT. 1
</b>                         
           We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only
           as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over
           the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.
                         
<b>           DRIVER O/S
</b>           ...hundred thousand streets in this city,
           you don't need to know the route. You give
           me a time and place, I give you a five
           minute window. Those five minutes I'm
           yours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute
           either side you're on your own...
                         
           As the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO:
                         
<b>          2 INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2
</b>                         
           A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different
           routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -
                         
<b>           DRIVER O/S
</b>           ...One last thing. You won't be able to
           reach me at this number again...
                         
           DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it
           in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly
           packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
           cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA
           Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.
                         
<b>          3 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT. 3
</b>                         
           Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel
           bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night
           out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his
           way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle
                         
<b>          4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4
</b>                         
           The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is
           only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the
           passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.
           Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives
           carefully, letting other cars overtake.
                         
<b>          5 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 5
</b>                         
           Driver glides into the parking lot of another low-rent apartment
           block.
<b>                          2
</b><b>                          9/24/10
</b>                         
                         
                         
                         
<b>          6 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 6
</b>                         
           Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park
           elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a
           pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes
           meet briefly, before Driver walks on.
                         
<b>          7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7
</b>                         
           Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new
           apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,
           sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He
           tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.
                         
<b>          8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8
</b>                         
           Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on
           the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food
           shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage
           lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -
           vintage cars.
                         
<b>          9 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 9
</b>                         
           SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver
           follows him past rows of vintage cars.
                         
<b>                          SHANNON
</b>           ...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but
           with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside.
           You get any sleep?
                         
<b>                          DRIVER
</b>           Not this week.
                         
           As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them.
                         
<b>                          SHANNON
</b>           I can offer you some Halcyon.
                         
<b>                          DRIVER
</b>           Won't work.
                         
           They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they
           arrive at a plain looking Impala.
                         
<b>                          SHANNON
</b>           There she is. Silver Impala. Most popular
           car in the state of California...
                         
           Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds
           out his hand for the keys.

</b>                         
           The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.
           Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows
           of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's
           9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.
                         
<b>          11 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 11
</b>                         
           A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.
           Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees
           signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,
           making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,
           the basketball commentator is getting more excited.
                         
<b>                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
</b>           ...This is some comeback from the Clippers!
           Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and
           buried!...
                         
           Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld
           scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.
           Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
           commentary now.
                         
<b>                          POLICE SCANNER
</b>           ...9 Adam 81, what is your current

<b>                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
</b>           ...Another unbelievable three pointer from
           Davis and the Clippers are within five!...
                         
           Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He
           doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with
           bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them
           pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and
           blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.
           The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.
                         
<b>                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY

           The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the
           commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
                         
           The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's
           going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three
           minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel
           bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car
           without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.

           The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police
           scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.
           His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering
           what's happened to his partner.
                         
           Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on
           his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
                         
           Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as
           fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a
           few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.

           Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle
           Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady
           speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their
           masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in
           his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as
           his police scanner crackles to life.

           Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He
           switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.

           The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and
           out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.
           It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or
           probing to see if there's anyone out there.

           It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver
           taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays
           there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the
           same direction as the black-and-white.

           It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white
           at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars
           won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way
           through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being
           shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.

           Driver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car
           swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,
           anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In
           the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
           chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
                         
           Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching
           helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They
           just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting
           closer and closer.
                         
           Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,
           there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver
           slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
           chopper's searchlights spot them.

           The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is
           crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS
           can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of
           the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again.

           Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.
           Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing
           factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.
           The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the
           basketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he
           sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway.

           There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in
           behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is
           still playing.

           The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a

           approaching in the opposite direction.

           Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He
           turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.

           glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper
           overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging
           its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
                         
           Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way
           of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around

           Driver floors the gas, screeching out of the alleyway. He
           swerves between several oil drums then straightens up on the
           main road.

           The Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles
           an hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel.
                         
           Driver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as
           his Black-and-White goes careening off the road. He keeps the
           car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips
           end over end.

           Bright sunlight. In the distance we see a trail of dust moving
           across the flatland. Everything is silent, then slowly the hum
           of an engine rises as the stock car turns towards us. It
           shimmers in the heat waves, the noise of its engine getting
           louder as it picks up speed.
                         
           Shannon stands with his friend Bernie Rose at the edge of the
           makeshift track, staring at the glittering car with its colorful
           signage advertising everything from Snickers to Cheerios.

           Even in the cramped space of the roll cage there's something
           effortless about the way Driver controls the car. His eyes are
           fixed in concentration, his body tensing only slightly as he
           lifts his foot off the gas and turns the wheel.

           again, moving even faster now. The STOCK CAR'S OWNER, a bearded
           hot-rodder with a t-shirt that says, "Drive it like you stole

           Driver smiles politely, gazing back at him. The stock car's

           Tinny supermarket music plays in the background. Driver walks
           past the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the
           choice. Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his
           eye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is
           browsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her
           is a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack
           of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly
           picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single
           snicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy
           turns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle
           before Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself.

           Irene sits in a battered Oldsmobile, trying to start the engine.
           She tries several times then gets out in frustration, opening
           the hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix.

           his car and drive away, but as he feels Irene's increasing
           frustration he can't help himself, finally heading over to help.

           like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a

           from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS

           to sleep. He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit

           with intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly.
           Driver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the
           longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a
           weapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in
           his eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass.

           little uncertain.

           Their eyes stay on each other, the attraction palpable. Driver
           finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the
           door. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes. Driver
           knows he could kiss her, wants to, but something inside holds
           him back. Instead he just offers his help.

           beside him, mimicking his expression, trying to make him relax.

           Irene emerges with Benicio from the dentists. The little boy is
           clutching his mouth, making a show of being in pain. Irene
           teases him gently as they walk. Driver waits for them in his
           car, watching them quietly.

           seat with a smile. Driver looks at her curiously as he drives,
           no idea why she's grinning. Benicio suddenly leans forward and
           changes the radio to a different station -- hard rock blaring
           out. Driver lets it go for a moment, then changes it back.
           Benicio responds, until it becomes a game, Irene laughing now.

           confronting the villains, the screen flickering from color to
           black and white. Driver and Benicio sit on the couch, watching

           Driver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens
           to the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings.
           Irene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads
           over, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN
           who's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.

           She hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the
           back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his.
                         
           The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare
           out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her

           Irene is finding the party overwhelming too. She heads out into
           the corridor to have a cigarette when she sees Driver across the
           hallway, locking the door to his own apartment. She hesitates,
           then calls out.

           A noise of hammering and drills. The corporate signage has been

           has bought his partner Nino to the garage to take a look at his

           then the motor.

           I paid three hundred for that. The money
           goes on the inside not the outside.

           Driver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of
           foreboding. Standard enters the pawn shop. Driver starts his
           stopwatch now, listening to the seconds tick away.
                         
           He casts his eyes around the street, observing the smallest
           details -- the number plates of other vehicles; the windows of
           overlooking buildings.
                         
           The white hot sun blazes down, reflecting on the pawn shop
           windows, hiding everything inside.
                         
           The police scanner crackles but picks up no activity. Driver
           listens to his stop watch, in his own world. He starts the
           engine and sets off, cruising slowly past the pawn shop, heading
           for the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting.
                         
           He pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something.
           Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle
           glinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different
           from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out.
           For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers
           and racing tires.
                         
           Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from
           the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting
           Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment.
                         
           But there's no sign of them.
                         
           The seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his
           instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is,
           thinking of Irene.
                         
           Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop,
           Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand.

           He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the
           crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on
           his face as he spins around.
                         
           A GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in
           an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The
           force of the bullets sends Standard flying.
                         
           Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from
           his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into
           the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look
           at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots
           crack behind him.
                         
           As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly
           comes to life, pulling out of its parking place.

           Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on
           his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just
           following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips
           open the gym bag, then stares in shock.

           There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed
           inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror,
           but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an
           intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running
           them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler
           draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.

           Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the
           corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't
           move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start
           honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at
           speed.
                         
           The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.
                         
           Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no
           match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He
           weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between
           himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for
           move, staying on his tail.
                         
           In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.

           Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a
           deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make
           the same turn. It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose
           pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle. 
                         
           Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and
           regains control of his car.
                         
           The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into
           him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver
           pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the
           Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.
                         
           Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road,
           Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang
           closing fast.
                         
           It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated
           for an instant.
                         
           The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...
                         
           Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with
           construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his
           pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going,
           spinning 270 degrees.
                         
           The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the
           maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a
           corner he can't control. 
                         
           The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a
           sickening crunch of metal on metal.

           A soap opera plays on the TV. Driver walks back into the motel
           room. Blanche lies on the bed, looking more relaxed. Driver
           picks up the remote and flicks through the channels until he
           finally finds a breaking news story on the robbery. There is a
           police mug-shot of Standard on screen.

           Driver listens to the report in silence. Blanche seems upset
           again, confronted with the reality of what's happened.

           where she's just been lying. It's her cell phone. Still flipped
           open as if she's called someone recently.
                         
           Driver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette
           of a MAN crossing the curtains. Someone's outside. The door
           handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly
           there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom.
                         
           Driver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door.
           He has to barge it open, something obstructing his way.

           Driver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts
           through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her
           head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a
           big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom
           window where he just shot her.
                         
           Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he
           can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The
           hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his
           forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.
                         
           Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into
           the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as
           they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls
           the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the
           hitman and grabs his shotgun.

           In the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open.
           Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time --
           firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks
           up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag
           doll.
                         
           The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as
           it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and
           his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter
           all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead
           man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.
                         
           Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his
           pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys.

           Irene begins to see the guilt in his eyes and slowly it hits
           her. She stares in disbelief, reeling.

           Driver glances at him and he smiles, biding his time. The lights
           on the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they
           reach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for
           him to go out first. He nods goodnight and heads off into the

           suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his
           eye.
                         
           A beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling
           her to the ground. In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of
           the darkness, opening fire with his automatic.
                         
           Bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other
           parked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering
           her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst.
                         
           More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the
           car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.
                         
           Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan
           Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of
           parked cars.

           Driver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She
           looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if
           all her worst fears have been confirmed.
                         
           Driver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps
           approaching.
                         
           He holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and
           runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire.
                         
           Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up
           the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him,
           reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.
                         
           Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his
           chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming
           and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.
                         
           Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing
           footsteps.
                         
           Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the
           time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his
           pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a
           car.
                         
           Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs
           him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.
                         
           Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She
           picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.
                         
           Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the
           resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs
           him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.
                         
           The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering
           Tan Suit's skull.
                         
           Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the
           elevator, framed against the light.
                         
           She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.
                         
           Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The
           elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.

           Nino doesn't look at Cook, a clear indication he should do as
           he's told. Cook stands up, humiliated, and walks over to the
           windows. Bernie Rose waits for Nino to explain.

           Cook hesitates, thinking Bernie's fucking with him for having
           two broken hands. He stares back dumbly and it's the final
           straw. Bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it
           in his eye. As Cook screams, Bernie takes a knife and buries it
           in his neck. He twists the knife deeper for good measure, then
           with one powerful sweep of his arm clears Cook off the table.

           background we see a DIRECTOR blocking out an action scene.
           Driver walks past without even a glance, heading towards the
           make-up trailer. He opens the door and walks in, looking around
           the trailer until he finds what he's looking for -- the SFX mask
           he saw previously on the film set.

           Shannon limps down the steps from his office with a suitcase in

           The impact is momentous. The huge Continental is lifted up in

           unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck.

           Driver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the
           pulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach
           but doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the
           other passengers are dead, then heads on.

           Nino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He
           looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps
           running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear
           clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.
                         
           Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the
           ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves
           and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries
           to wade out further, the ocean drags him back.

           Driver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more
           and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any
           hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water,
           barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces
           Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.
                         
           They stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver
           silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean.
           Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in
           him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then
           grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino
           splutters as Driver lets him up again.

           part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's
           no trace of emotion in his voice.

           He sees Bernie Rose sitting at a table on his own, pouring

           Driver's car is parked at the back of the parking lot, half
           hidden by a fenced area for garbage. Driver pops the trunk,
           taking out the black gym bag with the cash. Bernie Rose doesn't
           even look at it, still admiring the car.

           Driver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's
           hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into
           Driver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this
           time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to
           his throat.
                         
           Their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something
           like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking
           deeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he
           dies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then
           Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight.
                         
           Blood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and
           puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut.

           We're looking down on an enormous parking lot, hundreds of
           different colored vehicles gleaming down below. Driver pulls
           into the lot, searching for a place to park.

           Driver climbs out of his car, wearing a jacket over his blood-
           soaked shirt. He walks to the back of the car, kneels down, and
           hides the keys behind the left rear wheel, drops of blood
           dripping on the tarmac beneath him. He gets up again, then sets
           off through the maze of parked vehicles, dialling a number on
           his cell-phone.
