     MYRTLE - You're sure Uncle Elwood won't
     come back and spoil everything after the
     guests arrive?

     VETA - Oh of course not, dear. Your uncle
     always spends the afternoon down town at
     those filthy bars and taverns. You know
     that. I'll go tell the cateress to get
     started. Why, Miss Johnson, what are you

     minute ago and he stopped and he spoke to
     me.

     our party, did you?

     he gave me his card. Here! And then he
     introduced me to somebody.

     VETA - To whom?

     MISS JOHNSON - Do you think I'd stay in
     this house after that?

     VETA - Oh - uh -

     MYRTLE - Oh mother, people get run over by
     trucks every day. Why can't something like
     that happen to Uncle Elwood?

     VETA - Myrtle Mae Simmons! I'm ashamed of
     you. Even if people do call your uncle
     peculiar, he is still my baby brother and
     this thing is not his fault.

     MYRTLE - Whose fault is it then?

     make sense. She couldn't make out her will
     after she died, could she?

     VETA - Oh Myrtle, don't be didactic. It's
     not becoming in a young girl. Besides, men
     loathe it.

     VETA - Now, Myrtle, dear - you know the
     whole idea of this party this afternoon is

     look what he does with it. Oh, show some
     poise, dear. I want you to charm Mrs.

     Uncle Elwood comes home.

     SANDERSON - Naturally these things aren't
     easy for the families of patients. I
     understand. Won't you sit down, Mrs.
     Simmons?

     VETA - Thank you.

     SANDERSON - Now, tell me, how long has it
     been since you first noticed any
     peculiarities in your brother's actions?

     VETA - Well as a baby he was perfectly
     normal...I know - I was his big sister and
     I had to change him - babies do need
     changing, you know, but I noticed that he
     seemed to - different after we came back -
     after Mother had died. Myrtle Mae and I

     you never heard of? If you don't call that

     excess is.

He writes as she talks -

     VETA - Well yes, I say definitely Elwood
     drinks, and I want him committed out here
     permanently because I cannot stand another

     would have been a little bit kinder of
     mother if she'd written us about him,
     Doctor - now be honest, don't you?

     SANDERSON - Well - I really couldn't
     answer that question.

     rabbit myself. Uh! Now --

     SANDERSON - Mrs. Simmons!

     VETA --isn't that terrible? And what's
     more, he's every bit as big as Elwood says
     he is. Now don't ever tell that to anybody,
     Doctor. I'm ashamed of it. (SOBS)

     SANDERSON - Mrs. Simmons, I can see that
     you've been under a great nervous strain
     latetly.

     VETA - Oh you just try living with those

     KELLY - I had to give a hypo to upper
     nine.

     SANDERSON - I want you to telephone this
     Elwood P. Dowd right away. His sister's
     condition is serious.

     KELLY - Uh - but, Doctor, I --

     SANDERSON - He'll have to sign these
     commitment papers for her.

     KELLY - But I didn't know the woman needed
     the treatment! She said it was her brother!

     SANDERSON - Of course she did! That's the
     oldest dodge in the world. Always used by
     a cunning type of psychopath. She knew her
     brother was about to commit her so she
     came down here to discredit him. Get him
     on the phone, please.

     KELLY - But, Doctor, I thought the woman
     was all right, so I had Wilson take the
     brother up to Number Twenty-four - South
     Wing, G. He's there now.

     SANDERSON - You had Wilson take the brother
     in?! Come on, Miss Kelly, no gags, please!
     You're not serious, are you?

     KELLY - Oh, I did, Doctor, I - I did.
     Doctor, I'm terribly sorry.

     SANDERSON - Oh, you're terribly sorry!
     Well, that's fine! That - that fixes
     everything! That's just wonderful! No -
     oh, no! Kelly! Kelly, do you realize what
     you've done? This man Dowd can sue us for
     false commitment! He can own the whole
     sanitarium -- and I'll be kicked out of
     here faster than you can say stupid,
     incompetent and inefficient!

     to. You know that, don't you, Dr.
     Sanderson?

     SANDERSON - Miss Kelly, this is hardly the
     time or place to go into the balcony scene
     from Romeo and Juliet!

     KELLY - Lately, Doctor, there's never any
     time or place!

     SANDERSON - Jeepers! They may be putting
     him in the hydro room right now! Get up
     there quick and see if you can get him
     down here! I'll break the news gently to
     Dr. Chumley. He may want to handle this
     himself.

      KELLY - Well, what shall I say to Mr.
     Dowd? What'll I do? He'll probably be so
     furious he'll refuse to come down here!

     SANDERSON - Look, Miss Kelly, he's

     isn't he?

     don't I do what she wants - and then go
     with you?

     KELLY - That won't be necessary, Mr. Dowd.

     ELWOOD - All right. Well - good-bye, my
     dear. You could've had a bath, too.

     KELLY - I've already had a bath.

     ELWOOD - Oh, Miss Kelly, I wasn't speaking
     to you. I was speaking to my friend --

     DUNPHY - Mr. Dowd -- I take a bath every

     SANDERSON - Oh, no - the responsibility is
     all mine.

     ELWOOD - Well, your attitude may be old-
     fashioned, Doctor, but I like it. Like it
     very much.

     SANDERSON - Of course, if I had seen your
     sister first - this would've been an
     entirely different story.

     ELWOOD - Well, now - there you surprise
     me. I think the world and all of Veta, but
     I had supposed she'd seen her day.

     SANDERSON - Oh, you mustn't attach too
     much blame to her, Mr. Dowd. You see,
     she's a very sick woman. Why, she came in
     here insisting that you needed treatment.
     Now, that's - that's perfectly ridiculous.

     ELWOOD - Oh, well, Veta shouldn't be upset
     about me. I get along fine.

     SANDERSON - She was extremely upset and
     plunged right away into a heated tirade
     about your drink- --

     SANDERSON - Her alcoholism isn't the basis
     for my diagnosis. It was when she became
     so emotional about this - this big white
     rabbit, uh - Harvey. Yes - I believe she
     called him Harvey.

     ELWOOD - Well, Harvey's his name. Uh,
     Doctor, before we go any further, I must
     insist you and Miss Kelly allow me to
     introduce you to a friend--

     SANDERSON - Now, let me make my point,
     please, Mr. Dowd.

     ELWOOD - Yes.

     SANDERSON - I think that your sister's
     condition stems from trauma.

     ELWOOD - From what?

     SANDERSON - Uh - trauma - spelled
     T-R-A-U-M-A. It means shock. There's
     nothing unusual about it. There's the
     birth trauma - the shock of being --

     ELWOOD - Uh-huh. Well, I've always wanted
     Veta to have everything she needs.

     SANDERSON - Exactly.

     ELWOOD - Uh - but I wouldn't want Veta to
     stay out here unless she liked it out here
     and wants to stay here.

     SANDERSON - Well, if this were an ordinary
     delusion - something reflected on the
     memory picture - that would be one thing.
     But this - this is more serious. It stands
     to reason nobody has ever seen a white
     rabbit six feet high.

     ELWOOD - Well, not very often, Doctor.

     SANDERSON - So she must be committed here
     temporarily. Under the circumstances, I'd
     commit my own grandmother.

     ELWOOD - Does your grandmother drink, too?

     SANDERSON - That's just an expression.
     Now, here are the commitment papers for
     you to sign and here's a visitor's pass.
     You can come and see her whenever you
     like.

     ELWOOD - Yeah - well, I think maybe you'd
     better have Veta do this, Doctor. She
     always does all the signing and managing
     for our family. She's good at it.

     on going with this. I'd like to invite
     you to come downtown with me and we'll go
     to a charming little place called

     KELLY - Oh - well, I'm sorry but we're on
     duty now.

     SANDERSON - Yeah - give us a rain-check on
     it. Some other time we'd be glad to.

     Uh - Miss Kelly and I are on duty until

     I'll be waiting for you. It's at Twelfth

     to become friends with a very dear friend

     MRS. CHUMLEY - If I meet your friend
     inside, I'll be glad to give him a message
     for you.

     ELWOOD - Would you do that for me? I
     certainly would appreciate that. Just tell
     him to meet me downtown - if he has no
     other plans.

     downtown?

     MYRTLE - And all he did was get a big
     rabbit.

     JUDGE - Yeah, I know. He's had that rabbit

     MYRTLE - A man? What did he do?

     VETA - What did he do? He grabbed hold of
     me and he took me in there and then he --
     (SOBS) Oh-ho-ho.

     JUDGE - Go on, Veta Louise. Go on, girl.

     MYRTLE - Go on, mother. Poor mother. Was
     he a young man?

     JUDGE - Myrtle Mae, perhaps you'd better
     leave the room.

     MYRTLE - Now? I should say not! Go on,
     mother.

     JUDGE - Well what did he do, Veta?

     VETA - He took me upstairs and he tore my
     clothes off. (SOBS)

     on, Mother.

     VETA - And then he dumped me down in a tub
     of water.

     MYRTLE - Oh, for heaven's sake.

     JUDGE - By Godfrey, I'll sue them for this!

     VETA - I always thought that what you were
     showed in your face. Don't you believe it,
     Judge. Don't you believe it, Myrtle Mae -
     that man grabbed hold of me like I was a
     woman of the streets - but I fought. I
     always said that if a man jumped at me,
     I'd fight. Haven't I always said that,
     Myrtle Mae?

     MYRTLE - She's always said that, Judge.
     That's what Mother's always told me to do.

     VETA - Well he hustled me into the
     sanitarium and dumped me down in that tub
     of water and treated me as though I was
     a --

     MYRTLE - A what?

     VETA - A crazy woman. But he did that just
     for spite.

     VETA - Judge Gaffney, is that all those
     doctors do in places like that? Think
     about sex?

     JUDGE - I don't know.

     VETA - Because if it is they ought to be
     ashamed of themselves. It's all in their
     heads anyway. Why don't they get out and
     take long walks in the fresh air? Judge
     Gaffney walked everywhere for years,
     didn't you, Judge?

     MYRTLE - Didja?

     JUDGE - I'd better take some notes on
     this. You said - one of the doctors came
     up to - to talk to you?

     VETA - Yes - Dr. Sanderson - but don't pay
     any attention to anything he says. He's a
     liar. Close-set eyes. They're always liars.
     Besides I told him something in strictest
     confidence and he blabbed it. You can't
     trust anyone.

     MYRTLE - What did you tell him, Mother?

     VETA - Oh, well I - uh - what difference
     does it make? I don't want to - to think
     about it. I don't want to talk about it.
     (WHIMPERS)

     JUDGE - Anything you told Dr. Sanderson
     you can tell us, Veta Louise. This is your
     daughter and I'm your lawyer.

     VETA - I know which is which - I don't
     want to talk about it - I want to sue them
     and I want to get upstairs to my own bed.
     I should never have tried to do anything
     about Elwood - something protects him -
     that awful Pooka -

     MYRTLE - Uh where is Uncle Elwood?

     VETA - Well how should I know? They let

     something quickly. I took a course in art
     last winter. I learned the difference
     between a fine oil painting and a
     mechanical thing - like a photograph. The
     photograph shows only the reality. The
     painting shows not only the reality, but
     the dream behind it. It's our dreams,
     Doctor, that carry us on. They separate
     us from the beasts - I wouldn't want to
     go on living if I thought it was all just
     eating and sleeping and taking my clothes
     off - I mean putting them on. Oh - oo-oo!
     Oh, Doctor!

     CHUMLEY - Mrs. Simmons - steady now -

     VETA MOANS & SCREAMS AD LIBS

     CHUMLEY - Steady - don't get excited.
     Everything's going to be all right.

     CHUMLEY - Oh - I'm very glad to hear that.

     VETA - Elwood's been here. He's been here,
     Doctor.

     CHUMLEY - Now, now, now. Better be quiet.

     VETA - Oh! (MOANS)

     CHUMLEY - I'll take it. Hello - yes, yes.
     Who's calling? (INDISTINCT) It's your
     brother.

     VETA - Let me talk to him.

     CHUMLEY - Yes - well, now - be careful.
     Don't let him know that I'm here. Be
     casual.

     VETA - No, I won't - yes - yes, I'll be
     casual. Yes, yes. Hello, Elwood. Where are
     you, dear?

     VETA - All right - hello, Elwood - yes,
     dear. Harvey's here. Why don't you come
     home? It won't work - he wants us to
     call Harvey to the telephone.

     CHUMLEY - Well - uh - say Harvey's here,
     but he can't come to the phone because
     he's in the bathtub.

     VETA - Oh, Doctor!

     CHUMLEY - We've got to do it, Mrs. Simmons.

     VETA - El-Elwood - yes, dear. Harvey is

     the sanitarium where he belongs. I want
     to observe the expression on his face when
     he talks to this rabbit. He does talk to
     the rabbit you say?

     VETA - Oh, they tell each other everything.

     CHUMLEY - Good - what?

     VETA - I said, yes, he talks to him, but,
     Doctor--

     CHUMLEY - Oh.

     VETA --don't go out there. You'll regret
     it if you do.

     CHUMLEY - Nonsense, Mrs. Simmons. You
     underestimate me.

     VETA - No, no - you underestimate my brother.

     CHUMLEY - Don't worry - I can handle him.

     SANDERSON - I think you've been working
     too hard, Kelly.  You're getting neurotic.

     KELLY - Now don't start analyzing me. Save
     your psychiatry for your next job.

     SANDERSON - I'm not using psychiatry, Miss
     Kelly - and let me give you a little friendly
     advice - that chip on your shoulder stems
     from a persecution complex that undoubtedly
     goes back to childhood.

      KELLY - Well thanks so much for the case

     again. Almost. But I've told it all.

     KELLY - You're sure?

     ELWOOD - I'm quite sure. But ask me again,
     anyway, won't you? I - I liked that warm
     tone you had in your voice just then.

     SANDERSON - So did I.

     ELWOOD - But maybe we'd better go
     someplace else. Miss Kelly seems to be a
     little unhappy.

     SANDERSON - No-no - let's stay right here.
     Kelly's all right.

     ELWOOD - Perhaps you'd like to dance, Miss
     Kelly?

     KELLY - All right, Mr. Dowd - if you'd
     like to.

     ELWOOD - Oh, n-not I. No, I - I used to
     dance. I - I haven't danced in years. I -
     I'm sure Dr. Sanderson'd love to dance
     with somebody as lovely as you. Hm?

     ELWOOD - Oh, all right, if you want me to.
     I - it seemed to be so pleasant out here.

     Flea Hop - and - and let's see, uh - the -
     Black Bottom, the - Varsity Drag -- I don't
     know - I just don't seem to have any time

     KELLY - What is it you do, Mr. Dowd?

     ELWOOD - Oh, Harvey and I sit in the bars
     and - have a drink or two - play the juke
     box. And soon the faces of a-all the other
     people - they turn toward mine - and they
     smile. And they're saying, 'We don't know
     your name, mister, but you're a very nice
     fellow.' Harvey and I --

     grander than anything they offer me. And -
     and when they leave, they leave impressed.
     The same people seldom come back, but -
     that's - that's envy, my dear. There's a
     little bit of envy in the best of us.
     That's too bad. Isn't it?

     ELWOOD - Harvey's his name.

     SANDERSON - How do you know that?

     ELWOOD - Uh - there was a rather
     interesting coincidence on that, Doctor.
     One night several years ago, I was walking
     early in the evening down along Fairfax
     Street - uh - between Eighteenth and
     Nineteenth. I -- Do you know the --

Leaning against wall - talking -

     ELWOOD -- put Ed Hickey into a taxi. Ed
     had been mixing his rye with his gin and
     - and he - I just felt that he needed
     conveying. Well, anyway, I was walking
     down along the street and I - I heard this
     voice saying, 'Good evening, Mister Dowd.'
     Well, I - I turned around and here was
     this big six-foot rabbit leaning up
     against a lamp post. Now, I thought
     nothing of that because when you've lived
     in a town as long as I've lived in this
     one, you get used to the fact that
     everybody knows your name. And naturally,
     I - went over to chat with him.

     of course, he was not mistaken. I
     think the world and all of Ed, but he was
     spiffed. (MAKES NOISE) Well, we talked
     like that for a while - and then - and
     then I said to him, I said, 'You have the
     advantage on me. You know my name - and I
     don't know yours.' And - and right back at
     me, he said, 'What name do you like?'
     Well, I - I didn't even have to think
     twice about that. I - Harvey's always been
     my favorite name. So I said to him, I said,
     'Harvey.' And uh - he - and - - th- th-
     this is - this is the - the interesting
     thing about the whole thing. He said,
     'What a coincidence. My name happens to be
     Harvey.'

     child, didn't you have a playmate? --
     someone with whom you spent many happy
     hours?

     ELWOOD - Yes -- yes, I did, Doctor. Didn't
     you?

     SANDERSON - Yes. What was his name?

     ELWOOD - Verne. Verne McElhinney. Did you
     ever know the McElhinneys, Doctor?

     ELWOOD - Oh, that's too bad. Uh - there
     were a lot of 'em - and they circulated.
     Very nice people. Won - just wonderful
     people.

     SANDERSON - Think carefully, Dowd. Didn't
     you know somebody - sometime - someplace -
     by the name of Harvey? Didn't you ever
     know anybody by that name?

     ELWOOD - No. No. Not one, Doctor. Maybe

     get a little monotonous? Just Akron, cold
     beer and 'poor, poor thing' for two weeks?

     CHUMLEY - No! It would be wonderful!

     ELWOOD - Well, I - I - I can't help
     feeling, Doctor, that you're making a
     mistake not allowing the woman to talk. I
     - if she'd been around at all, she
     might've picked up some very interesting
     news items. A - and I'm sure you're
     making a mistake about all that beer and
     no whiskey - but it's your two weeks.

     CHUMLEY - Mr. Dowd --

     ELWOOD - Oh, he could - and might. Oh,
     I've never heard Harvey say a word against
     Akron. By the way, Doctor, where is
     Harvey?

     CHUMLEY - Don't you know?

     ELWOOD - Oh, well, the last time I saw him
     he was with you. Oh, but he's - he's
     probably waiting for me down at Charlie's.

     CHUMLEY - Uh - yes, that's it! He's down
     at Charlie's.

     ELWOOD - Un-hn - well, in that case, I
     think I'll go down and join him for a
     nightcap. Fortunately, Charlie's stays

     are your friends -- but I want you to know
     that I am your friend.

     ELWOOD - Well, thank you, Doctor. And I'm
     yours.

     CHUMLEY - They underestimate you - as I
     did. This sister of yours is at the bottom
     of a conspiracy against you! She's trying
     to persuade me to lock you up. Today she
     had commitment papers drawn up. She has
     your power of attorney and the key to
     your safety box! And she brought you
     here!

     ELWOOD - My sister did all that in one
     afternoon? That Veta certainly is a
     whirlwind, isn't she?

     CHUMLEY - Good heavens, man! Haven't you
     any righteous indignation?!

     ELWOOD - Oh, Doctor, I - I - (STAMMERS)
     Years ago, my mother used to say to me --
     she'd say, 'In this world, Elwood, you
     must be --' She always called me Elwood.
     'In this world, Elwood, you must be oh,
     so smart or oh, so pleasant.' Well, for
     years I was smart. I recommend pleasant.
     And you may quote me.

     people back to reality, that's where we
     want Elwood.

     VETA - Yes! If he won't see the rabbit any

     been.
