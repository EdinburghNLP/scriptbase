<b>                              NINE
</b>



                           Written by

                Michael Tolkin &amp; Anthony Minghella






                                            Final Script
                                       November 11, 2009





<b>INT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
The flicker of film.   Footage from a press conference.

<b>                         GUIDO
</b>            You kill your film several times,
            mostly by talking about it. A film is
            a dream. You kill it writing it down,
            you kill it with a camera; the film
            might come to life for a moment or two
            when your actors breathe life back
            into it - but then it dies again,
            buried in film cans. Mysteriously,
            sometimes, in the editing room, a
            miracle happens when you place one
            image next to another so that when,
            finally, an audience sits in the dark,
            if you're lucky -- very lucky - and
            sometimes I've been lucky - the dream
            flickers back to life again. That's
            why I'm secretive.

<b>                         REPORTER (O.S.)
</b>            So what's your favorite pasta?

<b>                         GUIDO
</b>            Finally, a serious question.

Laughter.   A word:

<b>                        NINE
</b>
<b>INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHT
</b>
A huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a
man into the stage, turns on a working light.

SUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965

<b>                         STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT
</b>            Good luck, Maestro.

Departing, he closes the soundstage door.

As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of
light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard.
GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the
world. In front of him:

AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under
construction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its
unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins.
Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open
platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    A
lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane
surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands.
                                    p. 2



Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts
on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the
stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping
over to the crane.

Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his
mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in
every sense a jumble of ideas.

Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the
bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands,
overwhelmed.

<b>THE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES
</b>
<b>                       GUIDO (V.O.)
</b>          Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini...
          How do you begin? How do you begin
          this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page
          1... Page nothing...

In the distance, a figure approaches out of the
darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An
escape from his tortured reality.

The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is
gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his
film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she
stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,
and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music
swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the
air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something
beautiful, transforms into the interior world of
<b>GUIDO'S FANTASY.
</b>
As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly
appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the
women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from
his films, women he has loved, the sources of his
inspiration and creative genius.

A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women
in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own
powerful entrance:

LUISA, his wife

CARLA, his mistress

LILLI, his costume designer and accomplice

GUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit

STEPHANIE, a fashion journalist

SARAGHINA, a whore
                                       p. 3



A dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido
and he loses himself and his anxiety in their
collective embrace.


<b>INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY
</b>
The fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE,
as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting
Guido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight
penetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,
discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures
approach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-
fed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime
associate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure
accompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an
accountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious
punctuation:

<b>                       DANTE
</b>                 (walking)
          Guido! You're here.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Buongiorno, Dante.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          I've been looking for you all over the
          place. The set's coming along. How
          are you?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Bene, grazie, bene.

Guido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Bene. My God, you look terrible,
          better go to makeup, forget you've got
          a press conference?

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>                 (discreetly, to Dante)
          He has no tie.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Yes, makeup and wardrobe.

He takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight.
Guido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look
and a gesture asks Dante who is he?

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>                 (overlapping Dante)
          Signor Contini, I'm Fausto.     Good
          morning, Signor Contini.
                                       p. 4



<b>                       DANTE
</b>                 (interrupts)
          He's counting costs, you know. The
          Bank wants him here.
                 (to Fausto)
          Don't speak to him, I speak to him.

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>          Okay, I have some questions for Signor
          Contini.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          We all have questions for Signor
          Contini.

They head outside.


<b>EXT. CINECITTA - DAY
</b>
Guido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en
route to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large
poster of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a
failure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido
passes he causes a mild stir, and many people nod
deferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>          Yes, but please, please, I think it's
          customary for there to be an approved
          script and budget before filming
          commences...

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Is he going to follow us?

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>          It's not my intention to be difficult.
          Maestro, I am a huge admirer of
          Maestro Contini's movies, your early
          films are...everybody loves them
          and... I consider it a great honour
          for me to be here now... none the
          less, I need a script and a budget.

Neither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders.
They make their way to the Production Offices.
Everywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.


<b>INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY
</b>
A long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio
heads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are
several, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without
missing a beat of their solemn conversation.
                                       p. 5


As they progress into and through the open plan office,
many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to
get Guido's attention, swelling the procession,
interjecting with their urgent requests.

There are set models everywhere, in the process of
being constructed, or painted.

JACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a
model, hurries over. Nobody stops moving.

As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to
look.

PIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the
procession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting
through them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a
partitioned office -

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>          Where do you want your messages?

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>          On my desk.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>          There's no room on your desk.

- into the main office -

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo
          so.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>                 (waving them at him)
          Some of these are urgent!

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (to Pierpaolo)
          Get me a cigarette.

<b>                       JACONELLI
</b>                 (confidentially)
          We will never be ready to shoot in ten
          days.

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>          Jaconelli -

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>                 (at the same time)
          Not ready?!

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (continues)
          Ascolta me.
<b>                       (MORE)
</b>                                    p. 6

<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>                 (he kisses Jaconelli on
                  the cheek)
          Careful what you say. He's a spy from
          the bank.

Guido carries on moving through the office.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          He's not exactly from the bank, Guido.

Now BENITO, Guido's Casting Director, moves towards
Guido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head
towards Guido's office.

<b>                       BENITO
</b>          Dottore, Dottore. You have actors
          waiting for you in your office.
          Auditions all morning. You should see
          what I've found. I found two sisters.
          Look, they're right...

Guido turns through another partition, as they all
besiege him with questions. Benito despairs.

<b>                       BENITO (CONT'D)
</b>          Dottore, this way...

Guido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the
door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him.

Dante blocks Benito.

<b>                       BENITO (CONT'D)
</b>          Maestro!

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Not now. He's got the Press
          Conference.


<b>INT. WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAY
</b>
Guido comes through the door, blows hard from the
barrage.

They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always,
for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is
Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky,
indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without
any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido
heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting
some fabric.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I need a cigarette.

Dante comes in, closing the door behind him.
                                      p. 7



<b>                       DANTE
</b>          He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.

Guido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to
Lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I need a coffee and a cigarette.

He lies down.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>                 (unimpressed)
          Answer a question, I'll give you a
          coffee. Answer another question, I'll
          give you a cigarette. And so on.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Actually and an aspirin.

Dante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some
drawings.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>                 (in the background, on the
                  phone)
          We're running late...

<b>                       LILLI
</b>                 (turns to Guido and lights
                  a cigarette)
          Calm down. Directing a movie is a very
          overrated job, we all know it. You
          just have to say yes or no. What else
          do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should
          this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More
          extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes,
          no, yes, no, yes, no - that's
          directing.

Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          That's right: that's directing. And it
          doesn't seem to make a blind bit of
          difference, finally, what the answer
          is...

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          So please, Guido, yes or no, do you
          want any costumes in this film?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Yes.
                                      p. 8



<b>                       LILLI
</b>          You see - simple!
                 (handing him an espresso
                  fetched by her assistant,
<b>                  ROBERTA)
</b>          Might I know what period the movie's
          in?

Lilli glances at Dante who has edged closer to the
table, he looks at the costumes.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Yes, yes.
                 (downs the espresso)
          Soon.

Lilli glares at Dante, ushering him away.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          You know I don't allow producers in
          here.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Alright. Two minutes Guido.

Lilli is the only person who intimidates Dante. He
leaves. Guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket.


Lilli walks round and takes the tie off him. Guido sits
up. Lilli puts the tie round his neck.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          He's gone. Have you written a word of
          the script?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          No.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          Are you in a panic?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Yes.

She ties Guido's tie for him.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          Is Luisa going with you to the Press
          Conference?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          No. Nobody. Dante.    And his spy.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          You need to shave.    You look terrible.
                                      p. 9



<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (looking around,
                  desperate)
          Why is there no fire escape in here?
          What if somebody needed to escape? I
          can't face these reporters. I have
          nothing to say.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          You'll be fine. You're a world class
          liar, darling, go out there and lie
          for Italy, lie for Italia.


<b>EXT. ROME - DAY
</b>
Guido is driving his Roadster   through the streets of
Rome. An Italian pop song of    the day is playing on the
radio as he speeds around the   Piazza del Poppolo. In
front of him in the convoy is   Dante with Fausto.


<b>INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY
</b>
As Guido drives, he turns to see his MAMMA in the
passenger seat. He's not remotely surprised. She
appears the way he remembers her. Mamma is
extraordinary.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          What the hell's wrong with me? I
          can't sleep. I can't think. I can't
          write. I can't breathe. My heart is
          racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you
          flowers, I know. I'll come to the
          cemetery at the weekend. You should
          have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I
          could visit you every week. Don't
          look at me like that.

<b>                       MAMMA
</b>                 (with kindly patience)
          Oh, Guido, Guido.

He stops at a busy intersection.


<b>EXT. STREETS OF ROME / INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY
</b>
This is the Rome of La Dolce Vita, the Rome of Vespas,
skinny ties, cool sunglasses, impossibly cool young
people. A magnificent fall day, and the cafes are
stuffed with the beautiful and chic.
                                     p. 10



<b>                       MAMMA
</b>          This is your Rome, Guido. The world
          sees Rome the way you invented it.
          Your films did that.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (buoyed by her
                  encouragement)
          I miss you.

<b>                       MAMMA
</b>          I miss you, too.

Guido is in his own world. The policeman raps on the
bonnet of the car. Guido startles and pulls off, alone
in the car.

Guido looks across as he drives. Mamma has gone.


<b>EXT. HOTEL EXCELSIOR, VIA VENETO - DAY
</b>
The convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel
Excelsior on the Via Veneto.

As soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting
paparazzi snap his picture. Beautiful women look at
him. Guido moves quickly by them.

Dante and the team hurry after him.   Fausto tackles
Dante.

And they hurry after Guido.


<b>INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY
</b>
A big suite. About fifty reporters, men and women, are
in the room, and an array of microphones are on a
coffee table next to a long couch. Excited chaos. A
RADIO REPORTER narrates in the background.

<b>                       RADIO REPORTER
</b>          And we're just waiting for the arrival
          of Contini...any moment now - Could
          this film put the Maestro back on top?

A few news cameras are filming.    There's a buffet, and
a bartender.

And Guido comes into the room, shaking hands, patting
shoulders, grabbing a glass of champagne. Dante and the
team follow him in.

<b>                       RADIO REPORTER (CONT'D)
</b>          And here he is..!
                                   p. 11



<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Silenzio, per favore...Thank you,
          thank you...

<b>                       RADIO REPORTER
</b>          Dante, Guido Contini's long time
          producer, is about to speak...

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          I want to say a few words from my
          heart. I am humbled and thrilled to
          be able to announce that I am
          producing Guido Contini's next film,
          Italia, which will star once again
          Contini's longtime inspiration, the
          international film star, Claudia
          Jenssen...

A stunning film poster is revealed -- Claudia Jenssen
emerging from the Colosseum: CLAUDIA JENSSEN. UN FILM
DI GUIDO CONTINI. ITALIA. Flashes. Excitement.

<b>                       DANTE (CONT'D)
</b>          ...we start shooting in ten days time
          in Cinecitta. That makes it one week
          from Monday.
                 (to Guido, handing over)
          Thank you, Maestro, thank you very
          much. This is our ninth film
          together. Guido Contini.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Thanks for coming, everybody.

Pretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and
kisses Dante on the cheek.

He returns to the couch. All the reporters fire their
questions at once. The questions come on top of each
other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated
energy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to
DINARDO, a harsh-looking woman.

<b>                       DINARDO
</b>          Maestro Contini. Maestro Contini.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Yes.

<b>                       DINARDO
</b>          Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new
          film is called Italia... big title.

Another journalist, Leopardi, vile - sitting next to
her, egging Dinardo on - almost sniggers with contempt.
                                      p. 12



<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Actually, it's my shortest title yet.

<b>                       DINARDO
</b>          But hardly a modest one.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Films are not modest. They cost too
          much, they take too long, and they
          involve too many people. So they
          should have grand titles.

<b>                       DINARDO
</b>          And might you tell the press what the
          film is about?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Why? I still don't know what my last
          film was about.

<b>                       LEOPARDI
</b>                 (In a loud aside to
                  Dinardo)
          That was the problem. Nobody else did.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Of course I can tell you what my film
          is about...I can tell you the story, I
          can tell you who I am going to cast,
          the music I want to use, I can tell
          you everything... but... I... won't.
          I'm afraid that if I say anything, the
          word might get out to the Press.

General laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is
clearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps
in.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Our next film will be exactly as it
          sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit
          of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a
          woman, Italy as a dream.

<b>                       LEOPARDI
</b>          Is this true?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          It sounds fantastic.    I can't wait to
          see it.

He's still winning. Ignoring the question, he points
to STEPHANIE, a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes
from American Vogue.   Flirtatious and charming, she
wants him and he senses it.
                                    p. 13



<b>                       STEPHANIE

<b>                       STEPHANIE
</b>          Grazie. Could you tell the fashionable
          women of America who your favorite
          designer is this year?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I'm less interested in the wrapping
          than what might be inside it.

<b>                       REPORTER ONE
</b>          Signor Contini! You're a man of the
          world, yes? Educated in Britain, a
          home in Biarritz. With Italia is it
          fair to say that you've come home for
          good?

<b>                       REPORTER TWO (O.S.)

<b>                       REPORTER FOUR
</b>          It's been a long time since you made a
          movie with your wife, do you plan on
          casting her in this new film?

Guido is spinning plates.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I told Luisa that when we got married
          I would never again make love to my
          leading lady.

<b>                       REPORTER FOUR
</b>          But she hasn't worked at all since
          working with you.

Laughter. Everyone starts firing questions at Guido
again. Another REPORTER asks a question.

<b>                       REPORTER FIVE
</b>          But why are you being so tight-lipped
          about this film? It's a serious
          question. What's the big deal?

<b>INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

We discover Guido, alone on the soundstage of his

glasses entering the suite through a hidden door in the

Guido speeds away from Rome in his Roadster.


<b>EXT. ROME ROAD - DAY
</b>
Guido's car passes by the remnants of an ancient
aqueduct, with women from his fantasy draped around
him, spilling out of his car.

THE WOMEN sing a musical flourish of praise to Guido.

The Alfa Spyder comes to a screeching stop in front of
the gates of the entrance of an impressive looking Spa:
GRAND HOTEL BELLAVISTA. The hotel has a slightly faded
glamour, something that lifts it a little out of time.
Guido's women are gone as the song ends.

Guido enters like a thief. He doesn't want to be
recognised. He approaches the Front Desk, where an
immaculate Desk Clerk, the urbane and wise DE ROSSI,
waits to greet him.

at the Front Desk, and scribbles down another number.

...CLOSE-UP on Guido's eye, being held open by a
DOCTOR. Guido is on the bed, shirt open. The Doctor
examines Guido's eye while a heavy-set NURSE takes his
blood pressure. The Doctor stands and turns to his
case.

He walks round to her. The Nurse whispers to the
Doctor. They look at the blood pressure gauge. Guido
is disturbed by their conspiracy.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          What is she whispering? Is it my

The doctor, interrupting him, takes a tongue depressor
from his kit.

The doctor, sits on the bed beside Guido, and takes his
cigarette out of his mouth. He stubs it out.

Guido desperately makes an attempt to reach it and
can't. He's trapped by the doctor and by the nurse
holding his arm.

ringing. Guido looks at the ringing phone, but the
nurse has his arm in her grip as she takes his blood
pressure for the second time. And the phone continues
ringing.

An enormous swathe of pink satin rakes across the
scaffolding of Guido's unfinished set. Emerging from
the highest point is a pair of long legs sliding down
the lush fabric. She wears stockings, heels and little
else. Bathed in hot light, Carla reveals herself from
inside the sumptuous folds of satin.

Carla disappears in a cloud of hot steam that becomes
the steam from an arriving train.

And out of the steam... CARLA comes walking toward
Guido, swinging her hips, with a PORTER behind her,
pulling five bags on a wagon. Carla is dressed in her
own style, which is not chic, but it's what Guido
likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant. She
wears it with pride.

</b>          Carla... I have to tell you... they
          found out who I am at the hotel--

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          No...

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          ... yes, horrible, but obviously we
          don't want to be followed by the
          press, so I found the most charming
          pensione for you, and it's right here.
          It's charming.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          Here at the station?


<b>EXT. PENSIONE FERROVIA - DAY
</b>
A small pensione across the street from the station.
Carla sizes it up, and it's really not at all what she
was hoping for, but she doesn't say anything.


<b>INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Later, Carla, in silhouette, from behind. Wrapped in a
sheet, she is looking out the window of the dingy room.
The light from the pensione's neon sign spills in. They
whisper.

<b>                       GUIDO (O.S.)
</b>          Close the curtains, it's too light in
          here.

Carla closes the curtains.     They continue to whisper.

<b>                        GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          Perfect.   Now, go into the corridor---

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          What?
                                    p. 28



<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Shhh! Yes, count to ten and come back
          in, and pretend you're in the wrong
          room, and I'm a complete stranger--

Carla sits on the bed facing Guido.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          I love your games!

She kisses him.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I'm here on business.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          Okay.

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>          Go, go.   Wait. Your face.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          What about it?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Get your makeup.

Guido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and
tilts the lamp shade up. He begins to pencil in a
beauty mark and darken her eyes. He is meticulous
about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it
exactly as he wants it.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          I had a nightmare last night. We were
          in that little alley behind Piazza
          Navona, where I bought you that scarf,
          remember? The same one your wife
          bought you--

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (probably doesn't)
          Don't move, Carla.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          When you wear it, I never know if it's
          hers or mine.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (not really listening)
          Uh-huh.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          So we were there, on the ground,
          naked, kissing, and we didn't care,
          and then my husband arrived and killed
          us both with a shovel! Poor Luigi!

<b>                       CARLA (CONT'D)
</b>          He would never do that! He's so sweet.
          He speaks Latin! He knows all the
          Roman Emperors.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (still intent on his
                  makeup job)
          Good for him.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          Perhaps there's a job for him in the
          movie--

<b>                         GUIDO
</b>          Why not?

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          You could work well together.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Beautiful. When you come in I want
          you to be my little savage.

<b>                         CARLA
</b>          Yes.

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>                 (gesturing towards the
                  door)
          Go, go.

Guido takes off his glasses and puts them on the side
table..

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          You think I am one of your actresses?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Hurry, please, Carla.

Carla gets up and takes Guido's glasses with her. Guido
turns out the light and settles into his pillow, for
the game. Carla looks at herself in the mirror.

<b>                         CARLA
</b>          Oh, Madonna!

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I'll pretend to be asleep.

Carla turns back to the mirror, she puts on Guido's
glasses and turns back to him.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          What if I really found the wrong room?
          Would you be jealous?
                                   p. 30



<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Could you do such a thing?

Carla teases him with a look that says, "Why not?"

<b>                       CARLA
</b>                 (coyly)
          Hm! Who knows?

Carla goes into the hall and closes the door behind
her. We HEAR the MATRON who runs the Pensione talking
to her. While they talk, Guido removes a crucifix from
the wall and puts it in the bedside drawer.

Now Carla comes back into the room, giggling, signaling
for Guido to keep quiet.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          What happened?

<b>                       CARLA
</b>                 (still giggling)
          It was the woman from the hotel. She
          wanted to give me towels.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Come here.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          Okay.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          What?

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          You are a stranger, I don't know you.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Carla, just come here.
                 (indicating her sheet)
          Be savage. Show me.

She crosses the room and climbs onto the bed and opens
the sheet slowly, spreading her arms wide.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          Excuse me! I've got the wrong room.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Yes, you have. And I don't have the
          faintest idea who you are.

She throws herself on Guido, whose arms enfold her.
                                     p. 31




<b>INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
Carla is asleep, her bare back a thing of post-coital
beauty. Guido sits on the edge of the bed, quietly
getting dressed, filled with confusion and guilt.


<b>INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Guido tip-toes out of Carla's room, shoes in his hand.
He walks down the hallway, alone.

<b>                       GUIDO (V.O.)
</b>          Page one, page one, page one...
          The figure emerges from the darkness
          like a goddess. She is Claudia, his
          muse...


<b>INT. HOTEL, GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
</b>
IMAGES OF CLAUDIA in his fantasy.   Kissing him.
Walking away...

<b>                       GUIDO (V.O.)
</b>          She takes the man's face and kisses
          him...

Guido is surrounded by discarded bits of paper, an
outline of Italia. An empty sheet of paper sits in his
typewriter on his desk. He is not working on the
outline. He is sketching a voluptuous woman...

<b>                       GUIDO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          ...And with that gesture, he's
          suddenly inspired to write
          something... profound.

...he draws in the nipples on the woman's breasts.

Guido becomes discouraged. He tosses off his glasses
and runs his hands through his hair in frustration.

<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          Mother of God, give me a sign.

He's happily distracted by the sound of vehicles
arriving outside his window. He opens a slat in the
shutters, looks down as a motor calvacade draws up. At
its heart is an impressive luxury car.
                                     p. 32




<b>EXT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA, POV FROM BALCONY - DAY
</b>
Hotel staff swarm around the vehicles which discharge a
procession of religious, including an ANCIENT CARDINAL
in scarlet robes and the CARDINAL'S SECRETARY. Priests
follow as the Cardinal heads inside the hotel.

Guido is intrigued, hurries out of his hotel room.


<b>INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA LOBBY - DAY
</b>
As Guido hurries down the stairs, the Cardinal is being
helped into the elevator. The CARDINAL'S SECRETARY is
dealing with check-in formalities with De Rossi. Guido
calls to him.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Excuse me, father...

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>                 (turns)
          Buongiorno.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          His Excellency, the Cardinal, is he -?

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>                 (recognising Guido)
          Signor Contini!
                 (starstruck)
          I am a big fan.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I would very much like to speak to the
          Cardinal. Do you think he might grant
          me -

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          Is Claudia Jenssen with you?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          No.

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          Pity. His excellency is a big admirer
          of Signorina Jenssen.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (explaining)
          I'm in need of some guidance, some
          pointers...

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          Do you think you could find a signed
          photograph of Signorina Jenssen?
                                        p. 33



<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          For His Excellency?

<b>                        CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          Si.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I'm sure that would be possible...

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          Truly?   What a pleasure. Arrivederci,
          Maestro.

He heads towards the elevator. Guido watches him go,
then a voice calls out his name....GUIDO! Guido can't
turn round. He knows that voice.

<b>                        DANTE
</b>          Guidino!

Guido hurries towards the elevator. The elevator doors
close. Guido is trapped.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I'm not going to ask how you found me.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Please - it's my job. A producer
          needs to know where his director is at
          all times...even to know the pensione
          where his mistress is staying...

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>          Oh God.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          I understand, Guido. Rome is

<b>                         GUIDO
</b>          Really?    You understand?

He takes Guido by the arm and leads him to a stairwell.


<b>INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA - STAIRCASE - DAY
</b>
<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Of course I understand.      Absolutely.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          You're not going to drag me back?

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          You can't be in Rome. Okay.
                 (heading towards the
                  ballroom)


<b>INT. GRAND BALLROOM, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY
</b>
<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Rome will come to you!

Dante opens the door of the Ballroom to reveal a full
<b>PRODUCTION OFFICE, ART DEPARTMENT, COSTUME DEPARTMENT,
</b>CASTING OFFICE. The models, costumes, headshots,
everything all in place or being put into place. An
absolute beehive of activity. Guido is staggered.

<b>                       DANTE (CONT'D)

          love you, Guido.

He stands watching Guido with genuine admiration as he
sets to work with his team. Guido moves through the
room avoiding specific questions from everyone. As he
does so, Dante makes his way over to Guido with a
magnificent girl on his arm.

<b>                       JACONELLI

<b>                       DANTE

<b>                       GUIDO

Pierpaolo, Guido's assistant, holds a telephone.   Guido
wants to know who it is.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO (CONT'D)
</b>          Claudia's agent...

Guido grimaces. Then takes the phone.   He attacks the
phone call with gusto.

          No no no no - impossibile - are you
          telling me she didn't get the script?
                 (shouting at Pierpaolo)
          Pierpaolo!

He takes the cigarette with a smile, and then without
missing a beat starts barking at Pierpaolo.

He hands the phone to Dante, who's delighted to see
Guido back on good directing mode.

As Dante takes over, Guido walks away, heads towards
Lilli and her domain.


<b>INT. LILLI'S TEMPORARY OFFICE, BALLROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!

Guido leaps over the balcony and lies down on a table.
Performance mode off. Lilli nods to Roberta to leave.
Roberta puts down her work and clears the room quietly,
leaving them alone.

<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          I'm happy. I brought my swimsuit.

Lilli is working at a mannequin, hand-sewing some
sequins on a costume. A red feathered boa is draped on
the figure.

<b>                       LILLI (CONT'D)
</b>          It was Luisa's birthday yesterday.

</b>          What? No. Oh please God. No. I

          even mention it. Give me a cigarette.

Lilli points to the one in Guido's hand.

<b>                          LILLI
</b>          What's that?

Guido sees the costume.

</b>          What's that?

<b>                       LILLI

<b>FANTASY:

<b>INT."SOUNDSTAGE"
</b>
...Lilli, draped atop an upright piano, the red
feathered boa hangs from her shoulders. She places the
same straw hat on her head.

The soundstage has been transformed into an
impressionistic version of the Folies Bergere of the
1930's, with Lilli as its French Star. A spotlight
finds Guido watching from the scaffolding of his
unfinished set. The din of the theater audience fills
the smoky atmosphere.

Behind a black scrim, ghostly images come to life.
Apparitions that reveal themselves as exotic SHOWGIRLS
barely covered in beads, sequins, and feathers. They
descend the grand staircase.

Lilli crosses onto the passerelle, and speaks directly
to the audience.

</b>          Ah, Bon soir, bon soir, bon soir. Je

          Vedette, it means 'star.'

Lilli singles out guests at the lip of the stage:

<b>                       LILLI (CONT'D)
</b>          Let me tell you. Last night I looked
          down at this table in the chairs you
          are sitting in now, and what did I
          see? A priest! And next to him?

Suddenly, she sees Young Guido in the audience.

<b>                       LILLI (CONT'D)
</b>          Ahh, mon Dieu! Guido? Guido Contini?
          What are you doing here at the Folies

          you've come. Would you like to join
          me on stage? Yes. Come. Come, come,
          come.

And she brings him onto the stage. The audience
applauds. She addresses him as though he is Older
Guido.

Young Guido finds himself swept into Lilli's

<b>INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
We seem to be looking at the SET ON STAGE 5. But
suddenly a HUGE HEAD dips into the shot and it's Guido
contemplating a model of the set. He places a figure
on the top of the staircase.
                                     p. 41


He moves round to the front of the model and places
another figure on the top of the scaffold tower. He
knocks it over.

Unconvinced, he sits down on the sofa. The coffee
table is covered in head-shots. He finds the one of
Claudia.   Guido looks at it.

He lies back to write and finds himself in CLAUDIA'S
LAP. She hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his
hair. He starts to sign - "TO HIS EXCELLENCY.... "
then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself.
Claudia laughs.


<b>INT. ANCIENT BATHS - DAY
</b>
Grottos and tunnels are thick with steam.    Guido
follows the Cardinal's Secretary.

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          The Cardinal is right this way.

The Cardinal's Secretary leads Guido to a private area,
where the Cardinal is already soaking in a large tub of
hot water.

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b><b>                       (CONT'D)
</b>          Your Eminence, Signor Contini is here.

The Cardinal's Secretary makes a gesture to Guido to
get into the tub with the Cardinal. Guido gets in the
water. The Cardinal looks hard at Guido and then makes
his first pronouncement.

<b>                       CARDINAL
</b>          I like Charlie Chaplin.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Me too.

<b>                       CARDINAL
</b>          A genius. What can I do for you?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Do you believe in God?

The Cardinal's Secretary is shocked.

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          Signor Contini, please.

<b>                       CARDINAL
</b>          No, no, it's an honest question.    Yes,
          I believe in God.

<b>                        CARDINAL

</b>          Yes, yes. I will, I will. Your
          Eminence, I am not happy. I'm
          searching for something. I feel a

<b>                       CARDINAL
</b>                 (interrupting)
          I saw your films. Not the flops, the
          others, the good ones.
          But you think people need to see so
          much sex?   It's not necessary. We can
          all imagine.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (laughing)
          Excuse me - my films are what I
          imagine.

<b>                       CARDINAL
</b>          Then your imagination has no moral
          training.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (nonplussed)
          How do you train the imagination?

<b>                       CARDINAL
</b>          The imagination is God's garden; don't
          let the Devil play in it. Teach our
          Italian women to be wives, not whores,
          don't make us look at filth and
          debauchery. Make us proud to be
          Italian...

Guido's head disappears under the water.    The sound of
the Cardinal's voice trails away...

<b>MEMORY:
</b>

<b>EXT. BEACH - DAY
</b>
SUPERTITLE:   Pesaro, Italy, 1926

Young Guido, dressed in his school uniform, runs fast
across the rough dunes with five boys from the village.

The boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall
with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the
war.

They reach into pockets and extract small change, hand
it to Young Guido, already the ring leader.

They crawl through a small opening in the wall and
approach an abandoned bunker...


<b>EXT. SARAGHINA'S BUNKER - DAY
</b>
...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker,
as the other boys fearfully take a step back.

<b>                       YOUNG GUIDO
</b>                 (not loud enough)
          Saraghina.
                 (louder)
          Saraghina.

Now all the boys join in.

<b>                        BOYS
</b>          Saraghina!   Saraghina!

<b>                       YOUNG GUIDO
</b>                 (loudest)
          Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina!

A shadow moves inside the bunker. Now even Young Guido
takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps
back.

And then she comes out. SARAGHINA is a gritty, earthy
woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. She has
darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the
model for the whore makeup on Carla.

She looks at the boys. She may be a crazy whore, but
she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the
boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having
her own fun with them.

She takes a deliberate step. Young Guido stands his
ground. She takes another step and holds out her hand.
                                    p. 44



Young Guido opens his hand with the coins.

She looks at the money.   Is it enough?


But she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes
the coins.

She stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back
to her bunker. She returns dragging an old broken
chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready
for the "show."

Saraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands
and pours it over her body...

A dark vamp begins.


<b>FANTASY:

<b>INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Curtains of falling sand fill the soundstage.

Through the sand, we see Saraghina seated on the same
chair from the beach. She speaks, surrounded by other
WHORES in provocative positions on beaten-up chairs.

</b>           So, you little Italian devils, you

           will tell you...and if you want to

She gets up and heads towards the water.   The boys
follow, running.

Saraghina and The Whores brandish tambourines. They
begin a slow, rhythmic and sensual dance that builds
into a wild and raucous tarantella.

We furiously intercut between the musical fantasy and

Saraghina, across the sand and through the water.

<b>EXT. BEACH - DAY

Two PRIESTS are running down the beach, cassocks
flapping.

The boys run. Young Guido tries to run away from the
priests. They catch him and carry him away from the
beach.


<b>INT. ST. SEBASTIAN CHAPEL - DAY
</b>
Off-screen, a boys choir sings KYRIE.

The priests drag Young Guido through the school's
chapel, past a tortured Christ hanging above the ornate
altar, into the Principal's office.


<b>INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Guido's mother is there with the PRINCIPAL (again, she
appears the way he remembers her).

<b>                       MAMMA

</b>          Bring him here. That savage is the
          devil. God will punish you for your

The Principal produces a cane and starts to whip the
boy remorselessly. Mamma looks away. Young Guido cries
out as they punish him...


<b>INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
...and the cry is now in Guido's mouth, on top of Carla
in the spasm of sex... He suddenly can't breathe...
Carla is suddenly aware that he's not in ecstasy... He
rolls over, recovers slowly. As always, immediately
wanting to leave after the sex.
                                   p. 47

</b>          No, that's not what I meant, Guidino.
          No. Where are you going?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I have to go to work. Carla, I can't
          breathe.

Guido stands up and picks up his shirt. He puts it on
whilst they argue.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          Let me come with you.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          It's impossible.

<b>                        CARLA
</b>          Why?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Because it's impossible. Please.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          But why is it impossible? Look at your
          producer! He's married, he brings his
          girlfriend to work and nobody cares.
          Guido. Everybody knows about me. Why?
          Why won't you let me near you?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          For the very same reason you don't
          want me to die on top of you. It's
          not fair to your husband. It's not
          fair to my wife.
                                      p. 48



<b>                       CARLA
</b>          See, you're playing with me. You're
          twisting everything... Please let me
          come with you.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          No.

Guido heads towards the door, still dressing.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          I'll be here waiting for you with my
          legs open.

Disgusted with himself, he leaves.


<b>INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT
</b>
Glittering lights on the terrace. A view of the sea.
A pop band and a dance floor.   A slick Italian MALE
SINGER performs QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO. People dance.
The whole PRODUCTION TEAM is at a working dinner.
Guido is at the end of the table, spilling ideas,
struggling, struggling to make sense of Italia -

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>          Let's say there were ten sequences,
          each one set in a different period,
          but played by the same cast, a man and

                 (pours himself a glass of
                  wine)
          Something light and hectic - like
          Mozart would do it, like Figaro.
                 (to Lilli)
          Like the circus...

                                      p. 49



<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Let's try to dig for something else.
          Maybe a group of people digging, with
          shovels, in the desert.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          Guido.

She nudges him. He looks across the restaurant to see
his wife at the entrance looking for him...

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Luisa!

He jumps up from the table and hurries towards the
dance floor, genuinely happy.

<b>ON THE DANCE FLOOR:
</b>
 - as Guido is protective of Luisa... holding her back
from the dinner table.

<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          I can't believe you came.

<b>                       LUISA
</b>          The jungle drums said it was an
          emergency.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          The jungle drums exaggerated just a
          tiny bit.

<b>                       LUISA
</b>          Not entirely.
                 (with concern)
          You haven't been sleeping.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I was dying, until just now.    Come.

He pulls her into the middle of the dance floor.    They
start to dance.

<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          And don't think I forgot your

          will be full of flowers...

<b>                       LUISA

                                   p. 50



They move together, enjoying each other.   She kisses
him.

They walk towards the table.

<b>AT THE TABLE:
</b>
<b>                       DANTE
</b>                 (Seeing Luisa)
          Here she is. At last.   Magnificent.
          You know Donatella?

<b>                       LUISA
</b>          I do now.

She leans across to kiss Lilli.

He sits Luisa down, goes to grab a bottle of champagne.

<b>                       LUISA (CONT'D)
</b>                 (to Lilli)

</b>                 (confidentially)
          You're saving the movie. Give him a
          good idea, for God's sake.

Luisa says hello to the rest of the gang, there are
kisses, etc. as Guido returns and pops open the bottle
of champagne.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Let's drink a toast to Luisa's
          birthday.

          Thank you.

<b>                       GUIDO

Just then, the Cardinal's Secretary appears.   Heads
towards the table.

          Ah, Don Mario. Excuse me, darling,
          this is Don Mario. This is my wife,
          Luisa.

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          A pleasure, Signora.

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          Oh no.

<b>                       LUISA

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          I was telling your husband how much I
          admire his movies. Publicly, you know
          the Church condemns them - we have to -
          but we all love them.
                 (To Guido)
          Last year we did our own version of
          your Il Vicolo at the Christmas
          Party.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          That I would pay to see.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Luisa was in that film.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          She was the best thing in the movie.

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>          It's true.   It was your first part.

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

          my Lord!

<b>                       LUISA
</b>          I was.

Music begins.

<b>                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>          You can't stop being somebody.

<b>                       LUISA
</b>          Can't you?
                                    p. 52



<b>                        CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
</b>           Well there's a good catholic wife for
           you, Guido, that's what they do -
           sacrifice. Still, Signora Contini, it
           must be a very exciting life for
           you...

Luisa looks to Guido.   Close up on Guido.


<b>FANTASY:
</b>

<b>INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
</b>
The restaurant table as well as the production team are
transplanted onto Guido's unfinished set. They are
surrounded by camera equipment, standing lighting
units, etc. Luisa rises from her chair, distancing
herself from the scene. The other characters, with the
exception of Guido, freeze in a dimly lit macabre
tableau.

Luisa contemplates her life with Guido.

As the number progresses, the world around Luisa
disappears into a black void, leaving only herself,
with Guido in the shadows. Luisa climbs the staircase.

The clapper board. TITLE: IL VICOLO (The Alley)    Her
name: LUISA ACARI.

A small set. A couple of tables and chairs, as if it's
an outdoor cafe in Piazza Navona.   Luisa enters,
younger, she's like Audrey Hepburn...

Luisa sits on the chair.

<b>                       GUIDO (O.S.)

                                   p. 54



Guido enters.   He's fascinated by her. She's taken
aback that he's in front of the camera and approaching
her. He walks straight up to her and unties her hair.
It's oddly intimate. He stands back to reappraise her.

<b>                       GUIDO

In reality, Luisa sees Carla enter the restaurant.
They look at each other. Carla tries to change
direction, or look as if she's come to the wrong place.

...Luisa gets up abruptly.

<b>                       LUISA

She hurries away. Guido senses something terrible is
happening. He gets up and goes after his wife.

what's happened. He heads back to the terrace
restaurant...

Guido comes back inside. Carla is seated at a table.
She sees him and calls for him.

He disappears. Carla walks towards the door, conscious
of De Rossi. She's humiliated. De Rossi comes out
from behind his desk, approaches her.

She walks away.


<b>EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Carla walks along the road in the dark, stumbling
along.


<b>INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
Guido enters. The two single beds. Luisa is apparently
asleep in hers. Guido sits on his bed. Glum.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Apparently she's staying in some
          grotesque pensione next to the
          station.

Luisa doesn't move.

<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          Luisa, if I'd invited her here, she
          would be staying in the hotel,
          wouldn't she? Think about it. I
          didn't even know you were coming.

<b>                       LUISA
</b>                 (without opening her eyes)
          Very plausible.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Because it's true.

Luisa turns on her bedside lamp and sits up in bed.

<b>                       LUISA
</b>          You told me it was finished.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          It is. Look, she was worried about
          me, she came to see if I was all right
          - which yes, is stupid but not, as far
          as I know, a crime, and hardly a
          mortal sin.

Luisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly.
                                      p. 58



<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>                 (smiles, insecure)
          What? What are you laughing about?

<b>                       LUISA
</b>          Nothing. If you could see yourself.
                 (raising herself up
                  further)
          I couldn't live with it - the
          absurdity of being you, the effort of
          having to hide and lie and cheat. It's
          exhausting, no wonder you've got no
          script, you're too busy inventing your
          own life.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          It's finished. It's finished.
                 (and he is exhausted)
          If it wasn't before, it is now.

<b>                       LUISA
</b>                 (lying back on her bed)
          Blah blah blah blah blah.

Luisa turns over, reaches to the bedside lamp and turns
it off. Guido gets up and hurries from the room.


<b>INT. BAR, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT
</b>
Guido enters the bar, goes up to the bartender.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Vodka.

A voice comes from behind him.

<b>                       STEPHANIE (O.S.)
</b>          I'll have one of those. Due.

Guido looks around, it's the Vogue Journalist from the
Press Conference. Stephanie grins at him, infectious,
full of flirt.

<b>                       STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Hi, Guido Contini. Stephanie, from
          Vogue, remember me?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Yes, I remember very well, Stephanina
          from Vogue.

<b>                       STEPHANIE
</b>          So, coincidence. You being here.    And
          me being here.
                                     p. 59



<b>                       GUIDO

          Amazing. May I take a cigarette?

<b>                       STEPHANIE
</b>          That was quite a performance. At the
          Press Conference. The Vanishing Act.

Guido takes a cigarette. The drinks appear.    Guido
produces some money.

<b>                       STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
</b>          No, please, my treat.

</b>          Prego.

<b>                       STEPHANIE
</b>                 (eyeing Guido)
          I've seen all your movies.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (lights their cigarettes)
          Really?

<b>                       STEPHANIE
</b>          Like a million times. They're the only
          movies that tell the truth about the
          modern world.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          And what truth is that?

<b>                       STEPHANIE
</b>                 (thinks)
          Death of religion... Sexual
          revolution...

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I don't think religion is dead. And
          what exactly is the sexual revolution?

<b>                       STEPHANIE
</b>          That we can talk about later.

Stephanie crosses her legs. Guido looks down and sees
her grey patent leather boot moving in time to the
beat.

The tiered levels of the unfinished set are covered

He gets up from the bed and bolts from the room...

bed, curls round her and kisses her neck. Determined
to commit to Luisa.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I love you Luisa.

pressing a cold compress onto Carla's head as she lies,

things.

</b>          Come back.

Guido reassures her with a gesture.


<b>INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Guido and Doctor Rondi come out. Guido is concerned.
Doctor Rondi writes out a prescription as he talks.

<b>                       DOCTOR RONDI
</b>          She took five or six pills, enough to
          make herself very sick. I understand
          she's your mistress.
                 (Guido can't answer)
          This is a sordid business. You movie
          people, I suppose you don't consider
          yourself bound by morality...

Guido doesn't fight. Rondi hands him the prescription,
picks up his bag, turns and walks away, leaving Guido
leaning against the wall...

they should leave.

<b>                         GUIDO
</b>          Grazie.

He sits on the side of the bed and puts his hand over
hers.

<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          Carla, I should call your husband.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>          Don't be angry with me. Everything I

suddenly understands herself.

Guido hears her.    Knows what she's saying is true.   She
looks at him.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Ssshh. You should rest. We'll talk

He stands and pulls a sheet up over her.

           Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

Guido lies down next to her, she turns to face him.

</b>           Rest, rest.   Cara mia...

<b>                        MAMMA (O.S.)
</b>           ...Caro,caro mio.

...Young Guido is scaling the unfinished set, as Mamma
circles him from below. Hundreds of candles fill the
darkness.

Mamma intercepts Young Guido as he jumps down from the
spiral staircase and she swings him into her arms. She
sings playfully.

Guido attempts to comfort Carla.

<b>                        CARLA
</b>           My husband thinks I'm clever, that's
           the strange thing, because I'm not,
           well you know that, I spend too much
           time in my little brain thinking about
           you, about where you are, what you are
           doing, what you dream of.

Mamma guides Young Guido through an allée of candles.

She gently spins Young Guido, and - as he completes the
turn - he is replaced by Older Guido. Mamma now waltzes
with her adult son.

Mamma caresses Guido's face.   Guido pulls away.

Older Guido watches, as Mamma takes Young Guido up the
grand staircase.

Mamma sits on the steps with Young Guido.     He rests his
head in her lap.

Older Guido walks past them up the staircase.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Hold on to me, Mamma.   Don't let me
          wake from this.

He disappears into darkness.


<b>INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Guido wakes. It's morning.

Carla looks very fragile as the first rays of sun touch
the room. Him, too. He rubs his face, hears voices.
He gets up, goes out to investigate.


<b>INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Carla's husband, LUIGI, is talking with Matron on the
landing.
                                   p. 69


Guido straightens himself up, approaches, as Matron
retreats to leave them alone. LUIGI is a nice,
dignified man. He's very anxious. He and Guido can't
really look at each other.

<b>                         MATRON
</b>          Excuse me.

She leaves.

<b>                         LUIGI
</b>          Is she okay?

<b>                         GUIDO
</b>          Yes.

<b>                       LUIGI
</b>          I'd like to take her home.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Of course. I'm sorry.
                 (hapless)
          She loves you, you know that, don't
          you.

<b>                       LUIGI
</b>          She's my wife.

He walks into the room. Guido stands outside for a
second, then turns to go.


<b>INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
</b>
The door is open as Guido enters. He's confused,
worried that Luisa has gone, perhaps. But then he sees
a figure moving about in the dressing room, emptying a
closet.

<b>                         GUIDO
</b>          Darling?

Dante appears, stuffing Guido's things into a suitcase.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          We're going back to Rome.

<b>                       GUIDO

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with
          you.
                 (different tone)
          And quite frankly, so have I. You
          drag a whole crew up here and then you
          just disappear.

<b>                       DANTE (CONT'D)
</b>          I can't protect you anymore. And
          Claudia is in Rome. Makeup tests start
          today. Remember?

<b>                          GUIDO

          I can't.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          You can't. You must. Don't sit down.

<b>                          GUIDO
</b>          I need help.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>                 (still packing)
          You've had help. You've seen the
          doctors, you've seen the priests,
          you've taken the cure.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I'm not cured.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>                 (decisive, no arguments)
          That's enough! The movie calls, your
          star has landed. Fausto - take his
          things please.

Dante walks over to the door with the suitcase, passing
Fausto. A Bellboy and a luggage cart stand in the hall.

<b>                      DANTE (CONT'D)
</b>                (impatient,

          Guido! Andiamo!


<b>EXT. GATES OF CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
Guido's Roadster approaches the gates. There are
PAPARAZZI gathered for the arrival of Claudia, for the
beginning of filming. They drive through, solemn faced,
ignoring the press.

<b>                       GUIDO (O.S.)
</b>          I need more time.

<b>                       DANTE (O.S.)
</b>          Forget the script. Claudia's here now.
          She'll inspire you to do what you do
          best, write with your camera.
                                     p. 71




<b>EXT. CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
The whole energy of this return to Cinecitta is hectic,
people wanting to work, equipment waiting to work,
everybody and everything needing Guido's attention.

Guido drives towards the stages. Guido feels the
pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a
movie that doesn't exist.

Guido is trying not to panic. He feels as if he's just
arrived in prison camp. He drives fast and straight to
Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are
immediately swamped. Pierpaolo has a hundred requests
for Guido...

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>          Maestro, the screen tests are back
          from the lab. Will you watch them now?

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Tonight.   We'll watch everything
          tonight and make some decisions.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>          Design meeting? Production meeting?

<b>                        DANTE
</b>          Tonight.

<b>                        PIERPAOLO
</b>          Tonight.

Dante marches Guido towards the stage. Lilli joins
them.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          Claudia says where are you? She's in
          fine form. Feisty.

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>                  (knows what that means)
          Okay.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          She asked if she could read my script
          as she didn't have one. I said I
          didn't quite have mine.

Lilli peels off and joins her assistant Roberta at a
rack of costumes.
                                    p. 72




<b>INT. INSERT STAGE, CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
A couple of huge cameras are being prepared, some
lights are being flown up into the grid, the LOADER is
preparing the Clapper Board. The Loader has created a
slate: ITALIA, CLAUDIA JENSSEN, HAIR AND MAKEUP TESTS.

The gang enters. Guido says a brisk hello to the crew,
then leaves the set quickly. Finds the studio
telephone behind the flats. He dials.

Guido waits. Luisa picks up the phone.

<b>                       LUISA
</b>          Pronto.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up.
                 (she doesn't respond)
          I want you to be with me in the
          screening room tonight. I want to talk
          to you about the casting, about the
          script. Everything...


<b>INT. INSERT STAGE/CONTINI HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
INTERCUT, LUISA at home, listening, inscrutable.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Otherwise I won't be able to start, I
          won't know what I'm thinking...

Luisa listens. Pierpaolo appears again, always the
same, needs him to start.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>          Maestro.

Guido nods, waves him away.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Are you there? Luisa?

<b>                       LUISA
</b>          Go on.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I'm not asking you to let me come
          home, I just want you to come to the
          screen test tonight. Not for me, but
          for the movie. You always have, you
          always do.

Luisa puts down the phone.
                                     p. 73



Guido is in a mess.


<b>INT. INSERT STAGE - EARLY EVENING
</b>
Guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly
there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and
some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only,
followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around
her. As the others walk towards a holding area with
costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman,
who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light,
her home, and stands there waiting for Guido.

She looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a
Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches
Claudia.

Pierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>          Silence please. Se gira. And we are
          rolling.

Guido gets behind the camera and films Claudia's test.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Could you turn to the right please,
          Claudia.

<b>                       CLAUDIA
</b>          Yes, I can turn to my right.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          And can you turn to the left.

<b>                       CLAUDIA
</b>          Yes, I can turn to my left.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Now just one slow turn for us.

<b>                       CLAUDIA
</b>                 (she turns around)
          Okay, one slow turn.

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>          Bellissima.   Brava.   Cut.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>          We've got it. Next costume please.

Makeup artists and costume assistants immediately
surround her, loosening her hair.

Dante is thrilled. Fausto is also mesmerised.    She's a
star, that's the long and short of it.
                                   p. 74


And she's warming up for a fight with her director.
Another litany of jibes, half-joking, but dangerous.

<b>                       CLAUDIA
</b>          Has anybody got a script? Script
          missing, handsome reward.... Lost, one
          script, title Italia. Can't make a
          film without it...

Lilli comes forward, puts a chinchilla fur coat on
Claudia, adjusts her hair.

<b>                       CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
</b>          So interesting to do hair and makeup
          for a part when you don't know what
          the part is.

Guido adores her, her spirit, her feistiness.

<b>                       CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
</b>                 (shrugs off the coat)
          No! I'm going back to my hotel now.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>                 (anxious)
          But please, just a couple more
          costumes, Claudia.

<b>                       CLAUDIA

          I'll read it and then we'll take it
          from there.
                 (calls over to Lilli)
          I love the costumes, Lilli. They are
          beautiful.
                 (back to the guys,
                  sweetly)
          Ciao Bello.

<b>                         GUIDO

</b>                 (to Dante)
          That's fair.

<b>                         DANTE
</b>          Fair?

</b>          I'll be back.
                                    p. 75



Guido races after Claudia, taking the chinchilla coat
from Lilli with him. Opportunity for escape.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          (calling to Guido)
          You've got dailies, Guido.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I'll be right back.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          (shouting)
          You've got meetings.


<b>EXT. CINECITTA - NIGHT
</b>
Guido drives Claudia towards the gates, which swing
open. The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car,
flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a
picture of the Star driving away with her Director.
Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from
Guido. They drive away, and are immediately followed
by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas
and little cars.


<b>INT. CAR, ROME OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
</b>
Guido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse
following.   Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her
in the car, she's such a class act. He's always
inspired. He's driving fast but distracted by her.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          You look ravishing.

<b>                       CLAUDIA
</b>          You're not seeing me, you're seeing
          Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere
          hidden underneath.

Guido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the
traffic. So do the posse, but as the road opens up,
they can't keep up with him and he manages to overtake
a car, they speed after him.


<b>EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT
</b>
Guido stops the car by some narrow streets in the
Trastevere, just south of the Vatican. They watch the
photographers hurtle past in search of them.

They sit for a second.
                                   p. 76



<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          It's good to see you.

<b>                       CLAUDIA
</b>          I'm assuming that's code for there's
          no script.

Guido is exasperated.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed
          with the script?

Claudia listens. She's always seduced by the way he
speaks, his passion. They fall in love with each other
in every movie, that's the way of it. Guido lights a
cigarette.

<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          Talk to the people who love you in our
          films, they're not interested in my
          script! They're interested in the way
          you turn your head, the way the camera
          looks past you to the moon... the way
          you smile a little as you cry, the way
          you really do blush for the camera -
          how?! -
                 (enough examples, sighs)
          who even knows, but whatever else it
          is, it's not my script.

Guido has no confidence in what he's saying anymore.

They get out of the car and begin to walk away.    It's
almost deserted here.

<b>                       CLAUDIA

<b>INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT

A screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting
down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the
screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup
test. People start to comment, all enthusiastically.

Guido gets a cigarette off Pierpaolo and lights up.

<b>                       DANTE

</b>          Thank you.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          ...and the hair, makeup, fantastic.

Guido watches, sitting alone, he turns around as he
sees someone come in the door, but it's Gianluca, not
Luisa.

<b>                       BENITO
</b>          She has a beautiful profile.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Two great profiles.

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>          She's a goddess.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          And the back isn't too bad.

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>          She came directly from Venus.
          Beautiful.

<b>                      DANTE
</b>          Fantastic. Guido?     Really nice.
          Who's next?

<b>                       BENITO
</b>          Actresses.

<b>                        DANTE
</b>          Okay.   Let's see the actresses.

The reel finishes. The lights come up, to excited
chatter, he looks at Lilli a row or two behind him, she
shrugs sympathetically.

The room goes dark, the next reel begins.      Guido turns
back to look at the screen.
                                     p. 81



During the reel, Dante is very decisive... shouts out,
as the women appear.

They come on, one after the other, say their names.
Guido gives them things to do.   Pick up the phone and
argue with your lover. No, make him laugh. Make him
want you.   Walk towards the camera as if you were
frightened. As if you were angry. ON ELEANORA - very
angry on the phone:

<b>                       BENITO
</b>          If we like her, we have to call her
          agent right away. Everybody wants her
          right now.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Well they can keep her.

<b>                       BENITO
</b>          She's a very funny actress.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          She's peculiar. You don't like her
          Guido?

Next actress: ILARIA. Someone comes in the door.
Guido turns and sees it's Luisa, sitting next to Lilli.
She's come. He turns back to the screen.

Another actress appears. It's Donatella. Very
nervous. She says her name. Guido instructs her.     She
tries the phone, the walks. She's not a natural.

Luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation. She
looks at Guido. A little smile. He feels it like
sunshine. He turns back to the screen.

<b>                        DANTE (CONT'D)
</b>          She's nice.

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>          She's very natural.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Even better. She's a bit nervous
          here. What do you say, Guido?
          Donatella's nice?

Another girl: ALESSIA. Very striking. Keeps looking
out past the camera, getting sotto voce instructions
from Guido. Her hair is in a chignon. She begins her
improv, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in
front of the camera. Approaches her, and undoes the
chignon, freeing her hair. She's beautiful and
innocent. Guido says something to her, a whisper. But
what he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes,
goes like a dagger to Luisa.
                                      p. 82



<b>                       DANTE (CONT'D)
</b>          Who's this? I thought we were looking
          for a blonde.

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>          She's too tall.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Very tall.

<b>                       BENITO
</b>          She's very beautiful.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          It's not the point.     Guido wants the
          blonde.

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>          She's not bad, but -

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          Shh.

<b>                       FAUSTO
</b>          She's beautiful.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>          She's too beautiful.      For my tastes.

As the reel finishes... and the lights come up.

<b>                       DANTE (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't know what Guido thinks. I
          think we are happy with Donatella.
          Donatella's better, isn't she?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Sure.

<b>                       DANTE
</b>                 (delighted, jumps up)
          Great. Anyway, fantastic day, but we
          have to go home. We have a very, very
          busy day tomorrow. Thank you very much
          everybody. Thank you. Okay, well
          done.

The screening room empties, a lot of mutual
congratulations on good work, especially to Lilli, and
a hug or a handshake from almost everybody for Luisa.
Lilli kisses her, leaves. Just the two of them now,
husband and wife, several rows apart in the empty
screening room.

<b>                       GUIDO

A gloved hand emerges from behind a beaded curtain,

Guido collapses to his knees.

<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>                 (honest)
          I destroyed everything, Mamma...

Suddenly, his mother appears.

<b>                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          ...I destroyed everything, I just...
          you make one wrong turn and then
          because of that, after it all the
          turns are wrong. And you are so far
          from where you wanted to be...and
          you're lost and then you're lost.
                                       p. 87



<b>                       MAMMA
</b>          No one can help you find your way.
                 (a beat)
          It's up to you, Guido. Up to you.
          Nobody else.

In Guido's face, a soulful recognition that what she's
said is true.


<b>INT. CINECITTA, STAGE 5 - DAY
</b>
<b>A HUGE CRASH...
</b>
...A large piece of Guido's set comes crashing down.

Dante and Guido walk through the empty soundstage,
leaving behind the set which is being dismantled by a
group of construction workers.

<b>                       GUIDO (O.S.)
</b>          Old friends, I have to come clean with
          you.


<b>INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY
</b>
REALITY. Guido faces his production team.      This is
hard for him.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          There is no movie. I can't pretend
          anymore. We have to stop.
                 (nothing more to say)
          I'm sorry.

There is silence in the room.


<b>EXT. CINECITTA, STAGE 5 - DAY
</b>
The metal soundstage door opens as Guido and Dante walk
through and into the sunlight. Guido is defeated. He
stops at his car and turns to Dante. Guido gets in his
car. Guido drives away. Dante watches him go.


<b>EXT. BEACH - ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON
</b>
A cold wind blows.   A lonely figure (GUIDO) walks along
a deserted beach.

SUPERTITLE:   Anguillara, Italy, 2 years later
                                    p. 88




<b>EXT. BEACH CAFE, ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON
</b>
It's the end of the season. Only a few customers left
in the cafe, as the waiters close up for the day,
pulling down umbrellas, stacking tables.

Guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt.
Haggard. He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves
crash to and fro. A newspaper sits open in front of
him. Scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a
theater production in Rome. Guido gets up at this
moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper,
folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant.

He heads up the steps towards the promenade and we
catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes -


<b>EXT. ROME, THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
Guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street
from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play,
DIANA E LA TUDA, starring LUISA ACARI.

Luisa exits the theatre with the company of actors, all
of them plaited together in post-performance bonhomie.

Guido watches from a distance.

Luisa takes the arm of a handsome male, as they cross
and head down the street.


<b>EXT. ANGUILLARA STREETS - DAY
</b>
Guido and Lilli walk along the waterfront.   People pass
by occasionally. They talk -

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          I'm glad she's acting again. I made
          her costumes for the play. She's
          funny.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          She seemed so happy. I didn't want to
          interfere... Is she with anybody?

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          Guido, she's my friend. I'm not her
          mother. I don't know. I expect so.
          Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me
          you're going to let me cut your hair
          and get rid of that awful beard.
                                      p. 89



<b>                        GUIDO
</b>           I like to get about without everybody
           pointing at me.

<b>                        LILLI
</b>           And where are you getting about?

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>           Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be
           able to walk.

<b>                        LILLI
</b>           Are you seeing anybody?

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>           No, no. Nobody.

<b>                        LILLI
</b>                  (teasing)
           Well, it sounds exciting. Walking
           around and not seeing anyone, growing
           a beard.   I might come up here and
           join you.

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>           Don't tease me, Lilli.    My heart is -

<b>                        LILLI
</b>           - I know.

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>           I just miss her. I should have IDIOT
           tattooed on my forehead.

<b>                        LILLI
</b>           Luisa certainly thinks so.

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>                  (grasping at this)
           Does she? Did she really say that?

<b>                        LILLI
</b>           Stop! I'm not going to act as a
           postman between you both. Come back
           to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work.

He sits.   Lilli joins him.

<b>                        GUIDO
</b>           No. Never. I've spent this time
           trying to learn something, Lilli, to
           not be the person who forgets about
           everybody else, the person who never
           grew up.
                                      p. 90



<b>                       LILLI
</b>          You're such a dope, aren't you?
          Making movies wasn't your problem. You
          were your problem.   Don't stop being
          a child. You'll never make another
          movie! Nobody wants that...
          especially Luisa.

She indicates the people who pass.

<b>                       LILLI (CONT'D)
</b>          Guido - there probably isn't a single
          person passing by who hasn't been
          touched in some way by one of your
          movies. That's your gift. That's what
          you've been given. Use it. Just use it
          with some grace. For Chrissake.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (doubtful)
          The only movie I could make now would
          be... I don't know... would be about a
          man trying to win back his wife.

<b>                       LILLI
</b>          Sounds perfect.
                 (after a beat)
          The costumes might not be so bad too.

FLASH: Lights from a makeup mirror. A glimpse of a
female eye applying false eyelashes.

FLASH: A man of the collar applies pancake makeup,
while a cigarette dangles from his lips.

Young Guido, 9, appears and whispers into Guido's ear.

<b>                       YOUNG GUIDO
</b>          We're ready to begin!


<b>INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
</b>
A surreal backstage, the cast of Guido's life, whores,
models, schoolboys, priests, etc. A show about to
begin.

The music of "Be Italian/Folies Bergere" plays and
builds throughout.

People run past with props, lights, etc.    Showgirls are
hurrying. A beautiful confusion.
                                      p. 91




<b>EXT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY
</b>
Guido pulls up in his car outside the soundstage. He
stops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence.
Summoning his courage, he gets out of the car. He is
greeted by Pierpaolo. He seems to need and acknowledge
his support. Pierpaolo is tender.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I can't remember how you do this.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>          You'll remember.


<b>INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
</b>
The camera moves through the backstage mayhem.

Mamma is in her dressing room preparing. Saraghina is
sharing a dressing room with a Priest. He is helping
with her corset. Carla and Luigi. Carla fixes her
husband's hair. Claudia and Stephanie smoke and talk.
Lilli adjusts her own, and other men's wardrobe.


<b>INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY
</b>
Guido is in his element again, locked in passionate
discussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand,
an actual script. The set surrounding them is modest;
a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets.
The vast film Italia has clearly given way to something
smaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a
woman.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          I don't want to say too much. The
          first way that we kill our film is by
          talking about it. But this scene is
          about reconciliation. And within the
          scene I would like you to try and find
          your way to begin that journey back
          towards each other.


<b>INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
</b>
Young Guido rushes by the dressing rooms.

<b>                       YOUNG GUIDO
</b>          Presto! Presto! Take your places!
          Andiamo! Andiamo!

The dressing rooms begin to empty.
                                    p. 92




<b>INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY
</b>
From high above on the soundstage catwalk, Young Guido
watches Older Guido at work.

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>                 (Continuing to speak to
                  his actors)
          Maybe it's the most important building
          block that we have to begin again...
          We start from the beginning each time
          and I feel today as if I'm starting
          from the beginning. We'll just keep
          asking each other questions, and don't
          look to me for the answers, okay?

On cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him and
ushers in THE CAST OF GUIDO'S LIFE. They enter with a
sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange
themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom
behind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white.

But Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task
that lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts down
his script. He takes off his jacket and hangs his
glasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set
in front of him.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>          Maestro, should I call final checks?

<b>                       GUIDO
</b>          Yes.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO
</b>          Makeup, please! Final checks!

A LONG WIDE PAN reveals a tableau vivant looming behind
Guido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every
inspiration. They watch him as he begins to work. A
part of him now and forever.

Guido sits on the crane.

The soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure
slip quietly onto the set. Tentatively, she steps
through the shadows. It's Luisa. From a discreet
distance, she watches her husband return to his gift.

Pierpaolo calls for silence.

<b>                       PIERPAOLO (CONT'D)
</b>          Alora. Silencio per favore. Silence
          please.
                 (to camera)
          Gyriamo. E alora motore!
                                    p. 93



<b>CLOSE UP ON THE CLAPBOARD.   WORKING TITLE: NINE.   DIR:
</b><b>G. CONTINI.
</b>
As the clapboard strikes.

<b>                       CLAPPER LOADER
</b>          Slate.

At the last moment, Young Guido runs fast, down the
maze of steps, across the soundstage and jumps onto the
crane with Guido as it begins to rise. Luisa watches.
As the last note plays, the crane soars higher,
carrying Guido up and up.
