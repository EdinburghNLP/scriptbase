ON THE WATERFRONT by Budd Schulberg


               ON THE WATERFRONT

               by Budd Schulberg

FADE IN

EXT—ESTABLISHING SHOT—WATERFRONT—NIGHT

Shooting toward a small building (Hoboken Yacht Club) set upon a wharf 
floating about twenty-five yards off shore. A long, narrow gangplank 
leads from the wharf to the shore, and on either side of the wharf are 
large ocean liners which are being unloaded by arc light. In the B.G. 
is the glittering New York skyline. A great liner, blazing with light, 
is headed down river. A ferry chugs across to Manhattan. There is a 
counterpoint of ships' whistles, some shrill, others hauntingly muted.

CLOSER SHOT—SMALL BUILDING—ON WHARF—NIGHT

It is the office of the longshoremen's local for this section of 
waterfront. Coming along the gangplank toward the shore is an isolated 
figure. He is TERRY MALLOY, a wiry, jaunty, waterfront hanger-on in his 
late twenties. He wears a turtleneck sweater, a windbreaker and a cap. 
He whistles a familiar Irish song.

A SERIES OF WALKING SHOTS—TERRY MALLOY—WATERFRONT—NIGHT

Reaching the shore and turning away from the union office. Passing the 
burned-out piers.
Turning up a waterfront tenement street lit by a dim street lamp that 
throws an eerie beam. He is holding something inside his jacket but we 
cannot see what it is.

NOTE: MAIN TITLES TO BE SUPERIMPOSED OVER THIS SERIES OF SHOTS

EXT—WATERFRONT STREET—NIGHT

Terry walks along until he reaches an ancient tenement where he stops, 
hesitates, looks up toward the top of the building, and putting his 
fingers to his mouth lets out a shrill, effective whistle that echoes 
up the quiet street. Then he cups his hands to his mouth and shouts:

                    TERRY
          Hey Joey! Joey Doyle!

MEDIUM SHOT—TENEMENT WINDOW—NIGHT

The window of a third-story room, from Terry's POV. JOEY DOYLE, a 
youthful, rather sensitive and clean-cut Irish boy, pokes his head out 
the window.

                    JOEY
          Terry?
               (then a little suspiciously)
          What do you want?

REVERSE ANGLE—WATERFRONT STREET—NIGHT

                    TERRY
          Hey look-

He reaches into his windbreaker in a gesture associated with drawing a 
gun from a shoulder holster. But instead he draws out a live racing 
pigeon. As he does so the bird makes an effort to escape and flaps its 
wings, but Terry subdues it expertly and holds it up for Joey to see.

                    TERRY
               (somewhat uneasily)
          —one of yours. I recognized the band.

CLOSE—ON JOEY AT WINDOW—NIGHT

There is a fire escape in front of it.

                    JOEY
          Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the
          last race.

                    TERRY
          He followed my birds into their coop.
          Here, you want him?

                    JOEY
               (cautiously)
          Well I got to watch myself these days.
          Know what I mean?

                    TERRY
          I'll bring him up to your loft.

                    JOEY
               (some what reassured)
          I'll see you on the roof.

Joey closes the window and turns away.

EXT—MEDIUM CLOSE—TENEMENT—ON TERRY —NIGHT

Tensely, as if going through something he wishes he could avoid, Terry 
looks in the direction of the tenement stoop and nods. Now for the 
first time we see two men standing there under the doorway so that Joey 
was unable to see them from his window. When Terry nods they enter the 
tenement hallway; he takes a few steps forward so as to be out of sight 
from Joey's widow. Then Terry raises the pigeon into the air and, 
inexplicably, releases it. As it wings out of sight he turns and starts 
up the street in the direction from which he came, walking crabwise as 
if trying to see the effect of what he has just done. A soddenly drunk, 
one-armed longshoreman, MUTT MURPHY, staggers toward him, singing in a 
hoarse voice... .

                    MUTT
               (as if it were a dirge)
          Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim,
          Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...
               (He stumbles into Terry.)
          Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?

                    TERRY
          Go on, beat it!

                    MUTT
          A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?

                    TERRY
          Don't give me that coffee, you rummy.
          Now blow!

                    MUTT
          Thanks for nothing, you bum.

With a certain battered dignity, Mutt moves off, picking up his song, 
"Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan... ." Terry takes an anxious glance back 
toward the tenement.

EXT—TENEMENT ROOFTOP—NIGHT

In the B.G. on the far shore is the New York skyline. In the M.G. a 
ship is being unloaded on this side of the river. In the F.G. is a coop 
of racing pigeons. Joey comes out on the roof and looks around. The 
door f rom the tenement stairway creaks open and Joey turns.

                    JOEY
          Terry?

There is no answer. Joey is surprised.

                    JOEY
          That you, Terry?

Two men step out upon the roof, their faces hidden in shadows. Joey 
looks startled and retreats a  few steps.

                    JOEY
          Where's Terry?

The two men (BARNEY and SPECS) advance, silently.

                    JOEY (continued)
          He said he'd meet me up here.

CLOSE SHOT—JOEY—ROOFTOP—NIGHT

Now he realizes the intentions of the two men. He looks around for some 
means of escape.

MEDIUM CLOSE—BARNEY AND SPECS—ROOFTOP—NIGHT

From Joey's angle. Moving in.

MEDIUM CLOSE—JOEY—ROOFTOP—NIGHT

He makes a wild dash for the fire escape which leads him to the roof. 
But when he reaches it, another goon, SLIM, appears, cutting off this 
escape.

LONG SHOT—ROOFTOP—NIGHT

Joey turns and runs along the edge of the roof, the illuminated skyline 
in the B.G. He
disappears from view as if he has jumped o ff the roof.

MEDIUM SHOT—LOWER ROOFTOP LEVEL—NIGHT

This rooftop is one floor lower than the rooftops on either side of it, 
forming a trough between the two and providing no further avenue of 
escape for Joey. As Joey looks around desperately, Barney appears on 
upper level and another goon, SONNY, appears on the other. Now Joey is 
trapped between them. As they move forward he retreats backward toward 
the edge of the roof.

                    JOEY (defiantly)
          You want me to jump so it looks
          like an accident?

The assailants close in silently. Joey gestures them on.

                    JOEY
          Come on. I'll take one of you with me.

The goons edge in still closer, poker-faced, knowing they have him.

EXT—FRIENDLY BAR—NIGHT
An old-fashioned corner saloon with swinging doors. Standing on the 
corner, fl anked by a goon aptly named the TRUCK is CHARLEY, THE GENT, 
Terry's older brother, rather handsome if a little too smooth, in his 
late thirties, a snappy dresser in his camel hair coat and snap brim 
hat. He is quick-witted and affable, more politician than mobster. 
Terry enters to him.

                    CHARLEY 
               (gently) 
          How goes?
                    TERRY
               (tightly)
          He's on the roof.

                    CHARLEY
          The pigeon?

                    TERRY
               (resentfully)
          Like you said. It worked.

                    TRUCK
               (to Terry, tapping his own temple)
          That brother of yours is thinkin' alla time.

                    TERRY
               (tense)
          All the time.

There is a short, shrill, almost human cry of a boat whistle. It 
changes slightly in pitch and we are hearing an actual cry.

CLOSE SHOT—BODY OF JOEY

Hurtling off roof, with a bloodcurdling shriek.

INT—CLOSE SHOT—WOMAN AT WINDOW (MRS. COLLINS)

She screams.

EXT—FRIENDLY BAR—FAVORING TERRY—NIGHT

Worried as he begins to wonder what happened.

                    TRUCK
          I'm afraid somebody fell off a roof.

Terry stares at him. Longshoremen come running out of the bar toward 
the sound of the scream. Terry has to struggle not to be carried along 
with them. He works his way toward Charley, standing on the curb with 
Truck, calmly watching the Friendly Bar customers excitedly running 
past him. (Calls and commotion in the distance O.S.)

                    TRUCK
          He thought he was gonna sing for the 
          Crime Commission.   He won't.

Truck winks at Charley significantly. Terry catches the meaning and is 
horrified.

                    TERRY
               (accusingly)
          You said they was only going to talk to him.

                    CHARLEY
          That was the idea.

                    TERRY
          I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get
          him to dummy up.

                    CHARLEY
          Maybe he gave them an argument.

                    TERRY
          I figured the worst they'd do is work him
          over a little.

                    CHARLEY
          He probably gave 'em an argument.

                    TRUCK 
               (almost primly)
          He's been giving our boss a lot of trouble.

                    TERRY
          He wasn't a bad little fella, that Joey.

                    CHARLEY
          No he wasn't.

                    TRUCK
          Except for his mouth.

                    CHARLEY
          Talkative.

                    TERRY
               (muttering to himself)
          Wasn't a bad little fella ...

                    TRUCK 
               (chuckling)
          Maybe he could sing, but he couldn't fly.

Terry looks at Truck, stricken.

                    CHARLEY 
               (sympathetically, nodding toward bar)
          Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.

                    TERRY
               (bewildered)
          In a minute.

Charley looks at him, slightly concerned, and goes in with Truck. Terry 
watches the longshoremen hurrying past him, in the direction of—

EXT—LANDING BELOW TENEMENT ROOF—NIGHT

Forming a circle around Joey are KAYO NOLAN, a hard little nut of a 
man; TOMMY COLLINS, a young longshoreman friend of Joey's; LUKE, a 
giant Negro; MOOSE, a good-natured, hulking longshoreman; and others. 
The shot favors POP DOYLE, a short , stocky man with a small potbelly.

                    POP 
               (to someone running up)
          I kept tellin' him: don't say nothin',
          keep quiet, you'll live longer.

                    POLICE SERGEANT
               (to another cop)
          Tell the ambulance to hurry.

SHOT OF ONLOOKERS—ROOFTOP—NIGHT

Including a hard-faced longshoreman, a careworn woman in her middle 
thirties (Mrs. Collins) and Mutt.

                    LONGSHOREMAN
          He ain't gonna need no ambulance.

FATHER BARRY, a lean, tough, West Side priest, climbs a wooden fence 
and approaches the crowd.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (roughly)
          One side. Le'me through!

MEDIUM SHOT—MRS. COLLINS, MUTT—ROOFTOP—NIGHT

                    MRS. COLLINS
               (to Father Barry as he passes)
          Same thing they did to my Andy five years ago.

CLOSE ON BODY OF JOEY—TENEMENT LANDING—NIGHT

Father Barry prays. A police sergeant turns to Pop.

                    SERGEANT
          You're Pop Doyle, aren't you, the boy's father?

                    POP
               (angrily)
          That's right.

                    SERGEANT
          He fell over backward from the roof—
          like he was pushed. Any ideas?

                    POP
               (aggressively)
          None.

                    MRS. COLLINS
               (coming forward)
          He was the one longshoreman with guts
          enough to talk to them crime investigators.
          Everybody knows that.

                    POP
               (wheeling angrily and pushing her away)
          Who asked you. Shut your trap.
          If Joey'd taken that advice he wouldn't be—
               (starts to crack up)

                    MRS. COLLINS
               (protesting)
          Everybody know that...?

                    POP
          I said shut up!

                    SERGEANT
          Look, I'm an honest cop. Give me
          some leads and I'll...

Pop stands silently, choked with grief.

                    KAYO NOLAN
          Listen— don't bother him. Right, Moose?

                    MOOSE
               (nodding)
          One thing I learned— all my life on the waterfront—
          dont ask no questions— don't answer no questions.
          Unless you... .
               (looks at the body and stops)

                    LUKE
               (reverently)
          He was all heart, that boy.
          Enough guts for a regiment.

                    POP
               (in a bitter rage)
          Guts— I'm sick of guts. He gets a book in the pistol
          local and right away he's gonna be a hero. Gonna
          push the mob off the dock singlehanded... .

                    FATHER BARRY
               (comfortingly)
          Take it easy, Pop. I know it's rough
          but time and faith are great healers... .

CLOSE—ON EDIE—TENEMENT LANDING—NIGHT

Joey's sister, a fresh-faced, sensitive young Irish girl who has been 
kneeling over the body. She looks up and around at the Father in bitter 
grief.

                    EDIE
          Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you
          stand there talking drivel about time and faith.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (taken aback)
          Why Edie, I—

                    EDIE
               (plunging on)
          How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the
          neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me.
          Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?

                    FATHER BARRY
               (embarrassed)
          I wish I knew, Edie,
          But—
               (starts to turn away as if appealing to the others)

                    EDIE
          Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too—
          don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (defensively, sincerely)
          Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.

                    EDIE
               (bitingly)
          "In the church when you need me."
          Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?

She turns from him angrily, toward the covered form of Joey.

CLOSE SHOT—FATHER BARRY

Father Barry stands there jolted and troubled.

                    MRS. COLLINS
               (moves in to him)
          Forgive her, Father. Them two was as close as twins.

Father Barry nods. Thinking hard.

                    MRS. COLLINS
               (continued)
          Whoever was in on this'll burn in hell until
          kingdom come... .

DISSOLVE

INT—FRIENDLY BAR—NIGHT

The atmosphere is the sharpest possible contrast to the scene above. It 
is a rough waterfront bar full of half-gassed longshoremen and pistol 
boys. They are all watching a fight on TV above the  bar, and there is 
much hoarse laughter and ad lib jokes at the fight. The only one not 
watching
is Terry, who sits at a table by himself staring at a half-finished 
glass of beer. Mutt is wandering around in the B.G.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, Terry, Riley's makin' a bum outa that Solari—

Terry looks off and sees—

MEDIUM SHOT—BARNEY AND SPECS—AT BAR—NIGHT

Unconcernedly drinking and enjoying the fight. SPECS Come on over and 
have a shot.
Still disturbed and preoccupied, Terry shakes his head and goes on 
through the bar toward the 
back room. Others call to him but he keeps going.

INT—BACK ROOM OF BAR—NIGHT

A partition separates this room from the main bar, and a small corner 
of the bar extends through the partition. On the wall are old fight 
posters and some pictures of fighters, ball players and horses. At a 
table, flanked by Charley and a tall, muscular bodyguard, SONNY, is 
JOHNNY FRIENDLY. He is not tough in a conventional way, but with a 
sinister intent, a humorless sense of domination that is really 
dangerous. The boxing match can be seen on a smaller TV set.

                    JOHNNY FRIENDLY
          Turn it off. Them clowns can't fight. There's nobody
          tough anymore.

JOCKO, the bartender, pokes his head through the archway behind the 
bar.

                    JOCKO
          Hey, boss, Packy wants another one on
          the cuff?

                    JOHNNY
               (with a generous wave of his hand)
          Give it to him!

As Johnny finishes off a bottle of beer, BIG MAC, the bullnecked hiring 
boss, comes up to the table with a thick roll of bills. 

                    BIG MAC
          Here's the cut from the shape-up. Eight hundred 
          and ninety-one men at three bucks a head makes—

puts on glasses, incongruous on his beefy face

          --twenty-six seventy-three.

                    JOHNNY
               (to Charley)
          Here, you count it. Countin' makes me sleepy.

Terry enters during the above and sits at the bar, brooding. Johnny is 
glad to see him.

                    JOHNNY
               (continued)
          H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?

                    TERRY
               (subdued)
          So-so, Johnny.

                    JOHNNY
               (pantomiming, defending against blows)
          Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!

                    BIG MAC
          We got a banana boat at forty-six tomorra. 
          If we pull a walkout it might be a few bucks 
          from the shippers. Them bananas go bad
          in a hurry.

                    JOHNNY
          We'll ask ten G.
               (looks around)
          Where's Morgan? Where's that big banker of mine?

As Johnny talks he holds on to Terry, and fondles him casually. MORGAN, 
a big-eared, large-nosed little weasel of a man, pokes his head in the 
door as if he were waiting just outside.

                    MORGAN
          Right here, boss.

                    JOHNNY
               (mockingly — Morgan is sort of court jester)
          Well, J.P., how's business?

                    J.P.
          Havin' trouble with Kelly again, boss. He
          Won't take no loans and Big Mac puts him to
          work anyway.

                    BIG MAC
               (shouting at J.P.)
          He's my wife's nephew.

                    J.P.
               (right back at Big Mac)
          But he don't take no loans.

                    BIG MAC
          I got to give him work. She'd murda me... .

                    J.P.
               (shakes his head)
          That's why I stay single.
               (turns to Johnny)
          Here's the interest on the day, boss.
          Five thirty two.

                    JOHNNY
               (taking it from him and handing it to Sonny)
          Count it.

Now Sonny and Charley are both counting. SKINS, another runner for the 
mob, a nervous, pasty-faced man, enters. 

                    JOHNNY
               (continued)
          Hey, Skins—
               (as Skins approaches Johnny lowers his voice)
          --get away with that sheet metal all right?

                    SKINS
          Easy, that new checker faked the receipt.
          Here it is, boss.
               (offers receipt)

                    JOHNNY
          Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.

                    SKINS
               (producing another roll of bills)
          Forty-five bills.

                    JOHNNY
               (to Terry, sulking at the bar)
          Hey, Terry, front and center.

Terry comes over reluctantly and Johnny hands him the bills.

                    JOHNNY
               (continued)
          Count this.

                    TERRY
          Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.

                    JOHNNY
          It's good for you. Develops your mind.

                    SKINS
          What mind?

He starts to laugh but Johnny stops him with a look.

                    JOHNNY
          Shut up. I like the kid.
               (tweaks Terry's cheek fondly)
          Remember the night he took Farella
          at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle.
          Real tough. A big try.

                    TERRY
               (stops counting and taps his nose proudly)
          Not a dent.
               (tweaks his nose)
          Perfect

                    JOHNNY
               (laughs, rubs Terry's head)
          My favorite little cousin.

                    TERRY
               (disconcerted as he tries to count)
          Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.

                    JOHNNY
               (tolerantly)
          OK— skip it, Einstein. How come you never got
          no education like the rest of us?

                    BIG MAC
               (good-naturedly)
          Only arithmetic he got was hearing the referee count up to 
ten.

                    TERRY
               (hot-tempered, starting to attack Big Mac)
          Now listen, Mac—

Johnny laughs and pulls Terry back.

                    JOHNNY
               (amused)
          What gives with our boy tonight, Charley?
          He ain't himself.

                    CHARLEY
               (as if Terry were not there)
          The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is.
          Things like that— he exaggerates them.
          Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.

                    JOHNNY
               (taking the money from Sonny, Skins and J.P. and
          dealing out some bills to each of them as if the money 
werecards,
          while Charley goes on counting)
          Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the 
dock
          if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.
               (then more harshly)
          But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin'
          watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had
          to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up
          out of there for nuthin'.

                    TERRY
               (sorry to have aroused Johnny— who speaks loud and
          with frightening force when stung)
          I know, Johnny, I know... .

                    JOHNNY
          Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'.
          Some pretty tough fellas were in the way.
          They left me this—
               (suddenly holds up chin to show a long ugly scar on 
neck)
          —to remember them by.

                    CHARLEY
               (admiringly)
          When he got up and chased them they thought
          it was a dead man coming after them.

                    JOHNNY
               (to Terry)
          I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand
          dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two
          thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em
          puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work
          steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for 
openers.
          We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the 
world.
          Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.

                    CHARLEY
          Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.

                    JOHNNY
               (nods)
          We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin'
          ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our
          half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared
          to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little 
drop,
          eh, Charley?

                    CHARLEY
               (wisely)
          It'll do.

                    JOHNNY
          So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out
          of a deal like this— a deal I sweated and bled for—
          on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle 
bum,
          who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? 
          Do you?—

Terry is uncomfortably silent. Johnny raises his voice.

                    JOHNNY
          —Do you?

                    TERRY
          Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if—

                    CHARLEY
               (handing back the money)
          I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, 
Skins.

                    JOHNNY
               (turning darkly on Skins)
          Gimme.

                    SKINS
               (frightened)
          I— I musta counted wrong, boss, I—

                    JOHNNY
          Gimme.

He reaches over and takes money out of Skins's pockets, stripping him.

                    JOHNNY
               (continued)
          You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point.
          You don't work here no more.
               (impulsively he hands the bill to Terry— smiling)
          Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.

                    TERRY
               (still troubled)
          Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—

                    JOHNNY
               (roughly)
          Go on— a little present from
          your Uncle Johnny.
               (He pushes the bill into the breast pocket of Terry's 
jacket, then 
          turns to Big Mac)
          And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put
          Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.
               (to Terry)
          Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee
          bags. O.K.?

                    TERRY
               (frowning)
          Thanks, Johnny... .

                    CHARLEY 
               (a kind of warning)
          You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.

                    JOHNNY
               (smiling)
          Why should he forget it?

As Terry turns away, toward the bar,

EXT—TENEMENT ROOF—DAYBREAK

Terry, darkly troubled, is watching the pigeons he has just fed when 
JIMMY CONNERS,
a freckle-faced fourteen-year-old boy, approaches along the same 
stretch of roof seen in the mugging of Joey.

                    JIMMY
          Hi!

Terry turns around startled, as Jimmy comes climbing up out of the 
trough where Joey was trapped.

                    JIMMY
          —I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.

                    TERRY
          's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself
          this morning.

                    JIMMY 
          Boy, you must've been up early.

                    TERRY
               (as if he hardly slept) 
          Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured—
               (gesturestoward feeding pigeons; then with 
admiration) 
          They got it made. Eat all they want— fly around like crazy—
          sleep side by side— and raise gobs of squabs.

O.S. or in B.G. a ship coming into port sounds its whistle, bringing 
him back to reality.

                    TERRY
          I better get over there. 
               (O.S. sound of ship whistle again. Terry answers the 
ship irritably) 
          O.K., O.K., I'm coming.
               (starts off)
          Don't spill no water on the floor now. I
          Don't want them birds to catch cold.

Jimmy signals the Golden Warrior salute— the first two fingers raised 
together. Terry answers with the same salute as he goes o ff, 
disturbed.
DISSOLVE

EXT—LONG SHOT—PIER—DAY

Some three hundred men are standing around, men of all sizes and ages, 
some in dungarees, some in baggy denims, wearing battered windbreakers 
or service discards, and either caps or woolen pullovers. A sprinkling 
of Negroes. A ship is berthing in the B.G. The mood is somber and 
restless.

CLOSER SHOTS—LONGSHOREMEN

Muttering to each other.  

AD LIBS He was a good boy, the Doyle kid. Sure he was, that's why he 
got it in the head. Couldn't learn to keep his mouth shut.

MEDIUM CLOSE—ON TERRY

With his chum, JACKIE, as another pal, CHICK, comes up. Terry looks 
around as if t rying to hear what the men are muttering behind him.

                    CHICK
               (to Jackie but really to Terry)
          Hey Jackie, what D'ya think of this privileged character?
          Don't have to shape up no more. Got himself a soft touch
          up in the loft.
               (mimics sound of snoring)

                    TERRY
               (defensively)
          Who told you that?

                    CHICK
               (winks at Jackie)
          Waterfront Western Union.
               (business of putting his hand to his mouth)
          Terry looks around at the restless men
          again.

                    JACKIE
          You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.

                    TERRY
               (hotly)
          O.K., O.K., That's enough.

In the B.G. Pop can be seen approaching Nolan, Moose, Tommy, and 
Luke with a windbreaker jacket over his arm.

                    JACKIE
               (a little hurt)
          What's the matter wit' you,
          success gone to ya head?

                    TERRY
          I told you lay off.

                    JACKIE
               (to Chick in a falsetto)
          My ain't we touchy this morning?

MEDIUM CLOSE—MEN BEHIND TERRY AT PIER ENTRANCE—DAY

Nolan, Moose, Tommy, Luke, and others are muttering about Joey. Pop 
comes up to them. The  men quickly drop the subject of Joey.

                    NOLAN
          Go home, Pop. The lads who get work
          Today'll be chippin' in gladly.

                    TOMMY
          Sure, we'll take care of ya.

                    LUKE
          That's the truth, Pop.

Others mutter expressions of bitter sympathy.  "Tough about Joey," etc.

                    POP
          Thanks, boys, but I'm gonna shape. Who do
          you think's gonna pay for the funeral— Johnny
          Friendly and the boss stevedore?

CLOSE SHOT—TERRY

Reacting.  Sonny, a few feet away, also hears and we follow him back to 
Pop and group. 

                    SONNY
          Hey, watch that talk. What you say?

                    NOLAN
          He was just tellin' me how proud he was
          to belong to a fine honest local run by such an
          outstandin' labor leader as Johnny Friendly.

                    SONNY
          Don't get wise now, you.

                    NOLAN
          Wise! If I was wise I wouldn't be no longshoreman
          for thirty years and poorer now than when I started.

Sonny looks at him threateningly. Nolan holds his ground and Sonny goes 
on.

                    POP
          Here— I brought you Joey's windbreaker—
          Wear it, Kayo. Yours is more full of holes than
          The Pittsburgh infield.

CLOSE SHOT—NOLAN

He is affected, but largely hiding his feelings.

GROUP SHOT—POP, NOLAN, MOOSE, TOMMY

J.P. Morgan pops up right behind Pop.

                    J.P.
          Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?

                    NOLAN
          Oh me and my chum are just rolling in
          the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P.
               (Pop's cronies chuckle.)

                    MOOSE
          Haw, haw, haw— that's a good one.

                    J.P.
               (undaunted, to Pop)
          You'll be needing a few dollars for your extras,
          Won't you, Pop? You're three weeks behind
          on the last twenty-five, but I'm willing to take
          a chance.

                    NOLAN 
          Some chance at ten percent a week!
          And if he don't borrow, he don't work.

                    J.P. 
               (to Pop) 
          You'll work.

                    NOLAN 
          I ought to belt you one, J.P.

                    J.P. 
               (retreating slightly) 
          Raise a hand to me and... .

                    NOLAN
          ... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.

                    J.P.
          You'd be off the pier for good.

                    POP
               (ashamed)
          All right, slip me a bill— and may
          you rot in hell, J.P.

                    J.P.
          When I'm dead 'n gone you'll know what a
          friend I was.

                    NOLAN
          Drop dead now, why don't you, so we c'n
          test your theory?

Moose leads the laughter. J.P. looks at them sourly.

                    J.P.
          Condolences.

J.P. goes off with his shoulders bent over and his head down, like some 
mournful bird, and Nolan walks behind him, mimicking.  Nolan notices 
Pop isn't laughing and stops.  CAMERA FOLLOWS J.P. toward Terry, Chick, 
and Jackie and holds on them. Two men in business suits—one of them 
carrying a briefcase, looking decidedly out of place on the waterfront—
approach.

                    GLOVER
               (larger, more good-natured of the two)
          Do any of you men know Terry Malloy?

                    JACKIE
          Malloy? Never heard of 'im.

                    CHICK
               (quickly)
          Me neither

They both turn away sullenly. Glover and his colleague, GILLETTE, look 
at Terry carefully. Gillette is scrappy and tough.

                    GLOVER
          You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?

                    TERRY
               (suspiciously)
          What about it?

                    GLOVER 
          I thought I recognized you. Saw you
          fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.

                    TERRY
               (impatiently) 
          O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?

                    GLOVER 
          Our identification.

He snaps out his wallet and holds it open for Terry's inspection.

                    TERRY
          Waterfront— Crime— Commission— ?
               (pushes wallet back indignantly) 
          What's that?

                    GLOVER 
          We're getting ready to hold public hearings
          on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration
          of longshore unions.

                    TERRY
               (automatically) 
          I don't know nothing.

                    GILLETTE 
          You haven't heard the questions yet.

                    GLOVER 
               (pleasantly) 
          There's a rumor that you're one of the last 
          people to see Joey Doyle alive.

                    TERRY
          And I still say— I don't know nothing.

                    GILLETTE 
          We're not accusing you of anything, Mr. Malloy.

                    GLOVER 
          I hope you understand that.

                    GILLETTE 
          We only want to ask you a few things
          about people you may know.

                    TERRY
          People I— You mean sing for you. Get out
          of here before I—

                    GILLETTE 
               (with a slight but confident smile) 
          I wouldn't advise that, Mr. Malloy. Unless you want to be
          booked for assaulting an officer of the law.

                    TERRY
          Listen, I don't know nothing, I didn't see
          nothing, I ain't saying nothing. So why don't you
          and your girlfriend get lost.

                    GLOVER 
               (gently) 
          All right, Mr. Malloy, you have a right not to talk, 
          if that's what you choose to do. But the public 
          has a right to know the facts, too.

                    GILLETTE 
               (nodding in agreement) 
          We may be seeing you again.

                    TERRY
          Never will be much too soon.

                    GLOVER 
               (almost like a friend) 
          Take it easy.

The two men nod and turn away. Jackie and Chick, a few paces off, have 
been taking it in. Terry swaggers for their benefit .

                    TERRY
          How do you like them jokers? Taking me
          for a pigeon.

                    JACKIE 
               (mimicking the investigators, in a falsetto) 
          Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.

Chick laughs and punches Terry's arm with rough affection.

                    TERRY
               (responding to the praise) 
          One more word 'n I would've belted the two of 'em, 
          badge or no badge!

They nod and laugh approvingly. There is a blast from the ship in the 
B.G. which is just docking.

Big Mac blows his whistle.

          A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days
          me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er,
          loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!

                    POP
          Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.

They laugh, then Pop looks O.S. and frowns.

          —Edie?

LONG SHOT—EDIE—PIER—DAY

blows, restraining him.

                    POP 
               (to Kayo) 
          What the devil is she doin' down here?

CLOSE ON EDIE AND PIER GUARD—PIER—DAY

                    GUARD 
               (with a brogue) 
          Edie, I know your father well, and I'm sorry for 
          your troubles. But there's been hundreds of 
          murders down here and practically no convictions—
          hardly any arrests.

                    EDIE 
          Why, Mr. Rourke? Why?

                    GUARD 
          The last fellow who talked was awful dead 
          when they pulled him out of the river. I guess 
          the Sisters don't teach you things like that
          up at your school in Tarrytown. 
               (with a gesture of futility)
          That's the waterfront.

He shrugs his helplessness and turns away. Edie stands crestfallen. 
Then she turns in the opposite direction away from the pier.

EXT—MEDIUM SHOT—FATHER BARRY—OUTSIDE PIER—DAY

Father Barry is approaching.

                    EDIE 
               (surprised) 
          Father Barry.

                    FATHER BARRY
          Hello, Edie.

                    EDIE 
          I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.

                    FATHER BARRY
          You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in 
          a turned-around collar?

She says nothing.

                    FATHER BARRY
          Don't you? 
               (with humor)
          I see the Sisters taught you not to lie.

She smiles in spite of herself.

                    FATHER BARRY
          I've been thinking about your question and
          the answer come up and hit me—  bang.
          This is my parish. I don't know how much I
          can do but you're right, Edie— I'll never find out if
          I don't come down here and take a good look for
          myself.

She looks at him hopefully. O.S. a whistle blows again, shrilly. They 
turn in its direction.

Terry steps forward.

Hendricks, Krajowski. Now, two hundred banana carriers.

He approaches the men.

CLOSE—ON FATHER BARRY AND EDIE

Watching from the slip.

                    EDIE
          Pop never talks about this.

Father Barry watches interestedly.

GROUP SHOT—SHAPE-UP—DAY

The men press closer to Big Mac, each one trying to attract his 
attention.

                    BIG MAC
          Don't crowd me. Stand back.

AN OLD MAN
               (seedy, toothless)
          Give me a break, Mac. I been  two weeks
          out of work.

                    MOOSE
          I got five kids. I need a day bad.

                    A BEEFY LONGSHOREMAN
               (old-fashioned looking in his knit stocking cap
               and heavy wool sweater)
          How about me, Mac? I knew your old man.

                    BIG MAC
               (roughly)
          Come on, you bums, push back.
          I'll do the pickin'.

CLOSE SHOTS—LONGSHOREMEN

From Big Mac's angle. One touches an ear—another strokes his chin—
another begs with his  yes—hungry, pleading, desperate faces.

CLOSE—ON BIG MAC

Angrily trying to clear the way.

                    THE OLD MAN
          I'll give four bucks for the job.

                    BEEFY LONGSHOREMAN
          I'll kick in five.

                    BIG MAC
               (shoving them hard)
          Back! Get back!

The beefy longshoreman actually makes a grab for one of the tabs. The 
men begin to surround and engulf Mac. He is jostled and pushed. The 
beefy longshoreman, slightly behind Mac, suddenly knocks the box of 
tabs out of his hand.

                    BIG MAC
               (desperately over his shoulder)
          Hey, Sonny! Truck!

FULL SHOT—LONGSHOREMEN MELEE

Two hundred and fifty men scrambling on the ground, fighting for the 
tabs like animals.

CLOSE—ON FATHER BARRY AND EDIE

Horrified, as they watch the struggle.

A SERIES OF SHOTS DETAILING BATTLE CLOSE SHOT—KAYO NOLAN

As he begins to rise, tab in hand, a big longshoreman at least a head 
taller swings a vicious punch at him. Kayo, with old-time boxing skill, 
"slips" it by a fraction of an inch. The effect could be a moment of 
comedy relief.

CLOSE SHOT—MOOSE

On the ground—as he is about to pick up a tab, a heavy shoe steps on 
his hand and the tab is grabbed away from him.

CLOSE—ON FATHER BARRY AND EDIE

Watching helplessly.

                    EDIE
          Pop!

FREE-FOR-ALL FAVORING POP & TERRY

Pop is battling near the edge of the free-for- all, in view of Edie and 
Father Barry. He sees a tab on the ground and is about to pick it up 
when another man only slightly younger and bigger punches him in the 
nose. He retaliates with a looping punch that knocks his adversary 
back; but he is unable to scoop up the tab because meanwhile a crony of 
Terry's has called over.

                    JACKIE
          Hey, Terry. Grab me on!

Terry reaches for it with one hand while blocking Pop off with his leg. 
He calls over to a crony.

                    TERRY
          Here you go, Jackie boy.

As he hands it over to his chum, Pop comes charging in at Terry.

                    POP
          Hey, give me that.

He swings wild punches at Terry. Just then Luke, the burly Negro 
longshoreman, sees a tab behind Pop, hurls himself toward it, carrying 
Pop with him, and back into the battle royal.

CLOSE SHOT—EDIE

She has seen the above action and makes a beeline for Terry. She is 
furious!

                    EDIE
          Give me that. It belongs to Pop. He saw it first.

Terry is enjoying himself. Unconsciously Edie is pressing herself 
against him to get the tab and her rage is a kind of passion that 
pleases him.

                    TERRY
          Oh, I thought you was gonna go to
          work— with all them muscles.
               (winks at Jackie, who laughs)

                    EDIE
          Give it to me— my Pop's job—

                    TERRY
          What makes him so special?

                    EDIE
          None of your business.

                    TERRY
               (to Jackie; handing him the tab)
          Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?

                    JACKIE
          Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's
          Old Man Doyle.

                    TERRY
               (losing his bravado)
          Doyle.
               (looks around at Pop, the identity hitting him)
          Joey Doyle's... .?
               (stares at Edie)
          ... .You're his... .

                    EDIE
               (firmly)
          Sister. Yes I am.

He runs his hand over his face and then, with a sudden impulse:

                    TERRY
          You don't want to lug bananas in the rain
          anyway, do you, Jackie?

He reaches over and takes the tab back from Jackie.

                    JACKIE
          Aah, give it to 'im.

Terry hands the slip to Edie and adds, for the benefit of his pals:

                    TERRY
          Here you go, muscles. Nice wrastlin' with
          you.

He flexes his forearm and throws two quick jabs at an imaginary 
opponent, a characteristic gesture. He sets his cap at a jaunty angle 
and winks at his chums but we feel his manner is forced, barely hiding 
his guilt.
Edie looks after him with smoldering anger.

She turns as Father Barry comes into view, leading Pop. Pop's nose is 
bleeding and he is pretty thoroughly battered. Nolan joins him.

                    FATHER BARRY
          Pop, you all right?

                    POP
               (brusquely)
          Sure, just the beak—
               (taps his nose)
          It's been busted before.

Edie hands him the tab.

                    EDIE
          Here—I got it for you.

Pop takes it, but he is humiliated, and bitter that she should see him 
in this moment of weakness.

                    POP
          Okay, I can use it—
               (glares at her)
          Now go back to the Sisters where you belong.
               (His anger mounting with his need to regain
          his self-respect, he turns on Father Barry.)
          I'm surprised with you, Father, if you don't
          mind my sayin' so. Lettin' her see things ain't fit
          for the eyes of a decent girl.

Just then Big Mac shouts from the pier opening.

                    BIG MAC
          Hey, Doyle, you got a tab?

                    POP
               (holding it up angrily)
          Yeah!

                    BIG MAC
          Then get in there. Number three gang,
          number one hatch, puh-ronto.

Pop jumps and hurries.

                    NOLAN
               (following Pop)
          Our welfare officer. He's been away
          three times for assault and battery.

MEDIUM CLOSE—EDIE AND FATHER BARRY

Watching him go. Around them are at least one hundred rejected men who 
linger in resentful silence. Some of them are rubbing hands bruised in 
the melee. A truck, hurrying into the pier, sounds its horn loudly. The 
men barely avoid being run down.

                    BIG MAC
               (angrily, to the rejected group)
          Outa the way. Come back tomorra.

Father Barry looks at all this in amazement.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (to one rejected man)
          What do you do now?

The man shrugs, too beaten down to answer. Father Barry asks Luke:

What are you gonna do?

                    LUKE
               (bitterly)
          Like he says. Come back tomorra.

Luke goes along with Father Barry, who approaches Moose and Tommy, who 
have also been rejected.

                    FATHER BARRY
          Is this what you do, just take it like this?

                    MOOSE
               (carefully looking around and lowering his voice
               matter-of-factly)
          Five straight mornin's I been
          Standin' here and the bum looks right through
          me. There's always a couple hundred left standin'
          in the street.

          Shh. Sonny's over there.

                    FATHER BARRY
          And there's nothing you can do?
          How about your union?

          motion, the lights go out, you go out.

                    TOMMY
          If three guys talk on a corner, Johnny's—
               (He takes a careful look around.)
          —boys break us up. Look at 'em.

                    FATHER BARRY
          Didn't the miners— sailors—
          garment workers— get rid of this years ago?

                    TOMMY
          The waterfront's tougher— like it ain't
          part of America. Anywhere else you got the law
          protectin' ya. Here ya just get knocked off and
          forgotten. Like—
               (He stops.)

                    LUKE
               (frightened)
          Shh, not here, across the street.

                    MOOSE
          River Street, you might as well be in—

Sonny and Truck move in.

                    SONNY
          What is this, a church picnic? Get outa
          here. Excuse me, Father.

They all start away from the pier.

                    MOOSE
               (looking to see if he is out of earshot)
          That's how it's been ever since Johnny and
          his cowboys took over the local.

                    TOMMY
          Name one place where it's even safe to
          talk.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (impulsively)
          Use the church.

                    LUKE
          What?

                    FATHER
               (after a significant pause)
          The bottom of the church.

Father Barry has spoken in a normal voice,as contrasted with the 
whispering of the others, and they all look off toward Sonny and Truck 
to see if they have heard.

INT—MEDIUM SHOT—PIER LOFT—DAY

In this long area atop the working pier various articles of cargo are 
stored. Elderly men work at a leisurely pace.

CLOSE SHOT—PILE OF COFFEE BAGS—DAY

On top of which Terry is lying comfortably reading a comic book. 
Charley enters to him.

                    CHARLEY
          Working hard?

                    TERRY
          It's a living.

He wriggles himself deeper into the coffee bags.

                    CHARLEY
               (looking up at him)
          You don't mind working
          once in a while to justify this lofty position?

                    TERRY
          I just fnished work. I counted the bags.

                    CHARLEY
          We got a little extra detail for you. The
          local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a
          meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it.
          You know, names and numbers of all the players.
          You're nominated.

                    TERRY
               (frowns)
          Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny
          going in there.

                    CHARLEY
               (indicating this job)
          Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to
          do a little one for him once in a while.

                    TERRY
          But going in that church, I'd be stooling
          for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.

                    CHARLEY
               (tolerantly)
          Let me explain you something, kid.
          Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on
          the guys you're with.
               (sees Terry frown)
          When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out,
          just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.

INT—ENTRANCEWAY TO LOWER LEVEL—CHURCH—EVENING

This is an overflow chapel for the church above. There are stained-
glass windows, an altar, pews and the figures of saints, but all is 
utter simplicity; it has not lost its basement feeling, and the 
unadorned walls and low lighting may suggest the catacombs.
The above is seen from the POV of Terry as he approaches. Inside Father 
Barry faces a small group of longshoremen still in their work clothes, 
including Nolan, Moose, Tommy, and Luke; Edie sits behind them. A thin-
faced, rather ascetic-looking priest, FATHER VINCENT, sits 
disapprovingly in the rear. As Terry stands in the rear, not anxious to 
enter, Father Barry is saying:

                    FATHER BARRY
               (rapidly, with a cigarette in his mouth)
          I thought there'd be more of you here, but— the
          Romans found out what a handful could do, if it's
          the right handful. And the same goes for you and
          the mob that's got their foot on your neck. I'm
          just a potato-eater but isn't it simple as one - two three?
          One— The working conditions are bad.
          Two— They're bad because the mob does the hiring.
          Three— The only way to break the mob is to
          stop letting them get away with murder.
               (He looks around at them. Everybody is silent, 
waiting.)
          If just one of you would answer one question, we'd have a
          start.
               (pause)
          And that question is— Who killed Joey Doyle?

REVERSE—ON GROUP

Silence. Moose looks down at the floor. Nolan works his left fist into 
the palm of his right hand. Tommy runs his hand over his face, 
embarrassed. Luke stares straight ahead of him. Terry sets his jaw 
stubbornly. Edie looks at all of them with a hopeful, pleading 
intensity. Father Barry waits, and then asks again—

                    FATHER BARRY
          Not one of you has a line on—
          who killed Joey Doyle?

Silence.

I've got a hunch every one of you could tell us
something about it.

Silence.

Then answer this one— How can we call ourselves
Christians and protect these murderers
with our silence?

Silence. The Father looks from one to the other, hoping for some break 
in the ranks. Terry starts down the aisle, just as Edie turns on Tommy.

                    EDIE
          Tommy Collins, you were Joey's best friend.
          How can you just sit there and not be saying anything?

                    TOMMY
               (miserably)
          I'll always think of him as my best friend, but—

He falls silent and shakes his head. Next to him, Nolan notices Terry. 

                    NOLAN
               (muttering to Moose)
          Who asked him here?

                    FATHER BARRY
               (to Terry)
          Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what
          happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.

Terry is tight-lipped.

                    NOLAN
               (whispering loudly to Moose)
          The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the 
bottom
          of the river.

                    TERRY
               (turnsaround angrily)
          Keep Charley out of this.

                    NOLAN
               (spunkily)
          You don't think he'd be— helpful?

                    TERRY
               (insolently)
          Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask
          him yourself.

                    NOLAN
          Maybe I will— one of these days.

                    TERRY
               (laughs scornfully)
          One of these days.

They glare at each other. Edie regards Terry with curiosity.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (cutting through)
          Now listen, if you know who the pistols are,
          if you see them on the dock every day, are
          you going to keep still until they cut you
          down one by one?
               (turns from one to the other)
          Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?

                    NOLAN
          Father, one thing you got to understand.
          On the dock we've always been D 'n D.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (puzzled)
          D 'n D?

                    NOLAN
               (nodding)
          Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n
          happen right in front of our noses and we don't
          see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter
          how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.

Moose, Luke, and others mutter agreement.

                    FATHER BARRY
          Boys, get smart. I know you're
          Getting' pushed around but one thing we got in
          this country is ways of fightin' back. Getting' the
          facts to the public. Testifyin' for what you know is
          right against what you know is wrong. What's ratting
          to them is telling the truth for you. Can't you
          see that?
               (turns from one to another)
          Huh? Huh?

The men do not respond. A few look back at Terry apprehensively. Father 
Barry subsides, feeling defeated. Father Vincent comes forward and 
takes over the meeting.

                    FATHER VINCENT
               (dismissing them)
          This seems to be just about all we can
          do at this time, I think you'll agree, Father,
          and so I'd like to close with a few words from
          St. Paul, "Come unto me... ."

He is interrupted by the shattering of glass as a rock comes hurtling 
through the long
narrow stained-glass window. Everyone looks at each other in alarm. 
Some jump up.

                    NOLAN
               (thumbing toward the window)
          That's our friends.

CLOSE UP—TERRY

Looking at Edie; then he cases the room for other exits.

MEDIUM CLOSE—FATHER BARRY AND FATHER VINCENT

                    FATHER VINCENT
          What did I tell you about
          sticking your neck out?

                    FATHER BARRY
          These fellers need help, Vince.

                    FATHER VINCENT
               (striding off)
          Okay. Don't blame me when they pack
          you off to Abyssinia.

                    FATHER BARRY
          I'll take my chances.
               (turnstoward the group, picking up the rock)
          We must be on the right track or they wouldn't
          be sending us this little calling card.
               (pause)
          Who's got a cigarette?
               (as he takes one)
          You better go home in pairs.

They all start out tensely, Father Barry helping to pair them off at 
the door. Edie lingers behind them, frightened. As she starts forward, 
Terry suddenly approaches. 

                    TERRY
          Not that way.

She looks at him in surprise. Terry pulls her back with rough 
solicitousness.

                    TERRY
          Come on, I'll get you out.

Before she has time to protest he is leading her rapidly to another 
exit.

DISSOLVE

EXT—LONG SHOT—CHURCH EXIT—DAY

Moose and Nolan come down the steps of the church. They do not realize 
they are being ambushed but the audience does. The goons leap out at 
them, and we see the effect of this action in the giant shadows across 
the face of the church, the flailing bats looming as large as telephone 
poles. We hear the cries of pain, then groans.

EXT—MEDIUM CLOSE—STREET—DUSK

As Father Barry runs up, Sonny and Truck are working Nolan over with 
baseball bats. Father Barry wrestles with them, taking a glancing blow 
in consequence, and the goons take off. Nolan sinks to the sidewalk 
with blood streaming from his head and Father Barry kneels beside him.

                    FATHER BARRY
          You all right, Nolan?

                    NOLAN
               (furiously)
          Yeah, considerin' they was usin'
          my head for a baseball!

                    FATHER BARRY
               (taking a handkerchief to blot the blood on
          Nolan's face)
          Nice fellows.

                    NOLAN
               (rubbing his head angrily)
          Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix
          those babies but—

                    FATHER BARRY
          But you still hold out for silence?

Nolan hesitates.

                    FATHER BARRY
          You still call it ratting?

                    NOLAN
          Are you on the level, Father?

                    FATHER BARRY
          What do you think?

                    NOLAN
          If I stick my neck out, and they chopped
          it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you
          ready to go all the way?

                    FATHER BARRY
          I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.

                    NOLAN
          Baseball bats— that's just for openers.
          They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar
          or no turned-around collar.

                    FATHER BARRY
          And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.

                    NOLAN
          Down to the wire?

                    FATHER BARRY
          So help me God!

                    NOLAN
          Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I
          tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried
          time.

Nolan says this with a slight smile as he makes an effort to rise.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (as he helps Nolan to his feet with a grin)
          We're off and running, Kayo.

MEDIUM CLOSE—AT CHURCH ENTRANCE—DUSK

Father Vincent is nervously closing the doors.

EXT—RECTORY—FIRE ESCAPE—DAY

Leading down to a dark side street. Terry pulls Edie along at a flying 
pace. He jumps down from the bottom landing, then looks up to catch 
her, for whom the height is too great. He holds her for a moment. Then 
he stops and listens. Heavy rapid footsteps approach. It is Moose and 
Luke, closely followed by goons wielding baseball bats. Terry pulls 
Edie back against the wall into the
shadows. The goons run past and Terry starts racing with Edie down a 
narrow alley
in the opposite direction.

MEDIUM CLOSE—WATERFRONT STREET—NIGHT

The one that meets the alley at the other end. As Terry reaches the 
street with Edie, he looks around to be sure all's quiet. 

                    TERRY
               (looking back)
          I think we're O.K.

                    EDIE
               (catching her breath)
          Thanks.
               (shakes her head)
          Steel pipes and baseball bats.

                    TERRY
          They play pretty rough.

                    EDIE
               (puzzled)
          Which side are you with?

                    TERRY
               (pointing to himself)
          I'm with Terry.

                    EDIE
               (straightening her dress)
          I'll get home all right now.

                    TERRY
          I better see you get there.

She looks at him wonderingly. The rummy longshoreman, Mutt Murphy, 
shuffles over toward Edie with his hand out, frightening her closer to 
Terry.

                    MUTT
          A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.

                    TERRY
          Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to
          nothing but rotgut whiskey.

                    MUTT
               (ignoring Terry and coming closer to Edie)
          One little dime you don't need.
               (He brings his whiskered, sodden
               face very close to Edie's and stares at her as if 
througha
               dense fog.)
          I know you— you're Edie Doyle. Your
          Brother's a saint—
               (crosses himself quickly)
          –only one ever tried to get me my compensation.

He points a wavering (unconsciously accusing) finger at Terry.

                    MUTT
          Remember, Terry, you was there the night he
          was'?

CLOSE UP—EDIE—STREET—NIGHT

Looking at Terry in surprise.

                    TERRY
               (nervously reaching into his pocket)
          Yeah, yeah—
          Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.

                    MUTT
          I can't believe it— a small fortune.
               (He kisses the coin, then pulls from
               his shirt a small tobacco pouchful of
               coins in which he deposits this one.) (then turns on 
Terry again)
          You can't buy me— you're still a bum!
               (raises his cap to Edie with unexpected formality)
          'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey.
               (crosses himself quickly and he goes off)

                    TERRY
               (sourly)
          Look who says bum!

                    EDIE
               (looking after Mutt)
          Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to
          the old rummies.
               (looks up at Terry)
          Did you know him very well?

                    TERRY
               (evasively)
          Everybody knew him. He got around.

                    EDIE
               (looking after Mutt)
          What did that man mean when he said you were... .?

                    TERRY
               (quickly)
          Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to
          himself, the joke of the neighborhood.

                    EDIE
               (glancing at him and then hurrying her steps)
          I better get home.

She gives Terry as wide a berth as possible.

                    TERRY
          Don't be afraid of me. I ain't going to bite
          you.

She continues to walk apart from him.

What's the matter, they don't let you walk with
fellers where you've been?

                    EDIE
          You know how the Sisters are.

                    TERRY
          You training to be a nun or something?

                    EDIE
               (smiles)
          It's a regular college. It's just run by
          the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.

                    TERRY
          And you spend all your time just learning
          stuff, huh?

                    EDIE
               (smiling at the way he puts it)
          I want to be a teacher.

                    TERRY
          A teacher! Dong!!!
               (He's impressed)
          You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley.
          He's very brainy. Very.

                    EDIE
               (quietly)
          It isn't brains. It's how you use them.

                    TERRY
               (increasingly impressed, almost awestruck)
          Yeah.
          Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you
          lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski
          Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—

                    EDIE
          In braids? That's right.

                    TERRY
          Looked like two pieces of rope. And your
          teeth were—

                    EDIE
               (smiling)
          I know. I thought I'd never get those
          braces off.

                    TERRY
               (laughs)
          Man, you were a mess!

                    EDIE
          I can get home all right from here—

                    TERRY
          The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you
          grew up beauteeful. Remember me?

                    EDIE
               (nodding)
          The moment I saw you.

                    TERRY
               (strutting)
          Some people got faces that stick in your mind.

                    EDIE
               (tenderly)
          I remember you were in trouble all the time.

                    TERRY
          Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by
          the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used
          to whack me with!
               (cracks himself on the head and laughs)
          They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 
'em.

                    EDIE
          Maybe they just didn't know how to handle
          you.

                    TERRY
               (warming to the subject)
          How would you've done it?

                    EDIE
          With a little more patience and kindness.
          That's what makes people mean and difficult.
          Nobody cares enough about them.

Terry plays "Hearts and Flowers" on an imaginary violin. Edie watches 
curiously.

                    EDIE
          What's that?

                    TERRY
          Pardon me while I reach for my beads.

                    EDIE
          What?

                    TERRY
          What-what? Where you been the last four
          five years? Outer space?

                    EDIE
          When Mother died Pop sent me out to
          school in the country. He was afraid with no one
          home I'd— get into bad company.

                    TERRY
               (righteously)
          Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's
          around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer,
          a little pool, a little—
               (looks at her and catches himself, his face

EXT TENEMENT SUNDAY AFTERNOON

Overhead a flock of pigeons sweep by, close enough for the flapping of 
their wings to be heard.
Terry and Edie approach the stoop.

                    TERRY
               (looking up)
          Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?

                    EDIE
               (surprised)
          Do you like pigeons?

                    TERRY
          That's my own flock up there, getting
          their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.
               (impulsively)
          Listen, you want to see them?
          Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.

They have reached the stoop of Edie's tenement.

                    EDIE
          I'd better go in.

                    TERRY
               (not wanting to let go of her)
          I only live up there and across the roof.

                    EDIE
               (going in)
          Thanks anyway.

                    TERRY
               (following her)
          Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?

                    EDIE
               (simply)
          What for?

                    TERRY
               (suddenly bewildered)
          I don't know.

                    EDIE
          I really don't know.

Then she goes in abruptly. Terry is left standing there, staring after 
her, confused by the unfamiliar emotion he is feeling for her. Suddenly 
his thoughts are interrupted by—

MEDIUM CLOSE—MRS. COLLINS

The sound of a lower- floor window opening as Mrs. Collins sticks her 
head out.

                    MRS. COLLINS
          You got some nerve.

                    TERRY
          What do you mean?

CLOSE SHOT—EDIE

Overhearing, as she enters the house.

MEDIUM CLOSE—TERRY AND MRS. COLLINS

                    MRS. COLLINS
          You know what I mean. Leave her alone.

                    TERRY
               (apologetically)
          I was only talkin' to her.

                    MRS. COLLINS
          She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.

                    TERRY
          I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.

                    MRS. COLLINS
               (as she goes)
          Not that free.

She closes window.

EDIE—INTERIOR—ON STAIRS

She mounts the stairs, thinking about what she has just heard. We are 
close on her face, as she approaches the door to their place.

INT—EDIE'S BEDROOM—EVENING

As Edie enters, Pop, in his undershirt, favorite attire, is just 
putting the last articles into Edie's suitcase. He snaps the suitcase 
shut. There is an old cat on the bed.

                    POP
          You're all packed.
               (reaches into his pocket)
          And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to
          St. Anne's.

                    EDIE
          Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.

                    POP
          Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a
          cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters,
          and to keep you from things like I just seen out
          the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with
          Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?

                    EDIE
               (simply)
          Who is he, Pop?

                    POP
               (mimics)
          Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted
          and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize
          the devil if he had you by the throat. You know
          who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie
          the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a
          butcher in a camel hair coat.

                    EDIE
          Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?

                    POP
               (shouting)
          I'm not trying to tell you he's Little
          Lord Fauntleroy.

                    EDIE
          He tries to act tough, but there's a look in
          his eyes that... .

                    POP
          A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother,
          here we go again. You think he's one of those
          cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry
          for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only
          one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed
          to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the
          crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .

                    EDIE
          He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .

                    POP
          Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's
          the same difference. Well don't think this Terry
          Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a
          bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him
          when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell
          he still goes into action.

                    EDIE
               (musing)
          He wanted to see me again.

                    POP
          You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just
          to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon
          hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown,
          before I put a strap to you.

                    EDIE
               (flaring)
          And learn about charity and justice
          and all the other things people would rather talk
          about than practice?
          Pop goes up to her and holds out his two
          arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles
          with emotion.

                    POP
          See this arm? It's two inches longer 'n the
          other one. That's years of workin' and sweatin',
          liftin' and swingin' a hook. And every time I heisted
          a box or a coffee bag I says to myself—this is
          for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin'
          decent. I promised your mother. You better not
          let her down.

Suddenly touched, Edie goes up to Pop and kisses him.

                    EDIE
          Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for
          all you've done to get me an education and shelter
          me from this.
               (becoming aroused)
          But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are
          so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things
          that are only in books and that people aren't living?
          I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on
          trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk
          home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they
          could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop.
          Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.

                    POP
          You are like—

                    EDIE
               (with regret and affection)
          Pop!

She turns and runs out. Pop with his belt in one hand, takes a few 
steps after her and then stops and stares at the unused bus ticket.

                    POP
               (shaking his head as he mutters)
          Jesus, Mary and Joseph, keep an eye on her.

EXT—TENEMENT ROOFTOP—EVENING

Autumn on the roof. It is not particularly romantic—there are 
clotheslines, wooden boxes, etc. But to the people of this neighborhood 
it is a luxurious terrace. Terry's birds are aloft, flying in a great 
circle, nicely silhouetted against the sun-drenched evening sky. Jimmy 
Conners is with him.

Terry has a long pole with which he keeps the birds circling. Moose is 
leaning against the wall, playing an Irish melody on his harmonica. His 
wife, a heavyset woman, sits beside him.

                    MOOSE'S WIFE
               (Moving her feet)
          My feet feels like dancin'. But the rest of me just
          feels like settin' here.

MEDIUM SHOT—TERRY

As he swings his pole he looks off and sees—
LONG SHOT—EDIE—ROOFTOP—EVENING

Hurrying toward him across the rooftops.

MEDIUM CLOSE—TERRY—ROOFTOP—EVENING

Catching sight of her, and stopping to admire her as she comes toward 
him.

                    TERRY
               (to Jimmy)
          Okay— I guess they got enough exercise. Let 'em come in.

He puts down the pole and the birds start flying down toward the coop. 
He sees Edie approach.

                    JIMMY
          I wonder how long she's goin' to hang
          around, huh, Terry?

                    TERRY
               (indicating the pigeons)
          Be sure they got enough water.

And he turns to await Edie.

SHOT—BRINGING EDIE TO TERRY

                    EDIE
          I changed my mind. I feel real mean
          tonight.

                    TERRY
               (pleased)
          Good. So do I.

As Jimmy goes off to fetch some water, Edie reads the fancy lettering 
on the back of his jacket.

                    EDIE
          The Golden Warriors.

                    TERRY
          I started them Golden Warriors. I was
          their first Supreme Commander.

Now Jimmy starts back toward them.

                    TERRY
          My shadow. He follows me around like I was
          Mickey Mantle. Thinks I'm a big man because I
          boxed pro for a while.
               (throws a few quick jabs)

Several pigeons swoop down and enter the coop. He nods towards her.

                    TERRY
          Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.

                    EDIE
          You don't mind yourself at all, do you.
               (turns to the birds)
          Joey used to race pigeons.

                    TERRY
               (darkening)
          He had a few birds.
               (pauses, nods toward Joey's coop across the roof)
          I got up and fed 'em this morning.

                    EDIE
          That was nice of you.

                    TERRY
               (disconcerted, needing to talk)
          I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles 
          away he won't stop for food or water until he's back 
          in his own coop.

                    EDIE
          I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested
          —in pigeons.

                    TERRY
          I go for this stuff. You know this city's full
          of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em.
          They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop
          down on the pigeons in the park.

                    EDIE
               (slightly horrified)
          The things that go on.

                    TERRY
               (proudly indicating a large pigeon in the coop)
          How do you like that one?

                    EDIE
          Oh she's a beauty.

                    JIMMY
               (critically)
          She's a he. His name is Swifty.

                    TERRY
          My lead bird. He's always on that top
          perch.

                    EDIE
          He looks awful proud of himself.

                    JIMMY
          Why shouldn't he? He's the boss.

                    TERRY
          If another fella tries to take that perch
          away from him, he lets him have it.

                    EDIE
          Even pigeons aren't peaceful.

                    TERRY
          One thing about them though, they're
          faithful. They get married just like people.

                    JIMMY
          Better.

                    TERRY
          Yeah, once they're mated they stay
          together all their lives until one of 'em dies.

                    EDIE
          That's nice.

They look at each other, both strangely upset.

                    TERRY
               (suddenly)
          Listen, you like beer?

                    EDIE
          I don't know.

                    TERRY
          Want to go out and have one with me?

                    EDIE
          In a saloon?

                    TERRY
               (imploring)
          Come on, I know a quiet one,
          with a special entrance for ladies... .

DISSOLVE

INT—SALOON—LADIES' SIDE—NIGHT

Perhaps a sign can emphasize Ladies' Entrance. As Terry leads Edie in, 
a tipsy Irish biddy is noisily protesting her enforced departure.

                    WOMAN
          —I'm only after havin' one more wee bit—

                    BARTENDER
          You and your one-mores. Now beat it.

As Terry and Edie reach the bar, the radio blares a baseball game. A 
roar goes up from the speaker. Bartender nods to Terry. In the corner a 
small well-oiled longshoreman sings "I'll Take You Home Again, 
Kathleen" in a plaintive, cracking voice.

                    BARTENDER
          Well, what do you know—Jackie
          just stole home.

                    TERRY
               (glancing at Edie with a mischievous wink at the 
bartender)
          I wouldn't mind doing that myself.

The bartender grins. Terry guides Edie to a small table.

                    BARTENDER
               (to Edie)
          What're you drinking?

Edie hesitates, obviously not knowing what to ask for. A customer at 
the bar says, loudly—

                    SINGER OF "KATHLEEN"
               (B.G.)
          Give me a Glockenheimer.

                    EDIE
               (it could be root beer for all she knows)
          I'll try a— Glockenheimer.

                    TERRY
               (to bartender)
          Likewise. And draw two for chasers.
               (to Edie)
          Now you're beginning to live.

                    EDIE
               (as the drinks are poured)
          I am?

Edie picks up her glass, sniffs the contents with some distaste and 
then sips it tentatively. Terry watches with amusement.

                    TERRY
               (still swaggering)
          Not that way— like this.
               (holds glass up)
          Down the hatch!
               (gulps it down)
          Wham!

Edie takes her drink and does likewise. She gasps and her eyes pop.

                    EDIE
               (with soft amazement)
          Wham... .

                    TERRY
               (grinning at her)
          How do you like it?

                    EDIE
           It's quite—
               (gulps)
          –nice.

                    TERRY
          How about another one?

                    EDIE
               (already feeling this one)
          No thanks... .

                    TERRY
               (to bartender)
          Hit me again, Mac.

                    BARTENDER
               (as he pours drink)
          See the fight last night? That Riley—both hands.
          Little bit on your style.

                    TERRY
          Hope he has better luck.

                    EDIE
          Were you really a prize fighter?

                    TERRY
               (nods)
          I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al?
          But— I didn't stay in shape— and—
               (a little ashamed)
          —I had to take a few dives.

                    EDIE
          A dive? You mean, into the water?

                    TERRY
               (laughs harshly)
          Naw, in the ring, a dive is-

He stops, shakes his head and with his finger draws an invisible square 
in the air.

                    EDIE
               (mystified)
          Now what are you doing?

                    TERRY
          Describing you. A square from out there.
          I mean you're nowhere.
               (draws it again)
          Miss Four Corners.

                    EDIE
               (smiles, but persistent)
          What made you want to be a fighter?

                    TERRY
          I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might
          as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old
          man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I
          was put in a place—they called it a Children's
          Home. Some home! I run away and peddled
          papers, fought in club smokers and—
               (catches himself)
          But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for?
          What do you care?

                    EDIE
          Shouldn't we care about everybody?

                    TERRY
          What a fruitcake you are!

                    EDIE
          Isn't everybody part of everybody else?

                    TERRY
          Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!
               (then)
          You really believe that drool?

                    EDIE
               (deeply shocked)
          Terry!

                    TERRY
          Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to
          him before he does it to you.

                    EDIE
               (aroused)
          Our Lord said just the opposite.

                    TERRY
          I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin'
          to stay in one piece.

                    EDIE
               (flaring up) I never met such a person. Not a
          spark of romance or sentiment or— or human
          kindness in your whole body.

                    TERRY
          What do they do for you, except get in
          your way?

                    EDIE
          And when things get in your way— or people
          —you just knock them aside— get rid of
          Them— is that your idea?

                    TERRY
               (defensive— stung)
          Listen— get this straight— don't look at me
          when you say them things. It wasn't my fault
          what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey
          wasn't my idea... .

                    EDIE
               (gently)
          Why, Terry, who said it was?

                    TERRY
               (lamely)
          Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry,
          I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.

                    EDIE
          He was looking at everybody the same way.
          Asking the same question.

                    TERRY
               (troubled, not convinced)
          Yeah, yeah... .
               (suddenly)
          This Father Barry, what's his racket?

                    EDIE
               (shocked)
          His— racket?

                    TERRY
               (trying to regain his bravado)
          You've been off in daisyland, honey.
          Everybody's got a racket.

                    EDIE
          But a priest...?

With his finger he again describes a square in the air and then points 
through it to Edie. This time it angers her.

                    EDIE
          You don't believe in anything, do you?

                    TERRY
          Edie, down here it's every man for himself.
          It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the
          right people so you can keep a little loose change
          jinglin' in your pocket.

                    EDIE
          And if you don't?

                    TERRY
          If you don't
               (points downward with a descending whistle)
          Keep your neck in and your nose clean and
          You'll never have no trouble down here.

                    EDIE
          But that's living like an animal—

Terry seems almost to illustrate this by the way he drains off his beer 
and wipes his mouth with his sleeve.

                    TERRY
          I'd rather live like an animal than end up
          like—

He hesitates.

                    EDIE
          Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his
          name?

                    TERRY
               (challenged—defensive)
          Why keep harpin' on it?
               (looks at her unfinished beer)
          Come on, drink up. You
          got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter
          with you?
               (nods toward juke box)
          I'll play you some music.

He starts toward the juke box. She turns with him. Suddenly something 
cries out in her, almost as if she didn't know she was going to say it—

                    EDIE
          Help me, if you can— for God's sakes help me!

CLOSE—ON TERRY

For the first time the edge is knocked off his swagger. He feels the 
purity of her grief. He'd like to help—that's his immediate reaction. 
But there's his brother Charley and his steady work and his loyalties 
to the mob and its code. All this runs through his mind, confusing him, 
tearing him... .

CLOSE—ON TERRY AND EDIE

Terry turns back to her, with a helpless gesture.

                    TERRY
          I— I'd like to, Edie, but—
               (shakes his head)
          —there's nothin' I can do.
          Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, 
and in a low 
          voice says—

                    EDIE
          All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.

                    TERRY
          You haven't finished your beer.

                    EDIE
          I don't want it. But why don't you stay and
          finish your drink.

                    TERRY
               (swinging off the stool)
          I got my whole life to drink.

As if magnetized by her, he follows her out.

EXT—LADIES' BAR—NIGHT

As Terry comes up alongside her.

                    TERRY
          You're not sore at me?

                    EDIE
               (with complete innocence)
          What for?

                    TERRY
          For— not being any help?

She looks at him with disturbing simplicity.

                    EDIE
          Why no— I think you would if you could... .

CLOSE UP—TERRY

Struck. Her faith in him and in human nature becomes the most painful 
kind of accusation.

TWO-SHOT—EDIE AND TERRY—STREET—NIGHT

Softly, silently, she begins to cry.

                    TERRY
               (gently)
          What are you crying for?

                    EDIE
               (shaking her head)
          I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not—
          I'm just— all mixed up... .

Ahead of them down the block is an outdoor neighborhood party. The 
rhythm of a small band reaches out to them. Edie hangs back and Terry 
takes her hand.

                    TERRY
          Come on, I'll walk you through. It's the
          shortest way home.

He takes her hand and she walks along with him passively. The street is 
illuminated with colored lights and bright paper streamers. There are 
several gaily decorated counters serving drinks and sandwiches. There 
are balloons and colored paper hats. Neighbors are dancing in the 
street. Children look on, a few mimicking their elders f rom the 
sidelines. Above the street is a homemade banner inscribed:  JUST 
MARRIED— JOHNNY AND MARY O'DAY! We catch a glimpse of the happy young 
bridal couple, as Terry and Edie reach the edge of the celebrants. Her 
eyes light up. She has passed into a dreamlike forgetfulness.

                    TERRY
          You like music?

Edie nods dreamily.

—and dancing?

Edie nods again.

                    TERRY
               (pulling her to him before she realizes what has 
happened)
          We're on!

At first Edie dances somewhat clumsily and stiffly but gradually begins 
to dance with zest and surprising skill, as if a whole suppressed side 
of her nature were suddenly being released. Terry is light on his feet 
and they do some intricate steps together.

                    TERRY
          Hey, we're good! 
               (grins at her) 
          The Sisters should see you now, huh?

She laughs, out of her youth and embarrassment and unexpected enjoyment 
of a stolen moment.

Now Terry draws her to him and they dance a more conventional half-time 
foxtrot to the music.

                    TERRY
               (awkwardly)
          I— I never knew a girl like you,
          Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em
          And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.

                    EDIE
          It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm
          floating. I'm floating... .

They have danced off to a darker, less populated section of the street, 
away from the bar and the bandstand. Behind them people are dancing and 
laughing. Terry's lips brush her cheek as they dance, and move on to 
her mouth.

                    TERRY
               (breathlessly)
          Edie... .

Carried away, she allows him to kiss her and even responds. Then Terry 
feels someone tapping him on the shoulder.  He wheels around to see—

CLOSE SHOT—BARNEY—STREET—NIGHT

Barney wears a colored paper hat.

                    BARNEY
          I been looking for you, Terry. The boss wants you.

THREE-SHOT—TERRY, EDIE AND BARNEY— STREET—NIGHT

While the music and dancing continue around them.

                    TERRY
          Right now?

                    BARNEY
               (nods)
          He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's
          gone wrong. He's plenty hot.

                    TERRY
          I'm gonna take her home first.

                    BARNEY
          I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.

                    TERRY
               (for Edie's benefit)
          I'll come over when I'm ready.

                    BARNEY
          You know Johnny when he gets mad.

As suddenly as Barney arrived, he ducks off .

CLOSE—ON TERRY AND EDIE—STREET—NIGHT

Edie senses Terry's distraction.

                    EDIE
               (puzzled)
          Who was that?

She is about to move away; Terry puts his hand on her arm.

                    TERRY
               (impulsively)
          Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin'
          to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.

                    EDIE
          Why worry about me? You're the one who
          says only look out for yourself.

                    TERRY
               (pent up with his guilt and his frustrated feeling 
for her)
          Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to
          me when you get burned.

                    EDIE
          Why should I come hollering to you at all?

                    TERRY
          Because... because...
               (apologetically, as if this were a sign of weakness)
          Listen Edie, don't get sore now—
          but I think we're getting in love with each other.

                    EDIE
               (really fighting against it)
          I can't let myself fall in love with you.

                    TERRY
               (fervently)
          That goes double for me.

As they stare at each other in entangled hostility and love, a man 
turns from the food counter behind them, just finishing a hot dog and 
steps into Terry's path. It is Mr. Glover, the Commission investigator. 
In the B.G. is Gillette.

                    GLOVER
          Mr. Malloy, I was hoping I might find you here.

Terry turns as if to dart off. Glover puts a restraining hand on his 
arm.

                    GLOVER
          You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.

                    TERRY
          What?

                    GLOVER
               (reaching quickly into his briefcase)
          Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock
          tomorrow.

                    TERRY
          I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't
          saying nothin'.

                    GLOVER
          You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged
          under the Constitution to protect yourself against 
questions
          that might implicate you in any crimes.

                    TERRY
               (more in pain than anger now)
          You know what you're askin'? You're askin'—

                    GILLETTE
               (stepping in from B.G.) (sternly)
          Mr. Malloy, all we're asking you to do is tell the truth.

                    GLOVER
               (more gently)
           Goodnight, kid.

Terry looks at the subpoena in tortured confusion.

                    EDIE
               (softly)
          What are you going to do?

                    TERRY
               (viciously reverting to type)
          I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.

                    EDIE
               (with sudden intuition)
          It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?

Terry looks off and then looks down, unable to speak.

                    EDIE
          He had him killed or had something to do with it,
          Didn't he? He and your brother Charley?

Terry drops his eyes again; he can say nothing.

You can't tell me, can you? Because you're a part
of it. You're as bad as the worst of them, aren't
you, Terry? Aren't you? Tell me the truth!

                    TERRY
          Edie, your old man's right, go back to
          that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself
          nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying
          about the truth— worry about yourself.

                    EDIE
          Look out for number one. Always number
          one.
               (her voice rising in anger)
          I should've known you wouldn't tell me.
          Pop said Johnny Friendly used
          to own you. I think he still owns you.
               (then gently, and hating to have to say it)
          No wonder everybody calls you a bum.

                    TERRY
               (as if struck)
          Don't say that, Edie, don't...

Edie is crying softly, without sobs.

                    EDIE
               (with a half-sob)
          It's true.

                    TERRY
          I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt—
          What more do you want?

                    EDIE
          Much more, Terry. Much, much more!

She runs off. Terry looks after her, pained; the subpoena weighs in his 
hand. He stares at it in agony, while the party swirls around him. Then 
the blare of an auto horn cuts through the music.

                    VOICE OF JOHNNY
               (O.S.)
          Hey, genius.

Terry looks up.

MEDIUM LONG SHOT

Johnny Friendly's black Cadillac parked across the street. A driver, 
Sonny, Truck, Big Mac, and Charley are in it. Terry hurries up to them.

                    TERRY
               (lamely)
          I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.

                    JOHNNY
          By way of Chicago?

Sonny starts to laugh but Johnny cuts him short .

How many times you been knocked out, Terry?

                    TERRY
               (surprised)
          Only two times, why, Johnny?

Throughout the following tirade, Charley would like to intervene in 
Terry's behalf, but Johnny roughly nudges him into silence.

                    JOHNNY
          It must have been once too often. I
          think your brains come apart. What you got up
          there, Chinese bells?

                    TERRY
          Aw, Johnny... .

                    JOHNNY
          I thought you were gonna keep an eye
          on that church meeting.

                    TERRY
          Nothing happened, Johnny.

                    JOHNNY
          Nothing happened, he says. Some operator
          you got yourself there, Charley. One more
          like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.

                    TERRY
               (turning to Charley for help)
          It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.

                    JOHNNY
          Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain
          Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with
          the Commission and he did all the talking.

                    TERRY
          You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He
          doesn't know much.

                    JOHNNY
          He don't, huh?
               (produces a bound folder of testimony
          from his pocket and slams it on the fender)
          Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.

                    TERRY
          How'd you get that.

                    JOHNNY
               (thumbing 'upstairs)
          I got it. Hot off the press.

                    CHARLEY
          The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.

                    TERRY
          Nolan? I knew he had guts but—

                    JOHNNY
          Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking
          to get his neck wrung! (to Charley) You should have
               (to Charley)
          You should have known better than to trust this 
          punched out brother of yours. 
          He was all right hanging around
          for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs
          messing in our business.

                    TERRY
          Now just a minute, I—

                    CHARLEY
               (suddenly)
          What the hell are you doing with his sister?
               (then turning to Johnny)
          It's that girl, Johnny, the little Doyle broad has him out 
on his
          feet. An unhealthy relationship.

                    SONNY
          Definitely!

                    JOHNNY
          Don't see her no more. Unless you're
          both tired of living. Barney, you got her address?
               (then to others, businesslike)
          Now listen, if we don't muzzle Nolan, we're into the
          biggest stink this town ever seen. We got the best
          muscle on the waterfront. The time to use it is now—
          pronto— if not sooner.
               (to Terry, as he climbs in the car)
          And you know where you're going? Back in the hold—
          no more cushy job in the loft. It's down the hold
          with the sweat gang till you learn your lesson.

Johnny twists Terry's cheek, but not in fun this time, as he has often 
done before. Now it is hard enough to draw blood. Then he turns to the 
driver.

                    JOHNNY
          Let's go!

The car drives off fast, almost running Terry down. He stands there 
looking after it, alone in the street, feeling his wounded cheek and 
then scowling as he looks down at the subpoena in his hand.

DISSOLVE

EXT—FREIGHTER—DAY

The ship is being unloaded. An empty pallet is swung from the pier and 
lowered into the open hatch by the up-and-down-fall tackle. Our CAMERA 
rides the pallet down into the hatch, to the second level, where Terry 
is working. A little removed from him are Pop, Moose and Nolan. They 
are unloading Irish whiskey.

                    NOLAN
               (lifting a case onto the pallet joyously)
          An Ir-rish ship loaded to the gunnels with foine Ir-rish
          whiskey!

He does a little jig and kisses the case as he sets it on the pallet. 
Pop and Moose laugh. But Terry looks over at Nolan tensely. Then he 
looks up out of the hatch.

EXT—DOCK—DAY

Johnny Friendly comes up to the edge of the dock with Sonny and Truck. 
Johnny mumbles something under his hand to Sonny and Sonny nods and 
jumps down onto the deck of the ship.

MEDIUM CLOSE—ON DECK—NEAR HATCH—DAY

Sonny motions to Specs Donahue, glimpsed as Joey's killer at the 
opening. Specs nods and goes over to the winchman guiding the tackle 
over the hatch. He nods to him, and takes his place. Then he catches 
the eye of—

MEDIUM CLOSE—BIG MAC

Standing on the deck just above the open hatch. A wordless message 
passes between him and Specs. Then he looks down into the hatch.

INT—HATCH—DAY

Terry works grimly, glancing up anxiously at Nolan, Pop and Moose whose 
mood, in contrast, is a whiskey-inspired euphoria.

                    POP
          You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over
          us after all.

                    NOLAN
               (in an undertone, gaily)
          When we knock off let's have a bit of a party.
          We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women,
          to Joey and Edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!

As he finishes this he reveals surreptitiously the neck of a whiskey 
bottle concealed in his deep-pocketed jacket.

                    POP
               (with mock concern)
          You think one bottle's enough for all
          them toasts?

                    NOLAN
               (grins)
          Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.

With a wink he reaches into his other pocket and draws up the neck of 
another bottle.

                    NOLAN
          I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.
               (reaching into still another pocket and revealing 
still more bottles)
          Now you see the advantage of a little man in
          a big coat.

                    POP
               (laughing)
          Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a
          walkin' distillery.

                    NOLAN
          I wonder how many Hail Marys the
          Father'll make me say at confession.
               (reflects)
          It'll be worth it!
          The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.

                    TERRY
               (with a nervous glance upward)
          Listen— Nolan—

                    NOLAN
               (backing away suspiciously)
          What are you down here for— to see we don't make
          off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?

                    TERRY
               (miserably)
          Nolan... .

MEDIUM CLOSE—BIG MAC

Looking down into the hatch. Above him we can see Specs at the winch 
controls.

                    BIG MAC
          Come on, Kayo, get it up!

INT—HATCH—DAY

Nolan and Pop look up at him and then back to their work with 
mischievous resentment.

                    BIG MAC
               (continuing to bellow)
          And don't be walking off with any of that.
          You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.

INT—HATCH—DAY

                    NOLAN
               (pretending to clean out his ears)
          Talk louder. I can't hear you.

                    BIG MAC
          If you kept your ears wide open instead
          of your mouth—

                    NOLAN
               (shouting back)
          If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.

                    BIG MAC
          And what in blazes have the nuns got
          to do with it?

                    NOLAN
               (lowers his voice and confides in the hatch gang)
          When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in
          Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't
          be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you
          got something to say—
               (Now he shouts up at Big Mac.)
          —Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud
          don't blame me— it's the fault of the nuns!

Pop laughs, at Big Mac's expense. The laughter is infectious and sweeps 
the hatch. Moose lets go with his loud "haw haw." Everyone laughs 
except Terry, who watches in a cold sweat.

                    BIG MAC
               (furiously, from above)
          Come on, knock it off!

The men laugh even louder.

                    MOOSE
          Haw haw— that's a good one, Kayo.

                    BIG MAC
               (able to shout above their laughter)
          Knock it off! Stand clear.
               (to Specs, the winchman, above the hatch)
          All right, take it away.

Big Mac looks at Specs, touches his cap in a signaling gesture and 
nods.

CLOSE—ON SPECS AT WINCH ABOVE HATCH

He catches the signal. From below the laughter of the men can be heard 
O.S.

CLOSE—ON CARGO SLING

Full of whiskey cases, from angle of Kayo Nolan, Pop, Terry, and 
others, watching it rise out of the hatch. The general laughter 
continues. Terry is stiff with fear.

CLOSE SHOT—SPECS

Suddenly he appears to lose control of the winch, guiding the up-and-
down fall.

CLOSE—ON NOLAN

Standing in the middle of the hatch, looking up, as the cargo net 
begins to plunge downward. The general laughter stops. From farther 
back in the hold Terry cries:

                    TERRY
               (horrified)
          Nolan...!

And tries to pull him back out of danger. Too late. The overloaded 
cargo net crashes down on Nolan. Wood splinters—glass shatters—and 
whiskey sprays. Kayo Nolan is pinned under the broken pile of cases.

                    TOMMY
               (shouting up)
          Get a doctor.

                    POP
               (hard, flat tone)
          A doctor— he needs a priest

QUICK DISSOLVE

INT—HATCH—DAY

CLOSE—ON FATHER BARRY

He stands over the body of Kayo Nolan, which lies on the pallet and has 
been covered by a tarpaulin.

GROUP SHOT—HATCH

Pop, Moose, Luke and the others stand near him. On the deck around the 
hold some seventy-five longshoremen have gathered, including Big Mac. 
Others look down from the dock and the loft. Terry is in the same 
position we left him.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (aroused)
          I came down here to keep a promise.
          I gave Kayo my word that if he stood up to the
          mob I'd stand up with him all the way. Now
          Kayo Nolan is dead. He was one of those fellows
          who had the gift of getting up. But this time they fixed
          him good— unless it was an accident like Big Mac says.

Pop, Moose, and some of the others glare at Big Mac, who chews his 
tobacco sullenly. Some of the others snicker "accident." 

                    FATHER BARRY
          Some people think the Crucifixion
          only took place on Calvary. They better wise
          up. Taking Joey Doyle's life to stop him from
          testifying is a crucifixion— Dropping a sling on Kayo
          Nolan because he was ready to spill his guts
          tomorrow— that's a crucifixion. Every time the
          mob puts the crusher on a good man— tries to
          stop him from doing his duty as a citizen— it's a
          crucifixion.

CLOSE—ON TERRY

Voice of Father Barry continues.

                    FATHER BARRY
          And anybody who sits around and lets it happen,
          keeps silent about something he knows has happened—
          shares the guilt of it just as much as the Roman soldier
          who pierced the flesh of Our Lord to see if He was dead.

SHOT OF EDIE—ON DOCK

Listening, moved. Terry has come up behind her and stands nearby. She 
notices
him but barely reacts. He listens intently to the Father's words.

(NOTE: I am not indicating in detail the other necessary reactions—
those of Pop, Moose, the Negro Luke, the watchful hostility of Sonny 
and Truck, the murderous arrogance of Johnny Friendly, and the 
sophisticated cynicism of Charley Malloy.
But most important of all is the impression being made on Terry.)

CLOSE—ON TRUCK

                    TRUCK
          Go back to your church, Father.

INT—HATCH—DAY

                    FATHER BARRY
               (looking up at Truck and pointing to the ship)
          Boys, this is my church. If you don't think
          Christ is here on the waterfront, you got another
          guess coming. And who do you think He lines up
          with—

CLOSE—ON SONNY

                    SONNY
          Get off the dock, Father.

Sonny reaches for a box of rotten bananas on the dock and flings one 
down into the hatch.

CLOSE—ON FATHER BARRY

The banana splatters him, but he ignores it.

BACK TO SONNY—ON DOCK

Terry turns to him. Edie notices this and watches with approval.

                    TERRY
          Do that again and I'll flatten you.

                    SONNY
          What're you doing. Joining them—

                    TERRY
          Let him finish.

                    SONNY
          Johnny ain't going to like that, Terry.

                    TERRY
          Let him finish.

Edie looks at him amazed. Terry catches her eye, and then looks down, 
embarrassed at his good deed. They both turn to watch Father Barry.

CLOSE SHOT—CHARLEY

Near Johnny, watching Terry and then looking at Johnny apprehensively.

INT—HATCH—DAY

                    FATHER BARRY
          Every morning when the hiring boss blows his
          whistle, Jesus stands alongside you in the shape-up.

More missiles fly, some hitting the Father, but he continues:

                    FATHER BARRY
          He sees why some of you get picked and some
          of you get passed over. He sees the family men
          worrying about getting their rent and getting food
          in the house for the wife and kids. He sees them
          selling their souls to the mob for a day's pay.

CLOSE—ON JOHNNY FRIENDLY

Nodding to Barney. Barney picks up an empty beer can and hurls it down 
into the hatch.

INT—HATCH—DAY

It strikes Father Barry and blood etches his forehead. Pop jumps 
forward and shakes his fist.

                    POP
          By Christ, the next bum who throws something
          deals with me. I don't care if he's twice my
          size.

Some of the other longshoremen grumble approval.

                    FATHER BARRY
          What does Christ think of the easy-money boys
          who do none of the work and take all of the gravy?
          What does He think of these fellows wearing
          hundred-and-fifty-dollar suits and diamond rings—
          on your union dues and your kickback money?
          How does He feel about bloodsuckers picking
          up a longshoreman's work tab and grabbing
          twenty percent interest at the end of a week?

CLOSE—ON J.P.

                    J.P.
          Never mind about that!

CLOSE—OF SONNY—ON DOCK

Scowling.  Terry, nearby, is increasingly moved by the Father's 
challenge.

                    FATHER BARRY
          How does He, who spoke up without fear
          against evil, feel about your silence?

                    SONNY
          Shut up about that!

He reaches for another rotten banana and is poised to throw it. Almost 
simultaneously, Terry throws a short hard right that flattens Sonny 
neatly. Edie is watching, a deeply felt gratitude in her eyes.

CLOSE—ON JOHNNY FRIENDLY AND TRUCK

A little way off .

                    TRUCK
          You see that?

Johnny presses his lips together but makes
no sign.

CLOSE—ON TERRY AND EDIE

She moves closer to him. He barely glances at her, then continues 
listening to Father Barry.

INT—HATCH—DAY

                    FATHER BARRY
          You want to know what's wrong
          with our waterfront? It's love of a lousy buck. It's
          making love of a buck— the cushy job— more
          important than the love of man. It's forgetting
          that every fellow down here is your brother in
          Christ.

CLOSE—ON POP—MOOSE—LUKE—TERRY AND EDIE

As Father Barry's voice rises to a climax—

                    FATHER BARRY
          But remember, fellows, Christ is always with you—
          Christ is in the shape-up, He's in the hatch—
          He's in the union hall— He's kneeling
          here beside NolanÑand He's saying with all
          of you—

CLOSE—ON FATHER BARRY

                    FATHER BARRY
          If you do it to the least of mine,
          you do it to me! What they did to Joey, what they
          did to Nolan, they're doing to you. And you. And
          YOU. And only you, with God's help, have the
          power to knock 'em off for good!
               (turns to Nolan's corpse)
          Okay, Kayo?
               (then looks up and says, harshly)
          Amen.

He makes the sign of the cross. Pop, Moose, Tommy, Luke, and the others 
do likewise.  Big Mac and Specs, seeing the others, reluctantly follow 
suit. Then, disgruntled, Big Mac climbs up out of the hatch and 
bellows:

                    BIG MAC
          All right, fellows— break it up! Let's go!

Strongly moved, the longshoremen glare at Big Mac and then silently 
start back to their places on the deck, in the hatches, on the dock, 
etc.

MOVING SHOT

The pallet rises out of the hatch with the body on it. Pop sits 
casually on the edge with Father Barry who, in pantomime, is cadging a 
cigarette.

CLOSE—ON EDIE AND TERRY

Edie crosses herself. Then she looks at Terry. They look at each other 
and the feeling
in both of them is some terrible hunger beyond their control. For a 
moment it seems as if Terry must go to her, but instead he turns away, 
slowly, as if this were the most diffi cult thing he was ever asked to 
do. Edie looks after him and we feel that she will yield to impulse and 
call out to him.  But she looks down instead, finally, and closes her 
eyes, imperceptibly trembling against desire.  Luke comes up to her, 
but she is lost in her own most private thoughts and does not
see him. He carries Joey's jacket, the one Nolan has been wearing.

                    LUKE
          Edie... .
               (nudges her)
          Edie—

                    EDIE
               (startled)
          Oh— Luke.

                    LUKE
               (quietly)
          Joey's jacket. I thought maybe
          Kayo'd like you to have it back.

Edie looks at him, and takes it silently. She hugs it to her, whispers, 
"Thank you," and, in a kind of sleepwalking, starts toward the entrance 
of the pier. Luke watches her anxiously.

                    LUKE
          Sure you're okay?

She nods and continues on alone.

QUICK DISSOLVE

EXT—ROOFTOP—NIGHT

At the pigeon coop near Terry's rooftop window. Under the window is the 
mattress he uses as outdoor sleeping quarters on hot summer nights. 
Terry is staring in at the pigeons, full of his own troubled, 
bestirring thoughts. Edie comes up behind him almost silently, carrying 
the jacket.

                    TERRY
               (turning)
          Edie!

                    EDIE
               (holding the coat out to him)
          I— I brought this for you, Terry.
          It was Joey's.
               (her conscious self trying to conceal
3t4the real meaning)
Yours is coming out at the elbows.

                    TERRY
               (close to her— and not really caring what he is 
saying)
          I don't rate it.

                    EDIE
          Go ahead, wear it.

From the pigeon coop comes the soft sound of pigeons cooing as if 
upset.

                    EDIE
               (under her breath)
          Pigeons... .

                    TERRY
          There's a hawk around. They're scared
          tonight.

She looks up and huddles a little closer to him. Now he reaches out for 
her—groping with an unfamiliar inexorable emotion.

                    TERRY
          Edie— I— I— never said this to a girl
          before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it
          for, but you— you're... .

                    EDIE
               (whispering and suddenly wiser than he)
          I know... I know... .

He kisses her at last, with pent-up violence and hunger. The sound of a 
deep-throated ship's whistle rolls across the river but they do not 
hear it. There is a tremendous sense of release and relief as their 
mouths and bodies press together.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT—CONFESSION BOOTH—DAY

Terry waits in anguish for the shutter of the confessional to open. 
When it does, Father Barry is glimpsed from within.

                    TERRY
               (blurting it out)
          Father, help me, I've got blood on my hands.

Father Barry looks at him.

                    TERRY
          Bless me, Father, for I have—

To Terry's amazement the shutter closes abruptly.

INT—CHURCH—OUTSIDE CONFESSION BOOTH—DAY

As Father Barry steps out of the booth, Terry hurries from his side of 
the booth and clasps Father Barry's arms violently. Father Barry keeps 
on walking and Terry follows him.

                    TERRY
          What's the matter? I've got something
          That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.

                    FATHER BARRY
          Someone else c'n take your confession.

                    TERRY
               (following him)
          But you're the one I want to tell—
          what you said over Nolan— about keepin'
          silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you
          hear me? I'm guilty... .

                    FATHER BARRY
               (trying to move on)
          I don't want to hear it in there.

                    TERRY
          I don't get it!

                    FATHER BARRY
               (rapidly)
          Tell it to me in there and
          my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can
          use it where it'll do the most good.

                    TERRY
          But you've got to listen to me.

                    FATHER BARRY
          I'll find you a priest.

Father Barry starts off again. Terry follows him desperately, under a 
terrible compulsion to bare himself to Father Barry. He grabs the 
Father by the arm fiercely, half spinning him around.

                    TERRY
               (with relief, as he gets it out)
          Listen, it was me who set Joey Doyle up for the muggers.

Father Barry stops and stares at him, realizing Terry is ready at last.

                    FATHER BARRY
          Come take a walk with me, kid,
          and give it to me straight. There's nothing I
          haven't heard.

They turn toward the exit of the church.

EXT—LONG SHOT—CHURCH

They enter the park, on rise overlooking the docks, Terry talking to 
him eagerly.

CLOSE SHOT—TERRY AND FATHER BARRY

                    TERRY
               (pouring it out)
          —It started as a favor— for
          my brother— you know they'd ask me things and
          it's hard to say no— a favor— Who am I kiddin'?
          They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this
          time the favor turned out to be helping them
          knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a
          little but— Last night with Edie I wanted to tell
          her only it— stuck in my throat. I guess I was
          scared of drivin' her away— and I love her, Father.
          She's the first thing I ever loved.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (almost brusquely)
          What are you going to do?

                    TERRY
          About Edie?

                    FATHER BARRY
          Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena.
          I know you got a subpoena.

                    TERRY
          It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (agreeing)
          A question of who rides who.

                    TERRY
          If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.

                    FATHER BARRY
          How much is your soul worth if you don't?

                    TERRY
          But it's my own brother they're askin' me
          to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and
          my mother was first cousins. When I was this
          high he took me to the ball games... .

                    FATHER BARRY
               (violently)
          Ball games! Don't break my heart!
          I wouldn't care if he gave you a life
          pass to the Polo Grounds. So you
          got a brother. Well, let me tell you something
          you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the 
short
          end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on
          his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—
               (He catches himself and drops his voice.)
           — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, 
          Terry. It's your own conscience that's got 
          to do the asking.

                    TERRY
          Conscience... .
               (shakes his head ruefully)
          I didn't even know I had one until I met you and
          Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (sharply)
          Good luck.

                    TERRY
               (waiting for someone to do it for him)
          Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?

Father Barry looks off .

Edie coming toward them in the distance.

MEDIUM CLOSE—FATHER BARRY AND TERRY

                    FATHER BARRY
          It's up to you. Just one more thing. You better tell Edie.

Terry turns in Edie's direction, reluctantly. He goes off toward her. 
Father Barry stands looking after him.

CLOSER SHOT—EDIE AND TERRY—AT BURNED PIERS—DAY

                    TERRY
          Edie... Edie... ..

                    EDIE
               (turning to him)
          Terry, what's wrong?

                    TERRY
          I've been sittin' in the church.

                    EDIE
          You?

                    TERRY
               (almost inarticulate)
          Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me—
          he says it's up to me.

                    EDIE
          Who says?

                    TERRY
          The Father. The Father.

He is trembling.

                    EDIE
          Terry— what's happening to you?

                    TERRY
          I just told the Father.

                    EDIE
          Told him what?

                    TERRY
          What I did to Joey.

                    EDIE
               (whispered)
          You... .

                    TERRY
               (louder)
          What I did to Joey.

                    EDIE
          Don't tell me— don't tell me!

                    TERRY
               (plunging in)
          Edie— it's—

What he starts to say is drowned out by an immense, prolonged blast of 
the whistle from the departing ocean liner. Terry shouts his story out 
to Edie compulsively but we cannot hear it over the rasping sound of 
the whistle. Edie is horrified as she catches enough words to realize 
what Terry is trying to say. The whistle pauses a moment, giving us 
just enough to hear Terry shout—

                    TERRY
          Didn't know—

Then the blast of the boat whistle drowns him out again. When it 
finally stops, Terry is finishing—

                    TERRY
          —but don't you see, Edie, I never thought they'd—
               (then hysterically as he feels her turning away from 
him)
          I don't know what to do, Edie, I don't know
          what to do! I swear to God I—

She looks at him, turns and strides off .

                    TERRY
               (calling, desperately)
          Edie... Edie... What'll I do, Edie, what'll I do?

She doesn't look back. Terry watches her go, with mounting anguish; 
then he lurches on in drunken confusion.

QUICK DISSOLVE

EXT—ROOFTOP—DAY

As Terry, still dazed, enters onto the roof, Jimmy Conners, in his 
Golden Warrior blazer,
is exercising the pigeons. He sees Terry and runs up to him. Jimmy 
talks in a whisper.

                    JIMMY
          Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker
          from the Commission... .

                    TERRY
          Looking for me?

                    JIMMY
          He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around
          here after what you told him.

                    TERRY
               (grabs Jimmy)
          Jimmy, suppose I knew something,
          say a mug somebody put on somebody... .
               (violent gesture illustrates what he means)
          You think I should turn him in?

                    JIMMY
          A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!

                    TERRY
          Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't
          think I should turn him in... .

                    JIMMY
               (gives him a look)
          You was a Golden Warrior.

                    TERRY
          Yeah— us Golden Warriors.
               (grabs Jimmy)
          You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We
          stick together, huh, kid?

                    JIMMY
          You was our first Supreme Commander,
          Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're
          out.

                    TERRY
          But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying
          to who?

ROOFTOP—ANOTHER ANGLE

Terry walks over to where Glover is sitting, rubbing his feet.

                    TERRY
          You looking for me?

                    GLOVER
          Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down
          and rest my dogs a minute.
               (smiles and rubs his ankle)
          You know the next investigation we get into I hope
          it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one
          has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when
          we hit the top ßoor the folks are usually out.

Jimmy gestures behind him as if to say "Get a load of this square."

                    TERRY
               (distractedly)
          I guess it's pretty tough work at that.

                    GLOVER
               (casually)
          Well, it'll be worth it if we can
          tell the waterfront story the way the people have
          a right to hear it. Don't you think?

Terry shrugs. Glover studies him.

                    GLOVER
          Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night
          three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?

                    TERRY
               (still preoccupied)
          Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.

                    GLOVER
          I thought you were going to take him that night but...

                    TERRY
               (this is the key that unlocks him)
          You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—

                    GLOVER
          I think you could have.

                    TERRY
          If I licked him I would have had the title
          shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.

                    GLOVER
          You sure looked it. Something go wrong?

Terry has been growing more and more animated but now he becomes 
sullen.

                    TERRY
          Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother
          had other ideas.

                    GLOVER
          Such as what?

                    TERRY
               (suspiciously)
          Listen, this ain't for publication.

                    GLOVER
               (amused)
          I'm just resting my feet.

                    TERRY
          Remember the first round how I had him
          against the ropes, and—

                    GLOVER
          I'll never forget it. I thought it was all
          over.

                    TERRY
          Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out
          for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—
               (sighs)
          Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you
          about them guys—
               (then catches himself and pauses)

                    GLOVER
               (expectantly)
          Yeah?

Terry is silent.

                    GLOVER
               (rises)
          Well, I better get going. Hit those
          stairs again.
               (turns casually)
          Was that a looping right or an uppercut the
          first time you caught him?

                    TERRY
               (insulted)
          Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly
          a short puncher— hooks— over 'n under—
               (pantomimes, with violent short breath-releases)
          — whop-whop!

                    GLOVER
          Really?

                    TERRY
          Yeah, really!

As Glover reaches the door, Terry keeps following him.

                    TERRY
          Where you going? I'll walk along with you.

                    GLOVER
               (grins warmly)
          Sure... .

Terry follows Glover out, continuing to pantomime punches. Jimmy looks 
after them and frowns.

INT—FRIENDLY BAR—NIGHT

Back room. It is set up as an informal kangaroo court . Jocko is 
pointing at Charley Malloy, who is
on the hot seat. Johnny Friendly is the judge, flanked by Big Mac, 
Truck, Sonny, Barney, Specs, J.P. Morgan and others. 

                    J.P.
          I didn't hear them, boss, but I sure seen them,
          walking along and smiling like a pair of lovers.

Charley looks uncomfortable. He hasn't finished his drink.

                    JOHNNY
               (watching him carefully)
          Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.

                    CHARLEY
               (disturbed)
          I'm not thirsty.

                    JOHNNY
               (drinking)
          After what we been hearing about your brother,
          I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.

                    CHARLEY
          So they're walking along and smiling.
          That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no
          evidence until he gives public testimony.

                    JOHNNY
          Thanks for the legal advice, Charley.
          That's what we always kept you around for.
               (smiles wisely)
          Now how do we keep him from giving this
          testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it—
          main order of business?

                    CHARLEY
               (nervously)
          He was always a good kid. You know that.

                    BIG MAC
          He'sa bum. After all the days I give
          him in the loft— he got no gratitude.

                    JOHNNY
               (offended)
          Please, Mac, I'm conducting this—
               (nodding to Charley)
          —investigation.

                    CHARLEY
          This girl and the Father got their hooks
          in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up
          anymore.

                    JOHNNY
          I ain't interested in his mental condition.
          All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a
          canary?

                    CHARLEY
          I wish I knew.

                    JOHNNY
          So do I, Charley. For your sake.

                    CHARLEY
          What do you want me to do, Johnny?

                    JOHNNY
          Very simple. Just bring him to... that
          place we been using. Mac, you take care of the
          details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need
          him.

                    CHARLEY
          Gerry G!! You don't want to do that,
          Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a
          confused kid.

                    JOHNNY
          Confused kid? First he crosses me in
          public and gets away with it and then the next
          joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow
          down here.

                    CHARLEY
               (horrified)
          Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.

                    JOHNNY
               (coldly)
          Then don't.

                    CHARLEY
          But my own kid bro—

                    JOHNNY
               (cutting in)
          This is for you to figure out. You can have it your
          way or you can have it his way.
               (gestures with his palms up and his palms down)
          But you can't have it both ways.
               (turns to Sonny)
          Am I right, Sonny?

                    SONNY
          Definitely!

                    JOHNNY
               (thumbing Charley to his feet)
          Okay, on your horse, you deep thinker.

Charley rises reluctantly, his confident, springy manner now gone.

INT—TAXICAB—EVENING—(N.Y.B.G.)

Charley and Terry have just entered the cab.

          Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped
          by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they
          say about blood, it's—

          Where to?

          Four thirty-seven River Street.

                    TERRY
          River Street? I thought we was going to
          the Garden.

                    CHARLEY
          I've got to cover a bet there on the way
          over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.

                    TERRY
               (good-naturedly)
          Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.

                    CHARLEY
          The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.

                    TERRY

          That's right... .

          Of course, the boys know you too well to mark
          you down for a cheese-eater.

                    TERRY
          Mm—hmm.

                    CHARLEY
          You know, the boys are getting rather
          interested in your future.

                    TERRY
          Mm—hmmm.

                    CHARLEY
          They feel you've been sort of left out of
          things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few
          little things going for you on the docks.

                    TERRY
          A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's
          all I wanted.

                    CHARLEY
          Sure, that's all right when you're a kid,
          but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger.
          It's time you got some ambition.

                    TERRY
          I always figured I'd live longer without it.

                    CHARLEY
          Maybe.

Terry looks at him.

                    CHARLEY
          There's a slot for a boss loader on the
          new pier we're opening up.

                    TERRY
               (interested)
          Boss loader!

                    CHARLEY
          Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything
          that moves in and out. And you don't have
          to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week
          just for openers.

                    TERRY
          And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?

                    CHARLEY
          Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you
          say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?

                    TERRY
               (struggling with an unfamiliar problem of conscience
               and loyalties)
          Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's
          a lot more to this whole thing than I thought,
          Charley.

                    CHARLEY
          You don't mean you're thinking of testifying
          against—
               (turns a thumb in toward himself)

                    TERRY
          I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I
          ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted
          to talk to you about.

                    CHARLEY
               (patiently, as to a stubborn child)
          Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through
          the locals— you know what they're worth to us?

                    TERRY
          I know. I know.

                    CHARLEY
          Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny
          isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one
          rubber-lipped—

                    TERRY
               (simultaneous)
          Don't say that!

                    CHARLEY
               (continuing)
          —ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?

                    TERRY
          Don't say that!

                    CHARLEY
          What the hell!!!

                    TERRY
          I could have been better!

                    CHARLEY
          The point is— there isn't much time, kid.

There is a painful pause, as they appraise each other.

                    TERRY
               (desperately)
          I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!

                    CHARLEY
          Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get
          to four thirty-seven River... .

                    TERRY
               (stunned)
          Four thirty-seven— that isn't where Gerry G...?

Charley nods solemnly. Terry grows more agitated.

                    TERRY
          Charley... you wouldn't take me to Gerry G... .?

Charley continues looking at him. He does not deny it. They stare at 
each other for a moment. Then suddenly Terry starts out of the cab. 
Charley pulls a pistol. Terry is motionless, now, looking 
at Charley.

                    CHARLEY
          Take the boss loading, kid. For God's
          sake. I don't want to hurt you.

                    TERRY
               (hushed, gently guiding the gun down toward
          Charley's lap)
          Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .

                    CHARLEY
               (genuinely)
          I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.

Terry eyes him, beaten. Charley leans back and looks at Terry 
strangely. Terry raises his hands above his head, somewhat in the 
manner of a prizefighter mitting the crowd. The image nicks Charley's 
memory.

                    TERRY
               (an accusing sigh)
          Wow... .

                    CHARLEY
               (gently)
          What do you weigh these days, slugger?

                    TERRY
               (shrugs)
          ...eight-seven, eighty-eight.
          What's it to you?

                    CHARLEY
               (nostalgically)
          Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five
          you were beautiful. You should've
          been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to
          manage you brought you along too fast.

                    TERRY
          It wasn't him!
               (years of abuse crying out in him)
          It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the
          night the two of youse come in the dressing
          room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're
          going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night.
          I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready—
          remember the early rounds throwing them combinations.
          So what happens— This bum Wilson
          he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark!
          – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and
          a one-way ticket to Palookaville.
               (more and more aroused as he relives it)
          It was you, Charley. You was
          my brother. You should of looked out for me.
          Instead of making me take them dives for the
          short-end money.

                    CHARLEY
               (defensively)
          I always had a bet down for
          you. You saw some money.

                    TERRY
               (agonized)
          See! You don't understand!

                    CHARLEY
          I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.

                    TERRY
          You don't understand! I could've been a
          contender. I could've had class and been somebody.
          Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it,
          which is what I am. It was you, Charley.

Charley takes a long, fond look at Terry.  Then he glances quickly out 
the window.

MEDIUM SHOT—WATERFRONT—NIGHT

From Charley's angle. A gloomy light reflects the street numbers—433—
435—

INT—CLOSE—CAB—ON CHARLEY AND TERRY — NIGHT

                    TERRY
          It was you, Charley... .

                    CHARLEY
               (turning back to Terry, his tone suddenly changed)
          Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in.
          Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead,
          blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God
          help you from here on in.

LONGER ANGLE—CAB—NIGHT

As Terry jumps out. A bus is just starting up a little further along 
the street. 

EXT—MEDIUM LONG SHOT—RIVER STREET—NIGHT

Running, Terry leaps onto the back of the moving bus.

INT—CAB—RIVER ST.—NIGHT

                    CHARLEY
               (to driver as he watches Terry go)
          Now take me to the Garden.

Charley sinks back in his seat, his hand covering his face. The driver 
turns around, gives him a withering look, steps on the gas, and guns 
the car into—

EXT—MEDIUM LONG SHOT—RIVER STREET—NIGHT

They have reached a garage, and now the car zooms through the entrance. 
We catch a glimpse of Truck, Sonny and Big Mac.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT—EXT—JOHNNY'S LIMOUSINE —NIGHT

Johnny is watching from across the street.

MEDIUM CLOSE—ON GARAGE DOOR—NIGHT

Big Mac and Sonny pull the big black sliding door shut until the screen 
itself is blacked out. Inside there is the roaring sound of a motor 
racing.

QUICK DISSOLVE

INT—EDIE'S BEDROOM—NIGHT

Edie is in bed. There is a pounding on the door.

                    EDIE
               (frightened)
          Who is it?

INT—HALLWAY OUTSIDE DOYLE DOOR—NIGHT

Terry, in a wild state after his escape, is pounding on the door.

                    TERRY
          Edie, it's me— let me in— it's me!

He pounds on the door even harder.

CLOSE—ON EDIE

The pounding continues.

                    EDIE
               (Fiercely)
          Stop it! Stop it! Get away from here!

                    VOICE OF TERRY
               (muffled)
          I've got to see you. Got to talk to you.

                    EDIE
          Leave me alone. I want you to leave me alone!

ANGLE ON DOOR

The pounding grows louder. Suddenly there is the sound of the door 
being broken open. Edie draws back against the head of her bed, pulling 
the covers around her. Terry runs in wild-eyed.

                    TERRY
          I had to, Edie. I had to see you.

                    EDIE
          Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.

                    TERRY
          You think I stink, don't you? You think I
          stink for what I told you?

                    EDIE
          I don't want to talk about it. I want you to
          go.

                    TERRY
               (grabbing her)
          Edie, listen to me! I want you
          to believe me. I want to be with you.

                    EDIE
               (wrenching herself free)
          How can you be with Charley and Johnny
          Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie.
          It's like there were two different people inside of you.
          You've got to be one or the other.

                    TERRY
               (in pain)
          I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...

                    EDIE
          It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it
          inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got
          to come out.

                    TERRY
          I know what you want me to do!

                    EDIE
          I don't want you to do anything. Let your
          conscience tell you what to do.

                    TERRY
               (pounding his fist on the bed)
          That—
               (pound! pound!)
          —word again! Why do you keep saying
          conscience, conscience... .

                    EDIE
          I never mentioned the word before.
          In his agony he grips a glass standing on
          the night table.

                    TERRY
          I keep hearing it and I don't know what to
          do..I don't know what to do... .

Without realizing what he is doing, he squeezes the glass in his 
powerful fist until it breaks. The glass cuts his hand. He draws back 
in pain.

                    TERRY
          My hand.

                    EDIE
          It's just a scratch. You won't die.
          She turns away from him.

                    TERRY
          Edie...

                    EDIE
          Get away from me.

                    TERRY
          Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you
          love me.

                    EDIE
          I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay
          away from me.

                    TERRY
               (groping for her)
          Edie, Edie, I...

His arms move around her. Her reaction is convulsive. Her hands move 
over him in anger and love.

                    EDIE
          Stay away from me
               (her face close to his)
          Stay away from me—
               (closer)
          Stay—

They kiss, lying across the bed, and the fever seizes them again.

                    EDIE
          —away from me!

Then, after some moments, they are distracted by—

                    VOICE FROM THE STREET
          Hey, Terry, come on down. I got something to show you, 
Terry.

Startled, they cling to each other. The voice calls again—

                    VOICE FROM THE STREET
          Hey, Terry, your brother's down here.

                    TERRY
               (more curious)
          Charley?

                    VOICE
          Charley's waitin' for ya. Come on down
          and see him.

                    EDIE
               (whispers)
          Don't go. Don't go.

                    TERRY
          But Charley— maybe Charley needs me. I
          better see what he wants.

He goes.

                    EDIE
               (calling after him)
          Terry...

She rises and calls toward the door—

Terry...

Then she runs to the window.

EXT—EDIE AT WINDOW—NIGHT

                    EDIE
               (calling)
          Terry... .

                    WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          You hear what I heard?

Edie looks up and to one side.

CLOSE—ON MRS. COLLINS

Looking out another window of the tenement.

                    MRS. COLLINS
          That's the same way they called Andy out
          the night I lost him.

CLOSE—ON EDIE—AT WINDOW

Horrified. Looking for Terry. She runs from the window.

CLOSE—ON FIRE ESCAPE—NIGHT

As Edie runs out onto it. She looks down wildly, searching for Terry. A 
ship's whistle makes a mournful sound. A great luxury liner is heading 
out to the harbor. Fog is drifting in over the roof. She peers down but 
can see nothing. She hears a wild shriek from the street and runs to 
the railing again. It is only a teenager whooping it up below. Then she 
hears shots—Bang—Bang—
Bang—and the sound of a police siren. She raises her hands to her head 
and cries.

                    EDIE
          Terry.

Then she hears the follow-up of the police siren. It is only a TV set 
near the open window of the floor below.

                    TV ANNOUNCER
          And now for your weekly dramatic
          thrill straight from the files of the City's
          Finest— Police Patrol... .
               ("Dragnet"-type music)

Edie turns away in exasperation. She calls down the fire escape into 
the fog.

                    EDIE
          Terry!

There is no answer. Mrs. Collins appears on the fire escape in her 
kimono. 

                    MRS. COLLINS
          Don't go down!

Mrs. Collins tries to restrain her but Edie wrenches away—

                    EDIE
          Terry!

She starts to run hysterically down the fire escape.

EXT—LANDING UNDER FIRE ESCAPE—NIGHT

As Edie is coming down the outside metal steps, Mutt is wandering along 
singing mournfully—

                    MUTT
          Tippi-tippi-tin, tippi-Tin... .

A window opens and an angry voice cries:

                    LOUD VOICE
          Drop dead!

An old shoe is hurled at Mutt, just as Edie turns toward him.

                    MUTT
               (to the angrywindow)
          Spit on me, curse me and stone me, but I suffer
          for your sins... .

                    LOUD VOICE
          Go suffer somewhere else, you bum.

The window bangs shut. Mutt sees Edie and turns his attention to her.

                    MUTT
          I seen it. I seen them put him to death! I
          heard him cry out.

                    EDIE
               (impatiently— almost hysterically)
          Who. Who did you see?

                    MUTT
          His executioners. They was stabbing him
          in his side. And his soft eyes was looking down at
          them.

                    EDIE
               (desperately) Tell me who.

                    MUTT
               (lifting his head from his hands)
          Our Lord Jesus. When He died to save us...

He gropes toward her as if to paw her.

                    EDIE
               (with loathing)
          Oh get away— get away!

She runs on. Mutt goes staggering off in the opposite direction, 
singing his song. Edie runs on until she sees Terry in the mist.

                    EDIE
          Terry!

She runs into his arms.

                    EDIE
               (continued)
          Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.

                    TERRY
          I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley
          was waiting for me.
               (calls)
          Charley?

There is no answer. Terry frowns. Edie points through the darkness.

SAME VOICE IN FOG
Wanna see Charley? He's over here.

                    TERRY
               (as they hurry forward)
          Hey, Charley... .

EXT—MEDIUM CLOSE—WHITE WALL—NIGHT

The headlights of a car suddenly illuminate Charley against the wall. 
Charley is leaning against the lamp post, in a very casual attitude, 
looking as dapper as usual. Terry and Edie run to him. The car drives 
off .

                    TERRY
          Looking for me, Charley?

Charley seems to study them silently. Terry nudges him.

                    TERRY
          Hey Charley.

Charley slides down the wall and crumples to the ground. Dead. Edie 
screams. Terry drops beside the body.

                    TERRY
          He's dead. He's dead. Those scummy,
          good-for-nuthin' butchers!.

The lights of an approaching car catch them in its beam. Terry reacts 
quickly, cowering against the wall and pulling Edie down behind him 
protectively.

                    TERRY
          Behind me. Behind me. It may be them
          coming back!

They huddle in fear as the car comes closer; then it turns and the 
lights are no longer on them. Terry lets out a soft whistle of relief 
as the car drives off. Edie is completely panicked now.

                    EDIE
               (in a horrified whisper)
          Terry, let's go away.

Terry takes Charley's arm, which is twisted behind him, and straightens 
it tenderly.

                    TERRY
          Charley.

                    EDIE
               (hysterically)
          I mean it, let's get away from
          here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley—
          and any minute... .
               (stares at him, almost saying "you")
          ...I'm frightened— I'm frightened.

Terry seems not to hear. There are tears in his eyes but fury in his 
voice as he mutters to himself.

                    TERRY
          I'll take it out of their skulls.

                    EDIE
          I don't want to see you killed. I want to live
          with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk
          the streets without... .

                    TERRY
               (in a terrible mutter to himself)
          I'll take it out of their skulls.

He rises, in a dangerous, animal rage.

                    EDIE
          Terry, no, no... .

                    TERRY
          Don't hang on to me. And don't follow
          me. Don't follow me.
               (turns)
          Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My 
brother.
          There's something I got to do.

He looks around, takes note of and strides toward—

MEDIUM SHOT—PAWN SHOP—NIGHT

A little way down the block. An iron grille protects the windows. Terry 
goes up to the grille and looks in. Edie follows him anxiously.

CLOSE SHOT—PAWN SHOP WINDOW—THROUGH GRILLE—NIGHT

There are watches, rings, fishing rods, guitars, cameras, musical 
instruments, suits, furs, bowler hats, and—about two feet back from the 
window—a .45 revolver in a holster and a belt of cartridges.

                    TERRY
               (muttering)
          They put a hole in Charley. I'll
          put holes in them.

Edie sees what Terry is after and tries to restrain him.

                    EDIE
          Terry, go home. There's nothing you can do
          now. It's locked up.

Terry looks at her unseeingly, then drives the toe of his shoe through 
the diamond shaped opening in the grille, and through the glass behind 
it.

INT—PAWN SHOP WINDOW—NIGHT

Shooting toward Terry, the coveted revolver in the F.G. Terry's fingers 
cannot quite reach it. He has to press his shoulder painfully against 
the jagged glass in order to inch closer to it. He contorts his face in 
pain as the glass cuts through his jacket into his flesh. Blood begins 
to dampen his shoulder but with a final effort he gets his fingers 
around the gun.

EXT—PAWN SHOP—NIGHT

As Terry draws the gun from the window and slips it into his pocket, 
Edie sees the blood dripping from the rip in his jacket.

                    EDIE
          Terry, you're bleeding.

                    TERRY
               (in a flat tone)
          Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.

                    EDIE
          Terry, for God's sake.

                    TERRY
          Get out of my way.

                    EDIE
          No, I can't let you. I can't, you're—

She clings to him sobbing.

                    TERRY
               (violently)
          I don't want to hurt you, but... out of my way!

He flings her from him and goes on loading the gun, as she sobbingly 
watches him go off .

INT—FRIENDLY BAR—NIGHT

As Terry enters. The usual crowd are present: Barney, Specs, Sonny, 
Truck, J.P., etc. There is a comedian on TV and everyone is laughing 
but the laughter dies at the sight of Terry. He goes up to the bar 
tensely. Everyone watches in silence. There is a suggestion of men 
feeling for their guns but nobody moves.

                    TERRY
               (to bartender)
          Is Johnny in?

                    JOCKO
          No.

                    TERRY
               (suspiciously)
          No?

To see for himself, Terry strides through to the back room and throws 
open the door. The back room is empty. Then he takes a seat at the bar 
so he can watch the room and the entrance. The customers eye him 
carefully.

                    TERRY
               (to Jocko)
          Give me a double.

                    JOCKO
          Take it easy now, Terry.

                    TERRY
          Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.

Jocko sets the drink up. He notices the jagged tear in Terry's jacket 
and the spreading stain of blood from the shoulder.

                    JOCKO
          What's wrong with your shoulder?

                    TERRY
               (draining his glass)
          Hit me again.

                    JOCKO
               (in an undertone)
          Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny... .

Terry pushes his empty pony glass forward for another one.

                    TERRY
               (sharply)
          No advice. Just whiskey.

                    JOCKO
               (pouring it)
          Easy. Easy, boy.

ANOTHER ANGLE—TOWARD ENTRANCE

Footsteps are heard outside the swinging doors. Terry turns to face the 
entrance, his hand going to the gun in his pocket. Sonny, Truck, 
Barney, and others all watch him, ready for the draw. Jocko 
automatically crosses himself and turns off the TV, which is now only 
an irritant. The swinging doors open, but it's not Johnny. Just a 
couple of happy waterf ront barfl ies. But the moment they enter their 
grins vanish as they are made to feel the tension. They look at Terry,
then they look at the goons watching Terry. 

                    JOCKO
               (to the newcomers)
          What'll you have?

                    NEWCOMER
          Thanks just the same.

The two men bolt out the doorway. In the silence we hear the creaking 
of the ancient swinging doors. The silence is oppressive. Terry works 
his hand over his bleeding shoulder.

                    JOCKO
          You ought to go home and take care of that—

                    TERRY
               (watching the doorway, growls)
          First things first.

Once more steps are heard on the sidewalk outside the bar. Once more 
everyone is on edge for the showdown between Terry and Johnny. All 
eyes are on the swinging doors.

MEDIUM CLOSE—SWINGING DOORS—NIGHT

Father Barry enters, followed by Moose, Tommy, Luke. CAMERA goes with 
Father Barry as he walks right up to Terry.

                    FATHER BARRY
          I want to see you, Terry.

                    TERRY
          You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.

                    FATHER BARRY
          Now don't give me a hard time.

                    TERRY
          What do you want from me, Father.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (putting out his hand)
          Your gun.

                    TERRY
          Mind your own business, Father.

                    FATHER BARRY
          This is my business.

                    TERRY
          Why don't you go and chase yourself?

                    FATHER BARRY
               (slowly) Give me that gun.

                    TERRY
          You go to hell.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (advancing)
          What did you say?

                    TERRY
               (just a trifle disconcerted)
          You go to—

Father Barry throws a good right hand punch that catches Terry by 
surprise and knocks him down. Terry rises, feeling his shoulder, which 
is oozing blood now and weakening him. He  charges Father Barry like a 
tormented animal.

                    TERRY
          Why you... .

Moose and Luke grab him, although Father Barry waits calmly.

                    TOMMY
               (to Terry)
          Get wise to yourself, you bum.

The word hits him. Terry drops his hands slowly, weaving as if weak 
from loss of blood.

                    TERRY
               (chastened)
          Take your hands off me. What you call me?

                    FATHER BARRY
               (to Terry)
          A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave?
          Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum
          who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that
          brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You
          want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a
          dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't
          fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle.
          That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the
          head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow
          in the courtroom— with the truth as you know
          it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the
          truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —
               (reaches into Terry's pocket and removes the gun as 
he talks)
          —cap pistol.

The two men look at each other. Father Barry's words cut him.

                    FATHER BARRY
          That is, if you've got the guts. If you haven't, you
          better hang on to this.

Father Barry offers the gun back to Terry contemptuously. Terry takes 
the gun, and holds it self-consciously.

                    FATHER BARRY
          You want a beer?
               (to Jocko)
          Two beers.

Jocko sets them up and Father Barry and Terry drink them off, looking 
at each other. The drink seems to refresh Terry. He turns around to 
Jocko and slams the gun down on the bar.

Behind the bar is a large picture, in the place of honor, showing 
Johnny Friendly arm-in-arm with "Mr. Upstairs," beaming with self-
confidence.

                    TERRY
          Father, there is one thing I'd like to do.

So saying, he takes his revolver and hurls it into the face of the 
picture.

                    TERRY
               (feeling better)
          Tell Johnny I was here.

Terry looks around defiantly at the tense gunmen—and starts out with 
Father Barry and the group.

MEDIUM CLOSE—JOCKO—BEHIND BAR

Watching Terry leave. Breathing a sigh of relief as he picks up the 
gun.

                    JOCKO
               (inadvertently)
          ... nice boy... .

Then he catches the dark looks of Sonny, Truck, Barney, etc., and 
busies himself at the bar.

INT—TRAVELING SHOT—COURTROOM—DAY

A court room door opens. It is the door out of which the witnesses are 
brought to testify for hearings of the Waterf ront Crime Commission. A 
counsel is just finishing questioning Big Mac...We don't photograph 
this. 
We show Terry walking slowly towards his seat. Edie and Father Barry 
are in the audience. Also Johnny and some of the mob. We hear the 
dialogue (O.S.)

                    COUNSEL (O.S.)
          You mean to sit there and tell
          me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand,
          five hundred dollars every year and keeps no
          financial records?

                    BIG MAC (O.S.)
          Sure we keep records!

                    COUNSEL (O.S.)
          Well, where are they?

                    BIG MAC
               (indignantly)
          We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.

CLOSER SHOT—COUNSEL AND BIG MAC

                    COUNSEL
          Doesn't it seem odd to you that five
          different waterfront locals were broken into last
          night and the only articles removed were financial
          records?

                    BIG MAC
               (steadfastly)
          What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.

                    COUNSEL
               (waving him aside)
          That's all. Next witness!

Big Mac steps down, mopping his brow. Terry steps up to the stand. They 
glare at each other as they pass. We CUT to Edie looking on anxiously 
from the spectators' section, to Father Barry, Pop, Moose, Tommy, and 
Luke sitting together leaning forward.

                    CLERK
          Name?

                    TERRY
          Terrence Francis Malloy.

                    CLERK
          Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
          truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

There is a momentary pause.

CLOSE SHOT—EDIE, FATHER BARRY

Sitting with Pop, Moose, Luke, and Tommy. Waiting for his answer.

CLOSE—ON TERRY

His hand raised for the oath. When he answers, it seems more than a 
mere judicial formality.

                    TERRY
               (firmly)
          Right... I do.

                    COUNSEL
               (rising)
          Mr. Malloy, is it true that on the
          night Joey Doyle was found...

CLOSE—ON LARGE TV SET IN AN ELEGANT STUDY

We see Terry testifying on the TV screen.

                    COUNSEL
          ...dead you were the last person to see him before he
          was pushed off the roof, and that you went immediately
          to the Friendly Bar where you expressed your feelings
          about the murder to Mr. Johnny Friendly?

                    TERRY
          That's right.

During the above a butler's hand sets a highball glass down beside a 
rich leather chair, and a strong, manicured hand wearing an expensive 
ring picks up the glass.

                    VOICE OF BUTLER
          Will there be anything else, sir?

                    VOICE OF "MR. UPSTAIRS"
               (an impressive, heavy voice)
          Yes, Sidney, if Mr. Friendly calls, I'm out, and
          you don't know when I'll be back.

                    VOICE OF BUTLER
          Very good, sir.

The CAMERA moves in on the TV screen, the court room image spins, and 
when it fi nally stops, we are back to—

INT—MEDIUM CLOSE—COURTROOM—ON TERRY — DAY

                    COUNSEL
          .. Thank you, Mr. Malloy, you've done
          more than to break the case of Joey Doyle, you
          have held up a lamp of truth in the dark cave of
          waterfront crime. You may step down now.

As Terry steps down, he is quickly surrounded by police bodyguards, who 
lead him toward the chamber behind the court-room. As he steps into the 
aisle Johnny Friendly leaps up from a long bench facing the aisle.

                    JOHNNY
               (struggling to get at Terry)
          You're a walkin' dead man! You're dead on this waterfront 
and
          every other waterfront from Boston to New
          Orleans. You won't go anywhere, drive a truck or
          a cab or push a baggage rack without one of my
          guys have the eye on you. You just dug your own
          grave, dead man, go fall in it!
               (spits in Terry's face)

Terry leaps at him instinctively. The gavel sounds repeatedly and there 
are cries of "Order! Order!"  Johnny wrestles with Terry, but they are 
roughly separated by court room guards
who lead Terry off toward the door to the private chambers. Edie leaves 
her seat and tries to get to Terry but is kept off by the guards.

                    GUARD
          Sorry, Miss, our orders is to keep everybody
          away.

They lead Terry off, as the voice of the clerk is saying—

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Next witness, Mr. Michael J. Skelly,
          also known as Johnny Friendly... .

They look at him coldly, and turn away. Terry goes on, unhappily, the 
police guards just behind him.

          Hey, Jimmy!

EXT—ROOFTOP—DAY

Jimmy Conners, near the pigeon coop. He looks up at Terry sullenly and 
doesn't answer.

INT—TERRY'S ROOM—DAY

Terry draws back in defeat.

                    TERRY
          Jimmy too.

                    JIMMY'S VOICE (O.S.)
          A pigeon for a pigeon... !

Through the open window is flung the body of a dead pigeon. It falls at 
Terry's feet. He looks down at it. Its neck has been wrung.

                    TERRY
               (brokenly)
          Swifty— my lead bird—

He looks out toward his coop—then climbs out the window and hurries 
toward it. We hold on Edie who watches him, worried, and then follows 
him.

EXT—ROOFTOP—DAY

Terry goes to his coop. On the floor are every one of his pigeons, 
perhaps three dozen, all with their necks wrung. Terry picks one up. 
Its head hangs limp.

                    TERRY
               (looks off)
          Jimmy...

                    EDIE
          He's going to have to grow up too.

                    TERRY
               (from deep inside him)
          My pigeons... .

                    EDIE
          Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll
          come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the
          door locked.

                    TERRY
               (not seeming to hear her)
          Every one of 'em... .

                    EDIE
          You heard what Johnny said. No part of the
          Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland—
          the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .

                    TERRY
               (mutters disgustedly)
          Farm...

He turns and starts back toward his room. She follows desperately.

                    EDIE
          Does it have to be the waterfront! Pop, he's
          an old man, it's all he knows, but you— you could
          do lots of things, get into something new, anything
          as long as it's away from Johnny Friendly!

INT—TERRY'S ROOM

Terry enters. Edie's voice follows him as she trails behind him. He 
sits on the bed and looks at the cargo hook hung on a peg on the wall.

                    EDIE
          Doesn't that make sense!

Terry doesn't answer. He takes the cargo hook from the wall and jabs it 
viciously into the floor.

                    EDIE
          I don't think you're even listening to me!

He pulls the cargo hook out and jabs it into the floor again.

                    EDIE
          ...are you?

He looks up at her, frowns and then studies the cargo hook, tapping it 
into his hand with pent-up feeling. The feeling is a strong and 
infectious one. Edie senses it and accuses him—

                    EDIE
          You're going down there!

He looks up at her again for a moment and then works his hand over the 
handle of the hook.

                    EDIE
               (her voice rising)
          Just because Johnny warned you not to, you're
          going down there, aren't you?

He doesn't say anything but the determination in him seems to be 
constantly mounting.

                    EDIE
          You think you've got to prove something to
          them, don't you? That you are not afraid of them
          and— you won't be satisfied until you walk right
          into their trap, will you?

His silence maddens her. She seems on the verge of striking him out of 
frustration and impotent rage. Her voice is hysterical—

                    EDIE
          Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the
          shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded,
          son of a—
               (struggles to control herself)
          What are you trying to prove?
          With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it 
through his 
          belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker 
from the 
          nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker 
on in a 
          deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he 
walks to the 
          door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.

                    TERRY
               (quietly)
          You always said I was a bum. Well—
               (points to himself)
          —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock.
          Don't worry, I'm not going to
          shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.
               (rubs the sleeve of the jacket)
          Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.

He goes.

QUICK DISSOLVE

EXT—PIER—SHAPE-UP—MORNING

Big Mac facing the semicircle of several hundred men. Into this circle 
walks Terry.
Other longshoremen instinctively move away from him as he approaches.

CLOSE—BIG MAC 

                    BIG MAC
          I need fifteen gangs today. Everybody works!

He picks men out very quickly and they move forward from the mass.

MEDIUM CLOSE—TERRY—PIER—DAY

He has taken his stand defiantly, with his hands in his pockets, 
looking Big Mac in the eyes. Big Mac picks men all around Terry.
He makes it obvious by reaching over Terry's shoulder to pick men
behind him.  Finally there are only a handful left around Terry, 
and then they are chosen.  Terry is left standing there along.

                    TERRY
               (brazenly)
          You're still a man short for that
          last hatch gang, Mac.

                    BIG MAC
               (without looking at Terry, calls to Sonny)
          Hey, Sonny, go across to the bar and pick up the first
          man you see.

Now Big Mac looks at Terry for the first time.

                    BIG MAC
          Where are them cops of yours, stoolie?
          You're gonna need 'em.

He turns away. Terry stands there seething. He looks around at Pop, and 
the others ready to enter the pier. They look away, still fearful of 
Big Mac and the power of the mob, and feeling guilty for their 
passivity.

INT—JOHNNY FRIENDLY'S OFFICE ON WHARF—DAY

Johnny looks across at the isolated figure of Terry. Sonny, Truck, and 
Specs are with Johnny.  On the desk are tabloids with headlines
reading NAME JOHHNY FRIENDLY AS WATERFRONT MURDER BOSS. Under the 
banner head is a large picture of Johnny.

                    TRUCK
          That ain't a bad picture of you, boss.

Johnny glares at him and pushes the paper aside angrily.

                    SONNY
          I wish you'd let us go to work on that
          cheese-eater.

                    JOHNNY
               (with both hands working)
          After we get off the front page. Then he's mine.
          I want him.

EXT—CLOSE—PIER ENTRANCE—ON TERRY AND BIG MAC—DAY

Sonny returns with "the first man he saw"—Mutt Murphy. Mutt and Terry 
glance at each other.

                    SONNY
          Here's your man, Mac.

                    MAC
          Okay.

Mac nods Mutt on into the pier, the one armed derelict turning back 
with an apologetic gesture. Terry's fury grows. Mac growls at him—

                    MAC
          You want more of the same? Come back tomorrow.

Terry looks at him, and then across at Johnny's office on the wharf. 
His hands begin to tremble.

He turns and starts walking slowly, resolutely, down the gangplank 
leading to Johnny's headquarters.

INT—JOHNNY FRIENDLY'S OFFICE 

                    SONNY
               (seeing Terry through window)
          He's comin' down!

                    JOHNNY
          He's gotta be crazy!

                    TRUCK
               (glancing out, growls)
          Yeah, here comes the
          bum now. I'll top 'im off lovely.

Behind Johnny's back the click of a revolver safety latch is heard. 
Johnny whirls on him quickly

                    JOHNNY
          Gimme that.

                    TRUCK
               (offended)
          How are we gonna protect ourselves?

                    JOHNNY
          Ever hear of the Sullivan Law? Carrying
          a gun without a permit? They'll be on us for anything
          now. The slightest infraction. Give.
               (turns to the other goons)
          All of you? Give— give— give—

Sonny, Truck and the others reluctantly give up their guns. Johnny 
turns to the safe and begins to open it.

                    JOHNNY
          We're a law-abidin' union. Understand?
               (As he puts the guns in the safe and slams the safe 
door.)
          A law-abidin' union!

EXT—UNION LOCAL OFFICE ON WHARF—DAY

Terry walks compulsively down the ramp to the office.

                    TERRY
               (shouts)
          Hey, Friendly! Johnny Friendly,
          come out here!

Johnny comes out of his office followed by his goons.

                    JOHNNY
               (shouts)
          You want to know the trouble with you?
          You think it makes you a big man if you
          can give the answers.

                    TERRY
          Listen, Johnny—

                    JOHNNY
          Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.

                    TERRY
          You want to know somethin'—?

                    JOHNNY
          I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch
          up with you. Be thinkin' about it.

As he starts to turn back into his office, Terry advances, steaming 
himself up.

                    TERRY
               (louder)
          You want to know something? Take
          the heater away and you're nothin'— take the
          good goods away, and the kickback and the
          shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—
               (indicating the others)
          —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—
               (takes a deep breath as if relieved)
          Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!

                    JOHNNY
               (with fury)
          Go on talkin'. You're talkin'
          yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .

                    TERRY
               (voice rising defiantly)
          I'm glad what I done today, see?
          You give it to Joey, you give it to
          Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your
          own. You thought you was God Almighty instead
          of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum!
          So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad
          what I done!

                    JOHNNY
               (coldly)
          You ratted on us, Terry.

                    TERRY
               (aware of fellow longshoremen watching the duel)
          From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing
          over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them
          years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you
          against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .

                    JOHNNY
               (beckoning Terry with his hands, in a passion of 
hate)
          Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're
          mine! Come on!

FIGHT ON UNION OFFICE DECK—SERIES OF SHOTS

As Johnny takes an aggressive step forward, Terry runs down the ramp 
and hurls himself at him.  They fight furiously on the deck of the
houseboat. A fight to the death. A violent brawl with no holds barred.
First one, then the other has the advantage.  In B.G., longshoremen
we know creep forward and watchi n amazement.

LONGSHOREMEN WATCHING

                    LUKE
          That kid fights like he useta!

Others nod but show no inclination to join in and face the goons.

BACK TO FIGHT

Which mounts in intensity as CAMERA FOLLOWS it around the narrow deck 
bordering the union offi ce. Johnny knees Terry but Terry retaliates 
with desperate combinations that begin to beat Johnny to the deck. Both 
of their faces are bloody and hideously swollen

ANOTHER ANGLE—GOONS

At this point Sonny, Truck and the other goons jump in to save their 
leader. Terry fights them off like a mad man, under vicious attack from 
all angles. 

                    LONGSHOREMEN WATCHING 
          They'll kill 'im!  It's a massacre! etc.

But they still hang back, intimidated by Johnny Friendly and his 
muscle.

TERRY FIGHTING

His face a bloody mask, being punched and kicked until he finally goes 
down. Goons are ready to finish the job when a battered Johnny Friendly 
mutters:

                    JOHNNY
          That's enough. Let 'im lay there.

Terry is crumpled on the deck, senseless, in a pool of blood.

REVERSE—ON EDIE AND FATHER BARRY

Pushing their way anxiously through the crowd of longshoremen.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (tight-lipped)
          What happened?  What happened?

                    EDIE
               (to young longshoreman)
          Tommy, what happened?

                    POP
          Where you goin'?

                    EDIE
               (fiercely)
          Let me by.

BACK TO TERRY

Blood seeping from his many wounds as Father Barry and Edie run in and 
kneel at his side. Johnny Friendly near by.

                    JOHNNY
          You want 'im?
               (as he goes)
          You can have
          'im. The little rat's yours.

                    FATHER BARRY
               (to longshoreman)
          Get some fresh water.

                    EDIE
          Terry...?

                    FATHER BARRY
          Terry... Terry... .

Terry groans, barely conscious.

ENTRANCE TO PIER—ON BOSS STEVEDORE

In felt hat and business suit, symbols of executive authority.

                    BOSS STEVEDORE
          Who's in charge here? We
          gotta get this ship going. It's costing us money.

The longshoremen hang back, glancing off toward the fallen Terry.

                    BOSS STEVEDORE
               (waving them towardhim)
          Come on! Let's get goin'!

The men don't move.

                    BOSS STEVEDORE
          I said— c'mon!

                    TOMMY
          How about Terry? If he don't work, we don't work.

Others around him murmur agreement.

                    JOHNNY
               (from B.G.)
          Work! He can't even walk!

JOHNNY ON RAMP

Surrounded by longshoremen ignoring Stevedore's command, tries to drive 
them on.

                    JOHNNY
          Come on! Get in there!
               (grabbing Pop and shoving him forward)
          Come on, you!

From force of habit, Pop begins to comply. Then he catches himself and 
turns on Johnny.

                    POP 
               (sounding more sad than angry) 
          All my life you pushed me around.

Suddenly he shoves Johnny off the ramp into the water scummy with oil 
slick and riverbank debris.

JOHNNY IN WATER

Cursing.

POP AND LONGSHOREMEN

Cheering Johnny Friendly's humiliation.

                    JOHNNY 
               (from water) 
          Come on, get me outa here.

BACK TO STEVEDORE

                    BOSS STEVEDORE 
          Let's go! Time is money!

                    MOOSE 
          You hoid 'im. Terry walk in, we walk in with 'im.

Others facing Stevedore mutter agreement.

TERRY,FATHER BARRY AND EDIE

Terry's eyes flutter as they bathe his wounds.

                    EDIE 
               (to Father Barry) 
          They're waiting for him to walk in.

                    FATHER BARRY
          You hear that, Terry? 
               (as Terry fails to respond) 
          Terry, did you hear that? 
               (trying to penetrate Terry's batteredmind) 
          You lost the battle but you have a chance to win 
          the war. All you gotta do is walk.

                    TERRY
               (slowly coming to) 
          ...walk?

                    FATHER BARRY
          Johnny Friendly is layin' odds
          that you won't get up.

                    JOHNNY 
               (in B.G., shouts) 
          Come on, you guys!

Friendly's voice acts as a prod on Terry. 

                    TERRY
               (dazed) 
          Get me on my feet.

They make an effort to pick him up. He can barely stand. He looks 
around unseeingly.

                    TERRY
          Am I on my feet...?

                    EDIE 
          Terry...?

                    FATHER BARRY
          You're on your feet. You can finish
          what you started.

Blood oozing from his wounds, Terry sways, uncomprehendingly.

                    FATHER BARRY
          You can!

                    TERRY
               (mutters through bloody lips) 
          I can? Okay.  Okay...

                    EDIE 
               (screams at Father Barry) 
          What are you trying to do?

ANGLE—ON RAMP

As the groggy Terry starts up the ramp, Edie reaches out to him. Father 
Barry holds her back.

                    FATHER BARRY
          Leave him alone. Take your hands off him— 
          Leave him alone.

Staggering, moving painfully forward, Terry starts up the ramp. Edie's 
instinct is to help him but Father Barry, knowing the stakes of this 
symbolic act, holds her back. Terry stumbles, but steadies himself and 
moves forward as if driven on by Father Barry's will.

TERRY APPROACHING PIER ENTRANCE

As he staggers forward as if blinded, the longshoremen form a line on 
either side of him, awed by his courage, waiting to see if he'll make 
it. Terry keeps going.

REVERSE ANGLE—BOSS STEVEDORE—TERRY'S POV

Waiting at pier entrance as Terry approaches. Shot out of focus as 
Terry would see him
through bloody haze.

TERRY

As the men who have formed a path for him watch intently, Terry 
staggers up until he is face to face with the Stevedore. He gathers 
himself as if to say, "I'm ready. Let's go."

                    STEVEDORE 
               (calls officially) 
          All right— let's go to work!

As Terry goes past him into the pier, the men with a sense of 
inevitability fall in behind him.

JOHNNY FRIENDLY

Hurrying forward in a last desperate effort to stop the men from 
following Terry in.

                    JOHNNY 
               (screams) 
          Where you guys goin'? Wait a minute!

As they stream past him.

                    JOHNNY 
          I'll be back! I'll be back! And I'll remember every
          last one of ya!

He points at them accusingly. But they keep following Terry into the 
pier.

WIDER ANGLE—PIER ENTRANCE

As Father Barry and Edie look on, Stevedore blows his whistle for work 
to begin. Longshoremen
by the hundreds march into the pier behind Terry like a conquering 
army. In the B.G. a frenzied Johnny Friendly is still screaming, "I'll 
be back! I'll be back!" The threat, real as it is, is lost in the 
forward progress of Terry and the ragtail army of dock workers he now 
leads.

FADE OUT                                          

THE END
