It is the story of one Mr. Fox and his wild-ways of hen heckling, turkey taking and cider sipping, nocturnal, instinctive adventures.
He has to put his wild days behind him and do what fathers do best: be responsible.
He is too rebellious.
He is too wild.
He is going to try "just one more raid" on the three nastiest, meanest farmers that are Boggis, Bunce and Bean.
It is a tale of crossing the line of family responsibilities and midnight adventure and the friendships and awakenings of this country life that is inhabited by Fantastic Mr. Fox and his friends.
