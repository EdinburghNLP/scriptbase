Frank and Jack Baker are professional musicians who play small clubs.
They play schmaltzy music and have never needed a day job.
Times are changing and dates are becoming more difficult to get so they interview female singers.
They finally decide on Susie Diamond, a former 'escort' who needs some refinement, but the act begins to take off again.
While the act is now successful, both Frank and Jack have problems with their life on the road.
Susie becomes the agent that makes them re-evaluate where they are going, and how honest they have been with each other.
