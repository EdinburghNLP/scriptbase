FADE IN:

1	INT. APARTMENT - DUSK

JACK BAKER is standing before a dirty window, looking 
out at a dirty city street. He is wearing a tuxedo.

	VOICE
	Hey.

Jack looks at the GIRL in the bed, then at the rest of the 
apartment. Not good.

	JACK.
	Hey.

	GIRL	
	Whatcha doin' over there?

	JACK
	Gotta go.

	GIRL
	How come?

	JACK
	Job.

The girl glances at the bedside clock.

	GIRL
	Funny hours.

	JACK
	Funny job.

	GIRL
	Will I see you again?

Jack looks out at the dirty street again.

	JACK
	No.

The girl doesn't appear terribly unnerved by this.

	GIRL
	(the tux)	
	You weren't wearing that, were you, earlier?

Jack shakes his head, taps a brown bag on the sill.

	JACK
	Brought it.

	GIRL		
	Thank God. You look like a creep.

	JACK
	Thanks.

	GIRL
	I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who 
	wore that shit.

Jack nods, grabs the bag, and moves to the door.

	GIRL
	Hey.
	(as he stops)
	You got great hands.

Hearing this, a slow smile forms on Jack's lips and:

   MAIN TITLES END, we...

	DISSOLVE TO:


3	EXT. A NICE DOWNTOWN HOTEL (STARFIRE) 
- NIGHT

As Jack approaches, he takes a hit off a flask of whiskey,
then returns it to his pocket. A DOORMAN swings open 
the door.	

	JACK.
	How'm I doing, Tommy?

	DOORMAN.
	Two minutes.


4	INT. STARFIRE LOBBY - NIGHT

As Jack enters the lobby, he lights a cigarette, and nods to
a waitress (SHEILA) passing by.

	JACK
	Hey, Sheil. How's tips? 

	SHEILA
	I ain't booking a cruise. 

	JACK
	You seen my brother?

	SHEILA
	In the john.


5	INT. STARFIRE BATHROOM - NIGHT 

Jack's brother, FRANK, is standing in front of the mirror, 
stuffing the collar of his tux with towels while LOUIS, an 
old black attendant, looks on. Jack enters.

	JACK
	(a nod)
	Louis.

	FRANK
	You're giving me an ulcer, Jack.

	JACK
	I'm early.

	FRANK
	Forty-five seconds doesn't qualify as early, Jack. 
	Jesus, who's doing your tux these days?		

	JACK
	Moon.

	FRANK
	Go to China Boy, will ya. You look like you just 
	crawled out of bed.

Jack picks up a tiny spray can on the sink, reads it.

	JACK
	"Be the envy of all your friends with Crowning 
	Glory's Miracle Hair"...?
	(looking up)
	You gotta be kidding.

Jack studies the bald spot on the crown of his brother's 
head, then shakes the can. A MIXING BALL is heard.

	JACK
	This is paint, Frank.

	FRANK
	It's not paint.
	(pointing to the can)
	It's a "magical sheath which simulates a dazzling 
	head of hair."

	JACK
	Frank, this is paint.

	FRANK
	Just help me put it on, okay? You're supposed to 
	spray in a circular motion.

As Frank positions himself, Jack exchanges a glance with 
Louis. Shrugging, Jack gives the can a shake, steps back, 
and fires away.

	FRANK
	Well...?

Jack just stares. There is a dark spot on the back of Frank's 
head about the size of a scooter pie.

	FRANK
	Louis?

Louis looks up. His face could conceal a royal flush.

	LOUIS
	Dazzling...

APPLAUSE is heard as we...

	CUT TO:


6	INT. STARFIRE LOUNGE - CLOSEUP - A 
CARDBOARD STAND-UP - NIGHT

featuring two 8x10 glossies of Frank and Jack (more hair) 
and in bold letters: "TONIGHT! THE FABULOUS 
BAKER BOYS!"

We HOLD on the stand-up, then RISE above it to reveal a 
candlelit lounge, where Jack and Frank sit behind 
matching grand pianos, a poor man's version of Ferrante
and Teicher.

	FRANK
	(Mr. Smile)
	Thank you, thank you. Good evening and welcome 
	to the Starfire Lounge. My name is Frank Baker 
	and eighty-eight keys across from me is my little
	brother Jack.

The audience -- consisting of middle-aged out-of-towners 
swilling enormous banana daiquiris -- APPLAUDS.

	FRANK
	You know, my brother and I have been playing 
	together, gosh, I don't know. How long has it
	been, Jack?

	JACK
	(lighting cigarette)
	Thirty-one years, Frank.

	FRANK
	That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?

	JACK
	Lotta water.

	FRANK
	Of course, back then, things were a little different. 
	I was eleven, Jack was seven. and about the only 
	one who would listen to us was the family cat, 
	Cecil. We must've shaved three lives off that cat,
	eh, Jack?

The audience, having the benefit of the daiquiris, 
LAUGHS. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of razor 
blades.

	FRANK
	But seriously. It's been fifteen years since Jack 
	and I first stepped onto the stage as professionals. 
	But even though we've played some of the finest 
	venues in the world... there's one place that's 
	always been, for us, a very special place, and 
	that place is... this place, the Starfire Lounge.

Jack lays in a few soft bass chords.

	FRANK
	Why? Well, I guess you could say it's the...
	(pregnant moment)
	...people.

At which point, Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard 
and give birth to the melody of -- what else? -- "People."


7 	INT. STARFIRE KITCHEN - LATER 

Jack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen. 


	FRANK
	Now when we go in there, don't make trouble, 
	all right? 

	JACK
	Who's gonna make trouble? 

	GIRL'S VOICE
	Hi, Jack. 

A young GIRL in an apron smiles at Jack. 

	JACK
	Hi, Jenny. New earings? 

	JENNY
	Like 'em? 

	JACK
	Swell. You got something for me? 

The girl holds up a huge soup bone. 

	JENNY
	Been hiding it from Hector all day. 

	JACK
	You're a doll. 

	FRANK
	(as they exit)
	I mean it Jack. Behave. 

	JACK
	Like an angel. 


8	INT. LLOYD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Frank stands across the desk from the hotel's very young, 
very condescending assistant manager (LLOYD) as he 
prepares a cash envelope. Jack stays in the doorway, 
smoking.

	LLOYD
	Terrific, boys. Really. Terrific. Yes, sir... You're 
	just what we needed on a night like this.

	FRANK
	Uh... thanks, Lloyd.

Frank glances at Jack and realises he should have left him 
in the kitchen with Jenny and the soup bone.

	LLOYD
	Only Jack, do me a favour, will ya, pal. If you 
	wanna smoke onstage, put on a pair of sunglasses 
	and go play with the niggers on State Street.

Smoke curls out of Jack's nose. He is utterly still, like a pit 
bull eyeing a steak.

	LLOYD
	Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more 
	lessons. By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this.

Lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk.

	FRANK
	Uh... You don't know when you'll be wanting us 
	back, do you, Lloyd?

	LLOYD
	I'll call you.

	FRANK
	Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I 
	thought maybe...

	LLOYD
	I'll call you.

Frank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk.

	JACK
	Count it.

	FRANK
	Huh?

	JACK
	Count it.

	FRANK
	Jack...

	JACK
	Count the fucking money, Frank.

Lloyd looks up. Jack is staring right into him. Reluctantly,
Frank opens the envelope.

	FRANK	
	It's all here.
	(pulling Jack out)
	I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.

Lloyd doesn't answer. He just looks at Jack, smiling with 
amusement.


9	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Jack comes out onto the street with the wrapped up soup 
bone. Frank follows with the stand-up.	

	FRANK
	Very nice, Jack. Very nice.

	JACK
	Fuck him.

	FRANK
	This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.

	JACK
	Fuck him.

	FRANK
	Fuck him. Great, terrific. Fuck him.

As Frank reaches his car, he opens the trunk for the 
stand-up, then counts out Jack's share of the night's money.

	JACK
	So we on tomorrow night?

	FRANK
	Maybe Thursday. I hear the harpist at the 
	Sheraton's got appendicitis.

Frank slams the trunk closed.

	JACK
	Hey.

As Frank turns, Jack tosses him the Miracle Hair can.

	JACK
	Don't forget your hair.


10 	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Small, old, sparsely furnished. A piano by the window, an 
old phonograph, a bookcase full of records. Few 
photographs. 

As Jack enters, EDDIE, an old black Labrador, walks over
and yawns. 

	JACK
	Try to control your excitement, will ya, Ed. 

Eddie nuzzles the soup bone. 

	JACK
	Let's see your mouth.
	(taking a look)
	All right. But go easy. 

As Eddie retreats with the bone, Jack breaks the collar of 
his shirt and pauses by the piano. He considers the keys 
but, instead, flips on the PHONOGRAPH. As Bill Evans'
smoky piano solo "Turn Out the Stars" spills quietly into 
the room, Jack takes off his tie... then stops. He glances to 
the kitchen: dishes drip-drying in a rack. He touches an 
ashtray: clean. 

Taking two silent steps backward, Jack peers into the
bedroom. Inside, curled up on the bed, is a little girl 
(NINA). Jack studies her a moment, then, taking the bottle
of whiskey from his coat, sits at the piano by the window, 
staring into the night. 


11	EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING 
(EARLY)

The sun begins to peek through the buildings of Jack's 
neighborhood. Suddenly, ringing out over the rooftops is 
"JINGLE BELLS" -- not the entire song, just the first few 
bars, over and over.


12	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Jack, on the couch covered with a blanket, his arm draped
over the slumbering Eddie, opens his eyes, Across the 
room, seated at the piano, is Nina, the little girl. She stops 
playing and turns.

	NINA
	If you want some coffee? I made some coffee.

Jack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up. He
nods to the coffee. Nina goes to the kitchen,

	NINA
	(the piano)
	I practiced last night. I think I'm ready for "oh, 
	what fun it is to ride."

Jack nods. Suddenly the SOUND of heavy footsteps is 
heard. Jack and Nina glance up at the ceiling.
	
	JACK
	Sounds big. What's he do?

	NINA
	I don't know. Ma said it's like a lawyer, only the 
	hours are more regular. All I know's he came to 
	take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying 
	for dinner.

	JACK
	What happened to the donut king?

	NINA
	Married.

Upstairs, a door slams and heavy feet ECHO in the 
stairwell. Nina peers out the window.

	NINA.
	No breakfast. Maybe they had a fight.

Two deep thumps SOUND on the ceiling, a signal.

	NINA
	Gotta go. Teach me later?

Jack nods. As Nina exits, Jack turns to the couch and 
gives Eddie a nudge.

	JACK
	Hey.


12A	EXT. WILLIE'S PIANO SHOWROOM - DAY

The front window is cluttered with photographs of 
celebrity patrons, including two of Jack and Frank in their
tuxedos.


13 	INT. PIANO SHOWROOM - DAY 

Inside, Jack and Frank pick through a sea of rentals. 

	FRANK
	I just think it's time you came out for a visit, that's
	all. I mean, how long's it been? A year? 

	JACK
	(pointing to a piano)
	Try the Bosen. 

As Jack plays a little "Alfie" on one grand, Frank follows
suit on another. Jack frowns and glances across the room, 
where a fat MAN sits absorbed in the racing form. 

	JACK
	When you getting the Steinways back in, Willie? 

	WILLIE
	Wednesday next. 

Jack frowns again, moves to another piano. 

	FRANK
	Look. Here's what I'm saying. You come out to the 
	house next weekend. You spend a few hours with 
	the kids. You have a ball. 

	JACK
	I hate your kids, Frank. 

	FRANK
	You're their uncle. 

	JACK
	Only by relation. Besides, they hate me too. 

	FRANK
	They don't. They're always asking about you. 

	JACK
	They tried to electrocute me. 

	FRANK
	It was an accident. 

	JACK
	It was no fucking accident. The little one... 

	FRANK
	Cindy. 

	JACK
	She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How
	do you explain that? 

	FRANK
	She didn't know what she was doing. You're too 
	sensitive. 

	JACK
	You got weird kids, Frank. 

	FRANK
	(wearying of this)
	Look. It's Cindy's birthday. It'd be nice if you came
	out. 

	Jack
	(pointing)
	Try the Yamaha. 

Jack and Frank do a little "I Think I'm Going Out Of My 
Head", then Frank looks up for a verdict. 

	JACK
	(exiting)
	Tag 'em. 

	FRANK
	The Capri, Willie. Monday and Tuesday.


14	INT. CAPRI HOTEL/LUAU LOUNGE - NIGHT 

Decked out in Hawaiian shirts, Jack and Frank bang out 
"The Girl From Ipanema," while the audience -- three 
sorry-looking businessmen -- stares glumly at the 
grass-skirted waitresses yawning by the bar.

	FRANK
	...Thank you. The concludes our show for the 
	evening. Jack and I only hope you enjoyed 
	yourselves as much as we did.


15.	INT. CAPRI HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Frank stops before a half-open door marked "HOTEL 
MANAGER." Inside, a heavy MAN in a shiny suit is 
throwing darts in the general direction of a dartboard. 
He's not very good.

	MAN (CHARLIE)
	Frankie.

	FRANK
	You wanted to see me, Charlie?

	CHARLIE
	Yeah, yeah. Come on in.

	FRANK
	Little slow tonight.

	CHARLIE
	(waving it off)
	Mondays. How's Jack?

	FRANK
	Okay.

	CHARLIE
	The reason I wanted to see you alone... I mean the
	kitchen crew, the maids -- everybody loves him. 
	But me, he makes me nervous.

	FRANK
	Sometimes he makes me nervous.

	CHARLIE
	Yeah. Well, anyway.

Charlie takes an envelope, hands it to Frank.

	FRANK
	What's this?

	CHARLIE
	Your pay.

	FRANK
	What about tomorrow?

	CHARLIE
	It's all there. Both nights.
	
	FRANK
	What are you saying, Charlie?

	CHARLIE
	Look, Frankie. You and Jack been playing here a 
	long time.

	FRANK
	Twelve years.

	CHARLIE
	Maybe it's time we took a vacation from one 
	another.

	FRANK
	Vacation? Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You 
	said so yourself... I've got the pianos for two 
	nights... 

	CHARLIE
	It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got 
	six waiters standing in back listening to baseball. 
	I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta 
	fill the tables. It's a matter of economics. Me, I 
	love you guys, you know that. You're class. But 
	people today. They don't know class if it walks 
	up and grabs 'em by the balls.


16 	INT. CAPRI HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
(MINUTES LATER) 


As Jack waits, he notices an elegantly dressed woman 
watching him. She smiles. As Jack considers her, Frank 
appears, carrying the stand-up. 

	JACK
	Charlie's aim getting any better? 

Frank keeps walking. Jack notices the stand-up. 

	JACK
	What's with the board? 

	FRANK
	We're dark tomorrow. 
	
	JACK
	Dark? 

	FRANK
	Don't worry. Charlie stayed true. I'll give you your 
	share this weekend. At the house. 

As Frank moves quickly out of the door, the CAMERA 
PUSHES IN SLOWLY on Jack's face. 


17 	OMITTED
thru
18a


19 	EXT. STREET/FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY 

A taxi dumps Jack out onto the street of shabby tract 
houses. In his rumpled city suit, Jack looks like a cheap 
gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers. 
He stuffs the gift he's carrying into his coat and walks up 
to the small white house, presses the bell. No response. 

The back yard is small, with a short chain link fence 
surrounding it. Two kids -- a girl (CINDY) and a boy -- 
wearing party hats and buoyance devices, are splashing 
around in a build-it-yourself above-ground pool. When
they see Jack coming, they hunker down like crocodiles,
only their heads visible. 

	JACK
	Hey, kids. Dad home? 

The two heads say nothing. 

	JACK
	What d'ya say? Wanna run and get him for me? 

Still nothing. Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette, pats his 
pocket for matches. No matches. 

	JACK
	Shit. 

The kids' eyes widen at this profanity. Jack ponders things
a moment, then steps over the fence. 

At which point, the tiniest head begins to SCREAM. 

	JACK
	Hey, kid. Take it easy. 

No use. The kid's a world-class screamer. Suddenly 
Frank comes racing out of the house. 

	FRANK
	Cindy! What is it?
	(seeing Jack)
	Jack. 

	JACK
	Your doorbell doesn't work. 

	FRANK
	Honey, it's only Uncle Jack. You remember Uncle 
	Jack.
	(to Jack)
	It's probably just the excitement of seeing you again. 

As Jack nods slowly, we... 

	CUT TO: 


20 	INT. FRANK'S DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING 


A battered birthday cake, which reads "Happy Birthday 
Cindy", sits amid crumpled party hats and shreds of gift 
wrap. Jack stands alone, looking out the window into the
back yard. Turning, he glances at the cake, then exits. 


21 	INT. FRANK'S HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING 

At the end of the hallway, shadows cling to the ceiling 
outside the kitchen and VOICES can be heard -- the sound 
of family. As Jack moves towards the light, a half-open
door catches his eye. Stopping, he pushes the door open, 
flips on a lamp. 


22 	INT. BAKER BOYS' ROOM - EARLY EVENING 

Elvis has Graceland. The Fabulous Baker Boys have this 
little room in a tract house in the suburbs. 

Memorabilia is everywhere: music ribbons, newspaper 
clippings, photographs of Jack and Frank at every age, 
always dressed alike, smiling identical smiles. The first 
stand-up is there, carefully mounted and framed. Sheet 
music, dusty and dog-eared, is everywhere, piled in 
drunken stacks. 

But most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights,
perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed 
with age. 

Jack enters and surveys all around him. There is a shelf 
crowded with shot glasses from a hundred hotels, and, 
next to that, a stack of souvenir coasters from another 
hundred. Seeing a tiny monkey with "Hula Girl 
Hideaway" printed on it's belly (lighter), Jack gives one 
of the little plastic arms a flick and -- snap -- the little 
tiki torch in the other hand flames up. Jack lights the unlit 
cigarette in his mouth, replaces the monkey. 

Slowly, Jack's eyes come back to the pianos. He taps a 
key on the one nearest him and a curious expression falls
over his face. He moves to the other piano, taps a key. 
They're in tune. 

Turning, Jack sees that little Cindy is standing behind him, 
holding a pocket radio. She looks at it, then takes a step 
forward and holds her arms up to him. Jack looks wary. 
She shakes her arms impatiently and he bends down. 
Putting her hands on his neck, she gives him a kiss, then 
runs out of the room. 


	WOMAN'S VOICE
	Looks like you've found yourself a girlfriend. 

Jack looks up, sees Franks' wife, DONNA. 

	JACK
	The young ones always break your heart. 

Donna nods, gestures to the pianos. 

	DONNA
	Which one was yours? I can never remember. 

Jack taps the one nearest to him and Donna nods again, 
then studies a photo on the wall. 

	DONNA
	Funny... I don't ever seem to come in here... you 
	guys were really something, weren't you? 

	JACK
	Yeah, well, Frank always made sure we dressed 
	sharp. Said that was half of it. 

Donna nods. She and Jack obviously don't talk much. 

	DONNA
	So, how's that dog of yours? 

	JACK
	Losing his teeth. 

Donna nods slowly, then does a little shiver. 

	DONNA
	Gee, it's cold on here, isn't it? Think I need a 
	sweater. 

Donna starts to exit, then stops by the door. 

	DONNA
	Thanks for coming, Jack. The radio, that was nice. 

As Donna exits, Jack notices a stack of glossies on a table. 
As he touches them they fan into a dozen images of himself. 


23	INT./EXT. FRANK'S CAR - NIGHT

As Frank drives Jack back to his apartment, Jack taps an 
unlit cigarette on the dash.

	FRANK
	(a shiver)	
	Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year, huh?

Jack taps the cigarette.

	JACK
	What happened the other night, Frank? With 
	Charlie.

Frank says nothing, just driving.

	JACK
	He paid us off, didn't he? Fifteen years, Frank.
	No one paid us off.

	FRANK
	He made a deal. There's no shame in it.

Jack stares at Frank, then looks back out the window.

	FRANK
	We gotta talk.

	JACK
	Talk.

	FRANK
	I been thinking maybe we should make some 
	changes.
	(pauses)
	I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.

Silence. Jack taps the cigarette again.

	FRANK
	It's just an idea. I want your opinion. I mean, we go
	halfway on everything, right?

	JACK
	I wouldn't say exactly halfway, would you?
	
	FRANK
	We agreed if I took care of the business I'd be 
	entitled to a little extra. Isn't that what we agreed?

	JACK
	That's what we agreed.

	FRANK
	If you're unhappy with the arrange...

	JACK
	I'm not unhappy.

	FRANK
	If you'd like to assume more of the financial 
	responsibilities, I'd be...

	JACK
	Frank. Fuck it. Okay?
	(beat)
	How much? For the singer.

	FRANK
	I thought maybe twenty percent. I figure with the
	additional bookings we'll come out ahead. The 
	big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice.
	We have to stay competitive.

Jack laughs coldly.

	FRANK
	What?

Jack says nothing, just tapping the cigarette again.

	FRANK
	Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.

Jack looks out the window, at the night flickering by.

	JACK
	It never was.	


24 	INT. WILLIE'S REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY	

A YOUNG WOMAN in a pink sweater and short black
skirt stands in a tiny room in the back of Willie's 
showroom, holding some sheet music. Sammy Davis Jr.s 
face is on the sheet music. Frank is sitting with a notepad 
on his lap. Jack is at the piano.

	FRANK
	Good morning, miss...?

	YOUNG WOMAN (MONICA)
	Moran. Monica Moran.

	FRANK
	All right, Miss Moran...

	MONICA
	Actually, that's my stage name.

	FRANK
	I'm sorry?

	MONICA
	Moran. Monica. The whole thing. It's my stage 
	name. My real name's Blanche.

	FRANK
	Blanche...

	MONICA
	No romance, right? That's why I came up with 
	Monica. It's what I prefer.

	FRANK
	Well, that's fine.

	MONICA
	But if you call my house and my mother answers, 
	ask for Blanche. If you ask for Monica, she'll think 
	you have the wrong number and hang up.

	FRANK
	Right.

	MONICA
	And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's 
	opposed to my career.

	FRANK
	Uh huh. Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to 
	do for us?

	MONICA
	"Candy Man."
	(worried)
	Is that all right?

	FRANK
	It's one of Jack's favourites.

Monica turns, and, seeing Jack at the piano, gives a little
start.

	MONICA
	Oops. I almost forgot you were there. Here's the
	instructions.

Monica begins to hand Jack the sheet music.

	FRANK
	Uh... he knows it.

	MONICA
	Really? Isn't that a coincidence?

	JACK
	Small world.

Monica smiles. She likes Jack.

	FRANK
	Well, shall we?
	
Probably not, but Jack begins to play anyway. Swinging 
her arms and tapping her foot, Monica gets a feel for the 
rhythm, then launches in --  between beats -- so that Jack 
has to scramble over a chord to rescue her.

	MONICA
	"Who can take a sunrise
	Sprinkle it with dew
	Toss it in the air and make a groovy lemon pie
	The Candy Man can
	The Candy Man can..."

There would appear to be ample evidence as to why the 
mother of Monica nee Blanch opposes her daughter's 
career.
			
	FRANK
	Thank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.

Monica -- eyes closed, arms flung wide -- is fully caught 
up in the moment. Frank looks at Jack. Jack shrugs and 
continues to play.

	FRANK
	Miss Moran... Miss Moran... BLANCH!

Monica's eyes pop open, her mouth shut.

	MONICA
	Oh, sorry. I get so caught up in it sometimes. It's
	 scary.

	FRANK
	Yes, it is.

	MONICA
	Well... thanks.
	(to Jack)
	'Bye. Boy, you're good.

	JACK
	Drive carefully.

As Monica exits, Jack and Frank glance at one another 
apprehensively and a --


25  	MONTAGE BEGINS

in which a parade of singers come forth to offer their own
unique interpretations of:

A) "Feelings,"

B) "I Gotta Be Me," (sung by twins)

C) "This Is My Song," and perhaps most appropriately,

D) “What Kind Of Fool Am I?”

When it’s all over, Jack and Frank -- ties limp, collars 
broken -- look like they’ve been mugged.

	FRANK
	This must be statistically impossible.


26 	INT. WILLIE'S SHOWROOM - DAY 

A YOUNG WOMAN appears in the doorway, heavily 
BACKLIT. A silhouette in high heels. Willie, eating a 
corn beef on rye, looks up. 

	YOUNG WOMAN
	Hey. You one of the Fabulous Baker Boys? 


27	INT. WILLIE’S REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY 
(SAME TIME)

Frank is counting names on his note pad.

	FRANK
	Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven girls and not one who 
	can carry a tune.

	JACK
	There was a certain surreal quality to it.

	YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.)
	Goddamnit!

The woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway, 
holding a shoe in her hand. It’s broken.

	SUSIE
	Brand new Thursday. Believe it?

After today, Jack and Frank are prepared to believe 
anything.

	SUSIE
	This where the auditions are?

	FRANK
	This is where the auditions WERE. We’re finished.

	SUSIE
	What about me?

	FRANK
	You’re an hour and a half late.

	SUSIE
	Yeah, well, I had a little trouble catching a cab.

	FRANK		Punctuality. First rule of showbusiness.

	SUSIE
	(looking around)
	This is showbusiness?

	FRANK
	(in no mood)
	Look, Miss. We’re tired, you have gum on your
	lip, and we’re going home.

	SUSIE
	(touching her lip)
	Just like that, huh? I come all the way down here,
	break a heel, and you’re not going to give me a 
	chance because I have gum on my lip and I’m a 
	few minutes late?

	FRANK
	You’re an hour and a half late. Do you want me 
	to say it again?

	SUSIE
	It’s not exactly bewitching me.
	(stepping in)
	Besides, you’re not going anywhere.

	FRANK
	I beg your pardon?

	SUSIE
	Intuition, I’ve had a hunch about this all day. 
	Only I gotta say, in my mind it was a little more 
	glamorous. And anyway, if I’m so late how come 
	you’re still here?

	FRANK
	We ran long.

	SUSIE
	Uh huh. So where’s the winner?

Frank looks a little thrown. Susie nods knowingly and 
makes a little clicking noise as she taps her head.

	SUSIE
	See? What I tell you? Intuition.

	FRANK
	(pleading)
	Jack.
	
Jack studies the girl, shrugs.

	JACK
	What’ve we got to lose?

	FRANK
	Terrific. Thirty-eight.

	SUSIE
	What’s that? Thirty-eight? You guys have some 
	kind of code or something?

Jack gestures as if to say, “it’s nothing”.

	SUSIE
	(to Frank)
	You know, I’m sensing a lot of hostility from you.

Frank ignores this and sits down with the notepad.

	FRANK
	Name?

	SUSIE
	Susie. Susie Diamond.

	JACK
	Catchy. You have any previous experience as 
	a singer, Miss Diamond?

	SUSIE
	No.

	FRANK
	You have any entertainment experience at all?

	SUSIE
	Well... for the last couple years I’ve been on call
	for the Triple A Escort Service.

Jack and Frank exchange a glance.

	FRANK
	Any RATIONAL reason you think you can sing 
	professionally, Miss Diamond?

	SUSIE
	Well, I figure if you want to see if you can swim, 
	throw yourself in the water. What’s the worst that 
	can happen?

	FRANK
	How about drown?

	SUSIE
	You know, my bet is that you’re too literal a 
	person.

	JACK
	(intervening)
	What is it you’d like to share with us today, 
	Miss Diamond?

	SUSIE
	“More Than You Know.”

	JACK
	Key?

	SUSIE
	Low.

Jack nods and begins to play.

	SUSIE
	Real slow, okay?

Frank slumps in his chair, ready to be tortured again.

	SUSIE
	“More than you know
	More than you know
	Man of my heart
	I love you so
	Lately I find
	You’re on my mind
	More than you know...
	
	Whether you’re right
	Whether you’re wrong
	Man of my heart
	I’ll string along
	You need me so
	More than you’ll ever know...”

Susie stops. Frank Just sits there. Jack just sits there. 
She can sing. 

	SUSIE
	So? 

	FRANK
	Uh... We'll let you know. 

Jack shoots Frank a glance. 

	SUSIE
	Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of 
	showbusiness. 

Frank's not amused. 

	SUSIE
	Yeah, well, okay. 'Bye, Bakers. Nice socks. 

Susie walks out barefoot. Jack's eyes have Frank pinned. 

	FRANK
	I just thought we should talk about it between 
	ourselves. I mean, don't you think she's got a little 
	too much... personality? 

	JACK
	I think she's got half a voice. That makes her a 
	goddamn diva in this choir. We put one of those 
	other girls onstage, we're gonna get arrested.
	(leaning forward)
	And in case you didn't notice, I'm not sure 
	anybody's gonna be keeping track of how many 
	notes she hits. 

	FRANK
	What? Her? She looks like a tramp. 

	JACK
	Trust me. 

	FRANK
	(the notepad)
	Look, not all of them were awful. Here, Teresa 
	Meyers. A very nice low soprano. Sweet, 
	unassuming... 

	JACK
	Low soprano? That girl could make bats cry. 
	Besides, she was sixteen. What're we gonna do, 
	help her with her algebra between sets? 

Frank stares glumly at the notepad. 

	JACK
	Frank. There ain't no pearls in a litter box. 
	
	FRANK
	All right. I'll call her. 

Frank rises wearily, then freezes. 

	JACK
	What? 


28 	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWROOM - DAY 

Jack and Frank dash outside. Nobody. 

	FRANK
	We can always look her up in the book. 

	JACK
	Right. Susie Diamond. She's probably listed right 
	next to Monica Moran. 

The sound of a MATCH STRIKING is heard. There, 
lighting a cigarette in the doorway, is Susie. She exhales. 

	SUSIE
	Intuition. 


29 	INT. WILLIE'S REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY. 

The new trio poises for their first rehearsal. 

	FRANK
	Ready? 

Jack nods. 

	FRANK
	Ready? 

Susie, sitting on a stool smoking, nods without looking 
up from her lyric sheet. Frank pauses, then... 

	FRANK
	Ready? 

Jack squints strangely at Frank. Frank turns to Susie. 

	FRANK
	Ready? 
	
	SUSIE
	What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden? 

Frank glares at her. 

	SUSIE
	READY. 

Frank begins to play the opening passage of "Can't Take 
My Eyes Off of You". Jack joins in, then Susie. 
Unfortunately, Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing 
alone, are a tad overwhelming. 
	
	SUSIE
	Fellas, fellas... 

Jack and Frank stop. 

	FRANK
	What's the problem? 

	SUSIE
	The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all 
	this... music. You know what I'm saying? 

Jack and Frank look at one another. 

	SUSIE
	I mean back there it may be hard to notice, but up 
	here I'm having trouble getting a word in. 

Jack and Frank just stare. 

	SUSIE
	I mean you're supposed to be backing me up, right? 
	
	FRANK
	(icily)
	No. We are not supposed to be backing you up. 

	SUSIE
	What I mean is... 

	JACK
	We'll bring it down. 

Susie's eyes shift to Jack. 

	JACK
	Okay? 

	SUSIE
	Okay. 


30 	EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING 

Once again, "Jingle Bells" is heard. Plaintively picked out 
on PIANO. 


31 	INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S APARTMENT - EARLY 
EVENING (SAME TIME) 

A tuxedo, freshly pressed, hangs in the shower as Eddie 
watches Jack soap his face with a shaving brush, then picks 
up a razor. As NINA CLINKS badly on the final note of 
"in a one horse open sleigh", Jack almost slices open his 
throat. 

	JACK
	Sharp! F Sharp!
	(eyeing his throat)
	Jesus. 

As Nina appears in the doorway, she sees the blood 
welling on Jack's neck. 

	NINA
	You're bleeding, Jack. 

As Jack gives her a "no kidding" look. 

	JACK
	Hand me a towel, Chopin 

Nina starts to gather up towels, cleaning up, and hands
one to Jack. She notes the shaving brush. 

	NINA
	You shave like a old movie, Jack.
	(nodding to ceiling)
	Bigfoot gets his out of a can. 
	
	JACK
	Yeah? How do you know? 

	NINA
	I saw his stuff in the bathroom. 

	JACK
	Sounds serious. 

	NINA
	Uh uh. No toothbrush. 

	JACK
	What do you mean? 

	NINA
	No toothbrush. Toothbrush is serious. The donut 
	king...? 

	JACK
	Yeah? 

	NINA
	He had a toothbrush. And toothpaste. 

	JACK
	I thought he was married. 

Nina exits with an armful of laundry. 

	NINA (O.S.)
	He was married, but he was serious. 


32	INT. HILTON LOBBY - NIGHT (AN HOUR LATER)

As Frank paces, Jack smokes calmly.

	FRANK
	I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn’t I? 
	Seven-fifteen.

	JACK
	She’ll get here.

	FRANK
	Just like the day of the auditions, right? Jesus. 
	How’s my hair?

	JACK
	Awe inspiring.

	FRANK
	Yeah, well, yours isn’t. Let me run a comb through 
	it.

	JACK
	Get out of here!

	FRANK
	It’s not gonna hurt you.

	JACK
	I’ll hit you, Frank. I swear.

Frank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to feint an
opponent, then takes a flick at Jack’s hair. Jack cuffs him 
on the shoulder.

	FRANK
	You hit me.	

	JACK
	I told you I was gonna hit you.

He looks capable of hitting him again, too.

	FRANK
	All right, I’m a little wound up.

	JACK
	You’re a fucking alarm clock.

	FRANK
	I just wish she’d get here.

	JACK
	She’s here.

Susie, wearing a flamboyant dress, is standing across the
lobby, staring at the stand-up.

	FRANK
	Christ, look at her.
	(walking over)
	Good evening, Miss Diamond. You’re late.

Susie is still looking at the stand-up, which is unchanged 
except for a small notation at the bottom: “WITH GUEST 
VOCALIST.”

	SUSIE
	Guest vocalist? Who’s next week? Beverly Sills?
	And how come you guys are the only ones with 
	your pictures on the poster?

	FRANK
	We’ll talk about it later. Where’s your dress?

	SUSIE
	(to Jack)
	What’s he talking about?

	FRANK
	Is there a language problem here? Your dress. For 
	tonight. Where is it?
	
	SUSIE
	Do I look like I’m naked?

	FRANK
	That! Are you insane!

	SUSIE
	(to Jack)
	He doesn’t like the dress, right?

Before Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie’s arm.

	SUSIE
	Hey!

	FRANK
	Come on. We don’t have much time.
			 

33	INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DRESS DEPARTMENT 
- NIGHT

As the trio dashes into Ladies Wear, Frank begins to flip 
frantically through the dress racks.

	FRANK
	What do you wear? An eight?

	SUSIE
	(offended)
	A six.

	FRANK
	My wife wears a six. You don’t look like a six 
	to me.

	SUSIE
	I WEAR A SIX.

	FRANK
	Okay, okay. Here, how about this?

	SUSIE
	Save it for your wife.

	FRANK
	Jack, you find anything?

Jack has drifted to lingerie.

	JACK
	Maybe.

	FRANK
	Here, how’s this?

Frank holds out an inky black dress. Susie sizes it up.

	FRANK
	Close enough. Let’s go.

Frank begins to drag Susie into the dressing room.

	SUSIE
	Hey, pal. I don’t know about you, but where I 
	come from there’s a little girl’s room and a little
	boy’s room and the little boys don’t go where the
	little girls go.

	FRANK
	All right, but make it quick.
	(remembering)
	Shoes! What size do you wear?

	SUSIE
	(from the dressing room)
	Nine.

	FRANK
	Nine?

	SUSIE (O.S.)
	NINE!

	FRANK
	(to himself)
	Big feet.


34 	INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - SHOE DEPARTMENT 
- NIGHT

Frank and Jack work the shoe department quickly.

	FRANK
	See anything?

	JACK
	How about these?

Frank grabs the shoe out of Jack's handand gestures to a 
SALESMAN who looks like Jimmy Breslin.

	FRANK
	Hey! Do these come in black?

	SALESMAN
	I'll be with you in a minute,sir.

	FRANK
	I don't have a minute, pal. Yes or no?

	SALESMAN
	(glowering)Yeah. They come in black.

	FRANK
	Okay. Give me a pair of nines.Pronto.

The salesman glances casually at Jack.

	SALESMAN
	Does he want a pair, too?


35	INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DRESS DEPARTMENT 
- NIGHT

As Jack and Frank return to Ladies Wear, Frank jettisons 
the shoe box and tissue paper.

	FRANK
	All right, we got your shoes.

Just then, Jack and Frank notice Susie, standing in front of 
a mirror in the new dress.  The dress is open down to the
small of her back. It’s a nice back.

	SUSIE
	(turning)
	What do you think?

	FRANK
	Uh... good.

	SUSIE
	(to Jack)
	Zip me up?

As Jack takes the zipper, he gives Frank a “what did I tell 
you” glance.

	SUSIE
	Shoes?

	FRANK
	Right.

Frank puts the shoes down and Susie steps in.

	SUSIE
	They’re tight.

	FRANK
	They’re nines.

	SUSIE
	Well they’re aspiring to be sevens.

	FRANK
	We can buy new ones tomorrow. Don’t worry. 
	We’ll take these out of your share.

	SUSIE
	You’re a prince.


36	OMITTED	
	

37	INT. HILTON KITCHEN - NIGHT

As the trio rushes in, Frank hands Jack the Miracle Hair 
can, then turns to Susie.

	FRANK
	Okay, now remember, Jack and I go on first, I do 
	the set-up, then introduce you. And you say...

	SUSIE
	(as Jack sprays Frank’s head)
	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, I can’t tell 
	you how thrilled I am to be here.

As Susie starts to inquire about Frank’s head, RAY, the 
assistant manager, leans into the kitchen.

	RAY
	Winding your watch these days, Frankie?

	FRANK
	We had a little emergency, Ray.

	RAY
	(seeing Susie)
	Who’s this, Minnie Pearl?

All eyes turn to Susie’s dress, which still has the tags 
attached. Frank turns to the kitchen crew.			

	FRANK
	Scissors! We need scissors here!

	RAY
	(exiting)
	I want seventy-five minutes, Frankie.

	FRANK
	Jesus... Let’s go, Jack. Fix your tie.

	WAITRESS
	(in passing)
	Good luck, guys. It’s a pretty ugly group. They’re 
	sending back the cheeseballs.

As Jack and Frank exit, Susie turns and sees a TINY 
MAN in an apron holding a meat cleaver.

	TINY MAN/CARLOS
	No scissors.


38	INT . HILTON LOUNGE - NIGHT

As the Bakers slide quickly behind their pianos, Frank 
bumps his head on the microphone.

	FRANK
	Good evening. Welcome to the Ambassador 
	Lounge. My name’s Frank Baker and no, you’re 
	not seeing double, it’s just my little brother Jack.

The audience peers at Jack as if he were some curious life
form they’ve never seen before. Jack and Frank exchange 
a wary glance.	


39	INT. HILTON KITCHEN - NIGHT

Susie, sitting on a stool, fits something on her wrist while
Carlos looks for a good angle to get at the tags. As the 
waitress passes by, Susie snares a drink.

	WAITRESS
	Hey!

	SUSIE		
	Just a sip. To kill the butterflies.

	WAITRESS
	Okay. But no lipstick. Hey, what’s that on your 
	wrist?

	SUSIE
	The next hour and a half of my life.

Carlos brings the cleaver down with an ominous chop.


40	INT. HILTON LOUNGE - NIGHT		
	
An audience of stone.

	FRANK
	This is nice. I feel an unspoken warmth here. We 
	may not know each other’s names, but over the 
	years we’ve shared something. A little music. A 
	little laughter. Maybe even... a few tears. But I 
	guess that’s what life’s about, huh?

Dead silence. As Frank glances at Jack, Jack cuts a rueful 
grin.

	FRANK
	Well, anyway. This is a very special evening for
	Jack and I, because tonight we have with us a 
	young lady who we think is very exciting...

Smoking nervously offstage, Susie checks her wrists, 
which is fitted with tiny cards, each containing the lyrics 
to a song.

	FRANK
	As far as I’m concerned, she couldn’t have chosen
	 a better place to make her debut.
	(solemnly)
	Because, for us, there’s one place that’s always 
	been a very special place. And that place is this 
	place, the Ambassador Lounge. Ladies and 
	gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to a 
	very special lady with a very special way of 
	singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond...!

Absently crushing her cigarette into a container of cocktail
napkins, Susie strides to the microphone, which, 
unfortunately, is not on.

	FRANK
	(whispering)
	The switch. Hit the switch.

	SUSIE
	Switch?
	(hitting it, voice booming)
	What fucking switch?

Silence. Susie looks at the audience.

	SUSIE
	Pardon me.

Jack and Frank glance at one another, then quickly plunge
into the opening number.

	SUSIE
	I can’t tell you how thrilled I am to be here.

The feeling at this point, it would seem, is not mutual.
Susie glances at her wrist, finds the song she wants, then 
grabs the microphone. It’s stuck. She gives it a yank, 
trying to free it, but pulls so hard that the rubber band 
holding the cards snaps.

Mystified, Jack and Frank watch as the couple nearest the
stage is showered in tiny cards. Then they notice Susie.

She’s frozen. Stiff.

Jack looks at Frank. Frank looks at Jack. Then...

	FRANK
	(singing)
	“I work at the Palace ballroom...”

Every head in the lounge, Jack’s included, swivels 
to Frank.

	FRANK
	“But gee that place is cheap
	When I get back to my chilly old room
	I’m much to tired to sleep...”

Jack looks at Frank like he’s insane. Frank nods earnestly
to him as all heads swivel to Jack.

	JACK
	(reluctantly)
	“I’m one of those lady teachers
	A beautiful hostess you know
	One that the palace features
	At exactly a dime a throw...”

Jack’s voice -- damning evidence that he and Frank are
related -- brings Susie around. She takes the next lines 
right out of Frank’s mouth.

	SUSIE
	“Ten cents a dance
	That’s what they pay me
	Gosh how they weigh me down

	Ten cents a dance
	Pansies and rough guys
	Tough guys who tear my gown...”

 Compared to what preceded her, Susie sounds like 
Streisand. The audience -- bewildered, but oddly charmed 
-- applauds spontaneously. The effect on Susie is 
immediate. Hitting on all cylinders now, she grips the 
microphone like a trophy.

	SUSIE
	“Seven to midnight I hear drums
	Loudly the saxophone blows
	Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
	Customers crush my toes...

	“Sometimes I think I’ve found my hero
	But it’s queer romance
	All that you need is a ticket
	Come on big boy, ten cents a dance...”


41	EXT. HILTON SERVICE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
(LATER)

The new trio comes out into the night.

	FRANK
	Fucking. She says fucking in front of an entire
	 room of people.

	SUSIE
	I apologised.

	FRANK
	(to Jack)
	Did you hear it.

	JACK
	Fucking.

	SUSIE
	Look, they were all on their third Mai Tai by the 
	time I got out there anyway.

	FRANK
	FUCKING.

	SUSIE
	For Christ sake, I SAID it. I didn’t DO it. Besides,
	 I don’t think they were too offended, do you?

Susie pulls out some crumpled bills. Frank grabs them.

	FRANK
	We are not a saloon act. We do not take tips from
	 dirty old men.

	SUSIE
	(innocent)
	I was gonna split with you guys.

	FRANK
	WE DO NOT TAKE TIPS. I’ll apply this to the
	cost of the dress.

Frank puts the money away. Susie watches, steaming.

	SUSIE
	Then I want my name on the poster. And my 
	picture! And these shoes are too goddamn tight!

Susie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot. 
Jack, leaning against a wall, watches with amusement.

	JACK
	Nice girl.

On Frank’s expression we hear the opening NOTES of 
“Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You” and a MONTAGE 
begins.


42	INT. VARIOUS LOUNGES - NIGHT - MONTAGE

of Susie and boys performing the song in one lounge after
another, playing to increasingly enthusiastic crowds, no 
empty tables now. As the song ends, we close on the  
cardboard stand-up, newly done over with a picture of 
Susie and an accompanying exclamation: “SEE THE 
SENSATIONAL SUSIE DIAMOND!”. As the final 
CHORD sounds, the

MONTAGE ENDS and we --


43	INT. LLOYD’S OFFICE AT STARFIRE - NIGHT

Where, once again Jack and Frank stand before the 
supercilious Lloyd.

	LLOYD
	I gotta hand it to you, guys. This two Jacks and 
	Jill bit -- very sharp. Where’d you find her, 
	anyway. The girl.

	FRANK
	Ah, you know these kids. They hang around. We 
	figured we’d give her a break.

	LLOYD
	You’ve got a kind heart, Frankie. Well, give her
	a tip from me, will ya: The smaller the dress, the 
	larger the crowd.
	(closing an envelope)
	Okay, guys, there you go. Don’t spend it all in 
	one place.

As Frank reaches for the envelope, Lloyd pulls it back.

	LLOYD
	Oh... maybe you want to count it, Jack.

	FRANK
	We trust you, Lloyd. You know that.

Frank takes the envelope and starts to leave.

	LLOYD
	Say Frankie. Long as I’ve got you here... How’s 
	next week look for you guys?

Frank glances at Jack, giving it to him.

	JACK
	We’ll call you.

As Lloyd’s face falls, we --		


44	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE OF HOTEL - NIGHT 
(STARFIRE)

An exultant Frank spins giddily out of the hotel.

	FRANK
	Did you see his face? Did you see it! “We’ll call 
	you.”

Jack calmly lights a cigarette, says nothing.

	FRANK
	The world is good, little brother... Don’t let 
	anybody tell you different...

As Frank dances away with the stand-up, Jack notices 
Susie standing at the corner, watching Frank too, a slight
         smile on her face.

	SUSIE
	‘Night, Baker.


45	EXT. CITY - DAY		

The city, gray and cold. Once again we hear a tentative 
PIANO: Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh
 what fun it is to ride... Oh what fun it is to ride... Oh what
 fun...

47	EXT. VETERINARY CLINIC - ESTABLISH - DAY

47A	INT. VETERINARY CLINIC WAITING ROOM - DAY

Jack and Eddie wait with several other pet owners and 
their pets.

48	INT. VETERINARY OFFICE - DAY

Jack looks on as a VET examines Eddie’s mouth. 

	DR. FINNEGAN
	Mmm... mmm hmm...
	(looking up)
	They gotta go.

	JACK
	Go? What do you mean?

	DR. FINNEGAN
	Five’s my guess. Maybe more. Won’t know till I 
	get in there.

	JACK
	How will he eat?

	DR. FINNEGAN
	Cottage cheese to start. A banana now and then.

	JACK
	No bones?

	DR. FINNEGAN
	(patting Eddie)
	‘Fraid those days are over, my friend. Don’t 
	worry, Mr. Baker. We’ll knock him out. He won’t 
	feel a thing.

As Dr. Finnegan exits, Jack looks at Eddie.

	JACK
	You shoulda brushed, pal.


49	OMITTED


50	INT. MOONLIGHT LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Jack, wearing a Santa hat, sits on a busing cart backstage, 
smoking. Frank and Susie, in the midst of a discussion, 
are also wearing Santa hats.

	SUSIE
	Look, all I’m telling you is what Bernadette over 
	the Hilton said. The nights we play, she’s drawing 
	three times the tips because the Chivas is jumping
	out of the bottle and the room’s pearls instead of 
	polyester.

	FRANK
	I don’t understand. You’re saying we should...

	SUSIE
	Ask for a percentage of the bar.

	FRANK
	Mel Torme doesn’t get a percentage of the bar.

	SUSIE
	Maybe he never asked.

	HOUSE MANAGER
	(passing by)
	Five minutes, Baker.

	FRANK
	(to Jack)
	You hearing this?

	JACK
	How much you say she’s drawing?

	SUSIE
	Let’s put it this way. Two months ago she’s 
	wearing a Timex. Now she’s got a Seiko strapped 
	to her wrist. And it sure as hell wasn’t the Hilton 
	that put it there.

	FRANK
	You’re not actually listening to this, are you?

Jack rolls the tip of his cigarette in an ashtray.

	JACK
	Jerry Stein books the Hilton, right?

	FRANK
	For eight years.

	JACK
	Forget the bar. We’d look like amateurs. But why
	not bump him for an extra hundred up front.

	FRANK
	And if he tells us to take a walk?

	JACK
	We play the other side of the street.

	FRANK
	I don’t like it. It’s not the way we play the game.

Susie watches Jack crush out his cigarette.

	JACK	
	The game is changing.	 


51 	INT. MOONLIGHT KITCHEN - NIGHT (AFTER THE 
SHOW)

Becky, the pretty young kitchen worker, drops a bunch 
of bananas into a bag.

BECKY
The cottage cheese is at the bottom. You're sure this is 
what you want?

JACK
(exiting)
Perfect. Merry Christmas, Becky.


52	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MOONLIGHT - NIGHT

As Jack exits the hotel, he finds Susie standing on the
sidewalk, shaking her purse. She sees the bag he’s 
carrying.

	SUSIE
	Ol’ Freckles in the kitchen slip you a stack of 
	T-bones?

	JACK
	Not exactly.

Susie fishes a pack of cigarettes out of her purse. Empty.

	SUSIE
	Damnit!

Jack offers his pack.

	SUSIE
	No thanks. I never touch American cigarettes.
	(searching again)
	Three fifty a pack and I go through ‘em like 
	toothpicks.

	JACK
	Huh?

Susie hands Jack the empty cigarette box. It has an exotic
design.

	SUSIE
	Paris Opals. Three fifty a pack. Know how much
	 that is a piece?

	JACK
	Seventeen cents.

	SUSIE
	Seventeen and a half. But I figure, If you’re gonna 
	be sticking something in your mouth, might as well
	make it the best.

	JACK
	As Jack ponders this, Frank steps outside in a 
	lumpy Santa suit.

	FRANK
	What do you think?

Jack and Susie just stare.

	FRANK
	Thought I’d give the kids a thrill.
	(moving off)
	Don’t forget Monday. Bright and early. We’ve got 
	a long drive.

As Frank leaves, Susie goes back to her purse.

	SUSIE
	I don’t know. It’s hard figuring you and egghead 
	as brothers. Seems like the hospital might’ve 
	scrambled the babies somewhere.
	(finding an Opal)
	Ah, here’s a lost soul.

Jack flicks out his lighter, snaps it. Susie inhales.

	SUSIE
	Mmm. Like kissing a rose. Well, au revoir.

	JACK
	(studying her)
	You feel like a cup of coffee?

	SUSIE
	(looking up)
	Now? On Christmas Eve?

Jack nods.

	SUSIE
	Nah. Gives me the shakes. Anyway, I’d better get 
	home. Rest the pipes.

	JACK
	You want me to walk you?

Susie looks at Jack a little funny.

	SUSIE
	No. Thanks.

She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.

	SUSIE
	Hey, listen, you’re not going soft on me, are you? 
	I mean, you’re not gonna start dreaming about me 
	and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like 
	I’m some kinda princess when I burp.

	JACK
	Forget it.

	SUSIE
	I mean, that’d be too creepy with us working 
	together and all.

	JACK
	Forget it.

	SUSIE
	Nothing personal...

Jack holds up his hand. Susie just stands there.

	JACK
	Better hurry. You’re a nickel down on your 
	cigarette.


53	EXT. VET CLINIC - NIGHT

A sign flickers: “Twenty-Four Hour Emergency Care.”


54	INT. VET CLINIC - NIGHT

Inside, a KID with deep-set eyes is bent over a magazine.
Jack enters, still wearing his tux.

	KID	
	Super Chief around the corner.

	JACK
	Huh?

	KID
	Bathroom. Super Chief around the corner.

	JACK
	No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning.

The kid looks up, eyes Jack’s tux warily.

	KID
	Regular hours are eight to five.

	JACK
	Yeah, yeah, I know. I was just passing by. 
	Thought I’d check in on him.

	KID
	You can check in on him tomorrow. Between 
	eight and five.

	JACK
	Yeah, well, I thought maybe...

	KID
	Hey, pal. We’re not communicating, are we?

The kid shakes his head with contempt.

	KID
	You want to know if he’s okay. Right?

	JACK
	(uncomfortable)
	Yeah.

	KID
	All right. Hold on.

	JACK
	The name’s Baker...

	KID
	Save it. What’s he look like?

	JACK
	(puzzled)
	Black. Lab.

	KID
	All right. They lay the dead ones out in the cold 
	room. I’ll take a look.

The Kid disappears. Jack stands frozen, watching the 
swinging door come to rest, looking like a man who, 
unexpectedly, finds a razor pressed to his throat.

Suddenly the door swings back open.

	KID
	Nope. Just a couple poodles.

As the kid hunches down again, Jack stares at him. 
Slowly, as Jack’s shadow falls across his magazine, the 
kid looks up. Jack looks like he could EAT a dead poodle.

	JACK
	I WANT MY DOG.

	KID
	Listen, pal. Get the hell...

Jack, quick as knife, pinches the Kid’s nose between his
thumb and forefinger.

	JACK
	No, YOU listen, you little fuck. You either get off 
	your candy ass and get me my dog or I’m gonna 
	roll that magazine and stick it straight down your 
	throat.
	(leaning in close)
	Are we communicating now?

55A	INT. HALLWAY - JACK’S BUILDING - NIGHT

Jack, with Eddie slung over one shoulder, mounts the 
stairs to his apartment.


56	INT. JACK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Nina is watching an old Christmas movie in the dark, the 
walls of the apartment dripping with black and white 
snow.

	JACK
	(entering)			
	Hey. How about a little light in here.

Hearing Jack, Nina turns and flips on a lamp.

	NINA
	Eddie!

	JACK
	Forget it. He’s still circling the airport.

Jack plops Eddie onto the couch and heads for the kitchen.

	NINA
	I didn’t know he was coming home tonight.

	JACK
	Yeah, well, we sorta skipped the paperwork.
	Besides, it’s Christmas, right?		

Nina just nods, strokes Eddie. Jack studies her, then grabs
a carton of eggnog and two glasses.

	JACK
	So, where’s Ma tonight?

Nina just shrugs.

	JACK
	You play her the song.

	NINA
	Maybe tomorrow, she said.

Nina looks up and sees the carton of eggnog.

	NINA
	From Hurley’s?

	JACK
	Eighty proof. Think you can handle it?

Nina nods. As Jack fills the glasses, Nina takes the Santa 
hat from his pocket.

	NINA
	Jack.

	JACK
	Yeah.

	NINA
	Can I stay here tonight? Even if she comes home
	 alone?

	JACK
	(a beat)
	Okay.

Jack settles next to Nina, staring out the window with her.

	NINA
	I think I’m getting drunk.

Jack studies the lights twinkling in the darkness beyond the 
window.

	JACK
	That’s what you’re supposed to do on Christmas 
	Eve.


57 	INT./EXT. FRANK’S CAR - MORNING

As Frank drives through the city, Susie pores over a slick
hotel brochure.

	SUSIE
	Get this: “Each room is an event, an excursion 
	into unprecedented luxury. Step outside and the 
	adventure continues with your own private 
	terrace...” Jesus, this place is like OZ.

Frank glances at the brochure dispassionately. Susie 
looks up from the brochure.

	FRANK
	You don’t think it really looks like that, do you?

	SUSIE
	It’s right here. Pictures.

	FRANK
	Welcome to the road, Dorothy. You’re about to
	lose your virginity.


58	EXT. FRONT OF JACK’S BUILDING - MORNING

As Frank turns the corner into Jack’s street, Jack is sitting
on a suitcase in front of his building... with Eddie.

	FRANK
	What the hell...?

As Frank stops the car, he gets out, looks at Eddie.

	FRANK
	He’s just seeing you off, right?

Jack picks up his suitcase, moves to the trunk.

	FRANK
	Jack. This is not possible. Jack...


59 	INT./EXT. FRANK'S CAR - MORNING

Jack and Eddie sit in the back. Susie hangs over the front
 seat, studying Eddie.

	SUSIE
	You try mashed potatoes? Or how 'bout yams? I 
	love yams. Put me right to sleep.

	FRANK
	He doesn't need to sleep, he needs to eat.

	SUSIE
	I'm just throwing out suggestions.

	FRANK
	The dog just had oral surgery. Why don't you two
	give him a few days before you set him up at a 
	smorgasboard.

Frank, so agitated he's let the car wander, gets some
vigorous HONKING from the next lane.

	FRANK
	(yelling out the window)
	That the only tune you know!

	JACK
	Hey. You're spooking Ed.

	FRANK
	(to himself)
	I'm spooking Ed.


60	EXT. “KING’S” HOTEL - DUSK

The hotel, done in a sort of King Arthur motif.


61	INT./EXT. FRANK’S CAR - DUSK

As Frank guides the car down a simulated cobblestone
drive, Susie smiles.

	SUSIE
	Is it just me? Or is that one spectacular hotel?

	FRANK
	(unimpressed)
	Stunning.

Two boys in jodhpurs descend upon the car immediately,
opening the doors with exaggerated courtesy.

	SUSIE
	Why, THANK YOU.
	(to Jack, Frank)
	I’ll see you boys inside?

As Susie strolls inside, she gives them a little wave with
the brochure.


62	INT. “KING’S MANOR” LOBBY - NIGHT

Susie stands in the lobby, fixed on the brochure. We 
HOLD on the picture in her hands -- a lobby of rich 
velvets and handsome woods, gleaming under a 
magnificent vaulted ceiling -- then TILT UP SLOWLY 
to the real thing.

A perfect match.

As the doors behind her open, Susie turns to see Jack and
Frank enter. They stop cold. Eddie yawns.

	SUSIE
	Come on, Toto. Tell the Tin Man and the 
	Scarecrow to get the lead out. Dorothy’s got a 
	five day engagement. Guaranteed.


63	INT. FRANK AND JACK’S ROOM - NIGHT

A magnificent room, with a pair of mammoth fruit baskets.

Frank is lining family photographs on the dresser.

	FRANK
	I took the right side of the closet like always, 
	okay?

	JACK
	Okay.

	FRANK
	Since I have the bed on the right and the drawers 
	on the right, I figured it’s easier to remember.

	JACK
	Good idea.

	FRANK
	But if it doesn’t work out, let me know. I’m 
	flexible.

	JACK
	Right.

Just then, Susie enters from the other side of the suite,
through the connecting bathroom. She has a piece of fruit 
in her hand.

	SUSIE
	Looks like Carmen Miranda had an accident in 
	my room.
	(seeing their baskets)
	They must get a deal on these things. What do you 
	make of this?

Susie holds up the tiny furry fruit in her hand.

	FRANK
	Kiwi.

	SUSIE
	Jesus. It’s got more hair than you, Frank.
	(exiting)
	No peeking at tub time.


63A 	EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - INNER 
COURTYARD - NIGHT

The inner courtyard is a maze of low hedges and small 
bridges, with a tiny stream running through it all. As 
Susie and Eddie inspect the menagerie of topiary animals 
along the way, Jack and Frank follow several yards 
behind.

	FRANK
	I'm telling you right now, I'm not gonna put up 
	with it. Did you see what she ate at dinner? 

Jack, working his mouth with a toothpick, studies Susie's
trim figure up ahead.

	FRANK
	Prime rib, confetti pasta, a festive cheese 
	platter, my potato, and two desserts. Two.

	JACK
	You never eat your potato. Besides, we're not 
	paying for it. What do you care?

	FRANK
	You think they'd don't keep track of these things?

Frank spots Eddie, up ahead, sniffing a topiary animal.

	FRANK
	Oh, that's very attractive. Your dog just went to
	the bathroom on an elephant.

	JACK
	I think it's a unicorn.

	FRANK
	And she has no business talking about my head.

	JACK
	Frank. Relax, will ya. You know what happens
	when you get tense on the road.

Frank gives Jack a look.

	JACK
	Howard Johnson? Four years ago.

	FRANK
	I do not sleepwalk.

	JACK
	Frank. I found you down in the lobby at 3 A.M.
	sitting by the Christmas tree in your pajamas.

	FRANK
	I went down for a pack of Chiclets, I saw the tree,
	I sat down for a few minutes. That is not 
	sleepwalking.

	JACK
	Then how come you leave the bathroom light on? 
	
Frank, a little thrown, stops.

	FRANK
	I leave the light on in case either of us has to 
	get up in the middle of the night.

	JACK
	(walking on)
	Mm hm.

	FRANK
	You want me to leave it off tonight? Fine, I'll
	leave it off...

64	INT. JACK AND FRANK’S ROOM - NIGHT

Pitch dark, except for a tiny sliver of light coming from 
the bathroom. Suddenly, the BLARE of BIG BAND 
MUSIC is heard coming from Susie’s side of the suite.

A bedside lamp flicks on. Frank.

	FRANK
	What the hell is this?

Jack squints awake. Eddie, in the chair by the window, 
looks up groggily.

	FRANK
	Do you hear this? Do you?

	JACK
	I do now.

Frank, wearing boxers, gets out of bed.

	FRANK
	This is great. Before we play a single note, we’re
	gonna get thrown out.

Jack sits up, takes a cigarette.

	JACK
	So she’s playing a little music.

	FRANK
	A little music! She’s got the Harry James 
	Orchestra in there.

	JACK
	Ellington.

Frank yells through the bathroom.

	FRANK
	Hey!

	JACK
	Frank.

	FRANK
	What?

	JACK
	You look a little tense.

	FRANK
	Of course I’m a little tense. It’s two o’clock in the
	morning. She’s gonna wake up everyone in the
	 hotel.

Suddenly there’s a KNOCK on the door.

	FRANK
	See? See?

As Frank opens the door, a hulking FIGURE is there.

	HULK
	Massage?

	SUSIE’S VOICE
	Down here, gorgeous.

Susie is leaning out her door, “Perdido” is BLASTING 
into the hallway. She eyes Frank’s boxers.

	SUSIE
	Funny, I would have figured you for jockeys,
	Frank.

69 	INT. FRANK AND JACK'S ROOM - MORNING 
(SAME TIME) 

Jack, rubbing a bad night's sleep out of his eyes, glances
over at Frank's bed. Eddie is lying there, lost in deep 
slumber. A light SNORING is heard and Jack looks 
down between the beds. 

Frank. Blissfully asleep. 


70 	INT. "KING'S MANOR" DINING ROOM - DAY 

Darkness. Quickly, one chandelier after another burns on,
illuminating a grand dining room. At the far end sit two 
dazzling Steinways. 

	SUSIE
	Holy shit. 

The trio, standing by a panel of light switches, stares up 
at the chandeliers. 

	SUSIE
	You know, it's the least dusted lighting fixture in 
	the world. Fulla spiders. That's a fact. 

Jack and Frank don't quite know how to respond to this. 

	SUSIE
	Guy I met on an escort gig sold 'em. 

As Jack and Frank nod, Susie looks at the stage. 

	SUSIE
	Hey, turn 'em off. 

Susie dashes to the other end of the room, to the stage. 

	SUSIE
	Come on. Kill 'em. 

	FRANK
	(doing it)
	Do you mind telling us exactly what it is we're 
	doing? 

	SUSIE
	(out of the darkness)
	When I say go, you hit the lights. Okay? Okay? 

	FRANK
	(sarcastically)
	Sure. Why not? 

	SUSIE
	Okay... Go! 

As Frank hits the switches, the chandeliers trip on, 
sending a rolling wave of light towards the stage. 

	SUSIE
	Ladies and gentlemen! The Sensational Susie 
	Diamond! 

As the stage bursts to life, Susie is revealed, head thrown
back, arms outstretched. Lena Horne couldn't do it better. 

Finally, Susie breaks her pose. Jack and Frank are
staring at her. 

	SUSIE
	Oh. And The Fabulous Baker Boys... 

As Jack and Frank look at each other, MUSIC begins, and
 we -- 


CUT TO: 


71	INT. “KING’S MANOR” DINING ROOM

A sea of elegantly-dressed couples dancing cheek to
cheek on the dance floor, while others sit at candlelit 
tables, sipping wine. As the stage drifts INTO VIEW, 
Susie steps forwards and begins to croon, “The Look Of 
Love,” while Jack and Frank underscore her voice with 
lush phrasings. The atmosphere is dreamlike, hypnotic.

Almost too good to be true.


72	EXT. FRANK AND JACK’S TERRACE - NIGHT
(LATER)

The trio is on the terrace, surrounded by champagne
buckets and caviar, radio purring SOFT MUSIC. Frank’s
hair looks a little wild, as if someone has been rubbing 
his head.

	FRANK
	(euphoric; smashed)
	Why kid ourselves? It’s time to set new goals.
	Cruise ships... it’s ours if we want it.

	SUSIE
	Fulla rats. I guy I escorted gave me the lowdown.

	FRANK
	(undeterred)
	After that... Europe.		

	SUSIE
	Europe?

	FRANK
	Music’s the international language.

	SUSIE
	I thought love was.

	FRANK
	Mark my words. From this night forward, our 
	lives will never be the same.

	SUSIE
	Tell you what, Frank. You get more pop out of 
	two glasses of champagne that anyone I know.

	FRANK
	This is a long way from Hula Girl Hideaway,
	huh, Jack? Remember? Banana trees in the lobby.

	JACK
	Takahama’s Tahitian.

	FRANK
	Takahama’s? We play there. I thought we just 
	stopped for teriyaki.

	JACK
	Three nights.

	FRANK
	(to Susie)
	It’s amazing. He can remember every place we 
	ever played. The day, the month, the year, how 
	many shows -- you name it. When was 
	Takahama’s, Jack?

	JACK
	August. ‘74.

	FRANK
	See? He’s brilliant. Really. Brilliant. Hey, Jack.

	JACK
	Hm.

	FRANK
	You’re brilliant.

	JACK
	Thanks.

	FRANK
	(to Susie)
	Same with music. You should’ve seen him when 
	we were kids. No one could ride the keys like 
	Jack. Miss Simpson would play something once
	and that was it -- he had it.

Susie, intrigued by this, studies Jack.

	SUSIE
	Really?

	FRANK
	I never won a single blue ribbon until the day 
	Jack showed up drunk at Spring Recital and 
	played “Moon Over Cuba” instead of “Clare de 
	Lune.” 

Susie glances at Jack.

	JACK
	The mood just hit me.

	FRANK
	Hey... “Moonglow.”

Frank turns up the VOLUME of the radio and looks at 
Jack with a smile. Jack shoots him a warning glance.

	SUSIE
	“Moonglow”...?

	FRANK
	High school formal. I didn’t know how to dance.
	Jack did the boxstep with me for a week.

	JACK
	It wasn’t a week, it was an afternoon.

	SUSIE
	You two are closer than I thought.

	JACK
	He paid me.

	FRANK
	Worth every penny. It was my first big social 
	with Donna. We fell in love on the dance floor.
	 I have a beautiful wife, two beautiful children... 
	all because of my brother.

	JACK
	I think you’re overestimating the boxstep.

Suddenly Frank slips into Susie’s arms and begins to 
dance with her, humming to the radio. Susie laughs, then 
goes with him. Jack takes a sip of champagne, watching.

	FRANK
	It was just like this on our honeymoon. The moon, 
	the stars... Remember, Jack?

	JACK
	I wasn’t there.

	FRANK
	Oh, right. My first solo gig. God, she was
	gorgeous. Couldn’t believe she was mine. How
	come I got so lucky, Jack?

	JACK
	You’re a lucky guy.

	FRANK
	I am. I am a lucky guy. She could’ve married 
	anyone, but she chose me...
	(to Susie)
	You know I’ve never kissed my wife on New 
	Year’s Eve. Not once. Always onstage 
	somewhere.

This seems to make Frank a little melancholy and he 
almost stops dancing. Finally, he pulls away.

	FRANK
	I think I’m drunk. You two dance. I gonna go 
	sit with the wallflowers.

As Frank turns Susie toward Jack, they glance at each 
other awkwardly.

	SUSIE
	I don’t know. I’m not used to leading.
	
	FRANK		
	Come on, Jack. Give the girl a glide.

	SUSIE
	I think maybe your little brother prefers to dance 
	alone.

Susie smiles slightly, offers Jack a cigarette.			

	JACK
	No thanks. I never touch French cigarettes.

Susie’s drunk enough that this tickles her a bit. Jack steps 
forward and takes her hand and they begin to move.

	SUSIE
	Your brother’s a pretty good dancer.

	FRANK
	Big heartbreaker. Never had to say a word. 
	Couple turns on the dance floor and that was it.

	SUSIE
	(amused)
	REALLY.

	FRANK
	(tapping his knees)
	Got ‘em right in the knees. They practically had 
	to carry the girls off the floor.

	SUSIE
	How thrilling.

	JACK
	Frank, why don’t you have another drink?

	FRANK
	I’m sleepy.

	JACK
	Why don’t you go to sleep then.

	FRANK
	All right.

Frank grabs a bottle and disappears into the bedroom.

	SUSIE
	Looks like I lost my chaperone.

	JACK
	I think you’re safe.

Jack presses in closer, moving smoothly to the music.

	SUSIE
	So, where do you keep all your blue ribbons,
	Baker?

	JACK
	Frank keeps them.

Jack slides his hand  a little lower on Susie’s back.

	SUSIE
	Nice night, huh?

	JACK
	Hm-hm.

Susie swallows, melting into the rhythm of Jack’s 
movements, into his body, drifting to the purr of the 
MUSIC, swirling under the stars. Suddenly, she dips in 
a little quivering motion and Jack catches her.

	JACK
	Careful.

Susie looks a little shocked by her body’s betrayal. She 
separates from Jack and takes a step back.

	SUSIE
	I... I think I’ve had too much to drink. Champagne 
	goes right to my... head.

	JACK
	Maybe we should call it a night.

Susie nods. A smile flickers on Jack’s lips, then he turns 
away. Susie looks down.

At her knees.


73	INT. FRANK AND JACK’S ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Seemingly empty, both beds unmade and unoccupied, a 
champagne bottle on the carpet, a tuxedo jacket hanging 
cockeyed on the closet floor, and Frank... fast asleep in 
the chair by the window.


74	INT. “KING’S MANOR” LOBBY - MORNING (EARLY)

As Susie steps out of the elevator, THEO, the clerk at the 
front desk, motions to her.

	THEO
	Oh, Miss Diamond. These just arrived for you.

A dozen red roses are sitting on the desk.

	THEO
	Looks like you’ve got an admirer.

	SUSIE
	There’s no card.

	THEO
	The gentleman who left them said he would be in
	contact with you. I can have someone put them in 
	water if you like.

	SUSIE
	Nah, that’s all right.

Susie takes the roses and turns back to the elevators. As 
the doors open, Eddie trots out, heading off across the 
lobby. Susie watches him go by, then we...

	CUT TO:


75	INT. “KING’S MANOR” CORRIDOR - EDDIE - 
MORNING

A moment later, coming toward us down a corridor off the
lobby. As he passes out of sight, Susie appears at the 
opposite end.

SUSIE’S POV		 	

as Eddie disappears into the grand dining room. Curious, 
she follows. As she draws closer, the SOUND of a piano 
becomes clear. Peering inside, she finds Jack playing 
alone at one of the grands onstage.


76	INT. “KING’S MANOR” DINING ROOM - MORNING

In the vast emptiness of the room, the piano resonates 
powerfully and the music Jack makes is like nothing 
we’ve heard him play before. Fluid and unpredictable, it 
is played with the focused abandon of a jazz hand. Susie 
watches, transfixed.

As he finishes, Jack notices Susie, but says nothing, 
instead pouring himself another glass of whiskey and 
starting to play again.

	SUSIE
	Working overtime?

	JACK
	I like the crowd.

Susie smiles slightly.

	JACK
	(the roses)
	Win a pageant?

	SUSIE
	First runner-up. Story of my life.

Jack doesn’t react, just keeps playing. Susie drops the 
flowers onto a table and walks over to the piano.

	SUSIE
	What’s this? You’re playing?

	JACK
	(shrugging)
	Just thinking out loud.

	SUSIE
	Nice.

	JACK
	Hm?

Susie watches Jack’s hand glide deftly over the keys, 
then looks at his face. He is oblivious to all but the sounds
he is making.

	SUSIE
	(quietly)
	Nice.


77 	INT. "KING'S MANOR" LOBBY - MORNING 

Frank steps out of the elevator, looking like a man with 
the worst hangover in history. 

	THEO
	(cheery)
	Good morning, Mr. Baker 

	FRANK
	(grim)
	Hi, Theo. 

	THEO
	Your wife's called again. 

	FRANK
	Yeah, what is it now? 

	THEO
	(reading a note)
	Little Frank refuses to ride his new bike unless the
	training wheels are removed, he's locked himself 
	in the bathroom, and he has Cindy with him. He's 
	says he'll only talk to you.		(pointing)
	You can use the courtesy phone around the 
	corner if you like. 

Frank nods wearily. He goes to the phone, begins to dial,
then hears the SOUND of Jack's piano. Hanging up the 
phone, he wanders down to the dining room and looks 
inside. 


78	INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING

Susie is leaning over the piano, smoking a cigarette, a 
shoe dangling from her toe as she watches Jack play. 
There is something intimate in her posture.

There is something about it Frank doesn’t like.


79	INT. “KING’S MANOR” BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

As Jack smokes calmly, Frank paces tensely. He takes a 
few steps, glances at Jack, then resumes pacing, stops, 
looks at Jack again. 	

	FRANK
	You know I think it’s been five years since I saw 
	you without a cigarette in your mouth. Five years.

Jack, a cigarette dangling from his lip, just stares at Frank.

	FRANK
	The whole goddamn room upstairs smells like an
	ashtray. You know that, don’t you? The sheets, the 
	carpet, the drapes, the towels, my tux, my shirt. 
	Do you want to smell my shirt? Do you?

	JACK
	Maybe later.

	FRANK
	I’m not kidding about this. Do you have any idea 
	what an insidious habit that is? I mean, how many 
	cigarettes do you smoke in one day? It must be 
	hundreds.

	JACK
	This is just a wild stab, but... is something 
	bothering you, Frank?

	FRANK
	Leave her alone. I mean it.
	
Jack looks at Frank, puzzled.

	FRANK
	Jack. This isn’t some hatcheck girl you can leave 
	behind at the Sheraton. You got two shows a 
	night with her.

As Jack realises what Frank means, his eyes harden.

	JACK
	You don’t know what you’re talking about.

	FRANK
	I know trouble. And its name starts with an “S.”

	JACK
	Do me a favour, Frank. Relax.

	FRANK
	Do me a favour, little brother. Stick to cocktail 
	waitresses.


80	INT. “KING’S MANOR” DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Moments later, onstage. Frank is addressing the audience.

	FRANK
	You know, meeting here each night as we do, 
	sharing these few moments, I feel as if we’re 
	becoming one big happy family.
	
Jack, still burning from Frank’s comments backstage, 
eyes Frank coolly.

	FRANK
	The candlelight. The music. You. Everyone of you. 
	Just being yourselves. People being people. What’s
	all this mean? I don’t know. Who’s to say? All I 
	can tell you is, it makes it very special for us up 
	here to have you out there. Right, Susie?

	SUSIE
	Right, Frank.

	FRANK
	Right, Jack?

	JACK
	Right. But if I could, I’d just like to add one thing... 
	I love you, Frank.

	FRANK
	(stunned)
	What?

	JACK
	I love you. I just wanted to say it.

Frank stares incredulously at Jack. Suddenly the audience 
breaks into APPLAUSE.

	FRANK
	Uh, well, thanks for sharing that with us, Jack.
	(moving quickly)
	So. Susie. How ‘bout it?

	SUSIE
	Huh?

	FRANK
	Got another song for us?

	SUSIE
	Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them.

	FRANK
	Well then... shall we?

As Frank stares over at Jack, Jack lights a cigarette and 
exhales a long plume of smoke.


81	INT. FRANK AND JACK’S ROOM - NIGHT (AFTER 
THE SHOW)

Eddie watches Jack and Frank undress in heavy silence. 
Susie, washing up, listens from the bathroom.

	FRANK
	You came in late on “Little Green Apples.”

	JACK
	(pointedly)
	I’m sorry?

	FRANK
	You heard me.

	JACK
	You came in early, Frank. You’ve been coming in 
	early for the last decade.

	FRANK
	I never miss the beat.

Jack lets out a derisive chuckle.

	FRANK
	I NEVER MISS THE BEAT.

	JACK
	That’s because you make it up as you go along.

Frank stops undressing, stares at Jack.

	FRANK
	Take it back.

	JACK
	Take it back? What is this? Third grade?

	FRANK
	TAKE IT BACK.

Jack frowns at his brother, then tosses him a kiwi.

	JACK
	Eat a kiwi, Frank.

Frank flings the kiwi back at Jack. Jack ducks.

	JACK
	Hey!


81A	INT. BATHROOM (SAME TIME)

Susie peeks through the door. Jack is standing in his 
boxers, a pineapple in his hand, pointing at Frank.

	JACK
	Go to bed, Frank. Or this is gonna get ugly.

	SUSIE
	(to herself)
	It’s the fucking Newlywed Game.

Shaking her head, Susie exits, flicking off the light.

	FRANK (O.S.)
	Hey!

	SUSIE
	(flicking it back on)
	Sorry.


82	INT. JACK AND FRANK’S ROOM - MORNING

We START on the kiwi, lying in a battered lump on the 
windowsill, PASS OVER a pack of cigarettes on the 
night table, then SETTLE on Frank... nestled under Jack’s
shoulder, dead to the world.

Jack blinks awake. Slowly his eyes slide over...


83	INT. SUSIE’S ROOM - MORNING (SAME TIME)

As Susie strokes her hair before the mirror, the phone 
RINGS.

	SUSIE
	Yeah?... No, Mr. Baker’s next door... Huh?... 
	Urgent?... No, never mind, I’ll get him.

Susie passes through the bathroom, opens the door.

	SUSIE
	Phone call, Frank. They say it’s... important.

Susie stops, seeing Jack, smoking now, with Frank still 
slumbering under his shoulder. It’s a rather striking 
tableau.

	SUSIE
	Guess you guys made up, huh?


84	OMITTED


85	INT. FRANK AND JACK’S ROOM - A SUITCASE 
- DAY (LATER)

Frank moves like a twister through the room, tossing his 
belongings in a suitcase.

	FRANK
	We made a deal. Man to man. Training wheels for 
	a month, then we’d see.

	SUSIE
	He ran into a car?

	FRANK
	Mrs. Ramondino’s station wagon. It wasn’t moving.
	It was just parked on the street. He barely made it 
	out of the driveway. All right, who’s got a pencil?

	SUSIE
	Pencil?

	FRANK
	I want you to take down the New Year’s show.
	Remember, at ten o’clock you start with “Thanks 
	For The Memories,” then...

	JACK
	I know the show, Frank.

	FRANK
	I just think it’s best if...

	JACK
	Frank. Go.

Frank gives in, grabs the suitcase, then pauses by the door.

	FRANK
	Guess I’m gonna get to kiss my wife on New 
	Year’s after all.	


86	INT. JACK’S ROOM - DAY (SEVERAL HOURS 
LATER)

Jack has lined a row of kiwis on the windowsill and is 
shooting rubber bands at them.


87	INT. SUSIE’S ROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)

Susie is smoking a cigarette, staring out the window. She 
glances at the bathroom once, twice, then takes the 
newspaper and passes through.


88	INT. JACK’S ROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)

	SUSIE
	Any word from Egghead?

Jack shakes his head. Susie nods, offers the paper.

	SUSIE
	I’m through with it.

	JACK
	Oh. Thanks.

	SUSIE
	Left the crossword.

This doesn’t seem to excite Jack, but he nods anyway.

	SUSIE
	Well. Happy reading.


89	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Susie retreats, frowns to herself, then notices Jack’s 
shaving cup. Curious, she takes the brush, runs the 
bristles over her cheek, then spins the cap off a bottle of 
aftershave, sniffs.


90	INT. JACK’S ROOM - DAY

Jack, up and pacing, pauses as he passes the bathroom, 
listening to the strange STIRRINGS inside.


91	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Susie inspects a few more items, then exits. Seconds 
later, the door opens tentatively and Jack enters. He eyes
his things, adjusts the shaving brush. He glances as the riot
of powders and creams crowding Susie’s sink. Picking up
a tiny perfume vial, he gives it a spray: it packs quite a 
wallop. Startled, he waves his hand to defuse the odor.


92	INT. SUSIE’S ROOM - DAY		

Outside, Susie pauses on her cigarette, sniffs the air.


93	INT. BATHROOM - DAY				

Jack replaces the bottle, accidentally causing a stir among 
a few other others, then exits. As Susie re-enters, a tiny 
nail polish bottle wobbles upright. She studies the bottle, 
sniffs again, then pokes her head into Jack’s room.


94	INT. JACK’S ROOM - DAY

	SUSIE
	Anything yet?

	JACK
	Not a peep.

	SUSIE
	Well. I think I’ll take a bath.

Jack nods. Susie nods.


95	INT. BATHROOM - DAY 

Susie pulls the door closed, frowns again, then turns on the 
bath. Taking a bottle of Mr. Bubble, she sits on the toilet 
and sprays pink lazy eights into the tub. 


96 	INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY 

Jack stops, pivots and sends a kiwi towards the 
waste-basket. SWISH. 


97 	INT. SUSIE'S ROOM - DAY 

Susie goes to the bedroom, strips, slips into a robe. 
There are cigarettes burning in every corner of the room. 
Oblivious, she lights another. 


98 	INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY 

Eddie ducks as a plum sails over his head. The carpet 
around the waste-basket is littered with fruit. Jack grabs 
a coconut, eyes the basket, then notices a crescent forming
on the carpet outside the bathroom. He raps on the door, 
gets nothing. 


99 	INT. BATHROOM - DAY 

Jack enters just as Mr. Bubble glides over the lip of the 
tub. 


100 	INT. SUSIE'S ROOM - DAY 


Susie, staring at the ocean like Garbo, hears the BOTTLE 
tumble, then sees the water. She dashes in. 


101 	INT. BATHROOM - DAY 

As the door pounds Jack, Susie does a little slip-slide-spin
on the sudsy floor and tumbles into Jack's arms. 

Not exactly "From Here To Eternity", but the room IS 
pretty steamy and Susie's robe has slipped off one very
nice shoulder. Jack looks at the shoulder, then into Susie's
eyes. Susie looks back. Swallows. 

	SUSIE
	Thanks. 

They stand like this, sort of like a statue, then the phone 
RINGS. They disengage. Jack goes to the phone. 

	JACK
	Yeah... Oh, hi, Frank.
	(to Susie)
	It's Frank. 

Susie nods, pulls her robe closed. 


	JACK
	So. How's little Frank?... Yeah?... Well, that's a 
	relief, huh?... No, I understand, call me when you 
	have more time... Huh? Oh, nothing. We're taking 
	a bath. Well, Susie's taking a bath, I'm doing the 
	crossword. Huh?... What's that?... Newt?... Yeah, 
	I know what it is. Turns up a lot, huh? okay, I'll 
	remember. Thanks. 'Bye... 


Jack hangs up the phone, looks at Susie. 

	JACK
	Kid's in the pink. 

Susie nods, tightens her robe again. 

	SUSIE
	Well. Thanks for the catch. Coulda got quite a 
	bump. 

	JACK
	It was nothing. 

Susie nods, pulls the door closed. 


102	 INT. "KING'S MANOR" BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 

Susie, wearing a very sexy black silk dress, joins Jack. 
She hands him a piece of paper. 

	SUSIE
	Theo at the front desk just dropped this on me. 

	JACK
	(reading aloud)
	"Ladies and gentlemen, due to a family emergency,
	my dear brother is unable to share this most 
	special of evenings with us..." 

	SUSIE
	Frank must've dictated it from the hospital. There's
	patter for all the songs, too. 

As Jack stares at the paper, Susie inspects her hair in the
reflection of a silver tea tray. 

	SUSIE
	Gotta give it to ol' Egghead. Never gives the kite
	too much string. 

As Susie turns back to Jack, he crumples the paper. 

	JACK
	So what do you want to open with tonight? 


103	INT. “KING’S MANOR” DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A banner stretched between two chandeliers, proclaims 
“HAPPY NEW YEAR!” As the CAMERA DESCENDS, 
Jack can be heard picking out a familiar TUNE, but 
showering it in blue notes, drawing it out, giving it 
smoke.

Susie’s face drifts up INTO FRAME, her eyes closed, 
but the CAMERA CONTINUES to drop, moving like 
syrup down her body, over the silk that clings to her hips 
and thighs, down her legs to a pair of wicked 
arch-breaking heels.

She’s standing on Jack’s Steinway.

	SUSIE
	(cooing)
	“Another bride,
	Another June,
	Another sunny honeymoon
	Another season
	Another reason
	To make whoopie...”

Caught somewhere between Ray Charles and Marilyn 
Monroe, Susie’s voice slides silkily from a whisper to a 
growl, her fingers running like sand over her body.

	SUSIE
	“A lot of shoes,
	A lot of rice,
	The groom is nervous,
	He answers twice,
	It’s really killin’,
	The boy’s so willin’,
	To make whoopie...”

As Jack knocks hell out of the bridge, Susie melts onto 
the piano like a kitten, stretching out languorously on her 
back. On the dance floor, men in tuxedos sneak guilty 
glances while their wives just stare, mouths agape. In less 
that a minute, Susie’s managed to turn a dignified resort 
hotel into a sizzling roadhouse.

	SUSIE
	“Picture a little lovenest
	Down where the roses cling
	Picture that same sweet lovenest
	See what a year can bring...
	(toying with Jack’s chin)
	I tell you the boy’s washing dishes,
	baby clothes
	He’s so ambitious,
	Ooooh, I tell you he sews”

Susie runs her fingers through Jack’s hair and slides 
oh-so-slowly off the piano, slinking toward the audience, 
and suddenly it’s apparent: she’s winning them over.

	SUSIE
	It’s really killin’
	The boy’s so willin’
	To make whoopee...”


104	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

Now a mass of swarming jubilation. Suddenly, the 
lights begin to dim.

	SUSIE
	All right, boys and girls. Find a friend. This is it. 
	Ten. Nine...

Gradually the entire room joins the chant.

	SUSIE/EVERYONE
	... Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. THREE. TWO! 
	ONE! HAPPY NEW YEAR!

A blizzard of confetti fills the air as people scramble for
that certain someone to kiss in the new year. In this 
moment, Jack and Susie find themselves oddly distanced 
from the happiness below them.

Susie glances at Jack, then finally goes to him. As their 
lips touch, they kiss lightly, then pull away awkwardly. 
As Susie turns away, Jack sounds the first chord of 
“Auld Lang Syne” and the room rises as one voice.

	SUSIE/EVERYONE
	“Should old acquaintance be forgot...”


105 	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

Dark and lonely now, the tables and floors covered with 
confetti, like virgin snow. Jack sits on a table, looking 
out at the moonlit ocean. Susie comes up behind him, 
carrying a half-empty bottle of champagne.

	SUSIE
	So. Make any resolutions?

Jack shakes his head. Susie sits down on the table next
to him, their arms almost touching.

	JACK
	You?

	SUSIE
	Nah. I figure that stuff’s all a bunch of crap 
	anyway. You do what you do, right?

	JACK
	Right.

Susie takes a drink, looks over at the empty stage.

	SUSIE
	Boy, ol’ Egghead would’ve blown a gasket if 
	he’d seen us tonight, wouldn’t he?

Jack just takes a drag on his cigarette, says nothing.

	SUSIE
	You’re good, aren’t you?

As Jack looks up, Susie’s eyes shift, staring straight 
into his.

	JACK
	I can carry a tune.

	SUSIE
	Better than that.

Jack just looks out the window again, takes another drag 
on his cigarette. Susie studies his face, then pushes off the
table, walks over to the window.

	SUSIE
	You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank. 
	At the Roosevelt.

	JACK
	Must’ve been a cheap date.
	
	SUSIE
	Soap convention.

Jack glances over at Susie.
	
	JACK
	Soap?

	SUSIE
	Yeah, they got a convention for everything. This 
	guy was some big roller in suds. At least he was 
	clean. Some of the guys I met through the service, 
	you wouldn’t believe. The older ones, they were 
	okay. Nice. Polite. Pulled the chair out for you. 
	But the younger ones...

Jack watches as Susie takes another hit off the bottle.

	SUSIE
	It wasn’t so bad, though. I’d get a nice piece of 
	steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift. Usually 
	whatever the guy was into. Got a set of socket 
	wrenches once. Believe it? The guy looked like 
	he’d just given me four dozen roses.

Susie smiles to herself, then her face changes, becomes 
almost wistful.

	SUSIE
	But I stayed at the Hartford once. You should see
	the rooms. All satin and velvet. And the bed. Royal
	blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow. Hard to 
	believe sleeping in a room like that don’t change 
	your life. But it don’t. The bed may be magic, but 
	the mirror isn’t. You wake up the same old Susie.
	(pause)
	I didn’t always, you know. If I liked the guy...

Susie glances at Jack, uncomfortable.

	JACK
	I never liked the Hartford much myself.

Susie’s eyes lock into Jack’s, then she turns a little and 
starts to roll her neck.

	SUSIE
	My neck is so tight. Usually singing relaxes me, 
	but I don’t know, tonight...

Jack watches her a moment, then stands up and sweeps
the hair off her shoulder, placing his hands on her neck, 
massaging the muscles softly. She swallows.

	SUSIE
	Thanks.

Jack hesitates, then unhooks the catch, letting the panels 
divide a bit.

	SUSIE
	Thanks.

As Jack’s fingers work down to Susie’s shoulders, the 
dress begins to divide slowly, the fabric pulling silently 
apart. Susie turns her head a little just as Jack’s fingers 
slip under the silk, skimming down her sides, just below 
her breasts. He leans in and kisses her neck.

	SUSIE
	Oh shit...		
		
	
106	OMITTED


107 	INT. "KING'S MANOR" CORRIDOR - MORNING 

As the service elevator opens, two maid exit left, then 
Eddie trots out and turns right. 

We TRACK him for a moment, then he stops: by a room 
service tray sitting outside a door. He sniffs finds nothing 
to his taste, then moves down the hall to the next tray. 

Finally, after several stops, Eddie returns to the elevator 
and waits... three T-bones in his mouth. 


108	INT. SUSIE’S ROOM - MORNING

Jack, quiet as a mouse, slips out of bed, gathers his 
clothes, and in approximately ten seconds, is dressed.

	SUSIE
	You’d make a helluva fireman, you know that?

Jack stops, looks over his shoulder.

	SUSIE
	You practice that at home with a stopwatch?

	JACK
	Didn’t want to wake you. Early riser.

Susie glances out the window. It’s gotta be about noon.

	SUSIE
	Yeah. Listen. I didn’t expect you to rush out and 
	buy me a corsage this morning, you know. Your 
	school ring’s safe.

Jack nods, slips into the bathroom.

	
109 	INT. BATHROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)

As he closes the door, Jack looks in the mirror.

	JACK
	Shit.


110	INT. SUSIE’S ROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)

Susie stares at the bathroom door, then notices Jack’s tie 
slung over the bedpost.

	SUSIE
	Shit.


111 INT. "KING'S MANOR" LOBBY - DAY 

As Jack stands at the front desk, members of the hotel 
staff pose for photographs with Eddie. 

	JACK
	I don't get it. 

	THEO
	What's that, Mr Baker? 

	JACK
	Ed. He barely touched a thing while he was here, 
	but I don't know... I could swear he's GAINED 
	weight. 

Theo points his finger to a line on the checkout form. 

	THEO
	(as Jack signs)
	Well, we're sure going to miss him. All of you. 
	It's too bad your brother missed all the excitement 
	last night. 

Jack glances up. 

	JACK
	Yeah. Too bad. You seen Miss Diamond? 

	THEO
	I believe that's her talking to the gentleman in the 
	blue suit. 

Across the lobby, Jack sees Susie talking to a man in the 
far corner.

	THEO
	Have a nice day, Mr. Baker. 

	JACK
	Yeah, you too... 


112	EXT. THE CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT

Home.


113	INT. JACK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Jack and Eddie enter, Jack sets his suitcase on the 
floor and flicks on a lamp. A string, hanging like a smile 
from one side of the bedroom door frame to the other, 
droops with paper letters: “WELCOME HOME.”

In the kitchen, Jack opens the refrigerator. A container 
of cottage cheese. Two desperate bananas. One beer. 
Opting for the beer, he goes to the piano by the window, 
sits down.

He taps out a skeleton phrase, teases it, then, like the 
morning Susie found him in the dining room, begins to 
expand on the idea, filling the room with music.


113A	EXT. DINER - DAY

In the front window, the usual photos of celebrity patrons,
 including one of Susie placed between those of Jack and 
Frank.


114	INT. DINER - DAY (SAME)

Susie and the brothers sit at a table strews with empty 
coffee cups and half-eaten food. Frank has several slips 
of paper before him with names and dates.

	FRANK
	That takes care of the week of the fifth. After that, 
	we got the Avedon downtown or the Plaza. Four 
	day turns. What do you think, Jack?

Jack is staring out the window. Bored.

	JACK
	You with me, Jack?

	SUSIE
	The Avedon’s a dump. No cover. No minimum. 
	And they water their drinks. It’s strictly for the 
	Fuller Brush crowd.

Susie, as she says this, pours sugar into her Coke.

	FRANK
	(watching)		
	It’s not that bad. Besides, Blackie Carson books 
	the Avedon. He’s always been good to us.

	JACK
	(drily)											He’s hasn’t been that good to us.

	FRANK
	All right, we’ll take the Plaza. After that, we’re 
	locked into the Capri for five days, then we got 
	our choice...

	SUSIE
	The Capri? Oh Christ, not the goddamn Luau 
	Lounge again.

	FRANK
	What’s the matter with the Luau Lounge? They 
	don’t salt their peanuts?

	SUSIE
	Singing “Feelings” knee deep in paper orchids 
	and plastic tiki lamps isn’t exactly my idea of a 
	fun evening.

	FRANK
	Fun? Who promised you fun? We get paid, 
	remember?

	SUSIE
	I’m just saying maybe we should vote on it. Or 
	maybe... we should ask Jack what he thinks.

	FRANK
	I don’t have to ask Jack what he thinks. I know 
	what he thinks.

Jack, hearing this. shifts his eyes coolly to Frank.

	FRANK
	It’s five days. The money’s green. We’re there.

Susie, looking tense, watches Frank go back to his slips.
Jack taps an unlit cigarette on the table.	

	FRANK
	And by the way, speaking of  “Feelings,” you 
	might think about brushing up on the lyrics. The 
	other night, at the resort, you sang the first verse 
	twice.

	SUSIE
	Really? That must explain the gasp I heard from 
	the audience.

	FRANK
	Okay. Let’s hear it. We’ve trashed the Avedon and 
	the Luau Lounge. What’s our beef with 
	“Feelings”?

	SUSIE
	Nothing.

Frank nods, starts to go back to the slips.

	SUSIE
	EXCEPT... who cares? I mean, does anybody 
	really need to hear “Feelings” again in their 
	lifetime? It’s like parsley...
	(taking a sprig from her plate)
	Take it away and no one would know the 
	difference.

	FRANK
	“Feelings” is not parsley.

	SUSIE
	To you, “Feelings” may be goddamn filet mignon. 
	To me, it’s parsley. Less that parsley.

Jack, mildly amused, settles against the window to listen.

	FRANK
	Look, “Feelings,” despite what you may think of 
	it, has always been one of the bright moments in 
	the show and a consistent crowd pleaser. 
	Consequently, we have an obligation to play it. If 
	we didn’t the audience would be disappointed.

	SUSIE
	Yeah, well, they weren’t exactly crying their eyes 
	out on New Year’s.

Frank stops shuffling the slips, looks up slowly.

	FRANK
	You passed over “Feelings”?

  	SUSIE
	Yeah. And for your information, “Bali Hai” went 
	out with the bathwater too.

Frank looks from Susie to Jack.

	FRANK
	Well, I see. The cat goes away for a night and the 
	mice take over the orchestra.

	SUSIE
	Hey. I ain’t no mouse.

	FRANK
	That’s right. You’re parsley.

Big silence.

	JACK
	I think you better calm down, Frank.

	FRANK
	I think you better make sure it’s your head that’s 
	doing the thinking these days, little brother.

Susie stands up, takes her coat.

	SUSIE
	This food’s been sitting here too long. It’s starting 
	to make me feel SICK.

Susie turns and slams out the door.

	JACK
	Why don’t you loosen the leash.

	FRANK
	Let’s not let a whiff of perfume blow off fifteen 
	years. Be reasonable, Jack.

	JACK
	I play three hundred nights a years with you, 
	Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me 
	to be?


115 	EXT. JACK’S BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

Susie paces under a street lamp, working on a Paris Opal. 
She takes a glance up at Jack’s window, then drops her 
cigarette to the sidewalk. There are half-a-dozen others 
already there. Deciding, she enters the building.


115A	INT. JACK’S BUILDING - STAIRWELL

Susie arrives at Jack’s door, knocks. A moment passes, 
then it swings open.

Nina.	


116	OMITTED

118	EXT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT (LATER)

The murmur of MUSIC can be heard.	


119	INT. BASEMENT - JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

Jack sits at the bar, sipping a whiskey gingerly, watching 
a trio perform on the dimly-lit stage. A BLACK MAN in 
a suit steps up next to him.

	JACK
	(watching the trio)
	How you doing, Henry?

	HENRY
	Can’t complain. What do you think of the kid?

Jack glances at the baby-faced pianist onstage.

	JACK
	When’s his mother pick him up?

	HENRY
	He’s been playing here a year. You oughta come 
	around more often, Jack.

	JACK
	He’s good. That Tyler on drums?

	HENRY
	(nodding)
	Some old man, huh? Guy’d fall down a fucking 
	staircase and keep the beat.

As the bartender passes, Henry motions to Jack’s drink.

	HENRY
	On the house, Tony.
	(to Jack)
	So how about Jack Baker? Still stompin’ at the 
	Sheraton?

	JACK
	Keeps me out of trouble.

	HENRY	
	So what’re you doing here?

Jack crushes out his cigarette.

	JACK
	Lookin’ for trouble.


120	EXT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT (LATER)

Susie arrives, glances around. She hesitates, then 
pushes through the doors to the club.


121	INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

As Susie descends the cement stairs inside, a man with a 
saxophone rushes past her, heading for the street. Patrons 
linger in the corridor, drinks in hand, talking animatedly, 
laughing.

The main room is even darker, full of shadows smoking 
cigarettes. Susie looks for Jack, doesn’t see him, then 
settles by the bar.

	SUSIE
	Double vodka.

Across the room, the men’s room opens and two black 
men exit, but no one else. Scanning the tables again, Susie 
sees only the same unfamiliar shadows.

Then she hears the PIANO.

Turning slowly, Susie discovers Jack, hunched over the 
piano onstage, playing with the trio. At first, he toys with 
the melody, finding his way, then seduces the song away 
from itself entirely. Lost in concentration, he plays more 
expressively, ending with a passionate cascade of notes 
as he reconstructs the melody. As the audience 
APPLAUDS, Susie settles back into the shadows of the 
bar. Hidden, studies Jack.

His face is calm. Peaceful.


122	INT. STAIRWELL - JACK’S BUILDING - NIGHT 
(LATER)

Jacks trots up the stairs to his apartment, then stops 
suddenly. Susie is sitting on the landing, one shoe off, 
massaging her bare foot.

	SUSIE
	Oh. Hi.
	(uncomfortable)
	I was in the neighbourhood. Thought I’d drop by.

Jack nods, eyes her foot.

	SUSIE
	(shrugs)
	Big feet.

Jack says nothing, starts up the stairs.

	SUSIE
	Look, don’t get nervous or anything. I just came 
	over to...

Susie’s voice falters as Jack hooks her stray shoe on his 
finger and continues toward his apartment.

	SUSIE
	...talk.

Jack doesn’t want to talk.


123	EXT. JACK’S BUILDING - MORNING
	
As the sun comes up.


124 	INT. JACK’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Naked, Susie slips quietly out of bed, gathers her clothes, 
dresses. Twelve seconds, tops. Only one problem: only 
one shoe.

Limping to the bathroom, Susie catches herself in the 
mirror, grimaces, then hobbles to the front room...

...Just as Nina pushes open the window and enters from 
the fire escape. Both stop cold, stare at each other.

	NINA
	I guess you found him, huh?

	SUSIE
	Yeah...

	NINA
	I came to walk Eddie.

Susie nods. Nina eyes Susie’s footwear situation, then 
slips off the windowsill and goes to the kitchen, where 
Eddie’s leash is hanging on the wall.

	NINA
	You don’t have a toothbrush with you, do you?

Susie, puzzled, shakes her head. Nina nods, then points 
behind Susie. There, on the bookshelf, is her shoe.

	SUSIE
	Oh... thanks.

As Nina exits with Eddie, Susie stares at the door, a little 
confused, then goes to retrieve her shoe. There, sitting on 
the shelf, is an old photograph of Jack and Frank. Wearing 
boyish grins and bad suits, they hold a bottle of liquor out 
for the camera.

	JACK
	Terry’s Tap Room.

Susie jumps, surprised to see Jack, dressed now. He 
smiles, nods to the photo.

	JACK
	First gig we ever played. The guy that ran the 
	place gave us the bottle but wouldn’t open in.

	SUSIE
	How come?

	JACK
	(charming)
	Told us to save it. Said someday it would soften 
	the edges of the bad times and make the good ones 
	seem even better. The best idea would’ve been to 
	drink it before we played Terry’s Taproom.

Jack watches Susie study the photo.

	JACK
	Coffee?

	SUSIE
	Yeah... no. I mean...

	JACK
	Look, if you want to leave...

	SUSIE
	No... yeah. That is...

	JACK
	I’ll see you tonight at the Hilton. Okay?

Susie nods, but doesn’t move.

	SUSIE
	Listen. The reason I came by last night... I’m 
	thinking about leaving. The act.

Susie looks at Jack, but he says nothing.

	SUSIE
	It’s a... I met this guy over New Year’s, at the 
	hotel. He liked my voice. And, well, it’s... He 
	thinks I can sell cat food just singing about it. 
	Crazy, huh?

Susie tries to laugh. Jack nods.

	SUSIE
	I mean, it’s nothing big. Mostly local stuff 
	probably.

	JACK
	Take it.

	SUSIE
	Well, I haven’t decided. I’m just thinking about it...

	JACK
	Take it.

Susie stops, studies Jack’s face.

	SUSIE
	So how long you been taking care of the kid 
	upstairs?

	JACK
	I don’t take care of her.

	SUSIE
	Doesn’t look that way to me...

	JACK
	What’s the difference?

	SUSIE
	(beat)
	Yeah, well, anyway, like I said, I know Frank’s 
	got us booked through March.

	JACK
	Don’t worry about Frank.

	SUSIE
	What about you?

	JACK
	What’s that got to do with anything?

	SUSIE
	Well... nothing. I just mean, I don’t want to leave 
	you guys with an empty mike...

	JACK
	Hey. There’s always another girl.

Susie looks at Jack. His face is unflinching.

	SUSIE
	(grabbing her coat)
	Right. Well... Thanks for the advice. I’ll think it 
	over.

As the door slams behind Susie, Jack’s face changes, 
resolve giving in to ambivalence.


125	INT. HILTON OLD AMERICA LOUNGE - NIGHT 
(AS IN SC. 38)

As Susie croons, waiters pass by.

	SUSIE
	“Feelings... Wo wo wo... Feelings...”


126 	INT. HILTON BACKSTAGE - NIGHT (AFTER THE 
SHOW) 

Susie whips on her coat tensely. 

	SUSIE
	I can't sing it anymore. 

	FRANK
	What? 

	SUSIE
	That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get 
	sick. 


127 	INT. HILTON KITCHEN - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 

Frank follows Susie into the kitchen, where a KID in an 
apron is chopping onions. 

	FRANK
	(patiently)
	Look, Susie. We talked about this. I told you why 
	we... 

	SUSIE
	(stopping)
	I'm going to throw up Frank. Do you understand? 
	I'm going to vomit right into somebody's Pina 
	Colada. 

	FRANK
	It's just a song. It's a couple times a night. Ten 
	minutes of your life. That's all. 

	SUSIE
	And ten minutes tomorrow night, and ten minutes 
	the next night, and the next night. Frank, I can't 
	sing that fucking song anymore! 

As Susie storms out of the kitchen, the Kid in the apron 
looks over. 

	APRON
	Volare? 


128	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HILTON - NIGHT

Susie comes up alongside Jack.

	SUSIE
	I’m quitting.

	JACK
	Congratulations.

	SUSIE
	As of now.

	JACK
	Well, if you ever need a recommendation, let me 
	know.

	SUSIE	
	Jesus, you’re cold, you know that? You’re like a 
	fucking razor blade.

	JACK
	Careful. You’ll have me thinking you’re going soft 
	on me.

Susie stops, looks at him in amazement.

	SUSIE
	You don’t give a fuck, do you? About anything.

Jack stops, turns.

	JACK
	Hey. What do you want from me? You want me to 
	tell you to stay? Is that what you’re looking for? 
	You want me to get down on my knees and beg 
	you to deliver the Baker Boys from doom? Well, 
	forget it. We survived for fifteen years before you 
	strutted onto the scene, sweetheart. FIFTEEN 
	YEARS. Two seconds and you’re bawling like a 
	two year old. You shouldn’t be wearing a dress. 
	You should be wearing a diaper.

	SUSIE
	Jesus. You and Egghead ARE brothers, aren’t you?

	JACK
	Damn straight. And let me tell you something. 
	Over the years they’ve dropped like flies in every 
	fucking hotel in this city, but we’re still here. 
	We’ve never held a day job in our lives. He may 
	be an easy target, but add it up and you’ll see; 
	Frank’s done fine.

	SUSIE
	Yeah. Frank’s done great. He’s got the wife, the 
	kids, the little house in the suburbs. Meanwhile his 
	brother’s sitting in a shitty apartment with a sick 
	dog, Little Orphan Annie, and a chip on his 
	shoulder as big as a Cadillac.

	JACK
	(tensely)
	Listen to me, princess. We fucked twice. That’s it. 
	Once the sweat dries, you still don’t know shit 
	about me. Got it?

	SUSIE
	I know one thing. While Frank Baker was home 
	putting the kids to sleep last night, little brother 
	Jack was out dusting off his dreams for a few 
	minutes.

Jack just stares at her.

	SUSIE
	I was there. I saw it in your face. You’re full of 
	shit. You’re a fake. Every time you walk into 
	some shitty daiquiri hut, you’re selling yourself 
	on the cheap. I know all about that. I used to find 
	myself at the end of the night with some malt ball 
	mogul, then wake up in the morning and tell 
	myself it didn’t matter. You kid yourself that you 
	got this empty place inside where you can put it 
	all. But do it long enough and all you are is 
	empty.

	JACK
	I didn’t know whores were so philosophical.
	
	SUSIE
	At least my brother’s not my pimp.

Susie turns to walk away, then stops and looks back.

	SUSIE
	You know I had you pegged for a loser the first 
	time I saw you. But I was wrong. You’re worse. 
	You’re a coward.

As Susie turns away, we HOLD on Jack.


129	 INT. HILTON LOUNGE - THE AMBASSADOR LOUNGE - NIGHT 

The site of Jack and Frank's first night with Susie. As 
busboys move in and out, Jack and Frank stand with Ray, 
the assistant manager. 

	RAY
	Sick? How sick? 

	FRANK
	The flu. 

	RAY
	So she's got a few sniffles. 

	FRANK
	Doctor's orders. 

Ray frowns, looks at the two pianos across the room. 

	RAY
	You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. 
	It's unethical. 

	FRANK
	Look, Ray. You want us to pack up, we'll pack up. 

	RAY
	What am I gonna do? Put a record player out there?
	(exiting)
	Bad, Frankie. Bad. 

	JACK
	What're you doing? 

	FRANK
	Just until we find another girl. 

	JACK
	Cancel, Frank. 

	FRANK
	We're in for three weeks solid, Jack. 

	JACK
	Better give her pneumonia. 


130	INT. STARFIRE LOUNGE - NIGHT (2 NIGHTS 
LATER)

Jack and Frank, onstage. A small crowd.

	FRANK
	You know, my brother and I have been playing
	 together, gosh, I don’t know. Jack?

	JACK
	Thirty-one years.

No response. As Frank clears his throat nervously, 
Jack studies the bored, brutally indifferent faces of the 
people in the lounge.

	FRANK
	Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little 
	different. We were just kids. Just about the only 
	one who would listen to us was the family cat, 
	Cecil. We must’ve shaved three lives off old 
	Cecil, huh, Jack?

Frank laughs. His voice, eerily magnified by the 
microphone, is the only sound in the room.

	FRANK
	Yeah, well, anyway. It’s nice to be back here at 
	the Ambassador Lounge, because this place has 
	always been a very special place for Jack and I...

Jack watches a woman dribble her drink accidentally and 
let out a peal of laughter.

	FRANK
	Why? I guess you could say it’s just... the people.

As Frank launches into “People,” Jack watches the 
woman wipe her chin, still laughing, and we --

	CUT TO:


131	EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT (LATER)

Jack moves down the block, then starts to slow as he 
sees Susie up ahead, standing on the corner, talking with 
a man. She says something to him, laughs, and the man 
gives her a peck on the cheek and walks away. As she 
begins to search her purse, Jack approaches. Just as her 
face comes INTO VIEW, she senses him and turns, 
startled.

Not Susie.

For a moment, he just stares at her.

	JACK
	Sorry.


132	INT. JACK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT (LATER)

Jack enters and slams the door. He looks wired up, 
restless. Lighting a cigarette, he flicks on the TV, gets only 
haze, adjusts the antenna, still gets nothing, then gives it a 
pop with his fist... still nothing. Infuriated, he steps back, 
eyes the TV, then gives it a kick with his foot, sending it 
tumbling. He studies it, unsatisfied, turns to the bookcase, 
and clears a shelf with a sweep of his arms. He looks at 
the debris at his feet, sees the “Terry’s Tap Room” photo 
of he and Frank and picks it up, studying it as he drags on 
his cigarette. Sliding behind the piano, he props the photo 
there, and begins to play, searching for something 
interesting, but he’s too distracted. He stops, tries again, 
loses the groove after a few bars and then begins to pound 
the keys furiously in frustration. As he stops, his eyes shift 
to the photograph of he and Frank.

Two skinny kids, smiling goofily.


133	INT./EXT. FRANK’S CAR - NIGHT

As Frank guides the car through the wet city streets, 
Jack cradles a whiskey flask, occasionally taking a hit. 
It’s two A.M. and raining hard.

	JACK
	We’re not getting paid then.

	FRANK
	No.

	JACK
	Nothing. We get nothing.

	FRANK
	I told you, Jack. It’s a telethon. No one gets a cent.

	JACK
	What’s it for?

	FRANK
	I don’t know. Some disease.

	JACK
	What disease?

	FRANK
	I don’t know.

	JACK
	You don’t know?

	FRANK
	It’s a disease, Jack. We’re against it. It’s not a 
	moral decision.

	JACK
	What channel’s it on?

	FRANK
	Seventy-one.

	JACK
	Seventy-one? What’s seventy-one?

	FRANK
	(defensively)
	A channel. It’s just a little further down the dial, 
	that’s all. Look, it’s publicity. Publicity’s publicity. 
	Right?

Jack stares at Frank, then takes another drink.

	JACK
	Right.


134	INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

Jerry Lewis need not fear. This is strictly a tinfoil and 
crepe paper operation. In front of a huge tote board, a kid 
in a wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the 
camera.

	FRANK
	I’ll see when we’re on.

As Frank leaves, Jack glances around the studio like he’s 
walked into a nightmare. At the phone bank, a heavyset 
MAN in a sweatshirt and cap looks over. Both the 
sweatshirt and the cap have “Earl” printed on them.

	EARL		 
	You the magician?

	JACK
	No.

	EARL
	(disappointed)
	Oh. What do you do?

Jack points to the pianos across the room.

	JACK
	Piano.

	EARL
	(hopeful)
	Two at a time?

	JACK
	My brother and I. One each.

	EARL
	(disappointed again)
	Oh.

	JACK
	(indicating the kid in the wheelchair)
	What’s wrong with the kid?

	EARL
	Knee. Tore it up against St. Joseph’s. Right before 
	the accident.

	JACK
	Accident?

	EARL
	The fire. The way we’re going, we’ll be lucky to 
	buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.

As Jack registers this, Earl’s phone RINGS. Frank 
returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.

	FRANK
	We’re on after Meadowlark.

	JACK
	Are you fucking kidding me? Are you fucking 
	kidding me?

	FRANK
	What?

	JACK
	We’re playing for a goddamn gymnasium!

	FRANK
	(worried)
	What?

Just then, the kid in the wheelchair rolls off and a guy in 
a cheap rented tux strides in front of the camera. He’s 
VINCE NANCY, the host.

	VINCE
	Let’s hear it for our own Jimmy Marshall, shall 
	we?

The audience APPLAUDS.

	VINCE
	As most of you know, young Jimmy put a nasty 
	twist on that knee trying to win one for good ol’ 
	Grant High this year. Luckily, the doctors tell us 
	Jimmy’ll be able to play next season. That is... 
	if there is a next season.
	(Uncle Sam)
	That’s where you come in. Pick up that phone. 
	Make a donation. Let’s keep our kids off the 
	streets and in the gym where they belong.

APPLAUSE.
	
	VINCE
	All right. Well, friends, what can I say about our 
	next guest?
	(consulting a card)
	He, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with 
	us two of the most respected men in the musical 
	entertainment field... The Fabulous Bunker Boys! 
	Come on out here, guys.

Vince gestures grandly to the left and Jack and Frank enter 
from the right.

	VINCE
	Whoops, there they are. Hey, nice suits, fellas.
	(to camera)
	Now, I know a lot of you amateur musicians out 
	there are going to want to rap with these guys -- 
	and don’t worry. Right after they finish up here, 
	they’re going to be manning the phones. Maybe 
	we can even convince them to raffle off a few 
	piano lessons if we’re lucky. What do you think?

The audience APPLAUDS. Jack glares at Frank.

	VINCE
	Well all right then. What are we waiting for? 
	Take it away, guys.

As Jack and Frank begin to play. As the music rises, the 
studio becomes very quiet, almost still. Unfortunately, 
Jack and Frank are barely though the opening passage 
when a thunderously loud BELL begins to ring. Suddenly 
Vince steps out again.

	VINCE
	Uh oh. We know what that means, don’t we? It’s 
	time to turn the big board over again.
	(to Jack, Frank)
	I’m afraid you fellas’ll just have to wait a minute. 
	All right boys. Bring it out.

Two post-pubescent giants roll out the tote board -- right 
in front of Jack and Frank. Jack looks homicidal.

	FRANK
	Jack...

Jack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave. Then, 
seeing the kid in the wheelchair, he grabs the basketball 
and fires it and Vince.

	VINCE
	What the...

	JACK
	(pointing at him)
	You’re a fucking creep, you know that. I oughta 
	kick your ass.

	FRANK
	(whispering)
	Jack, you’re on television.

	JACK
	Shut up, Frank.

Earl of the sweatshirt and cap puts his hand on Jack’s 
shoulder.

	EARL
	What do you say we go for a walk, pal?

	JACK
	Get your hand off me.
	
	EARL
	Come on friend. I can smell it on you. Get 
	yourself a cup of coffee. You’ll forget what 
	you’re angry about.

	JACK
	Go fuck yourself.

Earl’s eyes go hard.

	EARL
	You’re a real tough guy when the ladies are 
	around, aren’t you, Ace?

	JACK
	I don’t see any ladies here. Except maybe you.

That does it. Earl takes hold of Jack’s collar and starts 
to wrestle him roughly toward the door.	
		
	FRANK
	Hey, leave him alone.

	JACK
	(eying Earl’s sweatshirt, cap)
	Buy all your clothes at the same place, Earl?

Earl shoves Jack out of the studio, hard. Jack stumbles 
back, ends up in a heap.

	EARL
	Who do you think you are, asshole? Liberace?	


135	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Jack walks down the street, mindless of the rain. Frank 
follows a few yards behind him.

	FRANK
	Jack. We just passed the car. JACK. This is a 
	tuxedo. Three hundred dollars.
	(pause)
	You gonna talk to me? Or is this Jack’s famous 
	silent act? Look, it was for publicity. Do you 
	understand? Publicity.

Jack stops and stares at Frank incredulously.

	JACK
	What are you? A fucking moron? It’s three 
	o’clock in the morning, Frank. Who’s watching? 
	Paperboys?

	FRANK
	Look. I didn’t know when we were going to be 
	on until yesterday.

	JACK
	Basketballs, Frank. You had us playing for 
	basketballs.

	FRANK
	I’m sorry. I should’ve checked it out. I screwed 
	up. But that doesn’t mean you walk out in the 
	middle of a gig.

	JACK
	WHAT?
	
	FRANK
	It wasn’t professional, Jack.

Jack just stares at Frank, as if looking at a stranger.	
	
	JACK
	What’s happened to you, Frank? You been kissing 
	ass so long you’re starting to like it? You let that 
	guy turn us into clowns tonight. We were always 
	small-time, but we were never clowns, Frank. 
	What’s happened to your dignity?	
	
	FRANK
	Dignity? Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?

Frank steps forward and reaches into Jack’s coat, coming 
away with the whiskey.

	FRANK
	This where you get your dignity, Jack? This 
	where you get your courage?

Jack tries to grab the bottle but Frank holds it away.

	FRANK
	No, let’s do it straight for once.

Frank tosses the bottle into the street, where it 
SHATTERS.

	FRANK
	I want to explain something to you, little brother. 
	See, there are people in this world who depend on 
	me. I’ve got a wife, and two kids who expect to 
	wake up every morning with food on the table and 
	heat in the house. I got a mortgage. I got car 
	payments. And, oh yeah, I got you. My little 
	brother Jack who’s so cool and so hip and so 
	fucking sure he’s better than everyone else. Don’t 
	you think I’d like to walk up to one of these 
	assholes and blow smoke in his face? Goddamn 
	right I would. But I can’t. I have to be 
	responsible, little brother. I have to make sure the 
	numbers balance out in my favour at the end of 
	each month so everyone can go on living their 
	lives. You don’t win medals for it, but you can be 
	damn sure you’d all take notice if I folded up 
	shop. So don’t talk to me about dignity, little 
	brother. You’re drawing on a weak hand.

Jack stares at Frank through the rain, then turns and 
begins to walk away.

	FRANK
	Great. Terrific. Walk away. You’re good at that, 
	Jack. You never could commit to anything, even 
	a conversation.

	JACK
	Is that what that was? Sounded more like a speech 
	to me. Next time save it for the PTA.
	
	FRANK
	(beat)
	You just had to, didn’t you, Jack? You couldn’t 
	keep your cock in your pocket.

Jack stops, glares at Frank.

	JACK
	Hey. Who I fuck and who I don’t fuck is none of 
	your fucking business. Got it?

	FRANK
	It is when it affects my business.

	JACK
	Your business. YOUR business? Your business 
	exists because of me.

	FRANK
	YOU? Who’re you kidding? I make the calendar, 
	I pay the expenses. Christ, I even make your shoes
	are shined. What do you do? Show up for a couple 
	hours a night and smoke cigarettes.

	JACK
	Frank. If someone requested “Chopsticks,” you’d 
	ask for the sheet music.

	FRANK
	(stung)
	If it wasn’t for me, little brother, you’d be playing 
	for dimes out of the back of a truck.

	JACK
	Yeah, you’re a real pro, Frank. You were doing 
	such a bang up job a few months ago, you had 
	‘em paying us NOT to play. That’s fucking genius.

Enraged by this, Frank glares at Jack, then suddenly bolts 
forward, drilling hard with his shoulder, driving Jack 
into the wall.

	JACK
	Jesus, Frank! What the fuck’s the matter with you?

Jack twists Frank around and pushes him off, but Frank 
charges back.

	JACK
	Goddamnit, Frank! Knock it off!

As they pound off the wall again, Jack’s anger suddenly 
multiplies on itself, as of fuelled by fifteen years of 
frustration. Flinging Frank against the wall, he becomes 
the aggressor, pounding, pulling, and slamming him in 
fitful rage. Frank is suddenly scared.

	FRANK
	Jack!... Jack!...

Frank slides down the cement wall, trying to protect 
himself. Unrelenting, Jack comes down with a vicious 
fist at Frank’s face, catching his fingers instead.
	
	FRANK
	My hands! My hands!

Jack grabs one of Frank’s hands roughly, twisting the 
fingers back.

	FRANK
	(terrified)
	Jack!

Jack twists Frank’s fingers harder. A knuckle cracks.	

	FRANK
	Jack! JACK!

Frank’s voice ECHOES high above the SOUND of the 
rain. Jack stops, looks at Frank’s hand, still clasped in 
his own. Letting go, he stares at his own hands, the skin 
split and bleeding. He no longer looks dangerous. He 
looks hollow, frightened.

	JACK
	I’m through with it. I can’t do it anymore.

Before Frank can say anything, Jack turns away, leaving 
his brother on the sidewalk, and disappears in the rain.


136	EXT. CITY SKYLINE - DAWN (A FEW HOURS 
LATER)

	WOMAN’S VOICE
	(singing)
	“Who can take a sunrise
	Sprinkle it with dew...
	Toss it in the air
	And make a groovy lemon pie
	The candy man can...
	The candy man can...”


137	INT. DINER  - DAWN (SAME TIME)
	
Jack, looking like he’s gone fifteen rounds, is sitting at the
table by the window, his head against the glass. He opens
one eye, sees a waitress smiling over him. Monica 
Moran.

	MONICA
	You’re one of the “Fabulous” guys. I remember.

	JACK
	Wrong number.

	MONICA
	Ah, you can’t kid me. I see you every day.

She points behind the cash register, to the wall covered 
with photographs. Frank. Himself. Susie...

	MONICA
	That’s why I took the job. The day I came in I seen 
	you and your brother’s faces hanging there and I 
	figured it was like a sign or something. Like 
	destiny.

Jack looks away from the photo of Susie, nods.

	JACK
	How you doing, Monica?
	
	MONICA
	Swell. Only it’s Blanche here.

Jack nods, starts to take his coffee, but Monica pushes it 
away and turns over a fresh cup.

	MONICA
	Nah, don’t touch that. That’s three hours cold.
	(pouring)
	Yeah, I been sitting over there just waiting for 
	you to wake up. Finally, I figured maybe you had 
	an appointment or something.
	(shaking her head)
	Boy, it’s weird, huh? You meet people, and you 
	think you’re never gonna to see them again... 		

Jack studies Monica’s body and she pulls away with the 
coffee pot. She notices.
	
	MONICA
	Guess you got caught in the rain, huh?

	JACK
	(looking at her)
	Yeah, I got caught in the rain.

Monica looks at Jack, then laughs a little nervously.

	MONICA
	God, I still can’t get over it. You just walking in 
	here...

	JACK
	When do you punch out?

	MONICA
	(swallowing)
	You’re my last ticket.

Monica looks a little nervous, but hopeful. Jack studies 
her -- it would be easy -- but then his eyes shift to the 
photo of Susie again.

	JACK
	Well, button up on the way home, Blanche. It’s 
	cold out there.


138	INT. JACK’S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING 
(AN HOUR LATER)

As Jack enters, he finds Nina sitting by the piano, trying to 
master a paddleball toy.

	NINA
	(not looking up)
	Hi, Jack.

As Nina whacks the tiny red ball off the paddle, it makes 
a dull, snapping SOUND. Thwack. Thwack. Finally, she 
misses, looks up, sees Jack’s rain-rumpled tux.

	NINA
	You better take that tux in, Jack. I could drop it off 
	this afternoon.

Jack says nothing, takes off the jacket. Nina starts with the 
paddle again. THWACK. THWACK.

	NINA
	You want me to make some coffee?

Jack hangs his jacket on the closet door and pauses by the 
bookcase. Everything he had knocked off has been 
carefully replaced. He runs his fingers over an ashtray 
-- clean.

	NINA
	Jack...?

Jack turns and watches Nina slap the ball. THWACK. 
THWACK. Missing, she looks up.

	NINA
	... Coffee?

Jack shakes his head slowly and Nina goes back to the 
paddle. THWACK. THWACK. THWACK. The sound is 
driving Jack crazy.

	JACK
	(quietly)
	Could you stop that please?
	
	NINA
	(not hearing)
	How ‘bout eggs? I could make you some eggs if 
	you want...

THWACK. THWACK. THWACK. Suddenly, Jack steps 
forward and whips the toy out of her hands.

	JACK
	Will you knock it off with that fucking thing?!

Nina looks up, startled.

	JACK
	You’re driving me nuts.
	(mocking her)
	“You want some eggs, Jack? you want some 
	coffee?” What’s the matter with you? You’re not 
	my housekeeper and I’m not your fucking father. 
	I can’t babysit you every time Mama gets an itch!

Nina, flushed with fear and hurt, turns and slips out the 
window, up the fire escape. Jack stares after her, still 
seething, then looks at the paddle in his hand, loses his 
anger. He notices Eddie staring at him.

	JACK
	What’re you looking at?


139	EXT. THE FIRE ESCAPE - MORNING 
(A FEW MINUTES LATER)

Jack climbs out his window and scales the iron ladder 
to the roof, where Nina is sitting, dangling her legs over 
the rain gutter, chin in hand.

Jacks sits next to her, drops the paddle into her lap.

	NINA
	You’re having a bad day, right?

	JACK
	Right.

	NINA
	It’s okay. My Ma used to have lots of those. 
	Sometimes that’s why I came down. Even when 
	there was no one sleeping over.

Jack nods, studies the skyline.

	JACK
	What do you say we go over to Empire and get a 
	couple Coney’s.

	NINA
	Can’t. I’m going to the zoo with Howard.

	JACK
	Howard?

	NINA
	Ma says I can’t call him Bigfoot anymore.

Suddenly, from down in the street, the SOUND of a car 
horn is heard. Nina looks down.

	NINA
	Uh-oh. I think he’s early.

Nina gets up, pauses by the ladder.

	NINA
	You ever go to the zoo, Jack?

	JACK
	Sure.

	NINA
	No one ever took me to the zoo before. Boy, he 
	must REALLY be serious.

Jack watches as Nina takes the ladder, starts to descend.

	JACK
	Hey.
	(as she stops)
	Teach you later.

Nina looks at him, a little surprised.

	JACK
	What’re you going to do? Go around playing 
	“Jingle Bells” the rest of your life?

Nina smiles, then disappears over the side of the 
building. Jack picks up the paddle she’s left behind, 
studies it.

THWACK. THWACK.

As the SOUND of the paddle ball FADES, it’s 
overtaken by the sound of a bluesy piano and we --

DISSOLVE TO:


140	INT. THE TINY JAZZ CLUB - DAY			

MOVING INTO IT SLOWLY, hearing the MUSIC long 
before the CAMERA reveals Jack, at the far end of the 
room, sitting alone at the piano. It’s afternoon and sharp 
blades of sunlight slice into the ghostly room from street 
level windows. After a moment, a huge figure appears in 
the f.g., his back to us. It’s Henry, the owner. He watches 
Jack until he finishes.

	HENRY
	I’ve got Tuesdays and Thursdays open the rest of 
	the month.

Jack runs his hands lightly over the keys, just touching 
them, making no sound.

	
141	EXT. SUSIE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY)

Susie steps out of her apartment building, pauses by the 
mailboxes.

	SUSIE
	You’re risking your life, you know.

Jack is leaning against a car, watching her.

	JACK
	You got a gun?

Silence. Jack pushes away from the car, comes closer.

	JACK
	You look good.

	SUSIE
	You look like shit.

	JACK
	No, I mean it. You look good.

	SUSIE
	I mean it too. You look like shit.

	JACK
	So how’s the cat food business?

	SUSIE
	Terrific. I’m doing vegetables now.

Jack nods.

	JACK
	What kind?

	SUSIE
	Carrots, peas. None of the important ones.

Jack nods, taps the cigarette on the railing, thinking.

	JACK
	You know, the other night...

	SUSIE
	I was out of line.

	JACK
	No. I was out of line.

Susie looks a little surprised by this.

	SUSIE
	Well, I was a little rough on Egghead. I mean, beats 
	the hell out of me, but... I kinda miss him.

	JACK
	Yeah, well, he grows on you after awhile.

As Jack stares off down the street, Susie studies his face.

	SUSIE
	So... you find another girl?

	JACK
	I didn’t look.

As Jack looks up, Susie locks into his eyes, vulnerable 
to him, then glances away.

	SUSIE
	Well, I’m gonna be late.
	(singing)
	“Peas, peas try our peas								Our peas are a deli-ca-see...”
	From “Strangers In The Night” to that. It’s a funny
	 world, huh?

Jack nods.
	
	SUSIE
	Yeah, well, ‘bye, Baker,

Susie brushes by Jack and heads up the street.

	JACK
	Hey.

She stops, turns.

	JACK
	Am I gonna see you again?

	SUSIE
	(not giving in)
	What do you think?

	JACK
	Yeah. I think I’m gonna see you again.

Susie looks at him suspiciously. Jack smiles at her.

	JACK
	Intuition.

Susie just looks at Jack, saying nothing, then she can’t stop 
herself... she smiles.


142	EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE  - DAY

As the cab pulls away, Jack is left standing alone in the the 
street. He glances at the house, then goes to the front door. 
As he presses the new doorbell, a cacophony of CHIMES resonates 
inside the house and a moment later, the door swings open.

Little Cindy, in a lollipop-print dress. Jack eyes her warily, 
still not sure he's in her good graces.

	CINDY
	(cheerfully)		
	Hi, Uncle Jack.

	JACK
	(relieved)
	Hi, kid. Nice dress.

	CINDY
	Thanks.

	JACK
	Daddy around?

Cindy steps aside, points down the hall.

	JACK
	Thanks.
	

143	OMITTED


144	INT. “BAKER BOYS” ROOM - DAY

Frank is taking things off the shelves, putting them into 
boxes. Coming to the Hula Girl Hideaway monkey, Frank 
studies it curiously, then gives the arm a flick, igniting the 
little torch in the other. He tosses it in a box.

	JACK
	You don’t want that?

Frank turns. Jack steps in.

	FRANK
	How the hell’d you get in here?

	JACK
	Cindy. We’re pals now.

	FRANK
	Great. Have your pal show you the way out.

As Frank turns back to the shelf, Jack just glances around 
the room, not leaving.

	JACK
	Everything goes, that the idea?

	FRANK
	That’s the idea.

	JACK
	You’re just throwing it away?

Frank turns, a little shocked.

	FRANK
	No. Into the garage. I’m just getting too old for 
	trophy dens, that’s all. And, anyway, it’s about 
	time Little Frank had his own room.

	JACK
	You gonna paint?

	FRANK
	We’re gonna paint.

	JACK
	What color?

	FRANK
	(turning)
	Look, Jack. Let’s cut the bullshit. You came here 
	to talk business, right? Okay, fine. We’ll put the 
	other night behind us and in a couple weeks 
	everything’ll be the same again. Okay? Now you 
	can go.

Frank goes back to the boxes.

	JACK
	I didn’t come here to talk business.
	(beat)
	I’m not coming back, Frank.

Frank stops, looks at Jack.

	FRANK
	So what’s there to talk about?

	JACK
	We’re still brothers.

	FRANK
	I’m touched, Jack. Really.

	JACK
	Frank...

	FRANK
	Look, Jack. If you want to piss away everything 
	we’ve built over fifteen years, that’s fine. Just 
	spare me the ruminations on brotherly love.

	JACK
	Listen to me, Frank...

	FRANK
	I don’t want to listen to you anymore, Jack. 
	What’re you going to tell me? That I wasted your 
	life? That I twisted your arm for fifteen years? 
	Well, forget it, little brother. That’s a lie. 
	Hear me? A fucking lie.

	JACK
	(with sudden anger)
	You’re right. Okay? You’re right. I don’t blame 
	you, Frank. I don’t blame anyone. I just can’t do it 
	anymore.
	(beat)
	I’m drying up inside, Frank. I’ve been drying up 
	for years. Do you understand? Somewhere along 
	the way I started to close down. It’s like I had this 
	big house and one day I just started painting the 	
	windows black, one by one. I mean, I sit in the
	fucking Hilton or the Sheraton or wherever, 
	practically every night of my life, and from the 
	minute I get onstage, I’m waiting for it to end. We 
	play the same goddamn songs the same goddamn 
	way every night. That isn’t enough for me. It just 
	doesn’t mean anything to me.
	(beat)
	It’s dishonest. I can’t do that anymore. I’ve been 
	lying to myself long enough.

Frank stares at Jack for a moment, then turns back to the 
boxes.

	FRANK
	If you see anything you want, take it.

Jack stands there, staring at his brother’s back, defeated. 
He starts to leave, then something catches his eye. From a 
dusty shelf, he pulls out a bottle.

	JACK
	Okay if I take this?

As Frank turns, Jack tosses the bottle to him, hard. Frank 
scrambles to catch it, then looks at it. It’s the bottle from 
the photograph in Jack’s apartment.

	JACK
	Come on, Frank. I’m trying.

Frank looks up, reacting to the nakedness of Jack’s 
statement, then looks at the bottle. It seems to hold some 
special magic for him.

	JACK
	How’re your hands?

	FRANK
	My hands are fine. Don’t worry about my hands. 
	And don’t worry about me. I don’t need this any 
	more than you do, little brother. We both know I 
	can make just as much teaching “Campdown 
	Races” to these snotty kids in the neighbourhood 
	as being a lounge rat. Don’t kid yourself.

Jack just nods. Frank studies him for a long moment, then 
looks at the bottle again. Finally, making a decision, he 
flips it back to Jack.

	FRANK
	Open it.

Jack just looks at him.

	FRANK
	Open the fucking bottle.

As Jack holds the bottle carefully, he watches Frank grab 
a handful of souvenir shot glasses.

	FRANK
	What’s your pleasure? We got the airport Ramada. 
	We got the Travelodge on 410. And... the Mallory.

	JACK
	I’ll take the Mallory.

	FRANK
	Forget it. I want the Mallory. You take the 
	Travelodge.

Jack smiles slightly and takes the glass. As he and Frank 
settle on the tiny piano benches, Frank notices the dust on 
the glasses.

	FRANK
	Looks like these got a few years on them.
	
	JACK
	This’ll kill ‘em.

Frank nods. Jack hesitates, then breaks the seal on the 
bottle, pours. As they swallow, each grimaces, looks at 
the other.

	JACK/FRANK
	(in unison)
	Not bad.

It suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old familiar 
place, staring into his glass.

	JACK
	How come you keep them in tune?

Frank looks suprised, then shrugs.

	FRANK
	Habit.

Frank looks at his glass and his mind leads him to 
something uncomfortable.

	FRANK
	Maybe this is horrible. I mean, I know it’s like 
	breathing to you... But sometimes, when I was up 
	there with you, playing, it was almost like I had it 
	too. That feeling.

Jack glances at Frank. He looks old, sitting on the tiny 
bench. Suddenly, Frank lifts his glass, eyes the tiny hotel 
rendered there.

	FRANK
	Jesus, when was the last time we played the 
	Mallory?

	JACK
	(thinking)
	‘78... November.

	FRANK
	Right. It was someone’s birthday. Halloran?

	JACK
	Daughter. Sweet sixteen.

	FRANK
	Christ, that’s right. How could I forget. What a 
	nightmare.

	JACK
	She asked for it.
	
	FRANK
	I told Halloran we didn’t do vocals, but he said --

	JACK AND FRANK
	(in unison)
	“What my Sissy wants, my Sissy gets.”

	JACK
	She got it alright.

Jack and Frank glance at one another, little boy mischief 
glowing in their faces. Suddenly, they swivel on the 
pianos and begin to play “You’re Sixteen”.

	JACK AND FRANK
	(singing)
	“She comes on like a dream
	Peaches and cream
	Lips like strawberry wine
	She’s sixteen, she’s beautiful
	and she’s mine...

	Ribbons and curls
	Ooh, what a girl
	Eyes that sparkle and shine
	You’re sixteen, you’re beautiful
	and you’re mine...”

As Jack and Frank finish, they’re laughing. After a moment, 
their voices die and the room is quiet again. Full of ghosts.
Each stares at the tiny keyboard before him, awkward with 
the intimacy of the moment. Is quiet for a very long time. 
Finally, Frank looks over.

	FRANK
	Well... One more time?

Jack glances up and sees that Frank has his empty glass 
held out. He picks up the bottle and pours.

	JACK
	One more time...

	FADE OUT
