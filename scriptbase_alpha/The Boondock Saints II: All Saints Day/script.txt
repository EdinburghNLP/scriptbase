                                                         September 1, 2007

          

          

          EXT. BOYLESTON STREET, BOSTON -- MORNING


          
          The boulevard is empty, eerie silence. No cars, no people. A man
          walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades.
          Though he does not speak, we hear...

          

                                 MAN V.O.
                     There's two kinds of people in this
                     world when you boil it all down. You
                     got your talkers and you got your
                     doers.

          
          We recognize this man as ROCCO. He crosses Copley Square toward the
          looming dome of the Trinity Church.

          

                                 ROCCO V.O.
                     Most people are just talkers. All they
                     got is talk. But when all's said and
                     done, it is the doers who change the
                     world. And when they do that, they
                     change us. That's why we never forget
                     them...So, which one are you? Do you
                     just talk about it? Or do you stand up
                     and do something about it? Because
                     believe you me all the rest of it is
                     just coffee house bullshit.

          

          FADE TO BLACK...

          

          EXT. DEEP COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY


          
          SUBTEXT:   "Ireland"

          
          From behind we see two men perched atop a boulder. A flock of sheep
          encircles them. Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby. They roll
          their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up.
          CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (30's) now have long hair with heavy
          facial growth. Rugged. Piercing eyes. Looking to the horizon...

          

                                 MURPHY
                     Looks like a storm's comin'.

          

                                 CONNOR
                     Aye.

          

          EXT. FIELDS -- LATER


          
          MOODY MUSIC: The brothers drive the flock across jewel green hills.
          Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off.

          

                                 POPPA M V.O.
                     Peace, they say, is the enemy of
                     memory. So it had been for my boys.

          

                                                                           2.

          

          
          Connor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock surges.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    For some time now, their past had felt
                    like a dream to them...faded and worn.

          
          Murphy touches the faded Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. Connor
          sees. The music takes us to a secluded, pioneer-esque ranch.

          
          CLOSE ON: POPPA M's (58yrs) face as he coughs and watches his sons
          approach from his rocking chair on the porch.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    And then suddenly, as if not a day had
                    passed...it was back. I could see it
                    in their eyes.

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT


          
          Poppa M and his sons eat a rustic dinner.   It storms outside.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    I could feel it, heavy in their
                    presence. Something calling them back.

          
          Poppa M looks to his boys who just keep eating. DIP TO BLACK...

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- NEXT MORNING


          
          Very early dawn, shadowy morning light. Connor and Murphy sip
          coffees and look out into the rain. Lightening lights up the flock.

          
          Through the open door behind them, Poppa M stokes a warm fire.

          
          Connor touch the Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. The boys look
          at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the "little sounds"
          of morning cease. Something's amiss. Thunder. Ominous music as...

          

          EXT. BOSTON, TRINITY CHURCH -- NIGHT


          
          From behind, we see a man with a CREW CUT, staring at the dome of
          the Trinity.

          
          SLO-MO, CLOSE ON: Crew Cut's boots as he paces toward.    The
          threatening music bleeds over to...

          

          EXT. FARM -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Just inside the trees, a pack of wolves stalk the sheep flock...

          
          SLO-MO, CLOSE ON:   A wolf's paws as it paces toward...

          
          We intercut between BOSTON and IRELAND as chaos erupts...

          

                                                                           3.

          

          
          BOSTON:    Crew Cut quickly enters the church.

          
          IRELAND:    The wolves burst from the tree line.

          
          BOSTON: A frantic priest in his 50's weeps and begs as Crew Cut
          slams him to his knees with a .9 mm to his head.

          
          IRELAND:   The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep.

          
          BOSTON:    Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the altar.

          
          IRELAND: BOOM! BOOM! Connor and Murphy blast shotguns at the
          wolves. One is hit, the rest retreat. The boys perform mercy
          killings on the wolf and one sheep.

          
          Everything calms as Poppa M rushes up with a mag light and stops.
          He coughs roughly. Moody choral music begins...

          

                                  POPPA M V.O.
                      "And they cried out, How long O'Lord
                      dost thou not judge and revenge our
                      blood upon them that dwell on the
                      earth?"

          

          EXT. FIELD -- LATER


          
          The boys toss the wolf carcass onto a bonfire.     It rains again.

          

                                  POPPA M V.O.
                      And God said, "All will fear the wrath
                      of the lamb. For the great day of
                      their reckoning hath come."

          
          Poppa M looks across the blaze to his sons. Connor and Murphy stare
          into the fire, bathed in the light of angry flames.

                                  POPPA M
                      "And they that holdest my name shall
                      come with the shaking of the earth and
                      the roiling of the oceans."

          

          EXT. FARM -- NIGHT


          
          Downpour. A rugged old jeep tears through the mud. It stops at the
          farmhouse. Poppa M and the boys come out onto the porch. A dark
          figure with a fedora and rain slicker exits the jeep and hurries to
          the porch. Meet Uncle SIBEAL (62yrs). He wears a priest's collar.

          

                                  SIBEAL
                      Something's happened.

          

                                                                           4.

          

          

          EXT. CHURCH -- MORNING


          
          Breaking news. REPORTER #1 is live from outside a church.   Squads,
          coroner's vans, CSI etc. Police hold back crowds.

          

                                REPORTER #1
                    There is no new information on the
                    victim found slain this morning inside
                    Trinity Church. As you can see the
                    size of the crowd here has increased
                    substantially over the last couple of
                    hours. People are demanding answers as
                    to how a priest could be murdered in a
                    church. But perhaps more shocking, we
                    have confirmed that the body was
                    ritualized with pennies in the eyes.
                    Many remember this as the grisly
                    calling card of the prolific vigilante
                    killers known as the Saints, who went
                    on a murder spree here in Boston.

          
          NEWS FOOTAGE:   People scream as they run out of a courthouse.

          

                                REPORTER #1 V.O.
                    A rampage that ended six years ago,
                    when the Saints brazenly walked into
                    open court...

          
          NEWS FOOTAGE:   A body is wheeled out on a gurney.

                    Yakavetta before a courtroom of
                    terrified witnesses, then simply
                    disappeared without a trace.
          Grainy, unclear security footage of three men walking the court
          halls, two in heavy black jackets, one in a trench...

                    The now legendary security camera
                    footage from that harrowing day, our
                    singular tiny glimpse of these infamous
                    and controversial killers.

          
          We are back with Reporter #1 at the church.

          

                                REPORTER #1
                    As police have yet to confirm the
                    Saints' possible involvement, the
                    ominous question hangs heavy in the
                    air. "Are they back?"

          

                                                                         5.

          

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT


          
          Sibeal, Poppa M, Connor and Murphy sit around the table.   The boys
          have a look of controlled anger. Presently...

          

                                  MURPHY
                    The priest.    Did they release his name?

          

                                SIBEAL
                    No. But I made a few calls, still got
                    some friends in the diocese there.
                    McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.

          
          The boys flash with recognition.

          

                                SIBEAL (CONT'D)
                    You knew him?

          

                                CONNOR
                    Knew of him. Everybody did. A regular
                    Mother Theresa. Youth hostels, soup
                    kitchens. Even made it into the
                    newspapers sometimes.

          
          Sibeal considers this.    He genuflects and turns.

          

                                SIBEAL
                    Listen boys. I think it's best that ya
                    just stay put and we'll try ta figure
                    out what...

          
          Connor and Murphy are out the door and headed for the barn.
          Confused, Sibeal looks to Poppa M, who just sips his coffee.

          

          INT. BARN -- MOMENTS LATER

          MOODY MUSIC: The boys begin to look more like "themselves" as the
          they cut their hair and beards with sheep sheers.

          
          The brothers lift a chest from a hole in the barn floor. They load
          guns and money into black duffel bags and place their signature
          rosaries around their necks, clasping their hands in prayer...

          

          INT. TRINITY CHURCH, ALTER -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Detective GREENLY (38yrs) is alone on the alter. Police line all
          around as Greenly stares at the body like the detective has seen a
          ghost. He turns and nervously staggers toward the front vestibule.

          

          INT. VESTIBULE -- SAME TIME


          
          Detectives DOLLY and DUFFY are scared.   In hushed tones...

          

                                                                           6.

          

          

                                DUFFY
                    We need to keep our heads, here.   It's
                    probably not even them.

          

                                DOLLY
                    Of course it ain't them but that
                    doesn't really matter, does it. Our
                    skeletons just came screaming out of
                    the closet. We're fucked.

          

                                DUFFY
                    We're not fucked.

          
          Greenly enters from the church proper.   Dolly and Duffy turn.

          

                                GREENLY
                    We are totally fucked!

          

          EXT. RAPID FLASHBACK SEQUENCE, "ACCESSORY TO MURDER"


          
          Greenly, disguised as a correctional officer, lets Connor, Murphy
          and Poppa M out of a paddywagon. FLASH!

          
          The Saints enter the Suffolk Courthouse, undetected.   FLASH!

          
          Dolly, dressed as a civilian, pulls the fire alarm.    FLASH!

          
          The Saints execute Poppa Joe Yakavetta before many terrified
          witnesses, the alarm blaring in the b.g. FLASH!

          

          INT. BACK TO PRESENT, VESTIBULE -- MOMENTS LATER


          

                                GREENLY
                    ...and not just fucked, like elephant
                    dick, pounded in the ass, no reach
                    around, jungle fucked!

                                DUFFY
                    Now's not the time to panic, Green
                    beans!

          

                                GREENLY
                    Oh, I disagree. Now's the perfect time
                    to panic. We're all Accessories to...

          

                                DOLLY
                    Don't you fucking say it!

          
          They all argue over one another. OFFICER #1 peaks his head in the
          front door. The detectives grind to a halt.

          

                                OFFICER #1
                    Her E.T.A. is ten minutes.

          

                                                                           7.

          

          

          EXT. GRAVEYARD -- MORNING


          
          CLOSE ON:   a gravestone.   "Paul M. Smecker,    1956 - 2003"

          
          We reveal a pair of sexy female legs, expensive "Jimmy Choo" heels.
          From behind we see the woman rest a rose at Smecker's Grave. "Legs"
          turns and walks toward a waiting squad car in b.g.

          

          EXT. CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Dolly, Duffy and Greenly stand outside in the entry way of the
          church. Though still on edge, they have calmed.

          

                                  DOLLY
                      I didn't even know he had a protege.
                      What is this bullshit?

          
          Duffy whips out his trusty note pad.

          

                                  DUFFY
                      Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years
                      old. Smecker plucked her right out of
                      class at Quantico.

          

                                  GREENLY
                      Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man.
                      This brawd's gonna be a nightmare.

          

                                  DUFFY
                      She was assigned to OCD two years back.
                      She can shoot a gun, set three course
                      records during her training.

          

                                 GREENLY
                      Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna-
                      be. We gotta get rid of her.

                                  DUFFY
                      She is also an authority on the Saints
                      case. Which means Smecker must have
                      walked her through it.

          
          The cops suddenly flush with fear.

          

                                  DOLLY
                      And the hits just keep on comin'.

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Sibeal waits as Poppa M thinks, then shakes his head.

          

                                                                       8.

          

          

                                POPPA M
                    Naw...I'm in no condition.   I'd just
                    slow 'em down.

          

                                SIBEAL
                    Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk
                    them out of this?

          
          Poppa M shakes his head.

          

                                SIBEAL (CONT'D)
                    We don't even know what this is yet!
                    Somebody could just be tryin' ta get
                    away with murder here!

          

                                POPPA M
                    Aye. Only there's about a thousand
                    easier ways ta do that. Trust me.
                    Someone's callin' them out, Sibeal. Ya
                    kill a priest in a church and make it
                    look like they did it. Bring 'em back
                    with a vengeance. Don't know who.
                    Don't know why. But someone thinks
                    he's real fuckin' clever. Only one
                    problem with his little plan.

          

                                  SIBEAL
                    What's dat?

          

                                  POPPA M
                    It worked.

          
          Fear and frustration burst from Sibeal.

          

                                SIBEAL
                    Jesus Christ! D'er's too much we don't
                    know and if you're won't at least try
                    ta talk some sense into them, I will!

          
          The door opens and in comes Connor and Murphy. Sibeal notes the
          change in appearance. The boys stand at the kitchen table's
          opposing end, hands in their pockets. Their resolve fills the room.

          
          The brothers face off with Poppa M and Sibeal: a bizarre board
          meeting. Poppa M cocks a brow at Sibeal who clears his throat.

          

                                SIBEAL (CONT'D)
                    Exactly what do you intend to do?

          
          Silence. Nobody moves. Connor withdraws a hand from his pocket and
          looks down. He flips a penny on the table. It clatters to a stop.

          

                                                                          9.

          

          

                                 MURPHY
                     Every last motherfucker that had
                     anything to do with it.

          

          EXT. CHURCH -- LATER


          
          A squad pulls up.    Dolly, Duffy and Greenly turn.

          

                                  DOLLY
                     Game time.   How are we playing this?

          

                                 DUFFY
                     Feds love to pull the divide and
                     conquer routine. We hard line her.
                     Stick together on this. Agreed?

          

                                  DOLLY
                     Agreed.   We're a brick wall.

          
          They all nod and stiffen their resolve.

          

                                 GREENLY
                     Let's rock this bitch.

          
          Rockin' music fades in as a uniform opens the squad door.

          
          SLO-MO:   EUNICE BLOOM (32yrs) exits the squad and moves toward.

          
          She is simply delicious: sexy, blonde hair, a woman's business
          suit, short skirt, brass rimmed specs. Each detective's face drops.
          Soon she is before them. Music cuts. She smiles and speaks with a
          southern drawl a la Doc Holiday.

          

                                 EUNICE

                              (POINTING)
                     You hafta be Detectives Dolly and
                     Duffy. Am I right?
                              (extending hand)
                     Eunice Bloom. A pleasure.

          
          Dolly and Duffy shake and manage a nod.    Greenly is still enamored.

          

                                 EUNICE (CONT'D)
                     And you must be Greenly. Smecker
                     always said you were the funny one.

          

                                 GREENLY
                     T'sup...I mean, what? Yeah, well,
                     funny as in ha ha, though not like
                     funny as in gay cuz...I'm not...played
                     high school football.

          
          She chuckles.   Dolly and Duffy fume.

          

                                                                            10.

                    Look, with all due respect, Agent
                    Bloom...

          

                                 EUNICE
                    Special.

          

                                 DOLLY
                    Excuse me?

          

                                EUNICE
                    You see there's a "special" before my
                    "agent." If we are going to address
                    each other formally, I'd prefer if you
                    popped it in there. Makes me feel, I
                    don't know...special. Of course, I'd
                    hoped we could be a little more
                    personable. In fact, I'd like you to
                    call me Eunice.

          
          The cops are dumbfounded.      Duffy snaps out of it.

          

                                DUFFY
                    O'kay, Eunice. I don't see why the
                    fuck the Fed is...

          

                                EUNICE
                    Whoa, whoa, "fuck?" This isn't a
                    "fuck" situation, is it? I can see a
                    "God Damn" or two but why skip all the
                    way to "fuck" right off the bat? Let's
                    start slow and work our way up to it.

          

                                DUFFY
                    What is the Fed's interest in this?
          The detectives harden, brick wall.     Eunice furrows her brow.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Their interest, Detective, is capturing
                    the men responsible for the murders of
                    22 of Boston's finest criminals. Y'see
                    public perception is that these boys
                    stepped in, did our jobs for us and
                    then disappeared into thin air as we
                    fecklessly searched for them. The FBI
                    tends to take exception to such things.
                    They coulda sent anyone. They sent me.
                    Why do you think that is?

                             (BEAT)
                    Well, since we've broken the "Fuck
                    Barrier," allow me to be blunt.

                                (MORE)

          

                                                                         11.

                                EUNICE (CONT'D)
                    It is because I am so fucking smart
                    that I make smart people feel like
                    retards. Now, we seem to be getting
                    off on the wrong foot here. I'd
                    appreciate a bit of cooperation. Let's
                    chalk it up to paying respect to the
                    memory of a dearly departed mutual
                    friend. A man who taught me everything
                    I know.

          
          After a moment of consideration, the cops concede with nods.

          

                                EUNICE (CONT'D)
                    Lovely.
                             (re: crowd)
                    Now what's with the circus?

          

                                DUFFY
                    The victim was killed late last night.
                    When people gathered for morning mass,
                    they found the front entrance chained
                    and padlocked. A locksmith came out,
                    cut the chain and surprise, surprise.
                    Cell phones. Half of them called the
                    cops. Half of them called the media.
                    But regardless...word's out.

          
          Eunice turns and looks over the crowd.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And it looks like that's just the way
                    somebody wanted it. What say we scrape
                    the shit off this cow's ass, fellas?
                    Detective Greenly? Escort a lady onto
                    the crime scene?

          

                                 GREENLY
                    What?   No, yeah, no.   Of course.

          
          Greenly escorts her as Dolly and Duffy walk behind, mystified.

          

                                GREENLY (CONT'D)
                    Do you want a cup of coffee or
                    something?

          

                                EUNICE
                    Never touch the stuff.

          

          INT. VESTIBULE -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Eunice stands, looking down the aisle at the altar. Behind her, the
          Detectives are curios as Eunice slides on pink latex gloves.

          

                                                                        12.

          

          
          She puts in ear plugs and all ambient sound ceases.   She starts
          slowly down the aisle...

          
          TOTAL SILENCE AS...Eunice inspects the smashed door of a
          confessional booth. She looks over the body closely then turns from
          the altar and walks to the detectives. She pulls her earplugs and
          all sound returns.

          

                                EUNICE
                    It wasn't them...but I'm sure you boys
                    already knew that.

          
          The detectives nod.

          

                                DUFFY
                    The two "V's." The victim and venue
                    don't add up.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Let's go with the venue first. Our
                    perpetrators are devout. They would
                    never commit such an act on sacred
                    ground. And as for the victim?

          

                                DOLLY
                    All their vics were criminals. Clearly
                    not the case here. So, it wasn't them
                    which means this is a local matter and
                    it falls under our jurisdiction. No
                    need for Federal involvement so with
                    all due respect...we'll see you later,
                    Special Agent Bloom.

          
          Eunice stands right in front of Dolly.

                                   ROMEO (CONT'D)
                       We saved your entire fucking country in
                       World War Two! Gee...thanks for the
                       statue!

          
          Romeo's foot smashes to camera, blacking us out.

          

          INT. VESSEL, BERTH -- NIGHT


          
          The boys slumber, side by side in hammocks.     We pull close on them.
          Silence. They whisper in unison...

          

                                   BOTH
                       Quis praesumis profanus apud Dominus?

                                (SUBTITLES)
                       Who dares trespass in the house of God?

          
          Their eyes pop open.

          

          INT. BERTH -- LATER


          
          Murphy rigs a needle to an ink pen. Connor clicks on a hot plate.
          The boys listen intently to a tiny hand radio nearby.

          

                                   RADIO ANNOUNCER V.O.
                       People are still in shock as Father
                       McKinney was a beloved local cleric.

                                RADIO ANNOUNCER V.O. (CONT'D)
                    His selfless contributions to the
                    community too numerous to list. In
                    related news, second generation crime
                    boss, Concezio Yakavetta has not
                    commented on whether he fears for his
                    own safety.

          
          The boys flash with recognition.

          

                                 BOTH
                    Yakavetta?

          

          INT. HIGH CLASS HOME, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT


          
          Rich, Italian decor, long table, laden with food. CAPOS 1-6 sit in
          utter shock, looking to their boss, CONCEZIO YAKAVETTA (37yrs) who
          heads the table.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    So, there it is. I want everyone to
                    feel free to share their thoughts.

          
          He returns to eating. A moment of silence then the Capos burst into
          anger. Capo #1 slams a fist down and stands, silencing the lot.

          

                                CAPO #1
                    I can't believe none of us were
                    consulted on this! The disrespect!
                    We'd have never okay'd such a thing!   A
                    priest! It's an infamita!

          

                                CAPO #2
                    Yeah! Are we not Catholics, for Christ
                    fucking sakes?!

          

                                CAPO #3
                    And just for simple revenge?! There's
                    no business in it! You've put us all
                    at risk here! The cops could be all
                    over us!

          

                                CAPO #4
                    Forget the cops! What about these
                    Saints fuckers?! These guys were long
                    gone! And now you're trying to bring
                    the devil right back to our doorstep?!

          
          Concezio wipes his mouth, stands and adjusts his cuffs.   He slowly
          circles the table as he speaks.

          

                                                                20.

          

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Six years ago, with the backing of an
                    adoring public, these vigilante fucks
                    put my father on his knees and executed
                    him...in public. Mi Patrigno, a blood
                    relative and benefactor to all of you.
                    Poppa Joe made you rich and his murder
                    remains un-revenged...

          
          A few roll their eyes at this verbal blunder.

          

                                CONCEZIO (CONT'D)
                    This too, is infamita. These homicidal
                    maniacs nearly wiped this family out.
                    It's taken a lot of time to build
                    ourselves up again, brick by brick.
                    And now that we've re-acquiesced our
                    original power, can we really afford to
                    have these guys pop out of the woodwork
                    someday and try to finish the job when
                    we least expect it? Now, for those of
                    you who have forgotten, let's recap.
                    These fuckers walk into rooms full of
                    gangsters...
                             (denotes surroundings)
                    Outnumbered, outgunned. They kill
                    everyone...and leave.

          
          Some look as if they are starting to get his point.

          

                                CONCEZIO (CONT'D)
                    You think I don't know that each one of
                    you's been waking up in night sweats
                    over this the last couple years? These
                    sons of bitches prison fucked us with
                    no lube, wiped their dicks on our
                    drapes and walked away! And we been
                    living in silent fear ever since. Oh,
                    we don't talk about it. Rape victims
                    often don't. But it's there. Knowing
                    they're still out there, somewhere.
                    Thinking...what if?

          
          Fear and realization.

          

                                CAPO #4
                    Concezio is right. Pretending you
                    don't got a problem don't solve
                    nothing.

          
          Heads nod in shameful agreement.

          

                                                                        21.

          

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Thank you, Doctor Phil. So, let's take
                    a moment to look at the serendiplious,
                    diperous, serendip...

                             (FRUSTRATION)
                    ...type situation we find ourselves in
                    here. There's a good chance they'll
                    show. No catching us with our pants
                    down this time. We can deal with them
                    proactivitously. The cops were
                    embarrassed by these guys too. With a
                    second bite at the apple, they got
                    every reason in the world to crank up
                    the heat. And as for their doting
                    public. I'd imagine they're gonna lose
                    a few fans.

          
          Heads nod all around.   Sold.

          

          INT. BERTH -- LATER


          
          Murphy sits, bare chested on a crate. With the rigged pen, he
          tattoos his brother's back. Connor cooks something, in a pot, on
          the hot plate. The resin of anger is evident.

          
          TATTOOS: Murphy's back has the crucified feet of Christ and
          Connor's shows Christ's downcast head on the cross.

          

                                CONNOR
                    The prodigal son, huh?   He wants us,
                    he's fuckin' got us.

          

                                MURPHY
                    But why would he do something so
                    public?

                                CONNOR
                    Think about it. People figure we did
                    it. Makes it more likely someone will
                    drop a dime. Way easier to get to us
                    in prison, isn't it, now.

          
          The berth door is slightly ajar. In pops a bottle of Whiskey, then
          Romeo's head. He's expecting a cheer but the brothers have their
          backs to him. He's instantly taken by their ink.

          

                                MURPHY
                    But how would anyone recognize us?

          

                                CONNOR
                    You don't remember those sketches on
                    the news channel?

          

                                                             22.

          

          

                                MURPHY
                    Shit. That's right. Y'know, every
                    time they show those composites on TV
                    and then they catch the guy, it looks
                    nothin' like him. But ours?

          

                                CONNOR
                    Just our luck. We get Leonardo fuckin'
                    Divinci as a sketch artist.

          
          Romeo listens with suspicion.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Maybe we should dye our hair.

          

                                CONNOR
                    What?

          

                               MURPHY
                    Yeah. These guys are always dyin'
                    their hair. You know, like in "The
                    Fugitive." It's covert and shit.

          
            Connor smirks privately.

          

                                CONNOR
                    What color would you dye it?

          

                                MURPHY
                    I don't know...lighter, I guess.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Y'mean...blonde?

          

                                MURPHY
                    I didn't say that!

                                CONNOR
                    California, surfer boy, gay, gay
                    blonde?!

          

                                MURPHY
                    I'm warnin' ya!

          

                                CONNOR
                    Just keep your hands off my ass back
                    there and, "stay gold, Pony Boy."

          
          Connor laughs heartily.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Fuck you!

          

                                                                         23.

          

          
          Murphy stabs the ink pen into his brother's shoulder.

          

                                CONNOR

                    AAAAAH!

          
          Connor bolts up, knocking over the pot. Hot water and pennies
          spread across the floor. Connor pulls the pen out.

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    You motherfucker!

          
          Romeo steps inside and sees the pennies.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Serves ya right!

          
          The boys are just about to fight when...

          

                                ROMEO
                    Oh, shit.

          
          The brothers snap their heads toward.   A stunned Romeo points to
          them, then the pennies.

          

                                ROMEO (CONT'D)
                    I know who you are. You guys are the
                    fuckin'....

          

                                MURPHY

                    SHUT IT!

          
          Murphy moves behind Romeo, shuts the door and shoves him in.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Oh, this is so fucking cool, man. I'm
                    from Boston. I love you guys. Shit,
                    everybody does! I mean, holy fucking
                    shit! Maybe I could get in on this,
                    you know? Bring some La Raza ta this
                    thing. Spice it up a little. Hey, is
                    it true you guys say a prayer before
                    you grease somebody?

          
          Connor pulls a gun. The boys jump on Romeo and pin him to the
          floor. Murphy clasps a hand over Romeo's mouth. Connor puts the
          gun to Romeo's head. Their faces glaze over, religious ecstasy...

          

                                CONNOR
                    And an awesome wailing was heard
                    throughout heaven...

          
          Romeo's eyes go wide and muffled cries of terror are heard.

          

                                                                      24.

          

          

                                MURPHY
                    ...as the terrible hand of the Lord
                    struck upon the earth.

          

                                CONNOR
                    And as Almighty God created you...he
                    now calleth you home.

          
          He pulls the trigger - "click."

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    Ooops. Busy signal. We'll hafta

                    Let's have a shot while we're waitin'.

          
          The boys laugh, snatch the bottle.   Romeo is in shock.

          

                                ROMEO
                    That shit was NOT funny, man!

          
          The brothers laugh harder. Romeo rolls on his side and slides a
          hand down the back of his pants. He seems relieved.

          

                                ROMEO (CONT'D)
                    Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thought I
                    greased my drawers.

          

          INT. BERTH -- LATER


          
          The boys and Romeo smoke and pass the bottle around.

          

                                CONNOR
                    No.

                                ROMEO
                    But I got conex all over Bean Town.
                    Romeo'll hook you up like a tow truck!

          

                                MURPHY
                    No.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Why not?!

          

                                MURPHY
                    We don't hafta give you reasons.
                    Forget it.

          

                                ROMEO
                    It's because I'm Mexican, isn't it!

                                CONNOR
                    How dare you, sir, insinuate such a
                    thing? The fact that you're a greasy
                    spic's got nothin' ta do with it.

          
          The boys laugh.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I'm gonna let you have that one. Look.
                    I can do this. It's not rocket
                    science. You two find bad guys doing
                    bad shit and you kill them, right?

          

                                CONNOR
                    It's not that simple.

          

                                 MURPHY
                    Yes it is.

          

                                CONNOR
                    S'pose you're right. I'd sorta hoped we
                    were a little more artistic than that.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Well, you ain't. Can't you guys see
                    it? This shit's fate, man. Like
                    preordained type shit. Mea fucking
                    Culpa! Why do you think you just
                    happened to be in that hatchway today?

          

                                MURPHY
                    Oh, don't start gettin' all super
                    fuckin' natural on us. We saw those
                    guys goin' in there!

          

                                ROMEO
                    Ah, ha! That's what you say. I say it's
                    because Jeeeeesus wanted it that way!

          

                                 CONNOR
                    Oh, no.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Fine. Then what exactly do you intend
                    to do when you hit U.S. soil?

          

                                CONNOR
                    We'll go after all Yakavetta's people
                    and operations till we get to the man
                    himself.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Yeah, work our way up the food chain.

          

                                                                      26.

          

          
          The brothers seem pleased with themselves.

          

                                ROMEO
                    So, what's your first gig?    What's the
                    first thing you gonna do?

          
          The boys look to one another.   They're stumped.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Well, I don't suppose we have a
                    succinct plan, y'know, per se.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Yeah. It's not fully developed yet,
                    y'know, as it were.

          
          A slow smile splits Romeo's face.

          

                                ROMEO
                    You two need to chill in the green
                    room, sip on some Pellegrinos and let
                    your manager handle the details. And
                    you better get my Cub Scout badge
                    ready. Cuz if you want to kick
                    Yakavetta in the nuts, let him know
                    you're in town...Romeo's got an ace in
                    the hole for you.

          

          INT. / EXT. NEWS FOOTAGE, MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEWS


          

                                HOT DOG VENDOR
                    These guys have gone "mad dog" here.
                    They need to be put down.

          

                                CAB DRIVER
                    I think it's disgusting.   I wish they'd
                    have stayed gone.

          

                                PEDESTRIAN
                    I don't believe it for a second!   No
                    bleep-in way the Saints did it!

          

          INT. BOSTON P.D., WAR ROOM -- MORNING


          
          The CHIEF (50's) sits, arms folded. The detectives are present.
          Eunice stands before a wall adorned with crime scene photos,
          reports, Concezio and his Capos.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And that's all she wrote. Everything
                    points in the same direction.

          
          She taps Yakavetta's picture on the wall.

          

                                                              27.

          

          

                                CHIEF
                    Why would Yakavetta want them back
                    here? Him of all people.

          

                                DUFFY
                    To have them executed. Revenge.
                    Oldest motive in the book.

          

                                GREENLY
                    The Saints killed his daddy six years
                    ago, right? He was inside when that
                    happened doing a nickel for extortion.

          

                                DOLLY
                    Yeah. From inside he could only do so
                    much. Since he got out nine months
                    ago, the Yakavetta's have regained
                    their original strength. Looks like
                    their clearing all their open accounts.

          
          The Chief rubs his chin.

          

                                CHIEF
                    Well...it's a theory.

          

                                EUNICE
                    More than just a theory, Chief.

          
          She nods to Duffy.

          

                                DUFFY
                    C.I.'s came back. Cold hits all
                    around. Concezio Yakavetta and his six
                    Capo Regime, all blood relatives, have
                    disappeared.

                               CHIEF
                    So?

          

                                GREENLY
                    So, it fits. He's gone to the
                    mattresses with his top brass. He's
                    protecting them till this is over.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And word's been put to all his
                    lieutenants that the Saints are to be
                    taken out, on sight.

          

                                DOLLY
                    That means his resources on the streets
                    are battening down the hatches, waiting
                    for them to show.

          

                                                                          28.

          

          

                                CHIEF
                    Look, I been stone walling the media on
                    this thing but the Mayor's been riding
                    me like a rented mule here. I got half
                    of New England thinking the Saints
                    whacked a priest and the other half
                    thinking their innocent. Its a powder
                    keg. I'm talking riot gear at Celtics
                    games, here. I could clear them of
                    this murder, take the piss right out of
                    this thing, keep the peace in the
                    Commonwealth. Gimme one good reason
                    why I shouldn't go public right now.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Walk with me, Chief.    Let's talk.

          
          He stands and she takes his arm as they exit.     Duffy quietly closes
          the door and turns. Hushed tones...

          

                                DUFFY
                    This is not good.   She's gunning for
                    the boys hard.

          

                                DOLLY
                    This brawd, trying to put a feather in
                    her cap is gonna get us locked up.

          

                                DUFFY
                    Just calm down.

          

                                GREENLY
                    And you know they'll send us to the
                    Hoag. We put half those deranged sex
                    freaks in there. I hope you guys like
                    cock sandwiches. Cuz we'll be eating
                    them for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

          

          INT. PRECINCT HALL -- SAME TIME


          
          The Chief and Eunice walk down the hall.

          

                                EUNICE
                    I understand you got a job to do,
                    Chief. But if Yakavetta even sniffs
                    that we're onto him, he puts a bullet
                    in Napoleon's head, plants him at the
                    bottom of the ocean and walks. This
                    pint sized killer is the only thing
                    that puts Yakavetta right in the middle
                    of this. It is imperative that we find
                    this man.

          

                                                                        29.

          

          
          The Chief looks as if he is sold.

          

          INT. WAR ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          In hushed tones.

          

                                DUFFY
                    We need to figure what we're gonna do
                    when the boys show and start doin' what
                    they do best. Cuz that's when the
                    shit's really gonna hit the fan.

          

                                DOLLY
                    That's another thing. Everyone's
                    assuming that they're going to come
                    back. I mean, we got no way of knowing
                    that for sure.

          

                                GREENLY
                             (ray of hope)
                    Yeah. That could totally happen.    They
                    could not come back.

          

                                DUFFY
                    What dream world did you two just slip
                    into?!

          
          They argue.   Duffy snaps a photo of the dead priest from the wall.

          

                                DUFFY (CONT'D)
                    Point blank! We know the boys. Is
                    there any part of you that thinks
                    they're are just going to let this
                    slide? Believe this. They are either
                    on their way...or they're already here.

          EXT. BOSTON, DOCKS, PARKING LOT -- NIGHT


          
          CLOSE ON: Connor, Murphy and Romeo peaking over a concrete wall.
          Three sets of eyes.

          
          Our trio is atop a dumpster, peaking over at the loading dock.
          Chinese Gangsters supervise unloading of crates onto a flatbed.

          

                                ROMEO
                    It's been all over the papers the last
                    two years. Yakavetta's in bed with the
                    Chinese. They're using international
                    shipping routes to smuggle it in. This
                    is Little Yaka's shit.

          
          Connor and Murphy smile.

          

                                                                     30.

                    Alice.

          
          Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder.

          

                                MURPHY
                    You just scored a few points, Rome.

                    jacket.
                             (pulls set of keys)
                    Cuz the kid has also supplied the ride!

          

          INT. CAR -- LATER


          
          Murphy looks displeased. We hear a stressing motor. Romeo drives,
          Murphy sits shotgun. Connor is in back, loading guns. Pull back to
          reveal our trio rides in a '68 VW Bug. It is green with patches of
          Bondo, exposed engine, low-pro rims, neon runner board lights - a
          low riding "work in progress."

          

                                MURPHY
                    I thought you said your car was
                    inconspicuous.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I don't like words that got 'spic'
                    right in the middle. Besides, it
                    is...where I live.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Where's that? Pimpville?

          

                                ROMEO
                    Hey! I hail from a colorful people.
                    Besides, you wouldn't know style if it
                    pitched a tent in your ass!
                             (looks into rear view)
                    What do you think of the ride, Conman?

          

                                CONNOR
                    The only way I could be more
                    embarrassed right now is if I was
                    ridin' a moped.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Yeah...while fuckin' a fat girl.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Yeah...rollin' through the gym at my
                    high school reunion.

          CHINESE GANGSTERS #1-#5, shovel mounds of coffee grounds out of

          EXT. WAREHOUSE -- SAME TIME


          
          CLOSE ON:   Three sets of eyes peaking over oil drums.

          
          Our trio watches as a DOCK WORKER (22yrs) drives a forklift,
          unloading the crates from the flatbed and driving them through the
          huge open bay doors. The boys and Romeo huddle up.

          

                                  CONNOR
                      O'kay, here's the plan.

          

          EXT. "THE PLAN," WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT


          
          The "Queen" classic, Another One Bites the Dust, presides over this
          fantasy sequence. The boys, looking more "quaffed," do a pointless
          slow motion walk toward the forklift, throwing up their collars.

          
          Romeo, also looking polished, executes a "Dan Tana" pistol whipping
          on the Dock Worker who perfectly out of frame.

          
          INSIDE WAREHOUSE: The lift pulls to a stop before the gangsters,
          crate on the forks. Romeo is behind the wheel.

          
          SLO-MO: Connor and Murphy pop from the crate and fire on their
          Asian foe, hitting each squarely in the chest.

          
          SLO-MO: The boys leap down and light cigs as Romeo does the "one
          arm action star hang" off the side of the lift in b.g. WHIP PAN...

                      Irish. We're home in time for tacos.

          
          Murphy looks unsure.     Connor turns to his brother.

          

                                   CONNOR (CONT'D)
                      What?

                    lift, man. Got my class "D" license
                    and everything.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Now, dat's the spirit.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I need a gun.

          

                                 CONNOR AND MURPHY
                    Forget it.

          

                                ROMEO
                    What the fuck? I'm in on this shit,
                    man! I'm working here!

          
          The boys look to each other. Murphy shrugs. Relenting, Connor
          pulls a metallic object and shoves it in Romeo's hand.

          

                                CONNOR
                    You can consider yourself a fuckin'
                    pledge until we say different.

          
          Romeo holds up the gun in displeasure, a tiny .22 caliber lady's
          purse pistol. Murphy snickers.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Can I consider myself your girlfriend,
                    too?

          

                                CONNOR
                    That's what you get.   Is there a
                    problem?

                               ROMEO
                             (beat, fuming)
                    It's fine.

          
          Connor scopes the warehouse.   Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Don't worry, Rome.   Shit like this
                    builds character.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Yeah, the character of a little bitch.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Now, dat's just unprofessional.

          
          He turns and joins his brother as Romeo continues sulking.

          

                                                                       33.

                    I think Yakavetta murdered a good man
                    just to send us a message.

          

                                MURPHY

          They pull wrapped white kilos.    Connor dips in a finger and tastes.

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    It's heroin.

          

                                MURPHY
                    How the fuck would you know?

          

                                  CONNOR
                    Fuck you.    I know shit.

          

          INT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Romeo's winging it, jerky moves, grinding gears as the forklift
          staggers across the mammoth warehouse toward the gangsters at the
          opposing end. The crate blocks Romeo from view. He's driving blind
          as the rickety crate jiggles on the forks.

          
          INSIDE CRATE:   Connor and Murphy are sardined, back to back.

          

                                  MURPHY
                    Jesus!    What the fuck's he doin'?!

          

                                CONNOR
                    He can't see where he's goin'!

          
          Murphy peaks through a crack.

          

                                  MURPHY
                    Shit!    Tell him to go left, now!

          
          Connor puts his mouth to a knot hole.

          

                                  CONNOR
                    Go left!    Go left!

                                 ROMEO
                    What?!

          
          Connor sticks his finger out the hole and points. Romeo wrenches
          the wheel and they narrowly avoid machinery. The crate rocks...

          

                                MURPHY
                    I can't fuckin' believe I let you talk
                    me into this! This is a stupid plan!

          

                                CONNOR
                    I didn't notice you throwin' out any
                    ideas, ya creative asshole!

          

                                 MURPHY
                    Fuck you!

          

                                                                        37.

          

          
          The boys start elbowing each other in a close quarters scrap while
          hurling obscenities.

          

                                 ROMEO
                    Hey!   What's goin' on in there?!

          
          INSIDE CRATE: Murphy suddenly stops, eyes wide as he looks through
          the crack. They are headed for a "Mechanic's Well."   A long,
          rectangular cement hole in the floor six feet deep.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Jesus Christ! Tell him to stop!

          
          Connor slams his mouth to the knot hole.

          

                                 CONNOR

                    BRAKES!   BRAKES! BRAKES!

          
          A few of the Chinese turn as Romeo slams on the brakes, screeching
          to a halt just before the well. The crate slides right off and
          falls in, disappears from sight. CRASH!

          
          A large cloud of coffee dust plumes.   A wide eyed Romeo is exposed.
          The Asian gangsters stare in shock.

          
          Hard techno music! Suddenly, Romeo whips it in reverse, cranks the
          wheel guns it and navigates the well. Speeds toward the gangsters.

          
          MECHANIC'S WELL: (SLO-MO) The brothers burst from the debris,
          covered in coffee grounds and white powder. They draw their weapons
          and walk toward the ramp at the well's opposing end.

          
          The Chinese pull and start firing. Romeo dives off and rolls behind
          some machines. The lift continues on target.

          
          The brothers emerge and tear right in, firing at the gangsters.
          Romeo fires his useless 22. In the ensuing fire fight the brothers
          kill all but Chinese Gangster #3.

          
          The forklift crashes through the table with the stacked heroin.

          
          SLO-MO: The brothers slam the final Gangster to his knees and level
          to the back of his head and recite the following in synchronicity...

          

                                BROTHERS
                    And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my
                    Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended
                    forth from Thy hand, that our feet may
                    swiftly carry out Thy command. So, we
                    shall flow a river forth to Thee and

          Haunting music. Black and White film as Connor and Murphy take
          great care in ritualizing the bodies. They place pennies in eyes
          and cross hands over chests. WHIP PAN...

          

          EXT. BACK TO PRESENT, WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT


          
          Bodies are wheeled out in the b.g. as Dolly and Greenly talk
          privately with Eunice.

          

                                    DOLLY
                        Just got a call from my best snitch.
                        Never steered me wrong. He says its
                        this guy.
                                  (hands Eunice mug)
                        "Gorgeous" George Tuffano. He's
                        trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not
                        blood. He's been left control of the
                        streets. He's running all of it.

          
          Eunice looks over the mug shot.

          

                                    GREENLY
                        They call him "Gorgeous" cuz he likes
                        his silk suits and jewelry. He's even
                        got the 'out of season' fake bake going
                        on, a real peacock, this guy.

          

                                    EUNICE
                        Yeah, I heard of this rodeo clown.
          Duffy approaches, hands Eunice a tiny bullet in a baggy.

          

                                    DUFFY
                        Ballistics just dug it out.

          
          They all look perplexed.

          

                                    EUNICE
                        A twenty two? You gotta be kidding me.
                        That's like bringing a knife to a
                        gunfight.

          

                                    GREENLY
                        Yeah, or like bringing a really small
                        gun...to a gunfight.

          
          They all blank stare Greenly for a moment.        Moving on.

          

                                                                       39.

          

          

                                DUFFY
                    I don't know. Ballistics is reading
                    three shooters. This is one of them.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Well, I'm having a hard time believing
                    that one of the three most lethal
                    individuals on the planet just switched
                    over to bird shot.

          

                                DOLLY
                    Maybe we're reading it wrong. The
                    priest was a frame job, right?

          

                                DUFFY
                    Yeah, maybe somebody's trying to
                    eliminate some competition here.

          
          Eunice considers this.   The Detectives seem hopeful.

          

                                EUNICE
                    No, sir. It's them. But we just might
                    have ourselves a change in the line up,
                    here.

          
          The detectives all look at one another nervously.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Fine, they're back.   What's the plan?

          

                                EUNICE
                    Hell, we've just been called up to the
                    big show. We are tracking multiple
                    perpetrators, gentlemen. The plan? We
                    keep our ear to the ground and try to
                    figure out where Yakavetta's hiding.
                    Napoleon. We find him and flip him.
                    And as for the Saints...I'm gonna have
                    me a face to face with these boys one
                    way or the other.

          
          She walks off.   The cops look terrified.

          

                                DOLLY

          Later, they all enjoy an impromptu dinner on the pool table. The

          Later, music fades. Silence as Connor and Doc stare each other down
          across the pool table. Neither flinches. Murphy and Romeo watch
          with intrigue as Doc stiffles his urge to pop off.

          EXT. / INT. "BELLA SANTE SALON" -- MORNING


          
          Eunice enters the swanky salon and moves across the lobby.

          

          INT. MASSAGE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          "Gorgeous" GEORGE (47yrs) is face down as a female masseuse works
          his back, incense, mood music. Eunice silently slides in flashing
          her badge, a finger to her pursed lips.

          
          Uneasy, the woman continues her work as Eunice lotions her hands.
          She covertly replaces the masseuse and motions her out of the room.
          Eunice digs in as the fatted mobster moans with pleasure.

          

                                                                       43.

          

          

                                   GEORGE
                    Oh, yeah.     Someone's been eating their
                    Wheaties.     Yeah, get after it, girl.

          
          Eunice grabs a large massage paddle with rubber fingers. She whips
          George's towel off, winds up and smacks him on his bare ass, HARD!!

          

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)

                    AAAAAH!

          
          George involuntarily jerks and rolls off the table.

          

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)

                    WHAT THE FUCK!?

          
          He bolts to his feet.

          

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    You fucking bitch!

          
          He rounds the massage table, arms outstretched. Eunice draws her
          side arm and sticks it in his face, halting him dead.

          

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa.

                    Y, yeah...I'm with that.

          George sits. Eunice reholsters, wiggles her skirt straight and sits
          on the massage table. George looks at her legs as she slowly
          crosses them. Trepidation as he covers his genitals. Eunice smiles
          as she flashes her FBI credentials. George relaxes.

                    priest killed.

          
          George snaps his head to Eunice in shock, then recovers.

          The boys, Romeo and UNCLE CESAR (58yrs) sit in a booth. Cesar is
          noble looking, silver hair. Silence as he looks them over.

          

                                CESAR
                    Word is, Yakavetta's gunning for you

          They begin to argue in Spanish.

                                CESAR
                    Cool it, Mr. Big Shot! A year ago you
                    were washing my pots and pans!

                    anymore! I'm part of this, Uncle!

          

                                CESAR
                    Hey! This isn't my first bar-b-que!
                    Now shut up and stop interrupting! Let
                    me talk to them and I'll figure out
                    whether your in on this or in your own
                    fucking fantasy world!

          Romeo swallows his anger.   Murphy speaks Spanish.

          

                                 MURPHY
                    He's in.   All the way in.

          
          Cesar looks at Murphy surprised.   In English.

          

                                CESAR
                    Is my nephew pulling his weight?

          
          Connor nods while tapping his chest.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Mucho corazon.

          
          Cesar looks to his nephew with a new found respect and touches his
          hand. Romeo is very affected by this. Back to business.

          

                                CESAR
                    Gorgeous George is running the show for
                    Little Yaka. Drugs, prostitution,
                    sharking, the whole cha cha. If
                    anybody knows where he is, it's that
                    fat fucking pedico. I'll put it out on
                    the wire.

          

          INT. THE GREEN MACHINE -- LATER


          
          Romeo quietly weeps as he drives. The brothers are "highly aware"
          and give respectful silence. As Romeo sniffles we show slow motion
          remembrances of Cesar nodding and giving Romeo a look of respect and
          then touching his nephew's hand.

          
          Back in the Green Machine - an excruciating amount of time passes.
          Murphy tries to break the ice.

                                MURPHY
                    Hey, uh, maybe we should...

          

                                 CONNOR
                    Shut up.   Romeo's crying.

          
          A moment of silence....then all three burst into laughter.

          

                                ROMEO
                    You fucking assholes!

          

          INT. PRUDENTIAL BUILDING, LUXURY APARTMENT -- DAY


          
          A sprawling high rise apartment, overlooking Boston: buffet table,
          plasma screen, etc. The Capos are taking advantage of the
          amenities. Concezio's not here. Capo #5 - #6 fill their plates...

                                CAPO #6
                    We always bounce back. Besides, look
                    at the bright side. Better the chinks
                    than us, right.

          

                                CAPO #5
                    I guess.  Like the boss said...
                             (Concezio impression)
                    "This is war. There's gonna be
                    casuwalities."

          
          They laugh. Suddenly, George enters with an overnight bag.      The
          Capos are confused. Feigning a capitol mood...

          

                                GEORGE
                    Oh! Like the Roman Empire in here!
                    Where's all the concubines and shit?

          
          George laughs. Nobody else does. He looks at the food table.      We
          pull close on shrimp cocktail and cannoli. A look of dread.

          

                                  CAPO #3

                    I need to see the Boss, right away.

                             (to Jimmy)
                    Il cortina.

          
          Jimmy draws back a large curtain, exposing a steel panic room. Next
          to the vault door, is a video screen which displays the unamused
          face of Concezio. His voice booms over loudspeakers.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Get over here!

          

                                 GEORGE
                    Whoa!

          
          George hustles over.   He stands before the screen, confused.

          

                                                                       48.

          

          

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    Uh.   Hey, Boss! I just came by to...!

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Push the talk button, numb nuts.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Oh.
                             (he does)
                    Can you here me? Over.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    I can hear you fine, Smokey and the
                    Bandit. Now, what the fuck are you
                    doing here?

          

                                GEORGE
                    Everything's in motion. All our guys
                    are gunning for these Jesus Freaks. I
                    figure, no need for me to be on the
                    streets no more. So, which room do I
                    take, eh?

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    You stupid motherfucker! I told you,
                    you're on the streets till this is
                    over! Now get the fuck outta here!

          
          A terrified George hustles for the door.

          

                                CONCEZIO (CONT'D)
                    And don't come back here till I tell
                    you to, you fat fucking waste of space!

          
          George trips over his luggage.   The Capos giggle.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM -- EVENING


          
          Cheap, depressing room. Crew Cut, in his underwear, repairs a
          broken rosary chain with string and puts it on.He pulls a shoe box
          from a shopping bag. The brand is "Hushes." Slogan: "Measure up
          to your dreams."

          
          He puts on one shoe. Crew Cut stands before the mirror going up and
          down on the one shoed foot, noting the height that has been added.
          The shoe has been cleverly constructed to disguise the higher heel.

          

          EXT. AUTO BODY -- EVENING


          
          We are out back, among scrap cars. George talks with JO JO RHAMA
          (38yrs). Jo Jo is built like a fire plug and clearly a hoodlum.

          

                                                    49.

          

          

                       JO JO
          A priest.   The sick fuck.

          

                      GEORGE
          And he leaves all of us on the streets
          holding the bag while him and his are
          living it up at the Taj fuckin' Majal,
          not a care in the world.

          

                      JO JO
          So, until the Saints get popped, we're
          all lambs to slaughter?

          

                      GEORGE
          Yeah! And he don't care how many of us
          they wipe out in the meantime!

          

                      JO JO
          What do you need me to do, Skipper?

          

                      GEORGE
          Spread the word to all the brugliones.
          No bullshit. From your mouth to their
          ears.

          

                      JO JO
          Everyone? North and South?   That could
          get a little dicey.

          

                      GEORGE
          Fuck their old grudges. All of them
          are in this, like it or not. Tell them
          everything we discussed.

          

                      JO JO
          Even the panic room thing?

                        GEORGE
          Sure.

          

                      JO JO
          Good. That's a nice ice breaker.
          They'll get a kick outta that. I
          didn't even know those things were
          real. I thought they made that shit up
          for that movie? With that brawd and
          that kid? With those guys in that
          house?

          

                        GEORGE
          Panic Room?

          

                                                                        50.

          

          

                                JO JO
                    Naw, the other one.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Stop fuckin' around! This is serious
                    shit, here! Tell 'em we meet tomorrow
                    night. I'll call you with the
                    location.

          

          EXT. AUTO BODY -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          POV of binoculars as we see George exit the front of the auto body.

          

          INT. HOTEL ROOM -- SAME TIME


          
          Crew Cut looks through his binoculars as he continues to bounce up
          and down on his special shoe. He smiles at the site of George.

          

          INT. BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT, WAR ROOM -- NIGHT


          
          A table laden with clip boards, bagged evidence, reports, etc.
          Eunice finds a baggy with a tiny wooden bead in it. Greenly enters.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Tap's up and running on George's cell.

                                GREENLY
                    Rosary bead. They found it pushed into
                    the carpet near the victim. Father
                    McKinney wasn't wearing a rosary so
                    it's probably been there a while.
          Duffy comes in with a stack of papers.   He heaves it down.

          

                                DUFFY
                    The results on all 864 prints found at
                    the scene. All match churchgoers or
                    clergy but one. The partial on the
                    priest's watch is still unidentified.

          
          Eunice looks perplexed.   Dolly enters, sipping coffee.

          

                                EUNICE
                    That's horse shit. Everyone gets
                    printed nowadays. They're inking up
                    snotgobblers in kindergarten, now.

                                DOLLY
                    It's a brick wall anyway. We know
                    Napoleon was wearing gloves. Lab got
                    zilch off the chain and lock. The
                    pennies came up clean too.

          Greenly stares at her ass as she exits.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Aw, man. Daddy would knock that out
                    like Mike Tyson.

          
          Eunice suddenly re-enters the room with emergency.

          

                                 GREENLY (CONT'D)
                    What?!   I didn't say nothing!

          
          Eunice is absorbed a photo on the wall of the priest's hand.

          

                                EUNICE
                    McKinney wore his watch on his left
                    hand.

                    Where was this found exactly?!

          
          Duffy goes to a mock up of the victim's body position on the wall.

          

                                DUFFY
                    Right here, off his left elbow.   Where
                    are you going with this?

          

                                EUNICE
                    Dolly, get on the phone! Find out

          They all dart out. With fire in her eyes, she looks closely at a
          picture of the priest's wrist watch on the wall.

          INT. FLASHBACK, CHURCH -- NIGHT


          
          Crew Cut finishes ritualizing the priest and looks deeply at his
          victim. He removes a glove and places his tiny hand next to
          McKinney's large one. Silent rage. Bare handed, Crew Cut snatches
          the priest's rosary from about his wrist, breaking the bead chain.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM -- MORNING


          
          The brothers and Romeo walk through the Mausoleum. They approach a
          grave slate with respect. The name reads, "David Della Rocco."
          There is a picture of him. Murphy narrows his eyes and leans in.

          

                                MURPHY
                    What the...did they use his mug shot?

          

                                  CONNOR
                    What?   No.

          

                                MURPHY
                    You remember how he told us he was
                    embarrassed cuz the guy had to hold up
                    all his long hair behind his head?

                    Look at that.

          
          We see Murphy's finger denote a bad "airbrush" job.

          

                                MURPHY (CONT'D)
                    That's an arm.

          
          Connor looks close.

                                CONNOR
                    Oh...that's fuckin' harsh.

          
          The boys look at one another, then bust out laughing.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Y'er one of a kind, Roc.

                    You, sir, are no David Della Rocco.

          
          A sound. Instantly, the boys turn and level weapons. There stands
          ROY (32yrs) thick glasses, geeky. He drops his flowers.

          

                                                                          53.

                    Roy, it's an honor. Huge fan!

          
          The boys reholster and look to one another.    Disapproval.

          

                                CONNOR
                    We're developin' quite the cult
                    following in the old neighborhood.

          
          The boys continue to chat with Roy as Romeo answers his cell.

          The Manager lets George slip in. He steels into a tanning room.A
          Mexican towel boy has spied George. He picks up a phone...

          INT. MAUSOLEUM -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Romeo snaps his phone shut and turns to the boys.

                                                                       54.

                    Let's go.

          
          The three walk for the door, leaving Roy behind.

          

                                ROY
                    I, I didn't mean to...

                    breaking my balls, here and I get
                    second banana billing! I...

          

                                MURPHY
                    I, I, I. There is no "I" in team, ya
                    selfish prick.

          Moody music as our trio walks through the gravestones.

          

          INT. "TROPICAL TAN," TANNING ROOM -- NIGHT


          
          The brothers and Romeo sneak up to the tanning bed. George sings a
          Sinatra tune as his fat stomach props the cover up like a half open
          clamshell. Suddenly, Murphy leaps up and sits on the cover. George
          is being crushed beneath his weight. Connor kneels.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Lovely voice. We'd like ya ta sing for
                    us. What do ya say?
          George struggles and nods. Murphy hops off. George spills out, hot
          pink Speedos. On all fours and breathing heavy...

          

                                GEORGE
                    It's getting hard to be a fucking
                    gentleman of leisure, here!

          
          The boys pull weapons and throw him against the wall in a Jesus
          Christ pose, pinning his hands with their guns.

          

                                MURPHY
                    We want the shooter you motherfuckers
                    used on that priest.

          

                                GEORGE
                    I don't know who it is.

          

                                                                      55.

          

          
          The boys cock back the hammers on their weapons.

          

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    It's the truth! Concezio didn't tell
                    no one what he was doing cuz he knew
                    nobody would have o'kay'ed it! The
                    shooter's an independent contractor!
                    That's all I know!

          

                                CONNOR
                    Where's Yakavetta hidin'?

          

                                GEORGE
                    The Prudential! Fortieth floor!   Jesus
                    Christ!

          
          A ringing phone is heard. Romeo pulls George's Blackberry from
          nearby. He tosses it to Connor. Text message, "WHERE?"

          

                                CONNOR
                    You meeting someone tonight, George?

          

                                 GEORGE
                    Yeah.   The brugliones.

          

                                MURPHY
                    The what?

          

                                GEORGE
                    Yakavetta's racket chiefs. Street
                    guys.
                             (suddenly brightens)
                    Your kind of guys. You could take a
                    real bite outta crime here, huh? I
                    could help you.

                                CONNOR
                             (re: phone)
                    What's this?

          

                                GEORGE
                    Nobody forgot what you guys did to us
                    last time. They're staying indoors. I
                    give out the location an hour before.

          

                                ROMEO
                    My Uncle's place is closed tonight.    I
                    got the key.

          

                                MURPHY
                    It's down by the docks.   Dead as a
                    doornail at night.

          

                                                                           56.

          

          

                                CONNOR
                    Yeah. You could set off fourth of July
                    fireworks in dat place and nobody would
                    hear. How's Mexican for you, George?

          

                                GEORGE
                    No difference to me. I think I just
                    shit my Speedos, anyway.

          

          INT. EUNICE'S MERCEDES -- NIGHT


          
          Eunice drives.   Her cell rings.   She checks the I.D. then...

          

                                EUNICE
                    How do, David?

          
          Greenly is at his desk.   Alternating coverage.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Hey, DMV came up dry on the partial.
                    INTERpol's still working it. Should
                    only be another couple of hours.

          

                                 EUNICE
                    Lovely.   Anything else?

          

                                GREENLY
                    Yeah. Nothing big. We just dumped a
                    text message from George's cell. Just
                    two words. "El Cava." It's a Mexican
                    joint down by the docks. He sent it to
                    his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama. Guess
                    gangsters gotta eat too, huh?

          

                                EUNICE
                    I think I'll drop in on their supper,
                    see if I can shake them up a little.

          

                                GREENLY
                    You need a body guard?

          

                                EUNICE
                    No thank you, Mike Tyson.    Bye now.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Bye.

          
          She hangs up and we are left with Greenly.   Red handed.

          

                                GREENLY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, shit.

          

                                                                        57.

          

          

          INT. "EL CAVA," KITCHEN -- LATER


          
          Close up, three shot. George, looking very uncomfortable, is
          flanked by the brothers. He is positioned to covertly view the
          restaurant from the kitchen.

          
          We see NORTHSIDE BRUGLIONEs #1 - #3 and SOUTHSIDE BRUGLIONES #1 and
          #2 are at the bar.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Just two more to go. Uh...You guys are
                    gonna let me go, right?

          

                                MURPHY
                    We'll see, won't we.

          
          George grimaces.   Looks as if he'll cry.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Jesus, this is some embarrassing shit.

          
          We see the three men from behind. George is still in his Speedos,
          which now have a pronounced shit stain in back.

          

          INT. EL CAVA, BAR -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Romeo, frazzled and in a busboy uniform, has got two blenders of
          margaritas going. The Brugliones mow through appetizers.

          
          Northside doesn't interact with Southside and there is an empty bar
          stool between them. N.S. Bruglione #1 slides Romeo a platter.

          

                                N.S. BRUGLIONE #1
                    Yo, spicaroo. More nachos and mas
                    salsa, capisce?

                                S.S. BRUGLIONE #1
                    Hey and I need a refill there, pepe?

          

                                ROMEO
                    Si, muchachos.

          
          SOUTHSIDE BRUGLIONE #3 enters behind everyone.   All suddenly turn,
          going for their guns.

          

                                  S.S. BRUGLIONE #3
                    Whoa!    Easy...Jesus.

          
          Everyone calms. S.S. Bruglione #3 gives a respectful nod to the
          Northside guys but sits with his own.

          

                                                                         58.

          We do not see George just below frame as the boys are "working on
          him" in some way, putting on finishing touches. Romeo barrels in.

                    These dagos are getting antsy and I'm

          Jo Jo exits his Cadillac and walks toward El Cava.   There is a

          From behind we see the Old Man gardening.    He answers a ringing
          phone, nearby. We do not see his face.

          

          INT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          The following conversation is in Italian.

          

                                CREW CUT
                    He is not with them.

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Are you certain?

          

                                CREW CUT
                    Yes. It is only the sons. They have a
                    Spaniard with them. They will
                    slaughter everyone.

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Let them. If you kill the sons...the
                    father will come.

          
          Crew Cut develops a sinister smile.

          

          INT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Connor watches Jo Jo greet the others.    He turns to Romeo who is
          angrily cooking up a storm.

          

                                                                       59.

                    The gang's all here.

          
          Without missing a beat, Romeo slams the hot pans into a dish sink.
          He stands fuming with his hands on his hips.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Gimme my fucking bee bee gun.

                    Naw.   You've earned your stripes, Rome.

          
          Murphy throws him a .9 mm.   Romeo smiles.

                    So....where's Gorgeous?

          
          Suddenly, George comes rolling out of the kitchen, unconscious and
          tied, face down, to a bus cart. There is writing on his back.
          Everyone pulls their weapons and moves toward.

          

                                N.S. BRUGLIONE #2
                    What the fuck is going on, here?

          

                                S.S. BRUGLIONE #2
                    Where's that spic barkeep? Yo, Pepe!
                    Where you at?!

          
          As the gangsters achieve the cart, the brothers creep over the bar
          in the b.g. Brugliones look down on George, painted on his back...

          

                                S.S. BRUGLIONE #3
                    "Erin go brah?" What the hell does
                    that mean?
          Connor and Murphy are standing 25 feet behind them.

          

                                MURPHY
                    It's Irish for "You're fucked."

          
          Hard core music as the Brugliones turn in horror. Everyone begins
          firing and we have slow motion gunplay to pulsating music.

          
          Several are chewed up as chests explode and they are blown into
          George on the cart, knocking it over. George comes to.

          
          Romeo appears and tears in, sending several more crashing into the
          salad bar.

          
          Murphy, while firing, dives back over the bar as bottles explode.
          Connor rapid fires as he dives into a booth.

          The boys rise and lay out a second barrage, blasting the rest into
          buffet tables and a soda fountain. The music cuts.

          George bolts up.    The bus cart is still tied to his fat belly.

                    Uh, I've seen the light! You guys have
                    really turned me around on this! I'm

                    What do ya think? Let him go?

          
          Connor slips one bullet in a revolver, spins the barrel and snaps it
          shut. He points it to George's forehead. George weeps in earnest.

          

                                CONNOR
                    We'll let God decide if you get a
                    second chance.

          
          He slowly cocks the hammer back, pulls trigger, "click."

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    Well, praise the Lord.

          
          The terrified ex-gangster staggers toward an exit while wriggling
          out of his bonds. Just as he touches the door.

          

                                 CONNOR (CONT'D)

                    All good boys go to heaven.
          George nods and exits. Romeo is confused as our trio gathers.
          Connor tosses the bullet he palmed to Romeo and he nods.

          

                                MURPHY

          SLO-MO: Suddenly, Eunice bursts through the kitchen door and levels
          her weapon at the brothers and Romeo. Romeo levels back.

          

                                                                      61.

          

          
          Eunice fires as the boys dive on Romeo. Crew Cut is revealed behind
          our trio, firing from the shadows. Eunice and Crew Cut exchange
          fire as the boys reload.

          
          Eunice hits Crew Cut in the side. The assassin has a moment of
          outrage but persists firing as he makes a hasty exit.

          
          In the confusion it is a few moments before anyone realizes he is
          gone. Silence falls. Presently, Romeo and the boys bolt up. Romeo
          goes for the door and the boys level at Eunice.

                    I'll take these.

          
          The boys look to him.    He sniffles.   Red eyes.

          

                                                                       72.

          

          

                                MURPHY
                    Have you been crying again?

          
          Romeo snaps to him, eyes wide in challenge.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Yeah!  Tears of joy!
                              (to Dealer)
                    How much?

          

                                GUN DEALER
                    You guys are on the house.

          

                               MURPHY
                             (to Romeo)
                    Let's see.

          
          Romeo withdraws two gold plated .45's, intricately engraved, pearl
          handles with a Mexican flag. The boys snicker.

          

                                 ROMEO
                    What?

          

                                 CONNOR
                    Nothin'.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Are you saying I look gay?!

          

                                  MURPHY
                    No.    You just hail from a colorful...

          

                                ROMEO
                             (to Dealer)
                    You don't know me. You think these
                    make me look gay?
          Romeo poses.    The Dealer shrugs.

          

                                GUN DEALER
                    You look like you might have seen one
                    up close.

          

          EXT. COMMON HOME -- MORNING


          
          This is a common home at the end of a cul de sac. The Old Man picks
          up the paper on his front stoop and shuts the door.

          
          He opens the paper with shock. A big picture of Crew Cut on the
          front, "SAINTS INNOCENT, NEW SUSPECT IN PRIEST'S MURDER" He reads
          frantically. "New evidence discovered at the crime scene..."

          

                                                                       73.

          

          

                                 OLD MAN
                    Evidence?

          
          He ambles into the house and to a...

          

          INT. BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS


          
          The Old Man moves to Crew Cut's bedside. He sees the rosary about
          the slumbering man's neck and rips it off. Crew Cut bolts awake!

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Foolish, arrogant boy!   What have you
                    done?!

          
          He whips Crew Cut with the rosary, until he cowers in the corner,
          weeping profuse apologies in Italian.

          

          INT. PANIC ROOM -- AFTERNOON


          
          Monitors show angles of the apartment outside. This small space is
          equipped for single living. Yakavetta is frazzled, baggy eyed in a
          robe. Jimmy the Gofer sits quietly as Concezio babbles to himself.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    That wiley old fox not as clever as we
                    thought. Or maybe he played me from the
                    git. Y-you think he played me?

          

                                JIMMY
                    Uh, Boss. Maybe you aught not to be
                    telling me this stuff. I'm just...

          
          Concezio smacks him across the face.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    A little sensitivity, huh? You
                    heartless cocksucker! I need to
                    vindicate my feelings here! I can't
                    tell those goombas outside! They'll
                    serve up my balls over a plate of
                    fucking spaghetti!

          

          INT. LUXURY APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          The Capos huddle up.   Hushed tones.

          

                                CAPO #4
                    Fuck that. We got a mutiny on our
                    hands. Every ten cent wanna be with a
                    gun is moving on us all over town.

          

                                                                           74.

          

          

                                CAPO #3
                    Yeah and our fearless leader ain't even
                    come out of his little pussy room yet.

          
          With this, the panic room door slides open and Concezio emerges
          holding a bag. He dumps a bunch of cell phones on the coffee table.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    I want each of you to call your top
                    button man. The best you got. I want
                    them all here tonight. We rip this
                    city a new asshole. It's time for us
                    to reconnoiter our strength on the
                    streets. We seize the day starting
                    now...Carpel Tunnel, gentlemen, Carpel
                    Tunnel.

          
          All are relieved and words of approval flow.

          

                                CAPO #5
                    Glad to see you back among the living,
                    Boss.

          
          Nearby, Jimmy knocks over a bottle of wine, CRASH! Concezio dives
          back into the panic room. The door slides shut. DISSOLVE TO...

          

          EXT. THE PRUDENTIAL BUILDING -- NIGHT


          
          Dolly drives a laundry truck into the Pru's loading dock area.

          

          INT. LAUNDRY TRUCK -- NIGHT


          
          Dolly backs it up to the dock and pulls to a stop.   He turns.

          

                                 DOLLY
                    God speed.
          Romeo, in a laundry uniform, emerges from the back pushing a loaded
          laundry cart. He enters a...

          

          INT. UTILITY HALL -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          At the hall's opposing end, two maintenance workers move toward.
          Romeo sees and quickly puts his head down. Soon, Romeo and the
          maintenance men converge. They turn, entering opposing elevators.

          

          INT. ROMEO'S ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS


          
          As the doors close, Romeo looks into the opposing elevator. The
          maintenance men are Duffy and Greenly, ball caps, duffel bags.

          

                                                                       75.

          

          
          As the elevator ascends, Romeo swipes off the laundry, pulls the
          false top. The brothers pop out in their usual garb. Weapons
          emerge and they gear up. Romeo looks unsure...

          

                                MURPHY
                     What.

          

                                ROMEO
                     Nothing.

                                 ROMEO

                     heavy shit.

                     Yeah, but we're going off a new script
                     here. I'm just having a...period of

                     gettin' yer ass beat!

                     rollin' with no health insurance! Just
                     let me do my thing. I'm absorbing this.

                     This is not the time for you to be

                     Grande Camens!

          
          Ding!   Romeo has a look of dread.

          

                                                                        76.

                    This is you. Be on time.

          
          Romeo firms himself up as the door opens.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I'll be there.

          
          Romeo exits with the cart. The boys remain.    The doors close.
          Connor and Murphy look at each other.

          FLASH TO WHITE...

          

          INT. LUXURY APARTMENT -- NIGHT


          
          A demolished environment. The towering windows are blown out,
          providing a threatening view of the city below. Here, Eunice
          stands, looking out over the panorama.

          

                                EUNICE
                             (to herself)
                    On a sultry Saturday in September the
                    Saints saved seventeen souls...try
                    saying that five times fast.

          
          She turns and walks the marble floor which is like a runway, lined
          with pulverized statues. A long table of ravaged food extends.
          Crime scene personnel toil. Ritualized bodies everywhere.   Greenly
          is by the panic room. He pushes the "talk" button.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Come on. There's nothing to be afraid
                    of. It's all over.

                             (TURNS)
                    He won't come out.

          
          He joins Dolly and Duffy who stand on the periphery. Eunice is dead
          center, absorbing the scene when suddenly, FBI Agent JOHN KUNTSLER
          barrels in with his G-MEN #1 - #3.

          

                                KUNTSLER
                    Special Agent Bloom! You are hereby
                    relieved of all obligation to this
                    investigation.

          He holds up his I.D.   A collective groan from crime scene personnel.

          

                                KUNTSLER (CONT'D)
                    That's right, kids. This crime scene
                    is now under the full jurisdiction of
                    your beloved federal government. As of
                    now, you will all report to me, Special
                    Agent John Kuntsler.

          
          The detectives look to Kuntsler's G-men as if squaring off.

          

                                KUNTSLER (CONT'D)
                    Don't let us interrupt you. Just don't
                    forget to turn over everything you
                    find. We have people standing by ready
                    to take credit for all your hard work.

          
          He chuckles as all return to work.   Kuntsler turns to Eunice.

          

                                KUNTSLER (CONT'D)
                    So, how ya doin', Bloomy?

                    Just fine...Cunty.

          
          Kuntsler's shit eating grin disappears.   He leans in.   Hushed tones.

          

                                KUNTSLER
                    Nice little science project you got

                    sprinkles on shit, Bloom, but it's
                    still shit. So, you and your Keystone
                    Cops can all go home now and let the
                    professionals handle this?

                    Boy. I'd love to hear a gen-u-wine
                    professional's assessment of a crime
                    scene. How 'bout you, detectives?

          
          Dolly, Duffy and Greenly chorus the affirmative. Kuntsler looks
          unsure then phonies up some bravado. Looks around...

          

                                KUNTSLER
                    O'kay. Seems pretty obvious. The door
                    was broken down. We've got our point

          boots, cowboy hat and a pair of gleaming six guns on her hips.

          
          With the brim of her hat slung low, Eunice bursts into twirling
          gunplay with her Colts. She spins them all around, flipping them,
          catching them, etc. She holsters and stops.

          Their momentum carries them, sliding on either side of the table.

          pace with the boys as all three let the led out.

          The place is empty except for Connor and Murphy having a celebratory
          shot at the bar and cleaning their weapons.

          

                                MURPHY
                    When's Romeo returnin' to the "hide
                    out?'

          

                                CONNOR
                    Soon as he's done apologizin' to his
                    uncle for wreckin' his restaurant.

          

                                MURPHY
                    And he should be sorry.   The
                    disrespect.

          
          They chuckle as a loud knocking is heard.   As Doc peeps through the
          spy hole and unchains the front doors...

          

                                DOC
                    Hold your damn horses!

          
          He lets Greenly in and locks it behind him. Greenly takes a few
          steps in, stops and grabs his crotch with both hands.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Sack-o-matic, I said!

          
          As the boys guffaw, BOOM! A shotgun blast through the door sends
          Greenly to the floor with a gaping wound in his back.

          
          Crew Cut bursts in with a smoking pig nose shotgun hanging from a
          shoulder strap. He pulls two Sigs and rapid fires at the brothers.

          
          The boys jump over the bar frantically try to reassemble their
          weapons. Connor and Murphy check their clips.

          

                                MURPHY
                    I got nothin'!

          
          Connor racks his .50 cal and looks in the chamber.

          

                                CONNOR
                    One in the hole.

          
          They see a shotgun behind the bar. Murphy grabs it.   Just as they
          are about to stand, they hear Doc cry out.

          

                               DOC
                    Boys!

          

                                                                       91.

          

          
          They stand and level. Crew Cut has Doc from behind, .9mm to his
          temple. Thick accent...

          

                                CREW CUT
                    Put dem down! Throw dem over!

          
          The boys do not flinch. Crew Cut pushes his gun into Doc's temple
          hard. He cries out in pain.

          

                                CREW CUT (CONT'D)
                    Throw dem over!

          
          The boys toss their guns over the bar. Crew Cut levels toward them,
          holding Doc in place. He whispers in Doc's ear.

          

                                CREW CUT (CONT'D)
                    Brothers, eh? Which one first?      This
                    one?
                             (re: Murphy)
                    Dee other, eh?

          
          He cocks back his hammer. A silence POP! rings out from the
          shadows. Crew Cut's hand is hit. He drops, crying out in pain.

          
          SLO-MO: Poppa M emerges from the shadows and moves to Crew Cut with
          a smoking, silenced Walther pistol in hand.

          
          The brothers have just a moment of shock before Greenly chokes up
          some blood. They jump the bar and rush to him.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Jesus Christ!

          

                                 CONNOR
                    Doc!   Call da fuckin' ambulance!
          As they hold Greenly and beg him to hold on, we move to Poppa M
          standing over Crew Cut. Crew Cut looks up at him in awe.

          

                                CREW CUT
                    You.

          

                                POPPA M
                    Where is the Old Man?

          

                                CREW CUT
                    Never.

          
          Poppa M pulls two .38 revolvers. He snaps the rotary chambers out,
          puts one bullet in each gun, spins the chambers and snaps them shut.
          He holds them out to Crew Cut. The boys weep, oblivious to this.

          

                                                                         92.

          

          

                                MURPHY
                    Just hold on.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Hang in there, brother.     They're
                    comin'.

          
          Greenly struggles to speak.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Naw, boys...it's over. Don't
                    worry...proudest day of my life.

          
          He seizes violently and dies. The brothers are in anguish. Crew
          Cut picks a .38 and stands. He and Poppa M level to each other's
          foreheads. Crew Cut is excited. Poppa M is calm, tranquil. The
          brothers bolt up in shock.

          

                                  BROTHERS
                    Da!

          

                                  POPPA M
                    Easy, boys.

          
          The boys watch in horror, trying to figure it out. Poppa M motions
          for his opponent to go first. Crew Cut cocks his hammer back with a
          "click." The brother's eyes go wide.

          

                                MURPHY
                    What the fuck's he doin'?

          
          Crew Cut pulls the trigger, "click!"

          

                                BROTHERS

                    JESUS CHRIST!
          Connor rushes over and grabs up the shotgun.

          

                                CONNOR
                    I'm gonna blow this mother fucker's
                    brains out, right now!

          
          He cocks it and levels to Crew Cut's head.

          

                                  POPPA M

                    CONNOR!

          
          Connor stops.   Poppa M holds out his free hand.   Halt.

          

                                POPPA M (CONT'D)
                    Son...Daddy's workin'.

          
          Connor lowers the gun.    Poppa M pulls back the hammer, "click."

          

                                                                           93.

          

          

                                 POPPA M (CONT'D)
                     Where is he?

          
          Crew Cut is unsure of himself. He thinks. Shakes his head.       The
          brothers focus on Poppa M's gun as he tenses on the trigger.

          

                                  CONNOR AND MURPHY

                                (WHISPER)
                     Come on.

          
          Crew Cut clenches up, bracing for impact. Poppa M pulls, "click."
          The brothers drop to their knees and pray hard. Crew Cut recovers.
          He smiles, pulls back the hammer. In Italian...

          

                                 CREW CUT
                     Make me famous.

          
          "Click!"   Crew Cut's eyes widen in fear.

          

                                  POPPA M
                                (pulling back hammer)
                     Where?

          
          The brothers pray faster as Crew Cut thinks in horror.

          

                                   CREW CUT

                     FUCK YOU!!!

          
          BOOM!   Crew Cut falls dead.

          

          INT. UNCLE CESAR'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- LATER


          
          The boys sit at the kitchen table with Poppa M.      Romeo is propped up
          on a counter, nearby. Cesar sets out coffee.

          

                                 POPPA M
                     I'm so sorry, boys.      This is all my
                     fault.

          
          Cesar takes Romeo and leaves, giving them some privacy.

          

                                 MURPHY
                     What are ya talkin' about, Da?

          
          Poppa M strokes the faded "butterfly" tattoo on the back of his
          hand. Presently...

          

                                 POPPA M
                     I was an immigrant to the U.S. in 1958.
                     I was sixteen. I came to New York
                     where my father, Jacob MacManus, was a
                     cobbler.

                                 (MORE)

          

                                                                       94.

                                POPPA M (CONT'D)
                    Had a little shop and I was to learn
                    the family business. Mafia was
                    everywhere in those days.

          

          INT. FLASHBACK, COBBLER SHOP -- DAY


          
          Italian THUGS #1-4 talk to JACOB MacManus (43yrs). In these
          flashbacks we will refer to young Poppa M as "Noah." NOAH (16)
          works in back but watches.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    Simple extortion...protection money.
                    But your grandfather was proud.

          

                                JACOB
                    I can't help ya with dat, lads. Ya got
                    problems with your shoes, I'd be happy
                    to have a look, got fair prices.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    I just...watched.

          
          Noah stands shaking as he watches his father beat to death. We fade
          into later as he holds his father's body, wailing. An Italian kid
          with a leg brace, LOUIE (18yrs), staggers in and hobbles to Noah.

          

                                LOUIE
                    Il ochio de dio! We gotta call the
                    polizia, Noah! We gotta call somebody!

          

          EXT. FUNERAL -- MORNING


          
          Noah, Louie and a priest are the only ones present at this modest
          affair. Louie weeps. Noah is emotionless.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    I buried my father, then I buried the
                    men who killed him. Louie, my best
                    friend, helped me...

          

          INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT


          
          Noah holds a knife to Thug #1's throat at a card table. He has THUG
          #2's head pinned to the table top with a .38 cal. Nearby, Louie
          holds a large .44 magnum with shaking hands. Seated Thugs #3 and #4
          hands raised, are scared as they look at Noah's dead eyes.

          

                                THUG #3
                    Come on, kid. It was an accident.
                    We can work dis out. Whatever you want.

          

                                                                         95.

          

          

                                THUG #4
                    He ain't gonna do shit.
                             (to Thug #3)
                    I'll take two.

          

                                THUG #3
                    What da fuck's da matter with you?
                    Can't you see...

          

                                THUG #4
                    I see just fine. Deal.

          

                                THUG #1
                             (in Italian, to Louie)
                    You're Italian, kid. Help us out here.
                    Put one in the back of his head and you
                    get anything you want!

          

                                LOUIE
                    I, I, I...am his friend.

          

                                THUG #4
                    Fuck him and fuck his friend. Deal the
                    cards! He ain't got the balls.

          
          Noah shoots Thug #2 then cuts Thug #1's throat. The other Mafiosi
          scream in horror. Louie kneels and weeps. Noah shoots Thug #3 in
          the heart and calmly takes aim at Thug #4. He shoots him in the
          throat and he is blown to the floor, grasping his bleeding neck.

          
          Noah rounds the table and takes aim. The man is choking on his own
          blood. Noah slowly lowers his gun and just watches.

          

          INT. COBBLER SHOP -- AFTERNOON


          
          Louie works on a pair of shoes.   They are both a bit older.

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    It started out slowly. Just the ones
                    who were a threat to us.

          
          MAFIOSO #1 and #2 talk to the stoic Noah.

          

                                MAFIOSO #1
                    Come on, kid. It's good for you, good
                    for us. We'll move it right out the
                    back of the place.

          

                                MAFIOSO #2
                    It'll never touch you. You got the
                    word of the Bonnavese family on that.

          
          No response from Noah.   Dead eyes.

          

                                                                           96.

          

          

                                MAFIOSO #1
                    What's da matter with you, eh?

          
          We see Louie peeking through the curtains.

          

                                LOUIE

                             (WHISPERING)
                    Easy, Noah...easy friend.

          

                                MAFIOSO #2
                    What are you, stupid or something?

          
          He smacks Noah across the face.

          

                                                          CUT TO:

          

          EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT


          
          Noah and Louie bury the bodies of Mafioso #1 and #2.      Louie stops
          and rests. He watches Noah and thinks.

          

          INT. COBBLER SHOP -- DAY


          
          "CLOSED" sign in the door.   Noah and Louie eat sandwiches.

          

                                POPPA M
                    Then one day...

          

                                LOUIE
                    Why should we not help others who
                    suffer these Mafia thugs?

          
          Noah puts down his sandwich. Louie talks to Noah with passion,
          m.o.s. and he listens while nodding his head.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    Then it began.

          
          Over dialogue and music we see the following images...

          
          Noah cuts out a chalk sketch on a large sheet of shoe leather.

          
          Louie helps Noah make a "serious looking" leather vest.

          
          Louie hobbles in with a sack.   He dumps a bevy of handguns on a
          table. All different makes.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    Louie would pick the marks and plan
                    everything in detail.

          
          Louie draws a map on a note pad and speaks m.o.s.

          

                                                                       97.

          

          
          Holsters and bullet belts are sewn into the vest.

          
          Noah loads the vest with guns as Louie tightens the buckles, stands
          back and looks Noah over. Ominous.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    And I would go in and do the jobs.

          
          A mob boss and two body guards wait for an elevator. The doors
          open. Insides is Noah, dark jacket, English Mac (hat). He opens
          his coat, revealing the vest. He draws two weapons, executes them
          all and calmly hits a button. The doors close.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    I would execute, over and over again,
                    those who had taken my father from me.

          
          We do a montage of Noah killing Mafiosi in many different ways.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    So it went for years.

          

          EXT. BACK TO PRESENT, KITCHEN -- LATER


          
          We pan to the gaping mouthed brothers.

          

                                  MURPHY
                    Jesus.

                                POPPA M
                    Back in '75, I did a hit, came out and
                    the police were waitin' for me. He set
                    me up, 25 to life.

                                MURPHY
                    Wait...why did he set you up?

          

                                POPPA M
                    Can't wait ta ask him.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Why didn't ya flip on him? Cut down
                    yer time? The guy fucked ya.

          

                                  POPPA M
                    I couldn't.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Why the hell not?

          A picture of a woman with two babies is slammed to the glass.

                      He'd learned of the birth of my sons.

          
          Connor and Murphy hang their heads.      Connor looks up.

          

                                  CONNOR
                      Do you know Louie's full name?

          

                                  POPPA M
                      Aye.

          
          The boys look at each other.

          

          EXT. SIDE WALK OUTSIDE MCGINTY'S -- SAME TIME


          
          Greenly's bagged body is about to be loaded into an ambulance.
          Eunice stops the EMTs, unzips it and touches his face. She weeps
          and then crushes into Dolly's chest.

          
          He holds her and cries too as Duffy watches in anguish. Eunice's
          cell rings. She ignores it and Dolly pulls it from her pocket and
          tosses it to Duffy, never letting go of Eunice.

          

                                  DUFFY
                      Hello.

          Connor hands the phone to Poppa M.      DISSOLVE TO...

          

          INT. POLICE STATION -- LATER


          
          Eyes still red from crying, Eunice covertly works at a computer.
          She types. Soon a picture of the Roman comes on up. Eunice looks
          at his face with trepidation and then...

          

                                  EUNICE
                      I hope they do it slow...you piece of

          INT. ILLEGAL BOOK -- LATER


          
          CLOSE ON:   An old time phone being carried to a rear table.

          

                                                                           99.

          

          
          We drift by a poker game and young Italian thugs, betting horses and
          sports. T.V.s and smoke are abundant.

          
          The phone is set on a back table. PATRONAZZI (75yrs), an ancient
          Italian man drinking espresso picks up.

          

                                  PATRONAZZI
                    Si.

          
          It's the Old Man.    In Italian, alternating coverage...

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Hello, old friend.

          

                                  PATRONAZZI
                    Many years.    Are you in need?

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Yes. I am making marinara and alas, I
                    have run out of tomatoes. To help an
                    old friend...how many can you spare?

          
          Patronazzi looks up.    Slowly, many of the young thugs turn.

          

                                PATRONAZZI
                    I am in good supply of tomatoes.

          

          INT. UNCLE CESAR'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT


          
          The boys slumber. We push in on their staggered profiles.       They
          simultaneously take a deep breath. FLASH TO WHITE...

          

          INT. DREAM SEQUENCE, FENWAY PARK -- DAY


          
          The boys stand in a huge cement access corridor of Fenway Park.        It
          is empty and quiet as a church. A man walks toward them. They
          struggle to see. Presently, we reveal ROCCO. He passes them.

          

                                   ROCCO
                    Come on.     The game's starting.

          
          The brothers follow him.    Red Sox emblems are abundant.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    Funny thing about the Red Sox. We
                    never gave up hope, y'know? It's what
                    kept us going all those years. And
                    they did it. They finally fuckin' did
                    it. What are we all gonna do now, huh?

          
          They emerge into the stands.    Perfect baseball field, empty park.

          

                                                                       100.

          

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    I lost a lot of money on 'em. But I
                    gotta admit. Always felt
                    better...betting the underdogs.

          
          Rocco walks on.   The boys follow.

          

          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          The boys stand on the mound.   Rocco walks a circle around it.

          

                                ROCCO
                    So, how's things going?

          
          The boys drop their heads.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    Yeah. I know. It's rough having your
                    faith shaken.

          
          The brothers have a pained expression.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    But it happens to all of us.

                             (BEAT)
                    You know what's always tripped me out?
                    How hundreds of years ago, a bunch of
                    desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships,
                    crossed the ocean blue. They had no
                    clue what was on the other side of it.
                    Took real balls. But they sailed into
                    infinity and made it all the way to the
                    shores of the New fucking World...
                             (re: surroundings)
                    ...and all they had was their faith.
                    I'm always surprised how so many people
                    miss the simple fact that faith...is
                    the reason all of us are even here.
                    You can't underestimate the power of
                    it. Shit, you were the ones that
                    taught me that.

          
          Rocco looks to his left and right.   Secretly.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    Listen, your my boys so I'm gonna give
                    you some inside. The Sox are gonna do
                    it again this year. The line in Vegas
                    is huge. Put everything you got on it.

          
          The boys look to each other.   Eyes wide.

          

                                                                       101.

                                CONNOR
                    You're sure, Roc? You know this?

          
          Rocco smiles.

          

                                  ROCCO
                    No...I   just have faith. And for a
                    second   there, you almost did too.
                    Y'see,   it's contagious. And if enough
                    people   catch it...look out, baby.

          
          A roaring cheer arises, shaking the very foundations of the arena.
          The boys turn in awe. The stands are still empty.

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER


          
          They jolt awake and look to each other.

                    minutes from here. Better go quick. I
                    logged on to an FBI database to get the

          She looks at him as her eyes well up with tears.

          She is overcome and weeps.   Poppa M holds her.

          Kuntsler pours a coffee. G-man #2 comes in holding a piece of paper.

                    I want that little Bayou Bitch in here.
                    Something stinks about this whole

          Poppa M, the brothers and Romeo walk kneel at the altar before a
          memorial to McKinney: Candles, pictures, cards, flowers etc.

          
          As they pray, a dozen or so church patrons who are in the pews begin
          to realize who they are. Our foursome stands and walks back down
          the aisle. They make eye contact with a few people.

          
          When the Saints are gone, the churchgoers gather in the aisle and
          stare at the front door in disbelief. Excited whisperings. One guy
          opens his cell phone. Then he thinks...and closes it.

          The Roman's common, two story home looms in the b.g. at the end of a
          cul-de-sac. Walking down the middle of the street, is Poppa M:
          black trench, hat, dark shades. He opens the door and enters the...

          

          INT. COMMON HOME -- CONTINUOUS


          
          Poppa M listens, far off scratchy music. He moves quietly through
          the house, stopping at the foot of the stairs...listens. He removes
          his rosary, hangs it on the banister and moves on, pulling a weapon.

          

          INT. GREENHOUSE -- SAME TIME


          
          The Roman, swirls a tomato in a plate of salt and bites into it.
          Beside him, a horned phonograph plays 40's Jazz. Behind him, we see
          that the greenhouse is merely an extension of the home.

          
          The Roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame. Across
          the pit, an empty chair. Extended before him is a stunning garden,
          standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers,
          cobblestone walks, fountains. The center piece is a Turkish pool
          with pure white Lillys afloat.
          Poppa M slowly approaches the Roman from behind. He holsters his
          weapon and sits. The Roman halts the phonograph.

          

                                POPPA M
                    Hello, Louie.

                    We haven't much time.

          
          The Roman smiles and gestures the surroundings.

          

                                                                        104.

                                POPPA M
                    You know my reasons.   You know why I

                    Then explain this.

          
          The Roman flicks a photo over. It lands in Poppa M's lap.    It is
          the picture we saw earlier. A woman holding two babies.

          

                                ROMAN (CONT'D)

                    father. They have inherited your

          Poppa M looks at the photo deeply.

          Poppa "M" stands, throwing open his trench and revealing his leather
          vest, a six gun rig in the front. The Roman in awe.

          
          The double doors crash in and men barrel through as Poppa M turns,
          pulls two weapons and fires upon them, hitting one.

          
          The boys crash through the glass ceiling of the greenhouse on either
          side of Poppa M. They fire as they fall, hit the ground and roll.

          
          Romeo bursts into the fray from inside the house, blasting away with
          his gold .45's, a shotgun hanging on his back.

          
          The garden is being torn apart as the brothers, Poppa M and Romeo
          hit their marks and the hit squad returns fire. The boys dive
          behind fountains which are then pulverized.

          
          The gun battle rages around the Roman who remains seated in the very
          mouth of madness. His heart breaks as his sanctuary is shredded.

          
          Romeo fires as a large rack of wine behind him is torn apart.

          
          Murphy fires over a statue and bodies crash into the pool.

          
          Connor stands, firing in a Jesus Christ pose.

          
          Poppa M drops his empty weapons and pulls two more, laying down a
          second barrage.

          
          Romeo is simultaneously hit in the leg and shoulder. He falls,
          dropping his .45s. He struggles to fire the shotgun.

          
          Poppa M takes one in the chest.

          
          Connor is wounded in the shoulder but continues firing.

          
          Murphy is hit in the leg but continues firing.
          The boys and Romeo manage to take out the last of the Thugs, who are
          blasted into the Turkish pool. It is over. The music fades...

          They get him to his feet. Poppa M turns to the Roman. He levels a
          revolver toward the seated man. With his last bit of strength...

                     I'll see you in a minute, Louie.

          
          Poppa M fires one right between the Roman's eyes.    Poppa M crumbles.
          His sons lay him down.

          

                                 CONNOR
                     Oh, no, no, no.

          
          Poppa M smiles as he looks up at the sun through the blown out glass
          ceiling. A plume of butterflies escape.

          

                                 POPPA M
                     It's a beautiful day.

                     Aye.    It is...it is, Da.

          
          He dies. The brothers weep. Nearby, Romeo is slumped and bleeding,
          on the edge of consciousness. A strange calm comes over the
          brothers as they stand and look to one another.

          
          S.W.A.T. can be heard surrounding the perimeter. The boys look to
          Romeo. He smiles at them and nods. The brothers turn and walk into
          the house. The echoed voice of Poppa M.

          

                                 POPPA M V.O.
                     And shepherds we shall be...

          Cops level over their squads.      Media descends.

          

                                 POPPA M V.O.

          SLO-MO:   the boys move toward the front door.

          

                                 POPPA M V.O.
                     Power hath descended forth from Thy

                      ...that our feet may swiftly carry out

          The door opens and the boys walk out, guns down.

          

                                  POPPA M V.O.
                      So, we shall flow a river forth to
                      Thee...

          

          INT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Romeo raises a weak hand as S.W.A.T. moves cautiously through a
          battle field of dead bodies.

          

                                  POPPA M V.O.
                      ...and teeming with souls shall it ever
                      be...

          

          EXT. FRONT LAWN -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          SLO-MO: The boys stop in the middle of the lawn and look out over
          the massive presence. A policeman yells in his bullhorn, m.o.s.

          
          SLO-MO, CLOSE ON:    The brothers' guns fall to the grass.

          

                                  POPPA M V.O.
                      In Nomini Patri...
          SLO-MO:    The brothers drop to their knees.

          

                                  CONNOR
                      ...e fili...

          
          SLO-MO:    The brothers put their hands behind their heads.

          

                                  MURPHY
                      ...e Spiritu Sancti.

          INT. T.V. TALK SHOW, "BOSTON BANTER" -- DAY


          
          Five guests, BALLPLAYER, COMEDIAN, ACTOR, POLITICIAN and a HOST are
          seated in the midst of an "audience in the round." The format is
          similar to "Politically Incorrect."

          

                                   BALLPLAYER
                       It doesn't change anything. What they
                       did is still more important. It's
                       still the issue.

          

                                                                       111.

          

          

                                COMEDIAN
                    They deserve medals.

          

                                POLITICIAN
                    They deserve the death penalty.

          
          Arguments erupt.

          

          INT. PRISON HOSPITAL -- DAY


          
          The arguments are heard as the boys awaken in their hospital beds at
          the same moment.

          

                                PRIEST V.O.
                    Only God can judge!

          

                                ACTOR V.O.
                    Oh, save it for group, father!

          
          They are bandaged and hooked to machinery.

          

                                BALLPLAYER
                    Well, I know this! They certainly
                    don't belong in prison.

          
          The boys turn and look out the windows at a group of cons in the
          yard, staring up at them.

          

                                HOST V.O.
                    Oh, I don't know.

          
          Connor and Murphy's faces split with evil grins.   They mimic guns at
          the cons and gesture as if shooting them.

          

                                HOST V.O. (CONT'D)
                    Maybe that's just the place for them.

          FADE TO BLACK...
