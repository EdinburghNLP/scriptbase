          Climate. Nations. Borders. All
          were in upheaval. Humanity itself
          turned as violent as the planet.
          Civilization threatened to collapse.
          And then... a solution was found.
          The crumbling, teetering legal
          system was merged with the
          overburdened police, creating a
          powerful and efficient hybrid.
          Trained equally in jurisprudence
           and combat, these new guardians (X)
           of Society could dispense both
           justice and punishment. They were (X)
           police, jury and executioner, all
           in one. They were... The Judges.

          Zed FIRES out the window. Reggie happily joins, then the
          others. Finally Twist shrugs, FIRES too.

          Hershey nods. Brisco, eager to prove himself, steps in front
          of Dredd at the Heavenly Block entrance.

          Dredd pushes Brisco behind Hershey. Turns toward Heavenly as

          Order, order! As presiding Justice,
          I only vote to break a tie. But
          I wish to address the question of
          Judge Griffin's crime package. Is
          there any objection?

                         GRIFFIN
          This entire body owes its very
          existence to you, Chief Justice.

           I can ' t imagine anyone having an
           objection.

          America etched on t h e great DAIS. Only a few lights stand out (X)
          on all the conti nent: MEGA-CITY ONE; MEGA-CITY TWO; TEXAS CITY; (X)
           and the ASPEN PENAL C OLONY. All the rest is labeled THE CURSED (X)

          EARTH. (X)
           Fargo stands, eyes blazing with intelligence and intensity. (X)
          we sense t h at we are observing a Lion in Winter. And the lion
          can still roar.

                         FARGO
          This body is not the first assembly ('
          to think that more laws and fewer
          choices will bring peace and order. (X)
          That delusion has been tried and
          failed before. If the citizens of
          Mega-City are demanding more control
          of their lives, that's not a threat
          - it's a signal! A signal to open
          the windows of our society and let
          it: breathe -
          (a look to Griffin)
          Not to bolt the door and throw away
          the key! My fellow Judges, I was (X)
          barely in my teens when I put on
          this badge. When the time comes
          for me to take it off... let me do
          it. knowing that it stood for
          Freedom... and not for Repression.
          He sits down. Clearly he has changed the mood of the room.

                         JUDGE GRIFFIN
          Once again, Chief Justice,'you have
          served as a moral compass for all

          CAMERA WIDENS as the Council Chamber doors OPEN. The Judges
          come out. Griffin comes over, watches with Dredd. Dredd
          stiffens at the approach of his superior. Griffin silently
          indicates for him to stand at ease.

                         HAMMOND(CONT'D)

                         CENTRAL(CONT'D)
          Nine years ago, the Lawgiver Model
          Two replaced the Lawgiver Model One.
          The difference lies in two areas:
          The computer chip and the ammunition
          coding. Like the Model one, the
          computer chip recognizes the
          thumbcode of all Judges. Judges
          may use each other's firearms; but
          a suspect dare not use a Judge's
          .weapon against "a Judge.
          ANIMATION reminds us of this in non-gory fashion.

                         CENTRAL(CONT'D)
          However, the ammunition coding in
          the Model Two is not cued to the (X)
          thumbcode recognition chip.
          Instead, it is coded to the personal
          DNA of the Judge using the weapon.
