  1     INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
     The following is shot DOCUMENTARY-STYLE.
     A GIRLS VOLLEYBALL GAME has just ended. It was a big game. Some kind of
     championship.

     ONE TEAM is CELEBRATING -- jumping up and down, squealing and
     hugging each other. We are focused on the bench of the TEAM TRAT
     LOST. They're very sad -- several are crying.
     One girl, in particular, (AMY) is really sobbing. She's sweat-
     stained, tired and just blubbering. Stuff's coming out of her eyes,
     her nose, her mouth and the camera is seeing it all.

     The COACH, a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls -- Amy in
     particular.

                         COACH
               You quit! You gave up!

     He KICKS a CHAIR.

     Now Amy is really a mess. She's crying, coughing, shaking.

                         COACH (CONT'D)
                    (right in Amy's face)
               You quit!!

     The Coach storms off.

                         COACH (CONT'D)
               Qutters! ... Quitters!

     Amy is wailing and choking on her own tears.

     This IMAGE FREEZES.

                         TERRY (V.O.)
               And that would be it. I don't
               think you need any narration at
               all. Just end it right there.

     REVEAL


  2     INT. OFFICE - DAY
     BEGIN CREDITS

     We're in New York City. We're in the conference room of a modestly
     successful cable TV station called "Real TV." The people are
     young, energetic, clever. It's crowded, noisy -the furniture is
     beaten up, bulletin boards cover the walls, with large index cards
     all over them.
     This room is not for show -- work gets done here.

     SEVEN OR EIGHT PEOPLE are present. One of them is CYNTHIA REED.
     She's the boss.

                         TERRY
                    (to Cynthia)
               What do you think?

                         CYNTHIA
               It's horrible, it's depressing, I
               love it. What else?

                         ALICE
               I want to re-pitch that pregnancy
               idea. Find six women early in their
               pregnancies and follow them all right
               through to the births.

                         KEITH
                    (negative)
               Yeah, when all that stuff comes
               out.

     Mixed reactions, mostly negative.

                         CYNTHIA
               I have an idea.

     IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
               This is something I've been thinking
               about for a long time. We're "Real
               TV" right? I mean that's the name
               of the station.

     AGREEMENT

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
               So let's go real. We find someone.
               Just a regular person, someone. And
               we put their life on television -
               live... all day long.

     Silence. No movement at all.

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
               Calm down.

                         KEITH
               What do you mean, like PBS did in
               the seventies? What was that
               family?

                         GREG
               The Louds.

                         KEITH
               Yeah.

                         CYNTHIA
               No. We go way beyond that. We
               don't film it and edit it and put
               it on later. We go on the air
               live every morning and the show
               goes off each night, when our
               subject goes to bed. In between,
               we're on live all day, every day -
               the same person, -- for
                    (shrugs)
               let's say a month.

     No one is wild for this. Some hate it -- some are unconvinced.

                         FELICIA
               That's not a show that's a
               surveillance camera.

                         GREG
               You can't do that.

                         CYNTHIA
               The hell we can't. Look, the
               beauty of being a cable 
               channel is we can take chances. I've
               thought about this and I'm
               telling you, I think this can
               make a noise. A loud one. There
               are twelve thousand channels.
               You've got to do something that
               says "Look at me!" Hell, people
               look at fish tanks all day. This
               is people!
                    (more firmly)
               Someone's real life -- an TV, all day
               long - live... And, you know what?
               I'm doing it.

     Pause. The others know the argument is over.

                         GREG
               In that case, we love it.

     END CREDITS


  3     EXT. POOL HALL - DAY
     A BUS passes. On the bus is an ad. It says, "Would you
     like to star in your own TV show? Call Real TV (and a
     phone number) Coming (and a date)."


  4     INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT - PARAMUS NEW JERSEY
     This is a nice upscale pool hall. A party is in progress in a
     special private area -- a room upstairs let's say -- a loft.
     Thirty or forty PEOPLE in their twenties and thirties are
     informally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends.

     It's NOISY, it's fun, it's informal. It's not a high-end group.
     By that we mean, not, for the most part young lawyers or
     stockbrokers. They're mostly blue-collar. Community college
     graduates.

     WE OPEN ON ED PEKURNY. He's an attractive man, about thirty.
     There's still something a little juvenile about him -- not
     stupid, just boyish.

     SOMEONE is VIDEOTAPING HIM for one of those congratulation
     montage things that are done at parties these days. Ed is good
     at this. He's not professional but he's a loosey-goosey guy
     who's kind of good on camera.

                         ED
               I want to congratulate
               Kevin and Tracy on their engagement.
               I knew you guys were meant for each
               other from the moment Tracy told us
               she was pregnant.

                         TRACY
               You asshole!

     Everyone else is cracking up.

                         ED
                    (innocently)
               What? What did I say?

                         TRACY
               My mother's going to see this!


  5     INT. PARTY - LATER
     Other people are being "interviewed" on tape. Ed is SHOOTING POOL
     with his buddy, JOHN. John's had a couple of drinks. He's a little
     melancholy.

     He is looking across the room, thoughtfully.

                         ED
               What?

                         JOHN
               Look at this -- people are
               getting married, they're
               getting married...

                         ED
               You said that.

                         JOHN
               We're falling behind.

     Ed waves dismissively.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
               You know who we are?

                         ED
               Tell me.

                         JOHN
               We're the guys who clean up after
               the parade.

                         ED
               I'm gonna stick this right in your
               eye.

                         JOHN
               I was at this comedy club last week
               and this comedian says "If you're over
               thirty and your job requires you to
               wear a name tag, you screwed up your
               life." And I'm laughing and then I
               realize I wear a nametag.

                         ED
               So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.

                         JOHN
               Your brother's here.

     ANGLE ON THE DOOR

     Ed's brother RAY and Ray's girlfriend SHARI arrive at the party.
     Shari is pretty in an unglamorous kind of way. They both wave and
     then Shari goes off to talk to some of the LADIES and Ray joins Ed
     and John.

                         RAY
               What's up?

                         ED
               Where were you?

                         RAY
                    (reluctantly)
               I was... having dinner with Shari
               and her parents.

                         JOHN/ED
                    (taunting)
               Oooh!

                         RAY
               I'm telling you, it's
               closing in on me. All of a sudden
               it's like a thing, it's a whole
               thing.

                         ED
               What do you mean all
               of a sudden? You've been going with
               her six months.

                         RAY
               I know. I mean I'm sitting there
               and her father's asking me about
               my "career prospects" and I'm
               playing "Risk," with her kid
               brother, Leon and at dinner the
               dog's sniffing at my balls -- at
               least I hope it was the dog.
               'Cause her mother disappeared for
               a while.

     They LAUGH.


  6     INT. PARTY - LATER
     It's getting wild. Some of the girls are dancing raucously.

     ANGLE ON A TABLE (NOT A POOL TABLE, AN EATING-TABLE)

     Ed, Ray, John, Shari and maybe another WOMAN.

     Ray is holding a big tray of SHRIMP BALLS. During the
     conversation, Ray throws them in the air and catches them in
     his mouth like popcorn. Once, he even bounces one off the
     wall into his mouth.

                         ED
               You know, those are for everybody.

     Ray waves dismissively, then gets an idea.

                         RAY
               Oh!
                    (to Shari)
               Show them that thing you can do.
                    (to the others)
               This is great. I just found out
               she can do this, her brother told me.
                    (to Shari)
               Come on.

                         SHARI
                    (thinks it's stupid)
               I don't -

                         RAY
               Come on...

     She hesitates, but she really doesn't mind. Slightly, amused she
     takes her FIST and fits it completely INTO her MOUTH.

                         ED
               Whoa!! Oh!

     Ray is cracking up.

                         RAY
               Is that unbelievable?

     She removes her hand.

                         SHARI
               And that concludes today's show.
                    (to Ray)
               This is where you go around and
               collect the money.

     Ed LAUGHS. Ray gives her a KISS.

     Shari's roommate RITA sits down.

                         RITA
               Hi.

                         SHARI
               You guys know my roommate, Rita.

     They do, vaguely.

                         ED
               What's going on over there?

                         RITA
               Everybody's making
               audition tapes for that Real TV
               thing.

                         JOHN
               Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear
               about this?

                         ED
                    (not sure)
               Yeah, what - they put some schmuck
               on TV all day long or something?

                         RAY
               You know, that would be like a great
               thing.

                         ED
               What?

                         RAY
               That! Being that guy.
               Being the guy they watch.

                         ED
               What are you drunk?

                         RAY
               Yeah, but let's stay
               on one subject. Whoever that person
               is is going to be famous. They'll be
               able to get whatever they want.
               They'll ... trust me, this is my
               business.

                         ED
               What is?!

                         RAY
               Show business.

                         ED
               You're in show business?

                         RAY
               Yeah. I service video equipment.

                         ED
               That's like... those people
               stitching Nikes in Panama saying
               they're in the NBA.

                         RAY
                    (insulted)
               I'm not stitching Nikes in
               Panama! ... Bedwetter!

                         ED
               Thumbsucker!

                         RAY
               I'm making a tape.

                         ED
               We're excited.


  7     INT. BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
     Ed and Shari, waiting for drink orders.

                         ED
               So Ray met the family.

                         SHARI
               Yeah...

                         ED
               I hear the dog really liked him.

                         SHARI
               Oh, the whole family loved him.
               Of course, they loved the last
               guy I went out with, and he strung
               me along for three years and dumped
               me.

                         ED
               Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't
               have any trouble with men. There
               should be, like, a line behind you.

     She takes Ed's beer.

                         SHARI
               You shouldn't drink.

     They LAUGH.


  8     INT. TABLE - A LITTLE LATER
     Ed and Shari ARM-WRESTLING. After a struggle, Ed wins. Ed is
     impressed.

                         ED
               Jesus!

     Shari wrings out her arm and picks up her beer.

                         SHARI
                    (continuing a previous
                    conversation)
               And, you know, every guy I ever
               broke up with, the minute it was
               over, I could tell you what went
               wrong, how it went wrong, why it
               had to go wrong... but when I'm
               in it... lost. I'm like a love
               coroner. Bring me the corpse,
               I'11 tell you what killed it.
               But how to prevent it? Lost.

     Ed LAUGHS.

                         ED
               Ray's on.

     They walk over.

     ANGLE ON RAY

                         RAY
                    (to camera)
               Hi. I'm Ray Pekurney. I'm from
               Paramus, New Jersey...


  9     INT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE - DAY
     She's watching Ray's tape. Ray thinks he's funnier and
     cuter than he is.

                         RAY (ON TAPE)
               All my friends tell me "Ray, you've
               got too much personality for one guy."
               It's like at a party -- I'm at the
               center of the attention. Everybody
               loves me.

     He gets hit in the face by a hors d'oeuvre.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
               Ha, ha, ha. I'll kick your ass.
               No really, let me show you my
               girlfriend. She's really cute.

     He reaches out and grabs Shari's wrist. Shari is struggling
     to stay out of frame. We just see her arm and Ray pulling on
     it. Ray lets go.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
               She's strong, 'cause she's a Fedex
               girl. She lifts those
               packages. But she's not dikey at
               all, she's really pretty.

     CYNTHIA FAST-FORWARDS

     WE SEE the camera shooting an empty space.

     Then Ed's head appears sideways right in front of the CAMERA.

                         ED
               Hello I'm Ed.

     He starts to sniff.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               What smells?

     He steps back from the camera and straightens his head as
     he SNIFFS. He's more relaxed than Ray.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               What is that smell? Oop, I think
               it's this idea. One person on TV all
               day long?
                    (screams)
               Are you nuts?

     WE HEAR LAUGHS

     The Real TV Staff are enjoying Ed's tape while they eat
     lunch out of styrofoam containers.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Seriously, get your resumes in
               order. When my brother Ray -
               whose personality you were just
               dazzled by -- told me he was
               going to try out for this -- I
               said, "why in the world would
               anyone want to be on TV all day
               long, no privacy, everybody
               knowing your business, exposing
               every single detail of your
               life I mean... why would anyone
               want to do that? But then I
               thought of a reason...
                    (loudly)
               Why the hell not?

     He KISSES the LENS, smudging it.

     Cynthia, watching, cracks up. The others seem to like him to.


  10    INT. VIDEO STORE - DAY
     This is a video store in Paramus, New Jersey. It's busy.
     PEOPLE are in line to check out tapes.

     WE OPEN ON a WOMAN -- a mother -- who is rummaging through her
     purse for her Blockbuster card. She looks up and sees that her
     TWO CHILDREN have opened several boxes of candy from the candy
     display and are eating from the boxes.

                         MOTHER
               Oh for -- Put those -- Oh God...

     She grabs the boxes from them. The boxes are ripped more than she
     thought and candy goes flying all over. She bends to pick it up.

     Ed appears. He works here.

                         ED
                    (to the Mom)
               We'11 take care of it.

     Someone arrives with a broom.

                         ED (CONT'D)
                    (to the broom guy)
               Here. This time throw it out, don't
               eat it.

     LOU, the Manager passes.

                         ED
               Lou, can I talk to you a second?

     Lou seems like he'd prefer to avoid this.

                         LOU
               Um, yeah, I was gonna ...

                         ED
               What's the deal?
               Did anybody make a decision -

                         LOU
               Ed, look, uh... you're not getting
               the job. They're gonna transfer
               someone from another store to manage
               this store when I leave to manage
               the new store. I'm sorry.

                         ED
               Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for
               me?

                         LOU
               I batted!

                         ED
               You batted or you bunted?

                         LOU
               Hey. I went as far as I felt
               comfortable. I mean, you know,
               let's face it -- you come and go
               here as you please. You work
               when you feel like it -- you
               know, Bruce Springsteen's
               birthday is not a legal holiday.

                         ED
               Well, then I'm quitting.

                         LOU
               Ed, come on. What's that gonna do?
               You're gonna bring Blockbuster to
               their knees. Let me recommend a movie
               to you. It's called "Get your shit
               together before it's too late."

                         ED
                    (wise-ass)
               Who's in it?

                         CLERK
               Ed, telephone.

     Ed goes to the phone.

                         ED
                    (into the phone)
               Yeah... Are you serious? ... Come
               on, no kidding, who is this? ...
               Holy shit!


  11    INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
     Ed is being interviewed by the "Real TV" staff whom we met earlier.
     He's slightly less comfortable than on his tape, but he's good.

                         ED
               I had one year of college. And
               then one year of junior college.

                         CYNTHIA (O.C.)
               What did you study?

                         ED
               Oh, see, studying
               would've been a huge help. Where
               were you, then?

     They LAUGH.

               Well, there's Ray, my
               brother. He's... ambitious. Like a
               few years ago, he started this
               mobile dog-grooming business. But,
               like, out of his Camry. He had this
               bathtub in his trunk -
                    (Ed starts cracking up)
               he's throwing the dogs in there, they're
               fighting and splashing, then he'd
               slam the trunk down, let 'em run
               around inside screaming getting all
               wet... then he'd use the car
               exhaust to dry'em.
                    (wiping his eyes)
               Ah, Ray... he just can't get a
               break.

               mean she can't get a break. About
               seven years ago she falls in love
               with this Vietnamese guy who wants
               to marry her so he can stay in the
               country. So they get married, they
               have a kid, he gets his citizenship,
               immediately divorces my sister and
               marries this Vietnamese woman who,
               he was probably already married to
               all along. She can pick 'em.
                    (pause)

               I knew a guy who hated his mother -
               Stuey Shwam. He hated his mother so
               much, he had his belly button
               removed.

     He doesn't. He shrugs -- that's it.

     Ed's image freezes, while he has a funny-cute expression on
     his face.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL a TV in a conference room with Ed's
     frozen image on it. Cynthia is there with her bosses, the
     people who run the network that owns Real TV. The top man is
     MR. SCHARLACH. His deputies are MS. SEAVER and MR. McILVAINE.
     This is not the same place where we met Cynthia and her
     staff. This is richer, more corporate and formal.

                         CYNTHIA
               He's who we want to go with.

                         SCHARLACH
                    (doubtfully)
               This guy.

                         CYNTHIA
               I polled my
               staff. The men say they'd hang
               around with him and the women say
               he's fuckable. And one of the men
               said he's fuckable.

                         SCHARLACH
               I'm not
               sure about the entire concept.

     Cynthia is frustrated.

                         CYNTHIA
               Look it's not like we're 
               burning up the airwaves
               now. We're running neck-and-neck
               with The Gardening Channel. If
               people just tune in to this twice a
               day for five minutes, we're a hit.
               Plus we can sell advertising every
               second, running at the bottom of the
               screen... and the beauty is this guy
               doesn't even have to be good. I mean
               if he's good, great. But if he winds
               up making an ass of himself, better.

                         McILVAINE
               How is that better?

                         CYNTHIA
               Come on. People cannot turn away
               from an accident. You drive by,
               you say "Ooh, I hope there's not
               a head lying in the road" but you
               look ! See, nobody in America
               wants to be nobody. This guy
               wants to be famous. So,
               basically, the deal is he agrees
               to drive down the highway a
               hundred miles an hour blindfolded
               and we get to see if his head
               winds up rolling down the
               highway. Fun for the whole
               family. So let's do it.

     She stops, waiting for approval.

               Let me ask you something --

                         ED
               Why do you do that?

                         RAY
               What?

                         ED
               Whenever you ask me
               something why do you always say "Let
               me ask you something?" Why don't you
               just ask me?

                         RAY
                    (impatiently)
               All right. Let
               me ask you something... are you
               happy like this?

                         ED
               I'm doing all right.

                         RAY
               Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?

     Shari enters, curious about the yelling. She stands there
     quietly, unnoticed by the guys.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
               You're
               gonna be a video store clerk for
               the rest of your life? This is your
               big ambition, rearranging the
               "Ernest" movies?

                         ED
               Screw off.

                         RAY
               How many
               opportunities are you going to
               get in your life?

                         ED
               I don't know.

                         RAY
               That's right. You
               don't know. Doors don't fly open
               for guys like us.

                         ED
               Hey. You know-- we're not the
               same. I got a good life, this
               job suits me. I come and go when
               I please --

                         RAY
               Oh, don't bullshit a
               bullshitter. If you're happy like
               this you're an idiot, and you're not
               an idiot.
                    (sees Shari)
               Hi.

     Ed turns and sees Shari. She's self-conscious. She feels like she's
     been caught eavesdropping.

                         SHARI
               Oh. I -- I heard Ray yelling.
               1 didn't mean to --

                         RAY
                    (to Ed)
               Give me a chance. I'm begging
               you. I need a break. Look, I'11
               cover your ass. I'11 ride
               shotgun. Just bring those
               cameras over to me and I'11 make
               something happen for both of us.
               I swear. Come on, Eddie

     Pause.

                         ED
               All right.

                         RAY
               Yeah?!

                         ED
               Yeah.

     Ray lifts Ed up.

     Ray kisses Ed.

                         RAY
                    (to Shari)
               Is this guy a brother?!


  14    INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
     Moderate-priced, restaurant.

     WE OPEN ON a CLOSE-UP of AL. He's about seventy.

     REVEAL THE FAMILY

                         AL
               What happens when
               you go to the bathroom? Do they
               go in with you?

     Ed, Ray, Al, JEANETTE and MARCIA. Al is in a WHEELCHAIR and has an
     oxygen mask connected to a tank. He periodically takes a hit of
     oxygen. He's a little short of breath, but loves to talk. Jeanette
     is Ed's mother -- about sixty. Marcia is a little older than Ed.

                         ED
               No. The bathroom is off
               limits -and when I go to sleep they
               go to other programming. Unless I get
               up. Then they go back on the air.
               Unless I get up to go to the
               bathroom, I guess, then -

                         AL
               What if--you're vomiting?

                         ED
                    (amazed by the
                    question)
               What if I'm vomiting?

                         AL
               Do they show it?

                         ED
               I guess -- I don't -- it's all in
               the contract. There's this
               million-page contract --

                         RAY
               Look, can we all
               just sign the releases so we can
               get on with this?

                         MARCIA
                    (accusing, to Ed)
               What happened? You described this
               "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a
               million laughs on TV?

                         ED
               No! I barely even
               mentioned -it's just that, my
               friends, the people at work,
               whoever I'm regularly in contact
               with they want releases from.

                         MARCIA
                    (angrily)
               They're gonna mock our foibles.

                         ED
               Our what?

                         MARCIA
               Our foibles, our foibles!

                         RAY
               We don't have foibles.

                         MARCIA
               Everyone has
               foibles. Then the whole country sees
               them on TV and mocks them. Then we
               have... mocked foibles.

                         JEANTTE
               Eddie, please
               don't let them mock our foibles.

                         ED
                    (losing it)
               Stop saying foibles!

                         MARCIA
               Look, my life
               is not so great, that I want it
               shown on television. And neither
               is yours.

                         RAY
               That's the point -- this could
               change things.

                         MARCIA
               How?

                         RAY
               For instance... me and my friend
               Bucky are buying out my boss. His
               equipment, trucks, client list, the
               whole shmear.

                         MARCIA
                    (points to Ed)
               What does that have to do with... ?

                         RAY
               If they keep Ed on for one full
               month, he gets a balloon payment.

     Ed nods.

     Pause.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
               I borrow 
               against that now, at the bank. Buy
               the business. And Ed becomes a
               silent partner. Now here's the
               beauty part. While we're on TV I
               plug the shit out of the business.
               Free advertising.

                         AL
               How about sex?

     A STUNNED pause. They all look at Al.

                         ED
               I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's
               not an age thing --

                         AL
               No! Do they show you having sex?

                         ED
               No. Kissing and
               hugging, okay, but if it's actual
               sex they have to cut away.

                         AL
               At what point?

                         ED
               At the point -- I
               don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe
               one or two times each. I'11 try to
               avoid I'11 go out of my way to
               avoid, getting together with you.
               Believe me.

     WE HEAR: A loud drilling sound.

                                        CUT TO:


  15    INT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY
     A WORKMAN is drilling a hole in the wall.

     Ed is there with a TV CREW. They're running cable and drilling holes and
     examining the apartment.

     Cynthia is going around supervising. Ray and Shari are there. Ray is
     fascinated. Ed is tense. Shari is observant. Ray separates from Ed
     and Shari and asks one of the Installers a technical question.

     SHARI AND ED

     Ed thinks.

     Ed joins Cynthia.

                         SHARI
               Are you sure about this?

                         ED
               Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of
               making a fool of myself, here.

                         SHARI
               Why do it?

                         ED
               I saw this show once.
               It was about logging. I was home
               sick, there was nothing else on. Do
               you know how they break up really
               bad log jams? You know, when they're
               really tangled... ?

                         SHARI
               Cream rinse?

                         ED
                    (laughs) 
               Dynamite.

                         SHARI
               So?

                         ED
               So maybe this is my dynamite.

                         SHARI
               Dynamite is dangerous.

                         CYNTHIA
               Ed, can I see you a second.

                         ED
                    (to Shari)
               Excuse me.

                         CYNTHIA
               Okay, so you
               understand? We're installing a
               permanent camera in your bedroom,
               one in the kitchen, one in the
               living room, plus, of course,
               there'll always be a couple of
               steady-cams following you.

                         ED
                    (overwhelmed)
               Cool.

                         CYNTHIA
               I want you to take this.

     She gives him a card.

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
               That has my work number, my home
               number, my pager number. I sleep
               three hours a night. Call me
               whenever you want to talk. Off the
               air, on the air, whenever. Okay?

                         ED
                    (barely listening)
               Um, yeah -- thanks.

     Ed looks kind of overwhelmed. She doesn't like this.

                         CYNTHIA
               Now look. Don't
               freeze up on me. I picked you
               because you had kind of a relaxed,
               go-with-the-flow quality. You're not
               going to lose that, are you?

                         ED
               No, uh...

                         CYNTHIA
               I bet my career on you. You'd
               better be good.

                         ED
                    (annoyed)
               Don't say that. That's like...
               telling a guy before you have sex
               you'd better be good. You don't do
               that.

                         CYNTHIA
               I do.

     Ed reacts.

                         ED
               Oh.


  16    INT. ED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
     He's in bed, watching TV. The news is on. He glances up at one of
     the cameras. On the news, they go to a story about him.

                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
               Tomorrow morning, the cable 
               channel known
               as Real TV, begins broadcasting
               one of the most heavily promoted
               concepts in the history of cable
               television. In an experiment that
               they say will last at least a month.
               They're going to follow -- live -
               every waking minute of a thirty-one
               year old video store clerk from
               Paramus New Jersey. The Real TV
               press release on this promises that
               none of it will be scripted, none of
               it will be edited and in my opinion,
               none of it will be interesting. we're
               all just supposed to sit in front of
               our TV's and watch this guy... live.
                    (rhymes with "give")

                         ANCHOR
                    (to the Entertainment Reporter)
               What would be the interest here?
               What would... get people to tune in?

                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
               Betas me.

                         SIDEKICK
               I don't know. I might check it out.

                         ANCHOR
               Well, Len's
               here to check out sports. Len,
               would you watch this video clerk?

                         LEN
               I'd sooner watch soccer.

     They all CRUCKLE.


  17    INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
     She's watching the same show. She's edgy.
     She's CRACKING her KNUCKLES.

               Speaking of disasters, at the

     The set goes off. Ed, once again, stares up at the camera.

  19    INT. REAL TV - OFFICES
     Cynthia and her staff are gathered to watch the show begin
     They're TENSE and EXCITED. A commercial is on.


  20    INT. TRUCK


  21    INT. OFFICE

                         A.D.
               two... one.

     On the TV, the commercial ends and the Real TV logo appears.

     A CRAWL BEGINS

     It says "The following is unedited, unscripted, and unrehearsed. It
     is the real life of one American citizen named Ed Pekurny."

     The logo fades away and we see Ed, in bed, sleeping. His ALARM RINGS
     and he wakes up.

     He's groggy from sleep. Instinctively, he begins SCRATCHING his
     balls. As he does, it hits him that this is not a normal 
     morning. He looks up and sees two steady-cam guys at the foot of his
     bed, aiming their cameras at him. Ed, then, looks at his hand on his
     balls. Gently, he moves his hand away.


  22    INT. OFFICE

                         KEITH
                    (mock cheerful)
               Well, we're off to a great start.

     NOTE: The camera operators will change in shifts. We'11 see
     about four regulars over the course of the film. The one we
     will see most often is shooting Ed right now. His name is
     CARLOS.


  23    INT. BEDROOM
     Ed, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, gets out of bed. His hair is
     sticking up. He passes a mirror and notices his hair.

                         ED
               Oh, great.

     He turns to the camera and seems about to offer an excuse
     for his appearance, but, then, just moves on.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Excuse me.

     He grabs some clothes and enters the bathroom.


  24    INT. OFFICE
     They're not enjoying this. Everyone's staring at Cynthia. She
     doesn't flinch.
     NOTE: Silent advertising runs along the bottom of the screen.


  25    INT. KITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER
     Ed enters, dressed and showered. The Steady-cam is in his
     face.

     Ed is tight. He's much less comfortable than he expected to
     be. He smiles stiffly at the camera. He's misplaced his
     natural charm.

     He gets a box of Pop-tarts out of the freezer. As he does,
     other stuff falls out of the freezer on to the floor. He's
     embarrassed. He bends down to pick things up, showing his ass
     to the camera.


  26    INT. OFFICE

                         GREG
                    (to Cynthia)
               Start clearing a place for your Emmy.


  27    INT. KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER
     Ed is sitting up on the kitchen counter eating his Pop-tarts and
     a bowl of cereal.

                         ED
                    (nervously)
               Same people like
               to put the milk in first and then
               the cereal. I like to put in the
               milk first - I mean the cereal first
               and then the milk. Yeah, that's it.
               Now, watch this.

     He takes a KNIFE and a BANANA. He peels the banana. He holds the
     knife, blade up, over the cereal and chops down on it with the
     banana, several times, rapidly, slicing it into the cereal. He's
     proud of this.


  28    INT. RAY'S APARTMENT
     Ray is watching the show. His head is in his hands. He's
     horrified by how bad Ed is.


  29    INT. PARENTS' HOUSE
     Jeanette and Al watching Ed.

                         JEANETTE
                    (being positive)
               So far...


  30    INT. OFFICE

                         KEITH
               Somebody shoot me.


  31    INT. NETWORK OFFICE
     Scharlach, Seaver and McIlvaine watching, grim-faced.


  32    INT. OFFICE
     Cynthia is ON the PHONE.

                         CYNTHIA
               Get him out of the house! I want
               him moving!


  33    INT. CONTROL TRUCK

                         DIRECTOR
                    (on the phone)
               Hey, I want him dead, but what can
               I do.


  34    INT. KITCHEN
     Ed is EATING. He peers confused at the camera.

     ANGLE ON

     CAMERA OPERATORS. They're signaling Ed to get out.

     ANGLE ON ED

     Bewildered, imitating their gestures.

                         ED
               What... You want me to swim?


  35    INT. CONTROL TRUCK
     The Director is still on the phone. She's watching Ed on a
     monitor.

                         DIRECTOR
               Oh God...

     Ed gets it.

                         ED
               Oh, out? You want me to go out.


  36    EXT. BUILDING
     Ed exits the building with the Operators walking backwards in front
     of him, bumping into PEOPLE- People watch, curiously.

     Ed reaches his car. He takes out his keys and drops them in a muddy
     puddle. Disgusted, he fishes them out.

                                        CUT TO:

  36A   INT. NETWORK BUILDING
     Scharlach, watching impassively.

                                        CUT TO:

  36B   INT. ED'S CAR
     Ed, in the car. He can barely fit the key into the ignition. Carlos,
     in the passenger seat taps him on the arm. Ed looks up. Carlos holds
     up a hastily-made sign. "It's okay. Relax, man." Carlos WINKS. This
     does help Ed. He appreciates it. He drives.

     WE SEE the control truck in motion. We also see another car
     with another Steady-cam OPERATOR, shooting Ed's car as they
     travel.


  37    EXT. STREET - MONTAGE
     Ed is doing his morning errands. A little shopping -- a little
     banking -- always ON CAMERA. At one point, he WALKS INTO a
     GLASS DOOR with the word "Pull" on it. He pushed, 
     banging his forehead. A CHILD points to the word "Pull." Ed turns
     to the camera, embarrassed. Later he buys a slice of pizza at a
     little place that's doing no business.

                         ED
                    (to the camera)
               Best pizza in New Jersey.

     As he walks down the street, PEOPLE call out "Hey Ed!" People
     in windows show him that they're watching him at that exact
     moment.

     The camera shoots some of the people in the windows. They see
     themselves on TV and they go wild. Ed also is confronted by
     GUYS grabbing their crotches mockingly, calling out things
     like "Hey, Ed, holding your own?" or "Hey, Ed, howls the grand
     ballroom." Ed is slightly chagrined by all this, but handles
     it with good grace. He seems to be loosening up.


  38    INT. VIDEO STORE - DAY
     Ed arrives at work. The store is already open. (Ed usually
     gets there in the afternoon and stays until closing.)
     CUSTOMERS are a little stunned by the arrival of a camera.
     Some know what it's about some don't.

     The CLERKS are aware of what's going on. They all signed
     releases. Ed's BOSS greets him stiffly. Clearly he's trying
     to get face-time on camera.

                         ED
               Hey, Lou.

                         LOU
                    (stiffly)
               Welcome to work, Ed.

     He shakes Ed's hand and smiles at the camera. He WAVES a little.

     The BROOM GUY crosses, staring transfixed at the camera. He
     blocks Ed and Lou. He FREEZES, then panics. He tries to get
     out of the way and trips over his broom. He tumbles face-first
     into the camera lens, hurting himself.

     ANGLE ON ED, observing.

                         ED
                    (mutters)
               Oh, Jesus, I'm dying.


  39    INT. CONTROL TRUCK

                         DIRECTOR
               Carlos, give him some air, give him
               some room. Use a longer lens. We'11
               mostly go with the stationary cameras
               in here. Less intrusive.
                    (to the crew in the truck,
                    sarcastically)
               Have any of you
               thought about your next career?


  40    INT. A KITCHEN - SAME TIME
     A WOMAN is serving dinner. She's watching Ed on TV -- really just
     glancing at it. Her HUSBAND is helping her bring the food to the
     table.

                         HUSBAND
               Why are we watching this?

                         WIFE
                    (a little guilty)
               No reason. just... I just want to
               see what happens.

                         HUSBAND
               Nothing's gonna happen. He's just...
               working.

                         WIFE
               Oh, come on, they
               wouldn't put it on if nothing was
               gonna happen.

     He changes the channel. She changes it back. He doesn't get it
     at all.

     RAPID CUTS of VARIOUS PEOPLE around America, watching -- A couple, a
     young guy, a woman alone -- ending with a few college-age girls in what
     appears to be a dorm room.

     ONE GIRL is watching intently. Her roommates are mostly just
     hanging around not really watching.

                         COLLEGE GIRL
               I think he's cute.

     one of her roommates glances over to see what she's so excited
     about.


  41    EXT. STREET - NIGHT
     Ed is walking. He passes the little pizza place he touted earlier.
     There's a LINE out into the street. The STOREOWNER is working hard -
     - deliriously happy. Ed passes, oblivious to what he's created.


  42    INT. ED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
     The Camera Operator is shooting Ed in the bathroom CLIPPING his
     TOENAILS

                         ED
               Some guys work from
               the big toe down to the little toe.
               Not me. I save the big one for
               last. That's the one I really
               enjoy. It's thick, it's big, it's
               a challenge. Did you ever see old
               people's nails?
                    (makes a disgusted
                    noise)


  43    INT. RAY'S APARTMENT
     Ray and Shari watching Ed. Ray is BANGING HIS HEAD on the table.

                         RAY
               This is not working.
                    (to Ed on TV)
               Come to me!


  44    INT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
     It's late. She's alone. She's ON the PHONE. She's coming apart.

                         CYNTHIA
                    (into phone)
               No, I haven't seen the spot
               ratings...
                    (she winces)

     As she talks, she tries to LIGHT a CIGARETTE. She's shaking too
     much to use her lighter.

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                    (into phone)
               I think that's a number 
               from which we can hopefully, uh...
               build...

     ANGRY at her lighter, she throws it breaking a window.

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
               I disagree... No, I am not ready
               to pull the plug... Yes, Mr.
               Scharlach, I know they shoot
               horses...
                    (getting angry)
               Look, it's been one day. Can I have
               a week with this and then have
               you fly up my nose?!
                    (hangs up)

     She immediately regrets her outburst.


  45    INT. BAR - NIGHT
     Written on the screen -- "Day Two."

     OPEN ON TURTLES racing (as only turtles can) across the floor.
     The turtles have little plastic men, seated on their backs.
     The CROWD CHEERS and SCREAMS for their favorite turtles. Ed is
     being followed by the steady-cams but seems to be ignoring it.

     Ed is in a group which includes John, and Ray. The race ends
     John looks very uncomfortable.

                         BARTENDER
               The winner... Dashing Danny.

     Ed wins. MONEY changes hands.

                         ED
               Next round's on me.

     One of the cameras is very close to John. He's very
     SELFCONSCIOUS. He doesn't look where he's walking. He
     trips. PEOPLE LAUGH.

                         ED
                    (off-hand joke)
               Polish acrobat.

                         RAY
                    (loudly)
               Hey. Check this out.
                    (to the cameramen)
               Look at this.

     Ray TAKES OUT a big stack of QUARTERS and sets them on the bar next
     to a SHOT GLASS


  46    INT. CONTROL TRUCK

                         DIRECTOR
               Go with the desperate brother.


  47    INT. BAR
     The cameras go with Ray. Ray does a "spit the quarters off the bar
     into the shot glass" trick, while PEOPLE CHEER.

     Ed is standing next to Shari. They're OFF-CAMERA.

                         ED
               Whoa, God bless Ray.
               First time I'm off-camera in two
               days. This is hard, you know? I'm,
               like, exhausted.

     ANGLE ON RAY

     He's BALANCING a BAR STOOL on his forehead.

     ANGLE ON ED AND SHARI

                         SHARI
                    (calmly)
               He did that at my parents' house.

     ANGLE ON RAY

     As Ray drones on...

                         RAY
                    (selling hard to the
                    camera)
               Okay, I just wanted to get your
               attention. My name is Ray and my
               friend Bucky and I design video
               systems. You've got an office or
               a big home, we'11 come out there
               design you an entire system.

     ANGLE ON ED AND SHARI

                         ED
               See, they should've
               picked him. Look how comfortable
               he is out there.

     ANGLE ON RAY

                         SHARI
               He is so wound up. He bought all
               new clothes for this.

     He flips the BAR STOOL and catches it. He accepts the plaudits of
     the crowd. He returns to Ed and Shari. So do the cameras. Ray is
     fired-up.

                         RAY
               Whew! 1 am kicking hairy ass!

     Ray is still full of energy.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
               Hey, Ed. Did you hear about
               Marcia?

                         ED
                    (worried)
               No. What happened?

                         RAY
                    (to the camera)
               That's our sister.
                    (to Ed)
               She's got a new boyfriend.

     AL AND JEANETTE

     Watching TV.

                         JEANETTE
               Who?

     BACK TO BAR

                         RAY
               He's living with her!

                         ED
                    (camera-conscious)
               Ray, maybe this isn't ...

                         RAY
               No, this is great.
                    (to the camera)
               You'll love this.
                    (to Ed)
               He's a singer.

                         ED
               Marcia's living with a singer?

                                        CUT TO:

                         RAY
               Yeah. You know,
               piano bars. plays the piano
               and sings. That's how they met.

                         SHARI
               He sang to her and they fell in
               love?

                         RAY
                    (enjoying this)
               No! Some drunk
               hit him over the head with his
               snifter -- you know, that thing they
               keep on the piano for tips -- and
               Marcia yanked a big hunk of glass
               out of his head.
                    (cracks up, pounds the
                    table)


  48    INT. MARCIA'S APARTMENT
     Marcia is staring at the TV in UNHAPPY SHOCK. Next to her is a good-
     looking, but slightly sleazy-looking GUY with a bandage on his
     head.


  49    INT. BAR

                         RAY
               I mean my question
               is what was she doing in a bar in
               the first place?

                         ED
               Ray --

                         RAY
               She's an alcoholic,
               for Christ's sake.

                         ED
               Oh, Jesus.

     Marcia, watching, HORRIFIED.

     BACK TO BAR

                         RAY
               Remember the
               last guy she got involved with?
               What was his name?

                         ED
               What's the dif --

                         RAY
               Richie!
                    (to Shari)
               She spent six months dating a criminal

                         ED
                    (to Shari)
               She didn't know he was a
               criminal. They had a
               relationship. They --

                         RAY
               "Quick pull off the highway" is
               not a relationship. Oh man, I
               gotta pee.

     He KISSES Shari. She COVERS her FACE with her hand.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
               What are you, hiding from the
               Police?
                    (pulls her hands down)
               Show your face, you look great.
                    (to Ed)
               Doesn't she look great.

                         ED
               Great.

                         RAY
                    (to Ed)
               While I'm gone, tell them about
               our cousin Lenny who's gay. We
               knew from when he was five.

     He minces off' effeminately, to the bathroom, LAUGHING. It's
     like a hurricane has just passed through. Everyone is sitting,
     STUNNED.

                         ED
               You do though, you look great.

                         SHARI
               Right.

                         ED
               No, no, I -- as soon as you came
               in tonight I said to John, "Boy
               Shari looks beautiful." I said
               it on TV so you can ask anybody
               who saw it.

     She LAUGHS. They smile at each other. They make intermittent
     eye-contact a little self-consciously.

     Ed finally looks somewhere else and Shari, for just a moment,
     stares right at him.

     PULL BACK to TWO GUYS, watching this on TV in a bar -- more of
     a neighborhood bar.


  50    INT. BAR - NIGHT

                         TAD
               Did you see that?

                         BARRY
               What?

                         TAD
               Her. That look. She likes the
               Ed guy better than she likes the
               brother.

                         BARRY
               You're nuts.

                         TAD
               Okay, I'm nuts.


     CUTS OF OTHER VIEWERS, 

     WATCHING REAL TV

     A BEDROOM

     The COUPLE we met earlier are in bed, the wife is holding the
     remote.

                         HUSBAND
               Give me the remote.

                         WIFE

               your book.

     A LIVING ROOM

     A GAY COUPLE

                         FIRST GUY
               What do you like about it? I
               don't understand.

                         SECOND GUY
               I don't know -- it just
               it's I don't know. Just let
               me watch.


  51    INT. ED'S BEDROOM - MORNING
     "DAY THREE"

     The ALARM goes off. Ed starts to scratch his balls, but stops
     halfway down. He WINKS at the camera and starts his day.


  52    EXT. EWS BUILDING
     Ed comes outside and he's accosted by a GROUP of angry Polish
     Americans, many of whom are carrying signs decrying Polish
     jokes and anti-Polish attitudes. They SCREAM ANGRILY when they
     see Ed. Ed is completely shocked. He runs back inside. He
     locks the door, leaving Carlos outside. The demonstrators
     attack Carlos.


  53    INT. ED'S APARTMENT
     Ed is at his kitchen table with several burly DEMONSTRATORS
     arrayed behind him. Ed is NERVOUSLY, READING from a sheet of
     paper while Carlos shoots.

                         ED
               ... my "Polish acrobat" remark
               was ill-considered. Although, I
               meant no harm, I should have
               recognized that such
                    (trouble with the next
                    word)
               stigmatizing remarks bring pain
               and anguish to...

     He's having trouble reading the next word.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               I can't read my own writing.
               It's like Chinese --
                    (quickly backtracking)
               It's not like Chinese! Chinese
               is, I'm sure, a beautiful
               language and they write ...
               beautifully. It's not Chinese.

     He wipes sweat away.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Jesus, I'm sweating like a
               Mexican fruit-picker.
                    (realizes)
               Oh, Christ!

     QUICK CUTS of Ed, getting his laundry, doing some shopping,
     getting his oil changed, all being shot by a CAMERA PERSON.


  54    INT. DENTAL OFFICE
     A YOUNG DENTAL HYGIENIST is cleaning Ed's teeth. The camera is
     practically right in his mouth. It's making the Hygienist
     NERVOUS. She's distracted. She hurts Ed. He SCREAMS. She
     SCREAMS. She drops her tools.

                         HYGIENIST
                    (near hysterics)
               Can I have some room please?!

                         ED
                    (talking with the
                    suction in his mouth)
               Gi hu roo.


  55    INT. TV STUDIO
     It's an educational-type panel discussion involving various
     eggheads and pundits. It's called "Viewpoint."

                         MODERATOR
               Let's change topics for a moment.
               Does anybody have a viewpoint on
               something going on now called "Ed
               TV".

                         PANEL MEMBER #1
               This, I believe, is a new low
               point in American culture.

                         PANEL MEMBER #2
               I agree. What it reveals is the
               absolute creative bankruptcy in
               the television business. What
               they're saying, basically, is
               "We're giving up. We have no
               ideas."

                         PANEL MEMBER #3
               It's worse than that! They don't
               select someone with any talent,
               or with something to say -- they
               seem to celebrate the fact that
               this guy is a boob. It's a
               joyous celebration of boobery.

                         PANEL MEMBER #4
               I think we've already spent far
               too much time discussing this.

     They all agree.


  56    INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
     OPEN ON Ray with chopsticks up his nose, imitating a walrus.
     Also, he has lo mein noodles protruding from between his lips.
     Ed is forcing a smile. Ray is wearing a tee-shirt that says
     "Ray and Bucky- Video Kings" with a phone number.


  57    INT. REAL TV OFFICE
     Cynthia is alone working late. She's drinking. She's watching
     Ray. She's not enjoying him.

                         ED (V.O.)
               Ray, don't throw the shrimp,
               you're gonna choke again.

                         CYNTHIA
               Choke to death, you boring
               bastard.


  58    INT. EWS BEDROOM - NIGHT
     Ed is sitting up in bed, wearing shorts and a tee-shirt, eating
     directly out of a cereal box.

                         TERRY
               The audience likes you when
               you're moving.

                         ALICE
               Yes. Try not to stay in one
               place too long. Get outside as
               much as you can.

                         KEITH
               Also, we have some notions. Have
               you thought about becoming a Big
               Brother?

                         GREG
               Or coaching a Little League team?

                         FELICIA
               How about a date?

                         ED
               Are you asking me?

                         FELICIA
               No, I mean...

                         KEITH
               It's just, the ratings are still
               soft.

     LONG PAUSE

                         ED
                    (nervously)
               Are you going to cancel me?

                         CYNTHIA
               Let's not worry about that vet.

                         ALICE
               You're testing well.

                         FELICIA
               There's another problem.

                         GREG
               It's ... Ray.

                         ED
               What about Ray?

                         GREG
               Well, the walrus impression -
               delightful as it was -- is just
               not wowing the audience. This is
               some audience research.

     He hands Ed a PRINTOUT. Ed doesn't know how to interpret the
     figures.

                         ED
               What does this mean?

                         FELICIA
               It means they hate his freaking
               guts. It means if he were on
               fire they wouldn't put him out.

                         ED
               He's just ... trying a little too
               hard --

                         CYNTHIA
               Ed, the audience can smell the
               desperation coming through the
               screen.

                         TERRY
               Could you... see him a little
               less often?

                         ED
               How much less?

                         FELICIA
               Never would be plenty.

                         ED
               I can't do that to him. He's
               pushing a little too hard -
               but... I just can't do that to
               him.

     SILENCE

                         ED (CONT'D)
               He'11 be fine.


  59    INT. CAR - DAY
     "DAY FIVE"

     Ed is driving slowly on a busy street. Suddenly an 
     EIGHTEEN YEAR-OLD BOY lands heavily on Ed's windshield. Ed is badly
     startled. He can't see. He swerves and stops. The boy is not
     hurt. He's banging on the windshield, waving at the camera.
     Ed, furious, gets out.


  60    EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

                         ED
               What the --?!

                         BOY
               I'm on TV! I'm on TV!

     Ed just stares in disbelief.


  61    EXT. STREET - LATER
     Ed is walking. PEOPLE YELL at him.

                         GUY
               Ed! Your show stinks!

     The Guy LAUGHS like he really got in a good one. Ed ignores him.

     TWO TEENAGERS run in, one has a camera and quickly snaps a
     picture of Ed and the other Guy. Merrily, they shake his hand
     and run off, whooping.

     There are PEOPLE who trail along. Many of them will show up
     again and again, throughout the movie, following Ed. Some of
     them will look mentally or emotionally impaired.


  62    INT. VIDEO STORE - NIGHT
     QUICK SHOTS of Ed with CUSTOMERS - One or two show a bit of
     camera-consciousness. A little group has gathered to observe
     Ed's "show".


  63    INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY- NIGHT
     Ed rings the bell.

                         ED
                    (to the camera)
               This is Ray's apartment. Ray's
               got a big-screen TV and the
               Knicks are playing in L.A.
               tonight, so sometimes I come over
               after I work late and we watch
               the game here. He makes funny
               comments. He's really a good
               guy. He just...

                         RAY (O.C.)
               Who is it?

                         ED
               It's me, Ed.

     The door opens a crack, revealing Ray in a bathrobe. Ray's
     look is unwelcoming.

                         RAY
               Hi.

                         ED
               You watching the ballgame?

                         RAY
               Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired.
               I fell asleep.

                         ED
               Oh. All right. I'11 watch at
               home, then.

                         RAY
               Yeah...

                         WOMAN (O.C.)
               Ray, where do you keep the
               glasses?

                         ED
               Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't
               you just say so? Why are you
               giving me a song-and-dance about
               being tired?

                         ED (CONT'D)
                    (calls out)
               Hi, Shari.

                         WOMAN (O.C.)
               Who's Shari?

                         ED
               Who's --

     Ray looks pained. Ed realizes what's happening and freezes
     Ray's phone RINGS.

                         RAY
               Oh shit...

     He turns to answer his phone, allowing the door to swing open
     a little. Ed can see into the kitchen. He sees a WOMAN,
     wearing just panties, facing away from him, searching for
     glasses.

                         RAY
                    (into phone)
               Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ...
               Oh God!

                         ED
                    (to the camera)
               We'd better go...

     RAPID CUTS of VIEWERS loving this, some screaming "Don't go!,
     don't leave, stay" etc.

     BACK TO SCENE

                         RAY
                    (into phone)
               No, honey, it's not what it looks
               like--

     She hangs up on him. He holds his head.

                         RAY
               Oh God ... Ed!


  64    INT. HALLWAY
     Ed is TIP-TOEING away. He stops when Ray calls him. Ray 'runs
     out into the hallway after him. They speak with lowered
     voices.

                         RAY
               That was Shari. She saw the
               whole thing on TV--

                         ED
               What is this? What's going on,
               who is that?

                         RAY
                    (embarrassed)
               It's the receptionist at one of
               the places I service video
               equipment -- she's very pretty
               and, you know, she never even
               talks to me and then today I come
               in and she's all "I saw you on TV
               the other night... You were so
               great ... " Next thing I know
               we're ...

                         ED
               Next thing you know! Why didn't
               you stop?

                         RAY
               Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop.
               The woman's supposed to stop.
               We're the gas, they're the
               brakes.

                         WOMAN (O.C.)
                    (calls out)
               Ray, I finished the Snapple.

                         RAY
               Fine!

                         WOMAN (O.C.)
               Is there more?

                         RAY
               In the cabinet, but it's warm.
               There's ice in the tray. I 
                    (to Ed)
               Talk to her.

                         ED
               I don't even know her. All I
               know is she likes Snapple.

                         RAY
               No, not her. Shari. Go over
               there and talk to her


  65    INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM

                         CYNTHIA
               Yes! Go!

     She THROWS SOMETHING at the screen.

     She PICKS UP the PHONE.


  66    INT. HALLWAY

                         ED
               Why me?

                         RAY
               You brought the cameras here!

                         ED
               You brought the girl!

                         RAY
               Please!

                         ED
               If I go over to Shari, the
               camera's going there, too.

     The Camera Operators are vigorously nodding and mouthing "Yes, Go."
     Ray is oblivious to this, but Ed picks it up.

                         RAY
               That's good. She'11 -- you know
               control herself. Look. If I go
               over there, she's just gonna slam
               the door on me. Just go over and
               beg her to talk to me, that's
               all. Please. You owe me for
               this!

     Ed accepts the irony of Ray's attitude without comment


  67    INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY- NIGHT
     The door opens, revealing RITA, Shari's roommate.

                         RITA
                    (nervously)
               Um... Shari knew you were coming
               over because she saw ...

                         ED
               Right, yeah --

                         RITA
                    (apologetic)
               She really doesn't want you and
               the camera in here right now.

                         ED
               No, I understand. That's -
               where is she, is she all right?

     Rita isn't sure how much she should reveal.

                         RITA
               I ... gave her a drink. I thought
               it ... but she's not much of a
               drinker, so it's made her a
               little... belligerent.

     Shari appears in the doorway over Rita's shoulder. she's
     holding a liquor bottle and she's a little drunk.

                         SHARI
               What do you want?!

                         ED
                    (awkward)
               Shari, I'm just really sorry.
               Look, I know this is...
               unbelievably awkward, but if I
               could come in for like a second
               and -- you know -- just say...
               two words, then...

     Shari indicates with her head, that Ed can come in.

     Ed and Carlos enter. Rita shuts the door. Shari crosses to a
     couch. Ed indicates for Carlos to give them some distance.


  68    INT. CONTROL TRUCK

                         DIRECTOR
               Don't lose them, Carlos. This is
               gold. Stay out of their way, but
               get everything.


  69    INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT
     Carlos settles across the room. He rests the camera down as if
     he's not even shooting, but he's still guiding it where he
     wants it throughout the scene.

                         RITA
               I'm gonna go to bed.
                    (to Shari)
               You okay?

     Shari shrugs.

                         RITA (CONT'D)
               Good night. 

     She gives the camera a quick glance.

                         RITA (CONT'D)
                    (quickly, with a small
                    wave)
               Hi, Mom.
                    (she exits)

                         ED
               Shari, Ray feels --

                         SHARI
                    (starting to cry)
               Don't defend that horse's ass to
               me.

                         ED
               I'm not. I'm not. I'm just
               Look -- you know, in a way, it's
               good. He got this out of his
               system now and he knows it's
               not worth it and, you know,
               someday if you guys got married
               or something --

                         SHARI
               Ha!

                         ED
               Okay ...

                         SHARI
                    (poking Ed as she
                    talks)
               I've got news for you-- I never
               intended to marry him.

                         ED
               Oh... how come?


  70    INT. RAY'S APARTMENT
     Ray, watching on TV.


  71    INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT

                         SHARI
               Well, for one thing, he's a bad
               lay.


  72    INT. RAY'S APARTMENT
     His eyes bulge out and he begins to gasp.

     RAPID SHOTS of viewers reacting-- "Whoa!" laughs, etc. The
     college girls applauding. one of them SCREAMS "Tell it!"


  73    INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT
     Ed realizes that Ray's been called a "bad lay" on television.

                         ED
               Oh my God.

                         SHARI
                    (directly into the
                    camera)
               I mean bad.

                         ED
               Look, not having been there... I
               just think you're hurt and you're
               saying this to, you know, get
               back at him.

     She starts to cry.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Look... whether you get back
               together or not, you're too
               terrific a person to... lower
               yourself like this.


  74    INT. RAY'S APARTMENT
     Ray, still in shock.


  75    INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT

                         ED (CONT'D)
               I mean, I told Ray -- a couple of
               times -- that I thought you were
               one of the best and ... smartest
               and... most attractive women
               I've ever seen so...

     In comforting her, he's gotten his face very close to hers.


  76    INT. DORMITORY
     Same dorm girls as before.

                         DORM GIRL
               Kiss him! Kiss him!

     BACK TO SCENE

                         SHARI
               Really?

                         ED
               Yeah.

     She tilts her head forward a little, hesitates, then kisses
     him, at first warmly, then passionately.


  77    INT. DORM ROOM
     The girls are going wild-- SCREECHING.


  78    INT. TAD'S HOUSE

                         TAD
               I'm nuts, hah?! I knew it! I
               said!

     He dials the phone.


  79    INT. JOHN'S HOUSE
     John is stunned.

                         JOHN
               Oh, Jesus!


  80    INT. RAY'S APARTMENT
     He stares, amazed.

     The WOMAN he was found with appears behind him.

                         WOMAN
               I found the Snapple.


  81    INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM
     She sees the kiss.

                         CYNTHIA
               Yes! Yes! I win! Scharlach,
               you schmuck! I am the golden
               goddess of television!

     She begins beating her chest, one fist at a time while she
     SCREAMS in triumph.


  82    INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT
     Shari and Ed have stopped kissing. They both look stunned.
     Shari is suddenly sober.

                         SHARI
               Oh my God.

     She looks at Carlos who has now moved closer to them

                         SHARI (CONT'D)
               Oh my God.

                         ED
               It's... okay

                         SHARI
               I kissed my boyfriend's brother
               on television!

                         ED
               Well, when you put it that way.

                         SHARI
               Leave. Go.

                         ED
               Can't we just --

                         SHARI
               Go!

                         ED
                    (exiting)
               All right. Okay. I'11 ... see
               you.

     He and Carlos exit. Going through the door, he gives Carlos a
     little push then quickly steps back inside, slams the door and
     locks it.


  83    INT. CONTROL TRUCK

                         CARLOS (V.O.)
               I'm locked out.

                         DIRECTOR
               Stay calm. Shoot the door.
               We're running sound. And we've
               got a camera in the street.


  84    EXT. BUILDING
     A CAMERA is shooting at a second-story window. We SEE
     SILHOUETTES.


  85    INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT
     Ed is at the door. Shari is across the room. They stare at
     each other silently. Then they run to each other. They kiss
     again.


  86    EXT. BUILDING
     We can SEE them KISSING...


  87    INT. APARTMENT
     Ed and Shari are all over each other. They're breathless.

                         SHARI
               What are we doing?

                         ED
               I've got to tell you something.
               I have had a big thing for you
               for months.

     INTERCUT WITH SHOTS OF VIEWERS

     They're seeing the door or the silhouette shot, but they're
     hearing every word. They're mesmerized.

                         SHARI
               Really?
  
                         ED
               Yeah. I mean for months I've
               been seeing you with Ray you
               being his girlfriend and I
               kept wishing you were my
               girlfriend... But, you know, what
               could I do?

                         SHARI
               Me too. I mean I'm going out
               with Ray and I'm... thinking
               about you.

                         ED
               Really?

                         SHARI
               Oh God, this is so weird.

                         ED
               Weird? If this happened last
               month it would've been weird.
               Now with... the TV and... now
               it's just too weird.

     They look at each other. They don't know what to do.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               I'd better go.

     She nods. He walks to the door.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Once more?

     She nods. They run back to each other and kiss.


  88    EXT. BUILDING
     The silhouettes are kissing.


  89    INT. RAY'S APARTMENT
     Ray staring at the TV.


  90    EXT. PRIVATE HOME - LATER
     "DAY SIX"

     This is a fairly old, modest private home. Ed pulls up. He
     and Carlos get out of the car. Ed hurries up to the front door
     and enters.


  91    INT. HOME - CONTINUOUS
     Ed enters. He's a little AGITATED

     ANGLE ON AL
                         ED
               Hi, Al.

     Al is in his wheelchair and taking periodic hits off an oxygen
     mask connected to a tank. Al's watching himself on TV.

                         AL
                    (excited)
               Look. It's me.

     He WAVES.

                         ED
               Yeah. I brought you some movies.

                         AL
               Anything good?

     They LAUGH.

                         ED
               No, I intentionally picked out a
               lot of crap 'cause I don't like
               you.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Is Mom here? I gotta talk to
               her.

                         AL
               She's in the kitchen. I'd yell
               for her, but I'd die.
                    (sucks more oxygen)
               You had a busy night last night.

                         ED
                    (calls)
               Yeah. Ma...

                         JEANETTE (O.C.)
               Eddie? ...

                         ED
               Yeah?

                         JEANETTE (O.C.)
               Are the TV people with you?

                         ED
               Yeah. The camera guy is here.

                         JEANETTE (O.C.)
               Send him away.

                         ED
               Send him? Ma, I can't.
               it's -- just come out here.
               Please, I --

                         JEANETTE (O.C.)
               No.

                         ED
               Do you want us to come in the
               kitchen?

                         JEANETTE (O.C.)
               No. It's a mess.

                         ED
               Look, Ma, come on out. Really.
               I need to talk to you.

     After a pause, Jeanette enters, very camera-conscious.

                         ED (CONT'D)
                    (to the camera)
               This is my mother.

     STIFFLY, he gives her a kiss.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Ma, do you know where Ray is?
               I've been calling him and I'm
               getting his machine and --

                         JEANETTE
               Eddie, how could you do it? Your
               brother's girlfriend.

                         ED
               Hey, he cheated on her.

                         JEANETTE
               He made a mistake.

                         ED
               I don't want to -- do you know
               where he is?

                         JEANETTE
               No. Maybe he's watching.
                    (indicates the camera)
               Tell him you're sorry. Tell him
               you'11 stay away from that girl.

                         ED
               No! And that girl has a name.

                         AL
               What do you love her or
               something?

                         ED
                    (embarrassed)
               Come on...

                         AL
                    (teasing)
               Look at your face. I had a car
               that color.

     VARIOUS REACTIONS OF VIEWERS really liking this.

     BACK TO SCENE

                         JEANETTE
               I know you. This Shari is a
               passing fancy.

                         ED
               No! I -- All right,
               look, if you hear from Ray.... tell
               him to call me, okay?

     He KISSES her again.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               How's Marcia? She all right?

                         JEANETTE
               I don't know.
               She's living with that
               "entertainer"...

                         ED
                    (trying to make his
                    mother feel better)
               Well, who knows? Maybe she
               finally picked a winner this
               time.

                         JEANETTE
                    (unconvinced)
               Mm.

                         ED
               You and Al lived together a few
               months before you got married --
               after Dad left.

                         JEANETTE
                    (looks at the TV)
               Oh my God!

                         ED
               I mean, that worked out.

                         JEANETTE
               Oh my God!!

     She gets in the closet and closes the door.


  92    INT. OFFICE

                         ED
                    (to the camera)
               I think we're through here.

     The Real TV group is there.
     They're smiling. Cynthia is ON the PHONE

                         CYNTHIA
                    (into phone)
               I will. I'11 tell them.
                    (hangs up)
               That was Scharlach. All of you,
               scrub your asses. He's coming
               over to kiss them.

     They all WHOOP and LAUGH.


  93    INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT - DAY
     Shari and Rita are watching Ed leave his parents house on TV.
     Rita is very excited. Shari is ON the PHONE.

                         SHARI
                    (into phone)
               Um, I'd like to get a new phone
               number, please... Because I'm
               getting calls from every nut case
               in America... Right, unlisted...
               Sure.
                    (she holds)

                         RITA
               Aren't you excited? He said he
               loved you on television!

                         SHARI
               He didn't say it. His stepfather
               said it.

                         RITA
                    (joking)
               Well, the stepfather's cute...
               Seriously, how do you feel about
               Ed?

     Pause.

                         SHARI
               I think he's great. He just
               makes me feel... oh, I'm really
               gonna get hurt, this time - Hello ...

     CUTS OF VARIOUS VIEWERS WATCHING REAL TV

     End on TAD and BARRY in a health club. This is the refreshment
     area. They've played racquetball and they're sweaty. They're
     watching Real TV.

                         TAD
               I'11 tell you something else.
               The old guy in the wheelchair?
               The stepfather? They're gonna
               have him die.

                         BARRY
               What do you mean "they're gonna
               have him die?"

                         TAD
               You know, for a tearjerker. The
               audience falls in love with this
               loveable old geezer in a
               wheelchair and then he dies,
               it's ... They know what they're
               doing.

                         BARRY
               This is real, Bananahead!

                         TAD
               So?

                         BARRY
               So if it's a show and they have
               a guy die that's writing, but if
               it's real and they have a guy die
               that's murder.


  94    EXT. VIDEO STORE - DAY
     Ed arrives for work.

     People CALL OUT to him-- PEDESTRIANS, PEOPLE FROM CARS, TRUCK
     DRIVERS. "Hey Ed, my man." Ed waves. People shake his hand.
     A teenage boy looks into the camera, making a funny face.
     Someone else looks into the camera and says, "Hi, Ma."

     Suddenly, Ray is there with a WOMAN. Ray is not happy. He's
     wearing DARK GLASSES and a HAT.

                         RAY
               Hi.

     Ed stops.

                         ED
               ... Ray?

                         RAY
               Yeah.

                         ED
               Oh, man, I've been trying to call
               you.

                         RAY
               I know.

                         ED
               Look, we gotta talk.

                         RAY
               Save it.

     A GUY in a car appears and points at Ray.

                         GUY
               Hey, you're that French guy on TV.

                         RAY
               French guy?

                         GUY
               Monsieur Bad-a-lay.

     The guy drives away. Ray is steaming.

                         RAY
               Let me just do what I came here
               to do.

     Ed thinks he means to fight. Ed tries to calm him.

                         ED
               What are we gonna fight? Ray,
               please, listen to me --

                         RAY
                    (beckoning)
               Cassie...

     CASSIE, a woman about Ray's age, steps forward. She's slightly
     self-conscious.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
               Go ahead.

     Ray points Cassie to the camera.

                         CASSIE
               This is really hard.

                         RAY
               You promised me.

                         CASSIE
                    (to the camera)
               I went out with Ray a few years
               ago for... a couple of months.
               And we... were intimate. And.
               he's really not as bad as that
               girl said he was.

     Ray nods.

                         CASSIE (CONT'D)
               I mean, I've definitely had
               worse.

                         RAY
               That's enough.

     Ed is amazed that Ray would do this.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
                    (to Ed)
               Good-bye, brother!

                         ED
               Ray, come an--

     Ray leaves, still angry.

     Cassie lingers.

                         CASSIE
                    (flirting slightly)
               So you're Ed.

     Ray returns and yanks Cassie away with him. Ed still hasn't
     recovered from the bizarreness he just witnessed. Two girls
     YELL in unison from across the street.

                         GIRLS
               Ed... we love you!


  95    INT. REAL TV OFFICE - NIGHT
     Cynthia and her staff, around a conference call box.

                         CYNTHIA
               We're not going to be able to
               come over there for anymore
               midnight meetings. People are
               starting to watch your building.
               The interest level in you is
               soaring.

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

  95A   INT. ED'S BEDROOM.
     Ed's OFF-CAMERA

                         ED
               Soaring is good, right? I mean,
               that means you're not gonna
               cancel me, right?

                         KEITH
                    (sotto)
               Man, he wants that balloon
               payment.

                         ED (V.O.)
               Huh?

                         TERRY
               Ed, why didn't you go over to see
               Shari today? That's what all our
               viewers were hoping you'd do.

                         ED
               Isn't she great? I mean, maybe
               just to me, but... I don't know,
               she's just --

                         TERRY
                    (impatiently)
               She's great, she's great. Why
               didn't you go see her?

                         ED
               I wanted to! I was dying to!
               But...

                         GREG
               Is it Ray?
                    (pulls out research)
               The audience hates Ray. Females,
               18 to 35 --

                         ED
               No, I don't need to hear that. Cynthia?

                         CYNTHIA
               Yes, Ed.

                         ED
               Could we just talk alone for a
               second? I --

                         CYNTHIA
               Good idea.
                    (to her staff)
               Could you all leave us alone for
               a few minutes?

     She PANTOMIMES for them to stay in the room, but be quiet. The
     staff scrape chair legs and feign movement and ad lib "Bye Ed",
     "See you, buddy" etc. They all stay.

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
               How you doing, Ed?

                         ED
               I feel like when I was a kid and
               my mother sent me to school in
               orange corduroy pants.

                         CYNTHIA
                    (no clue)
               Uh-huh?

                         ED
               And all the kids stared calling
               me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin
               Ass," -- for like a year. So,
               now, I feel like everyone's
               watching me and, you know, I'm
               "Pumpkin Ass" again.

     The staff are stifling giggles.

                         CYNTHIA
               Can I tell you something? I
               think you are fantastic. I think
               you have taken an idea and turned
               it into something explosive.

     The staff stifle laughter. One of the guys is doing a jerk-off
     gesture. Cynthia gives them the finger.

                         ED
               Yeah?

                         CYNTHIA
               Can I give you one bit of advice?
               About Shari?

                         ED
               Sure.

                         CYNTHIA
               A woman wants to be pursued.


  96    EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY
     Shari, in her Fed-ex uniform is making a delivery. A WOMAN's 
     signing for it.

                         WOMAN
               This is so exciting! A real
               celebrity delivering my figs.

                         SHARI
                    (uncomfortable)
               Sign here, please.

                         WOMAN
               That Ray was a pig. Ed is
               doll. You latch on to him
               honey.

                         SHARI
               By the X.

                         WOMAN
               Some more make-up wouldn't do you
               any harm. On TV you look a
               little washed out.

                         SHARI
               What would I actually have to do
               to get you to sign this?

                         WOMAN
                    (insulted)
               Oh, an TV a minute and already an
               attitude.

                         SHARI
                    (annoyed)
               By the X. That's were two lines
               cross -- forming an X.

     ANGRILY, the Woman signs and slams the door.

     She heads back to her truck. She looks up and Ed is there with
     flowers. The TV cameras are there also. Shari is startled.
     But she's also glad to see him.

                         SHARI
               What are you doing?

                         ED
               I missed you.

     She's camera-shy.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               You know, I never saw you in your
               uniform before.

                         SHARI
               Yeah, well...

     They both LAUGH.

                         ED
               It's really a tremendous turnoff.

                         SHARI
               You should see the one we wear
               when it rains.

                         ED
               Sunday night at the Devils game,
               I'm driving the Zamboni.

                         SHARI
               The what?

                         ED
               You know, the big machine that
               cleans the ice.

                         SHARI
               Oh yeah.

                         ED
               It's quite an honor. Will you
               come with me?

     She looks at the camera.

                         ED (CONT'D)
                    (gently)
               Look, I know this is weird.
               But... I don't want to wait. I
               really think we might have
               something together. Don't you?

     EMBARRASSED, she nods.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Come on. Be my zamboni date.

     She doesn't say "no."

     They KISS -- a little hesitantly, not passionately, but
     affectionately. She's still self-conscious, but she's going
     with the flow.


  97    INT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE
     They're watching. They CHEER and high-five each other.


  98    INT. SHORT MONTAGE
     Ed and Shari dating. She's shy, but she really likes Ed. He
     likes her and is very sweet to her.

     1) Ed and Shari some place like "Tavern on the Green." She
     looks pretty. He's very happy.

     2) They come out of a club. TOURISTS photograph them. Shari
     is a little disconcerted. Ed takes out a little camera of his
     own and photographs the tourists. This makes Shari laugh and
     relaxes her.

     3) HOCKEY ARENA

     CLOSE-UP of Ed, driving the Zamboni. He's loving it. He WAVES
     to Shari.

     SHARI IN THE STANDS, watching. She waves and smiles.

     The ice, a WIDER SHOT.

     The Zamboni is, basically out of control. Carlos is sliding
     along the ice, shooting Ed as the Zamboni zig-zags dangerously,
     eventually crashing into the boards, shattering the Plexiglas.


  99    INT. LOCAL ROCK CLUB - NIGHT
     It's very CROWDED. Claustrophobic. Loud. Ed and Shari enter
     just to see the show. They're spotted.

     The Crowd, which is already fired up by the music, sees them.
     It starts out okay, people crowding around, patting Ed on the
     back.

     A CHANT begins "Ed, Ed, Ed..." Pretty soon it drowns out the
     music.

     More people press towards Ed. It's too crowded -- dangerous.
     Shari is swept away from Ed. She's buffeted about, violently.
     She goes down. Ed can't move. The Crowd is friendly and
     happy, but the effect is scary.


  100   EXT. ROCK CLUB - A FEW MINUTES LATER
     BOUNCERS squeeze Ed and Shari out the door, protecting them.
     Ed is unnerved. Shari is somewhat bedraggled. Her clothing is
     torn.


  101   INT. ED'S KITCHEN - DAY
     Ed is ON the PHONE.

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

                         CYNTHIA'S OFFICE
               Yeah?!

                         ED
               They tore her dress! ...

                         CYNTHIA
               We're going to get you a
               bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I
               have some news for you. We're
               picking up Ed TV for another
               month!

                         ED
                    (excited)
               Yeah?!

                         CYNTHIA
               That means a balloon payment and
               a big raise for the second month.

                         ED
               Stand back -- I'm about to do my
               Happy Dance.

     He does.


  102   INT. RESTAURANT
     Ed and Shari are EATING. So is a HUGE MAN sitting between
     them. His name is MOE.


  103   INT. ROLLER RINK
     Ed and Shari are SKATING. Up ahead of them, Moe, (on skates)
     is plowing into people, knocking them over.


  104   INT. PIZZA JOINT - NIGHT
     Ed and Shari get up to leave. They look at each other, very
     affectionately. They want to kiss. The cameras are close.

     Ed is wearing a jacket. He spreads it out wide to block
     Shari's face from the cameras. He leans in and they KISS on
     the lips, several times, while Ed's jacket screens off the
     cameras. They're in love.


  105   INT. TV NEWS SHOW- THREE WEEKS LATER
     Written on the screen -- "Day 26."

     It's the same news team we met earlier.

                         ANCHOR
               Well, welve had pet rocks, hula
               hoops, Davy Crockett, Beatle
               wigs, and leisure suits. But
               America's latest craze is a guy
               named Ed. Here with that story
               is entertainment reporter, Rick
               Douglas.

                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
               Pat, four weeks ago, no one in
               America had even heard of Ed
               Pekurny. Today, this thirty-one
               year-old video store clerk has
               become something of a national
               obsession. The words viewers use
               to describe him are "charming,"
               "natural," and "appealing." And
               ratings indicate that "Ed TV" is
               being watched by more people,
               each day, than any show in the
               history of cable television.

                                        CUT TO:

     A SHOT of Scharlach being interviewed. A CAPTION identifies him.

                         SCHARLACH
               This idea just came to me. I
               told my staff -- if people just
               tune in twice a day for five
               minutes we're a hit. Sometimes
               you gotta go with your gut
               feeling.

                                        CUT TO:

  106   INT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE
     She's watching. She's ANGRY.

                         CYNTHIA
               Sure it came to you! Because I
               brought it to you!
                    (raises her fist)
               You want a gut feeling?! How
               about a groin feeling?!
                    (raises her foot)

     BACK TO NEWS REPORT

                         ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
               Ed TV has become so popular that
               when Ed goes to sleep Real TV is
               running highlights of Ed's day
               all night. Some viewers have
               become obsessed with Ed. They
               wake up when Ed wakes up, they go
               to sleep when Ed goes to sleep,
               and in between they try to watch
               as much of him as possible.

     A SERIES OF MAN-IN-THE-STREET INTERVIEWS.

                         WOMAN #1
                    (casually)
               Yeah, I watch it... More than I'd
               like to admit sometimes.

                         MAN
                    (about fifty)
               Never... no...

                         YOUNGER MAN
               Honestly? ... I try not to go to
               the bathroom until Ed goes to the
               bathroom so I won't miss
               anything.

     A GUY in an ice cream store.

                         ICE CREAM GUY
               Watch this! Like Ed.

     He slices a banana the way Ed does.

                         WOMAN #2
               I just kind of leave it an, you
               know, so it's... there.

     THREE TEEN-AGE GIRLS

                         TEEN-AGER #l
               I don't like Shari. She's ...
               needy.

                         TEEN-AGER #2
               I like her. She's sweet.

                         TEEN-AGER #1
               She just rubs me the wrong way.

                         TEEN-AGER #3
               I'm so glad they got rid of Ray.
               He was creepy.

                         GUY #1
               To me, this Shari is like
               nothing.

                         GUY #2
               She's not even hot. I mean Ed's
               a celebrity. If that was me, I'd
               be dating the goods.

                         GUY #1
               There's something wrong with her.
               She's definitely not hot.

                         GUY #2
               Not hot. Not.


  107   INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT
     She's watching this, wearing a bathrobe.
     Her self-esteem is being crushed.


  108   INT. TV STUDIO
     This is an "E TV" kind of gossip show. The host -- a YOUNG
     WOMAN -- is showing film of Ed and Shari getting out of Ed's
     car. The film freeze-frames. Shari has an 
     unflattering look on her face.

                         GOSSIP QUEEN
               What's wrong with her! Everytime
               you look at this chick, it's like
               she badly needs a Tampax. Ed, you
               can do better.

     Shari watching, in horror.


  109   INT. DELICATESSAN - NIGHT
     Ed and Shari are on a date. A WAITRESS is taking their order.
     Shari still seems a little self-conscious, but Ed is having a
     ball.

                         ED
               I'11 have...
                    (to Shari)
               Get this --
                    (to the waitress)
               I'11 have the "Ed."

                         SHARI
               I'm stunned.

     A WOMAN with her young SON approach.

                         WOMAN
               Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother
               you. My son would just love to
               have your autograph.

                         ED
               No problema.
                    (to the boy)
               You want a picture?

     The boy nods.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Moe.

     MOE, the Bodyguard, in the next booth hands Ed a glossy of Ed
     and a pen. Ed signs it.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Take this around the corner to
               Frame World, they'll give you a
               discount.

     The Woman and Child leave.

                         ED (CONT'D)
                    (to Shari)
               Oh -- Sunday is good for me to
               meet your folks. We get a big
               family audience on Sundays so it
               works out.

                         SHARI
                    (ironic)
               That's lucky.

                         ED
               Saturday, I think we should

     A PHONE RINGS

     Ed takes a phone out of his pocket.

                         ED (CONT'D)
                    (plugging)
               Compliments of Motorola.
               Hello... Marcia??
                    (to Shari)
               My sister. -- What? ... What,
               right now? ... I'm eating, I'm on
               a date! ... Well, where's your
               boyfriend -- what's his name?
               Cliff .... Then, call a cab...
                    (wearily)
               All right. Look, just don't
               start any trouble okay. Just sit
               there quietly 'til I get there...
               you're welcome.

     He HANGS UP. He's disgusted.


  110   INT. CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

                         ED
               This used to be a regular thing.
               And the worst part, is while
               she'd be waiting for me to come
               down to some bar and get her,
               she'd start up with some guy and
               say "Wait 'til my brother gets
               here, he'11 kick your ass." So
               then I walk in and there's some
               rhinoceros in a windbreaker who
               tries to shove me into a shot
               glass. And Marcia's drunk and
               screaming "Kick his ass, Ed.
               Kick his ass."
                    (looks out)
               I think this is it.


  111   INT. BAR
     It's not a seedy dive. Ed and Shari and the camera operators
     enter. A CUSTOMER approaches.

                         CUSTOMER
               Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You're
               the guy on TV.

                         ED
               What was the tip-off? The
               enormous camera?

                         CUSTOMER
               Watch this.

     The guy does Ed's "Happy Dance."

                         CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
               See, like you.

                         ED
               Yeah. Keep up the good work.

     Ed brushes by him. He sees a WOMAN passed out at a table.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Oh great.

     He prepares to lift her.

                         MARCIA (O.C.)
               Ed.

     He turns and sees Marcia standing there.

                         MARCIA (CONT'D)
               What are you doing?

                         ED
               Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this
               drunken woman you?

     He lets go of the woman.

     Her head bounces on the table.

                         ED (CONT' D)
               What's going on? Why did you
               want me to come down here?

     Marcia guides them into chairs.

                         MARCIA
               Cliff is here. He's performing.
               I wanted you to see him.

     For a second, Ed doesn't get it. Then.

                         ED
               Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it.
               It's "Star Search." You wanted
               me here because the camera comes
               with me.

                         MARCIA
               Ed, he needs a break. You don't
               know what kind of bad luck he's
               had --

                         ED
               I can imagine. You said you
               wanted nothing to do with this.
               You swore to me. "Don't come
               near me. Don't bring this into
               my life..."


                         MARCIA
               For God sakes, you said two words
               about some lousy pizza joint, the
               guy's a millionaire now. This
               could be my whole future we're
               talking about.
                    (to Shari)
               Hi, I'm Ed's sister.

                         SHARI
                    (politely)
               I've heard so much about you.


  112   INT. BAR - LATER
     Cliff is in the middle of his show.

     He's wearing a PORTABLE ORGAN. He's not great. He's a smalltime 
professional with a lot of pep. Marcia is beaming. Ed's
     cameras are shooting him.

     CUTS OF Cliff, singing every type of song, imaginable. This
     guy is desperately trying to cover all the bases -- i.e.
     Sinatra-type standards, something from "Lion King", "Do Ya'
     Think I'm Sexy," "Smokin' in the Boy's Room," "Hey, Hey, We're
     the Monkees," the theme from "Hawaii Five-0," a rap number, and
     "Ave Maria."

     ANGLE ON ED AND SHARI

                         ED
                    (sotto)
               I wish my stepfather was here.

                         SHARI
               Why?

                         ED
               He could give me some oxygen.

     Ed and Shari are KISSING.

     CUTAWAYS TO VIEWERS

     TAD AND BARRY

                         BARRY
               Oh boy! Here we go!

     Ed is passionate.

     JEANETTE AND AL

                         JEANETTE
                    (cringing)
               Euuw...

     RAY

     Fuming.

     BACK TO ED AND SHARI

                         SHARI
               Um...

                         ED
               What?
 
     She indicates the camera. Ed tries to allay her fears.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               I told you. If we... you know
               do it, they go away until ...
               we're done.

                         SHARI
               I know, but even if they go away,
               everybody in America knows what
               we're doing because... they went
               away.

                         ED
               So? What do they think -- we're
               not kids --

                         SHARI
                    (overlapping)
               I know, I ...

                         ED
                    (overlapping)
               Shari, I really like you...

                         SHARI
                    (overlapping)
               I really like you too...

                         ED
               ...if this ...
                    (the camera)
               ... weren't here... ?

                         SHARI
               ... yeah, then, but...

     CUTAWAYS

                         ED
               So...?

                         SHARI
               Ed... I think we should stop
               seeing each other.

     The guys who said she wasn't hot.

     They applaud.

     THE DORM GIRLS

     They're booing Shari.

     A BAR

     A very attractive woman (JILL) and her friend.

                         JILL
               That girl's an idiot.

     BACK TO ED AND SHARI

                         ED
               What?... Why?

                         SHARI
                    (starting to weep)
               I can't take it anymore...

     GUYS WHO DON'T THINK SHE'S HOT

     They mock her, crying "Boo hoo hoo" and pretending to rub their
     eyes.

     BACK TO ED AND SHARI

                         SHARI
                    (crying)
               I have no privacy. Even now!
               I'm crying and I can't stop and
               they won't go away. And now it's
               going to be another month!

                         ED
               Shari...

                         SHARI
               Everybody hates me!

                         ED
               No. Who?

                         SHARI
               Look at this.

     She picks up a N.Y. POST.

                         SHARI (CONT'D)
               Page three of the Post.
 
                         ED
                    (knows what it is)
               Ohh...

                         SHARI
               A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough
               for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent
               said "no."
                    (crying)
               They hate me!

                         ED
               Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I
               do care.
                    (to the camera)
               Shame on everybody. Shame on
               you! Well, just the seventy-one
               percent. The other...
                    (he can't do the math)

                         SHARI
               Twenty-nine.

                         ED
               Exactly. Boy, you're smart.
                    (to the camera)
               Why are you so mean to her? What
               did she do to you?
                    (picks up newspaper)
               "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who
               the hell am I?
                    (sarcastically)
               Who the hell do you think I
               should be dating?

                         SHARI
               There's a list.

                         ED
               Really?
                    (he looks)

                         SHARI
               Ed?

     He doesn't hear her. He's scanning the list.

                         ED
               Wow...


  114   INT. DAVID LETTERMAN SHOW (OR SOMETHING)
     Ed is a guest.

                         DAVE
               I'm out here an hour a night and
               I feel like a dork. You're on
               every minute! Doesn't it just
               drive you nuts?

                         ED
                    (cheerfully)
               Yeah.

     LAUGHS.

                         DAVE
               All this fame and the money
               you're making. Is this going to
               change you, do you think?

                         ED
               God, I hope so.

     BIGGER LAUGHS.


  115   INT. GREEN ROOM - LATER
     It's after the show. Ed is getting ready to leave. John is
     with him, keeping him company. A. P.A. is giving Ed a bag of
     gifts. (Of course, Ed is still on Ed TV.)

                         PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
               You've got a ham in there and
               Dave's book and --

                         ED
               Hey, if it's free, it's me.
                    (to John)
               You ready?

                         JOHN
               Yeah. You did good. What's
               wrong?

                         ED
               Aah, I wanted Shari to come.

                         JOHN
               Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor
               substitute?

     He KISSES John.

                         ED
                    (easily)
               Yeah.
                    (to the camera)
               Honey, if you're watching this is
               for you.

                         JOHN
               No! Don't --
                    (new subject)
               Oh, wow.

                         ED
               What?

     ANGLE ON JILL IN THE HALLWAY (We met her earlier in a cutaway.)

     She's saying good-bye to a CASTING ASSISTANT.

                         JOHN
               No more calls, we have a 
               winner.

     Jill looks up, sees Ed and walks right up to him

                         JILL
               Hi.

                         ED
               Hi.

     SECURITY steps forward.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               It's all right.

     They step back.

                         JILL
               I'm Jill. I really like your
               show. I think you're great.

                         ED
               Thanks... That's ...

     Shari, watching this on television.

                         JILL
               You must be John.

                         JOHN
               I'm trying to remember.

                         JILL
                    (to Ed)
               Well, I don't want to bother you,
               I'm just -- I was here
               auditioning for a skit. You
               know, one of those things where
               Dave goes around town with models
               and whatever...

                         ED
               Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah...
               those are funny...

                         JILL
               Well, it was really nice meeting
               you and, uh...
                    (checks her watch)
               I'd better get a cab.

     But she doesn't leave.

                         ED
               Um... They gave me a limo, uh...

                         JILL
               Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just
               going uptown.

     She takes his arm and leads him out.

                         COLLEGE GIRL
               He'll never cheat on Shari!

     The game includes Tad and Barry.


  119   INT. TV STUDIO

                         BARRY
               You think she really likes him?

                         TAD
               She doesn't give a shit about
               him.

                         BARRY
               You know what would be great?

                         TAD
               What?

                         BARRY
               If Ray would steal this girl from
               Ed. That would be great.

                         POKER PLAYER #2
               You know what would be even
               better?

                         BARRY
               What?

                         POKER PLAYER #2
               If you shut your hole and played
               cards. Goddam pineapple
               brothers.

     The same eggheads who, earlier, had no interest in Ed. Now
     they're all worked up.

                         PANEL MEMBER #1
               But he's not a normal person
               anymore. He's a celebrity.
               We're no longer observing
               anyone's "real life."

                         PANEL MEMBER #2
                    (disagreeing)
               But that's what's interesting!
               The effect of celebrity on an
               otherwise average person.

                         PANEL MEMBER #3
               But do you really feel that Ed is
               an average person? I mean this
               guy seems to have a... magnetism,
               a charisma that, I think,
               transcends the entire concept.

                         PANEL MEMBER #4
               I agree. He's special.

     They all nod.



  120   INT. EWS APARTMENT - DAY
     " DAY 34 "

     Ed is opening letters and packages. There are piles of them

                         ED
               This is from a girl named
               Tawny... this goes in the nude
               picture pile. Thank you, Tawny.

     He places it in a large pile. He opens another envelope.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Let's see.

     Ed stares and his smile disappears.

     ANGLE ON THE MAIL

     A picture of Ed's face with his body drawn underneath it. The
     body is spurting blood and is mutilated. Ed stares at it.

                         ED
               Well. This is creative. This
               goes in the psychopath pile.

     The DOORBELL RINGS.

                         ED
               Oh, I hope that's not this guy.
                    (indicates psycho
                    letter)

     He PICKS UP a baseball bat and crosses to the door.

     He opens the door. A handsome man in his early sixties is
     there. His name is HANK.

                         HANK
               Hello.

                         ED
               Hi.

     Ed waits.

                         HANK
               You don't recognize me.

                         ED
               No. Am I supposed to?

     Hank shrugs. Ed stares at him, then begins to look a little
     shaken.

                         HANK
               It's me, Hank -- your father.

     RAPID CUTS of VIEWERS, excited. Many of them reach for the
     phone.


  125   INT. REAL TV OFFICE
     The Real TV staff react. Cynthia looks over-- stunned.

                         ALICE
                    (to Cynthia)
               Did you do this? Did you find
               him and get him to--

                         CYNTHIA
               No way... Oh, this just keeps
               getting better.


  126   INT. AL AND JEANETTE'S HOUSE - DAY
     Written on the screen -- "Day 35"

     Ed and his mother are arguing. Al is sucking oxygen and has a
     pile of "People" magazines with Ed on the cover. A REPAIRMAN
     is fixing the refrigerator. All their food is out and melting.

     Jeanette is trying to preserve food in an ice chest while she
     argues with Ed.

                         JEANETTE
               I can't believe you're taking his
               side.

                         ED
               I'm not! I'm just trying to get
               some facts.

                         AL
                    (to Ed)
               Sign this one to Nancy. She's
               the nurse who handles my urine.

     Ed signs.

                         JEANETTE
               I told you the facts! He
               abandoned us -- those are the
               facts.

                         ED
               So everything he told me
               yesterday was a lie. Everything.

     Al takes a loud breath.

                         JEANTETTE
               Yes! ... practically

                         ED
               What do you mean practically?
               Did he really run away or did you
               throw him out like he says.

                         REPAIRMAN
               I need to replace the coil.

                         JEANETTE
                    (to Ed)
               He ran away after I threw him
               out.
                    (to repairman)
               How much is a new coil?

                         REPAIRMAN
               A hundred and fifty bucks.

                         ED
               So he was telling the truth
               you threw him out.

                         REPAIRMAN
               Should I go ahead?

                         JEANETTE
               Yes.

                         ED
               Yes to me or yes to the coil?

                         JEANETTE
               Both.

                         ED
               Holy sh--

                         AL
               This one to Dr. Bamajian. Maybe
               he won't make me wait an hour.

     Ed signs.

                         JEANETTE
               He had girlfriends!

                         ED
               He says --

                         JEANETTE
               I don't care what he says. Look,
               I don't need to relive this. On
               television!

                         AL
               Whatever happened to Norman
               Rockwell?

                         ED
               Who?

                         AL
               Norman Rockwell. He painted
               magazine covers. Folksy. A
               mailman, a boy scout, a kid
               visiting a doctor...

                         ED
               Yeah, so... ?

                         AL
               They celebrated the common
               person.

                         ED
               Well, I don't think you can get
               more common than me, Al.

                         AL
               No. Only celebrities now. Now,
               if you put a mailman on the cover
               of a magazine he'd better have
               killed someone or no one will buy
               it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.

     Jeanette storms back in.

                         JEANETTE
               All right -- do you want to know
               the truth? I took you and Marcia
               and Ray to my sister's on the
               train for the weekend and you all
               got chicken pox. So I took you
               home a day early and there was
               your father with a woman in our
               bed. Okay?

                         ED
               Chicken pox? I was six. He
               didn't leave 'til I was twelve.

                         JEANETTE
               He... apologized, he begged me.
               He can be very... charming when
               it suits his purpose.

                         ED
               But what was that whole story
               about him and a nurse?

                         JEANETTE
               She could've been a nurse.

                         ED
               Could've been a nurse?

                         JEANETTE
               She had white shoes.

                         ED
               So does Grandma. So does
               Shaquille O'Neal. You told me
               you had a hysterectomy and he ran
               off with your nurse.

                         JEANETTE
               What's the difference?

                         ED
               The difference is for twenty
               years I thought one thing and now
               it's another thing.

     Ed nods.

                         JEANETTE
               He was no good. Do you remember
               how he used to scream at me? You
               used to cover your ears with
               dinner rolls.

                         JEANETTE (CONT'D)
               Also, no job was ever good enough
               for him. "Small potatoes, small
               potatoes." Al, you remember --

     Al breathes loudly.

                         ED
               Wait a minute. I thought you
               didn't know Al, 'til after Dad
               left.

     Pause. Even the repairman pokes his head out of the
     refrigerator.

                         ED (CONT' D)
               Oh my God. You and Al were -
               and that's why you threw him out.

                         JEANETTE
               He had a woman in my own bed!
               And how dare you call him "Dad"
               in front of Al.
                    (shakes Al by the
                    shoulder)
               This is your father. This is who
               was there for you when you needed
               someone.

                         AL
               Jeanette, you're hurting me.

                         ED
                    (on the defensive)
               I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you
               know how I feel about you...

     Al breathes loudly.

                         ED (CONT'D)
                    (uncomfortably)
               If I don't call you "Dad" it'
               just because...
               1 was already a big boy when you
               came into our lives --
                    (pointedly to his
                    mother)
               or when I thought you came into
               our lives --

                         JEANETTE
               And what did he come back now
               for?

                         ED
               Who?

                         JEANETTE
               Hank! All of a sudden. Because
               now you're famous and he can get
               something from you. I don't wan
               you to become a victim like
               Marcia.
                    (to the TV)
               Not that you're a victim, honey.
               You're not. Life's just been a
               little hard on you, sweetie.

                         ED
                    (to Al)
               What do you think. I mean
               about... him. Should I just...
               have nothing to do with him? I
               mean...

                         AL
                    (to Ed)
               Have I ever said a bad word to
               you about your father?

                         ED
               No.

                         AL
               Well, now I will. He was a crazy
               mean, son-of-a-bitch.

     Al starts to wheel himself out. Ed looks weary.

                         AL (CONT'D)
               But he was your father.


  127   INT. ED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
     He's asleep.


  128   INT. CONTROL TRUCK
     They're monitoring him. They see Ed WAKE UP. They stir.
     Sleepy, and scratching his ass, he goes into the bathroom.


  129   INT. BATHROOM
     Ed shuts the door. He takes his PORTABLE PHONE OUT of a
     bathroom drawer. (He stashed it there.) He makes a call and
     waits.

                         ED
                    (whispering)
               Hi... it's me, Ed. It's been two
               days, I want to see you... No, I
               won't let them follow me, I'11
               sneak out... No it's not allowed,
               but I'm going for it... I'm on my
               way.

     He takes CLOTHING OUT of the bathroom hamper.
     until he finds something acceptable.


  130   INT. CONTROL TRUCK
     They're monitoring the empty bed.


  131   INT. BATHROOM
     Ed is dressed. He CLIMBS OUT his bathroom window.


  132   INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT - LATER
     Shari opens her front door.

                         ED
               Hi.

     She looks down the hallway.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               They're not here.

     He goes in, grabs her and kisses her passionately.

                         SHARI
               I tried to tell you over the
               phone -- my parents went to
               Atlantic City.

                         ED
               So?

                         SHARI
               So my little brother's staying
               here. I'm sleeping with Rita.

                         ED
               Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with
               Rita? We'11 all have a good
               time.

                         SHARI
               I'm sorry.

                         ED
               Come on, let's go.

                         SHARI
               Where?

                         ED
               Somewhere.


  133   INT. ED'S CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
     They get in. They look at each other.

                         ED
               Do you want to go to a motel?

                         SHARI
               I feel like a criminal or, like
               we're cheating on someone.

                         ED
                    (nicely)
               Just... just relax. Okay? We
               won't do anything. We'11 just
               sit here for a while.

                         SHARI
               Okay.

                         ED
               Come on...

     Gently he puts his arm around her. At first, she hesitates,
     but then curls up against him and relaxes.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               I need to talk.

                         SHARI
               Are you all right?

                         ED
               She lied to me. I mean all my
               life, she's telling me one story
               and then... it turns out to be a
               completely different story. Come
               to me at some point -- tell me
               the truth. No. Not in my house.
               The truth is a stranger. And
               this is why Ray and Marcia are
               the way they are. Marcia gets
               involved with all these losers
               and sees no problem with herself -
               "How do they find me" she says.
               Ray cheats on you and then blames
               me for it. I'm the only one in
               the family who takes any
               responsibility for himself... Oh,
               man... Are you all right?

                         SHARI
                    (hesitantly)
               Yeah... I saw that girl come on
               to you at the TV show.

                         ED
               Oh that was... no, I ... she just
               kind of trapped me into giving
               her a ride. It's you. I want
               you.

                         SHARI
               ...yeah?

     He TOUCHES her. They KISS. Then again. Their hands are
     roaming. They're hot. They're breathing hard. He's
     unbuttoning her blouse. Their hands are all over each other.
     Her blouse comes off. LIGHTS GO ON. They see cameras,
     shooting at them. Shari SCREAMS and covers her breasts.


  134   INT. TV - DAY

                         ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
               Good morning. Welcome to another
               day of Ed TV. Last night, while
               most of us were asleep ... this
               happened.


  135   INT. FRAT HOUSE - MORNING
     FOUR GUYS in a disgustingly messy room, watching the replay of
     Ed and Shari.

                         FRAT GUYS
               Yes!!

     They GYRATE LEWDLY.


  136   EXT. STREET - DAY
     Shari is working. Ed is following her around. Shari is ANGRY.
     The cameras are there.

                         SHARI
               Get them away from me.

     She takes PACKAGES OUT OF the TRUCK and THROWS them at the
     cameramen.

                         ED
               It's not their fault.

                         SHARI
               No. It's your fault.

     She throws a package at him.

                         ED
               What do you want me to do? You
               want me to quit the show?!

                         SHARI
               No... Could you?

                         ED
               No. If I quit I don't get the
               balloon payment.

                         SHARI
               The what?

                         ED
               Ray borrowed this whole tub of
               money against this balloon
               payment that I don't get if I qu --
               it's too complicated. I -- Besides...

                         SHARI
               What?

     Pause.

                         ED
               You see how people look at me.
               Like when they ask for my
               autograph or say "Hi" to me...
               It's like I'm a basketball player
               or a... you know, like I'm
               someone.

                         SHARI
               Everybody's someone.

                         ED
               Well, yeah, everybody's someone.
               But I mean someone they want to
               be. I mean let's face it, I'm
               working in the video store, no
               one's coming in saying "oh, I
               wish I was that guy. 1 wish
               was rewinding that huge pile of
               tapes." At least for a month
               I'm not just a guy with a name
               tag. I'm famous.

     A GUY YELLS from across the street.

                         GUY
               Shari! Nice nipples.

                         ED
               And so are you.

     GUYS keep YELLING "Shari!"

     She tries to go after them. Ed holds her back.

                         SHARI
               I don't want to be famous for
               getting caught with my shirt off.
               If I'm going to be famous --

     The camera is right in her face. She grabs it.

                         SHARI (CONT'D)
                    (to the camera person)
               This is going right up your ass.

                         ED
               Come on.

     He returns the camera.

     Shari starts for her truck.

                         SHARI
               Look... maybe we just better put
               us on hold until this is over.

     She gets in her truck.

                         ED
               Come on! Loosen up.
                    (trying to joke)
               See -- this is why seventy-one
               per cent of the people don't like
               you.

     She SLAMS the TRUCK DOOR.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               It was a joke! A... vicious,
               thoughtless stupid joke.

     He bangs himself in the head.

     She drives away.

     He BOWS.

                         ED (CONT'D)
                    (to the camera)
               And that, for you kids out there,
               is how you screw up a relationship.


  137   INT. ED'S APARTMENT
     Ed enters. He's worn out. He plops down, and puts on the TV.

                         ED
                    (to the camera)
               I'm gonna watch anything but me.

     Ed is flipping stations. Something makes him stop.

                         ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
               Coming in two weeks to the
               Lifestyle Channel -- Joma. His
               Dad's a cop, his brother's a
               bouncer in a topless bar, his
               sister is a black-belt social
               worker -- and Joma's living with
               two gals.

     ANGLE ON THE TV

     We see JOMA. He has a lot of charisma. He seems a little
     dangerous, but in an exciting way.

                         JOMA
               Hey, Ed! I'm coming to get you,
               man! I'm gonna eat you right up!
                    (makes gobbling-up
                    noises)

     ANGLE ON ED

     Watching. He's stunned.


  138     INT. NETWORK CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
     They're watching a tape of Ed TV. Ed has just entered his own
     apartment. A WOMAN is there, sitting on his sofa. She's
     caressing Ed's undershorts against her cheek. Ed is highly
     agitated.

                         ED
               How did you get into my
               apartment?!

     The BODYGUARD is pulling her out.

     REVEAL that Scharlach, McIlvaine, Seaver, Cynthia and Greg are
     all watching.

                         McILVAINE
               What is she holding?

                         GREG
                    (calmly)
               A pair of Ed's underwear.

                         McILVAINE
               Oh my God!

     ON the TAPE, the woman while being forcibly evicted, offers
     the underwear to Ed. Ed recoils.

                         ED
               No -- keep it.

                         WOMAN
               I love you! 1 want to marry you!

     She's hauled out. They stop the tape.

                         SCHARLACH
               See -- that's television! This
               other thing, this Jama, that has
               "stink" written all over it.

                         GREG
               The break-up with Shari was very
               big. Big ratings.

                         SEAVER
               Only, Cynthia, seriously. Tell
               Ed not to sneak out anymore.

                         SCHARLACH
               Cynthia ...

     He wants it accomplished.


  139   EXT. STREET - DAY

                         SEAVER (CONT'D)
               It's in violation of his contract
               and if we wanted to be hard-nosed
               about it, he could forfeit all
               pay, including money he's already
               received.

                         CYNTHIA
                    (dutifully, but a tad
                    resentfully)
               I will see that he's properly
               threatened.

                         SCHARLACH
               Now what? What's on the young
               man's agenda? We don't want to
               see him sitting around like a
               lovesick puppy.

                         GREG
               Young males do not want to see Ed
               get back with Shari.

                         SCHARLACH
                    (impatiently)
               Enough with her. That sailed.

                         McILVAINE
               Could Ed live with two girls?

                         GREG
               You know who the audience is
               requesting a lot? That girl,
               Jill, that Ed met at the
               Letterman show. She really
               scored.

                         SCHARLACH
               Cynthia...

     He wants it accomplished.


  139   EXT. STREET - DAY
     Ed is walking from his car to a building. CROWDS are behind
     barricades. They YELL at Ed as he passes. Ed is used to this.


  140   INT. SHARI'S BUILDING - DAY
     Rita OPENS the door and sees Ed.

                         RITA
                    (nervously)
               Oh. Ed.

                         ED
               Hi. Is Shari here?

                         RITA
               No.

                         ED
               What is she, at work?

                         RITA
               She left.

                         ED
               Well, when will she be back?


                         RITA
               She won't.

                         ED
               What are you talking about?

                         RITA
               She left. She moved. She got
               Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and
               she left. She couldn't stand it
               anymore. We had people, news
               people, regular people, just
               sleeping in our hallway, going
               through our mail, our garbage.
               I mean it was she couldn't
               take it anymore. Now I've got to
               move. I can't afford this place
               by myself.

                         ED
               I'm sorry. Where'd they send
               her?

                         RITA
               She wouldn't tell me.


  141   INT. ED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
     He's off the air. He's a little down. He's ON the PHONE-

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

  142   INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM
     She's working out an a contraption.

                         ED
               Remember when you were
               interviewing me?
                    (details to follow)


  143   EXT. PARK - DAY

                         CYNTHIA
               Yeah.

                         ED
               You asked me if I had a dream.
               I said "Sure, I have a dream. I
               just don't know what it is yet."

                         CYNTHIA
               Great line.

                         ED
               What if Shari's the dream?

                         CYNTHIA
               Ed, do you want my advice?

                         ED
               Yeah, that's why I called. I
               mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me
               where she moved --

                         CYNTHIA
               Leave her be.

                         ED
               You said a woman likes to be
               pursued.

                         CYNTHIA
               Pursued, not harassed. Give it
               some space. Can I tell you
               something -- as a friend? My
               sister was going with a guy
               they hit a little rough spot
               they started seeing other people
               they got back together and last
               month they had their third child
               For what it's worth.

     OPEN ON ANDY, Ed's half-Asian nephew. He's eight. He's
     wearing a baseball glove.

                         ANDY
               Throw me a high one, Uncle Eddie.

                         ED (O.C.)
               Okay.

     REVEAL ED, also wearing a baseball glove. He throws a high pop
     up to Andy. Andy staggers around and almost catches it.

                         ED
               Oh!!

                         JILL (0.C.)
               We have to stop meeting like
               this.

                         ED
               Hm?

     REVEAL JILL, walking a DOG. it takes just a second to
     recognize her.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Oh, hi.

     Ed is hit with the ball.

                         ANDY
               Sorry.

     REVEAL the Real TV Staff watching this on television in their
     office. As Ed and Jill chat in the background.

                         ALICE
                    (to Cynthia)
               Did you arrange this?

                         CYNTHIA
                    (points to the TV)
               Whose dog is that?

                         ALICE
                    (surprised)
               That's your dog.

     Cynthia doesn't even smile.

     MONTAGE

     INTERSPERSED IN THE MONTAGE ARE SHOTS OF PEOPLE
     WATCHING THEM ON TV

     1. Ed and Jill going into a chic club -- ushered in
     immediately. Here, as in the other times we see her, Jill is
     comfortable with the situation. She's the opposite of Shari.
     She poses willingly. She chats easily with paparazzi. She
     clings to Ed. There's nothing overt or obnoxious about her.
     She's just comfortable and good at it and always looks great.

     2. INTERVIEW with the guys who didn't like Shari.

                         GUY #1
               Way to go, Ed!

                         GUY # 2
               Now, we're talking!

     3. A N.Y. Post story:

          "Readers Pick Jill over Shari."

     Pictures of both women. Jill looks great. Shari is in her
     uniform and looks like a mouse.

     4. SHARI

     In a new apartment. Watching Ed and Jill on TV. She's very
     unhappy. She turns it off.

     5. Ed and Jill at the nice restaurant he was at with Shari
     earlier. It looks like he's starting to like her.

     6. Ed is refereeing a pro-wrestling match. He counts out the
     villain who, then, jumps up and chases him out of the ring.


  144   INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
     "DAY 47"

     Ed and Jill are in a HEAVY LIPLOCK. Carlos is right there with
     the camera. Unlike Shari, Jill seems unself-conscious. She's
     getting Ed pretty turned-on.

     SHOTS of VIEWERS, also turned on, especially the men.

                         JILL
               You want to?

     It's clear what she means. Ed is conflicted. He's clearly
     aroused.

                         ED
               Um... It's kind of ...

     He looks for his watch on the wrong wrist, then seems to check
     all around his body until he discovers it.

                         JILL
               Are you busy tomorrow night?

                         ED
               No.

                         JILL
               Why don't you come over. And
               I'11 make dinner. And you bring
               a movie. And ... We'11 make a
               night of it ... okay?

                         ED
                    (nervously)
               Sure.


  145   EXT. STREET - DAY
     Written on the screen -- "Day 48"

     Ed is walking, the camera following. He looks tense. People
     SHOUT "Hey, Ed" "Ed-die" etc.

     ANGLE ON A NEWSPAPER VENDING MACHINE

     The New York Post front page -- "Is tonight the Night?" with a
     picture of Ed and Jill kissing.

     ANGLE ON ED

                         ED
               Oh man...

                         CON ED GUY
               Hey, Eddie.

     Ed looks up.

                         CON ED GUY (CONT'D)
                    (giving the "thumbs
                    up")
               Go for it!

     Ed continues down the street. People YELL to him "Good luck
     tonight," "We're rooting for you" etc.

     A STREET CHARACTER walks alongside for a minute.

                         STREET CHARACTER
               Hey, man. This is Haitian Love Juice.
                    (he produces a vial)
               You give her this, she be yours.

     Security grabs him and the vial falls and breaks. The liquid
     hits the pavement and smokes up.

                         ED
                    (looking at the smoke)
               Jesus!

     More shouts "Be gentle", "We'11 be watching", "Use a condom" etc.

     A SCHOOL BUS passes. The KIDS YELL out the window to Ed.

                         KIDS
                    (in unison)
               Good luck!


  146   EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
     There is no line. At TICKET TAKER sits, bored. No one is
     going in or coming out.


  147   EXT. STREET
     It's deserted.


  148   EXT. RESTAURANT
     It's empty. The HEADWAITER stands in the doorway with nothing
     to do.


  149   INT. LIVING ROOM
     A PARTY is in progress. The TV is on. On TV Ed is in a liquor
     store, buying a bottle of wine. Ed is dressed for his date.
     The people at the party are watching TV and commenting. It's
     like a Super bowl party.

                         VOICE (O.C.)
               What's he doing?

                         PARTYGOER
               He's buying wine!


  150   INT. BEDROOM
     Several high-school age BOYS. They have made themselves look
     like Ed. They're very excited.

                         TEEN-AGE BOY #1
               You think he's gonna do it?

                         TEEN-AGE BOY #2
               Hell yeah. The guy hasn't had
               any sex in six weeks.

                         TEEN-AGE BOY #3
               Neither have we.


  151   EXT. STREET
     Ed's car turns the corner and he sees a CROWD gathered around Jill's 
building.


  152   EXT. BUILDING

                         ED
                    (understating)
               I'm starting to feel a little
               pressure.

     Ed carrying his wine enters to APPLAUSE and CHEERS.


  153   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET
     A LONG SHOT encompasses all the houses on the block. Their
     living room TV's are visible. All but one are tuned to Ed.


  154   INT. JILL'S KITCHEN
     Something is cooking. Jill picks up a plate of something -
     dip and cut vegetables for instance. She starts to exit the
     kitchen as Ed and Carlos enter. Ed and Jill have a soft
     collision.

                         JILL
               Oh.

                         ED
               Can I help with anything?

                         JILL
               No. It's going to be about a
               half-hour.

                         ED
               What is? Oh, dinner!

     SELF-CONSCIOUSLY. He takes a vegetable, dips it and eats it.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Mm.

                         JILL
               Good?

                         ED
               Mm.

     They look at each other. Jill leans forward and kisses him.
     She puts the tray of vegetables on the counter. They continue
     to kiss.


  155   INT. BEDROOM
     The high school boys are CHANTING.


  156   INT. DORM ROOM

                         BOYS
               Ed -- Ed -- Ed -- Ed...

     COLLEGE GIRLS (same ones as before).

                         COLLEGE GIRL #1
               Oh, I hope she makes love to him!

                         COLLEGE GIRL #2
               I thought you didn't like her.

                         COLLEGE GIRL #1
               I don't, but I want him to be
               happy-

     RAPID SHOTS of other VIEWERS, watching, transfixed --


  157   INT. JILL'S APARTMENT
     Ed and Jill are making out. They begin taking each other's
     clothes off. They're passing the point of no return. It's
     going to happen right there in the kitchen.

     Ed and Jill, in heavy heat, back up to the kitchen table and
     climb on to it. They continue to pull at their own and each,
     other's clothing. They're making passionate noises.


  158   INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT
     Shari is not watching television. She's eating a little meal
     she's made for herself. She HEARS PEOPLE in her building
     cheering and whooping. She looks miserable.


  159   INT. CONTROL TRUCK

                         DIRECTOR
                    (slightly panicky)
               Someone say the word, how far can
               we go here?


  160   INT. REAL TV OFFICE
     Cynthia and her staff are watching. Cynthia is ON THE PHONE-

                         CYNTHIA (into phone)
               Stay with them ... don't leave
               yet... not yet ...

     Jill is on top of Ed. Carried away with passion, Ed attempts
     to roll her over and get on top. He does, but rolls too far.
     He crashes off the table, to the floor, face up.

                         ED
                    (in pain)
               Ohhh...

                         JILL
               Ed?

                         ED
               Ohh... do you own a cat?

                         JILL
               Yeah. Why?

     He looks at her apologetically.


  161   EXT. JILL'S BUILDING
     Ed is being loaded into an AMBULANCE. He looks humiliated.
     PEOPLE in the street are applauding politely as if Ed were an
     injured ballplayer being carried off the field. Jill is by the
     ambulance. She's PETTING a CAT who looks all right.
     PHOTOGRAPHERS are taking her picture. She's posing willingly.
     The ambulance drives off as Jill continues to pose.


  162   INT. TV STUDIO
     Written on the screen -- "Day 49"

     The taping of "The Tonight Show" or "the Late Show" -- once
     again, whichever we have a prayer of getting. The MONOLOGUE is
     in progress.

                         JAY (OR DAVE)
                    (mock annoyed)
               So I guess you were all watching
               Ed last night.

     The AUDIENCE goes wild.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
               This got the highest rating of
               the year, since the Super Bowl.
               I guess that makes sense. After
               all, Ed is now the Buffalo Bills
               of sex.

     BIG LAUGHS


  163   INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
     Scharlach EATING. He's stunned.

                         SCHARLACH
               What?!

     REVEAL CYNTHIA

                         CYNTHIA
               Take him off the air.

                         SCHARLACH
               What are you talking about? He's
               fine. He's out of the hospital
               already. The ratings are higher
               than ever.

                         CYNTHIA
               I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed
               TV is an over-inflated balloon.
               Get it off before it explodes all
               over us.

     He thinks.

                         SCHARLACH
               With all due respect, Cynthia
               you're nuts. I'm giving him
               another month!

                         CYNTHIA
                    (coldly)
               Good luck.


  164   EXT. STREET - DAY
     "DAY 54"

     Ed is walking. He's wearing a white, Velcro support around his
     waist. He's agitated. He's carrying a copy of the New York
     Post.

                         ED
               Look at this!

     WE SEE a headline -- "Ed: She Broke My heart."

                         ED
               She did not!
                    (venting)
               You know what she did?

                         ED (CONT'D)
               She went out to California and
               got one of those scandal agents.
               One of those agents who handle,
               like... Gennifer Flowers and...
               Kato Kaelin and Joey Buttafuco.
               That's what she --

     A GUY YELLS AT ED

                         GUY
               Hey Ed! ... She was a little too
               much for you, huh? Must run in
               the family.

                         ED
                    (angry)
               Oh -- like this guy's ever been
               with a woman.
                    (yells)
               How about I kick your ass 'til
               the crack goes the other way?
                    (to the camera)
               All of a sudden, I'm like fair
               game for everyone. I'm like --

     He stops and looks like he's in shock. He stares in through
     the display window of a bookstore.

     ANGLE ON,

     a big DISPLAY of cheap, rushed-out, exploitation books. On the
     cover we read "My Brother Pissed On Me By Raymond L. Pekurny.11
     And there's an old photo of two little boys. (Ed and Ray)

                         ED
               Oh my -- He wrote a book?! Ray
               wrote a book?! He never read a
               book!


  165   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
     "DAY 58"

     It's the hallway of a cheap hotel. Ed and the camera come off
     the elevator. Ed looks at room numbers. He can HEAR the noise
     from all the rooms. A radio -- a domestic disturbance -- a
     baby crying -- it's a horror. He KNOCKS ON a door.

                         HANK (O.C.)
               Who is it?

                         ED
               It's Ed.

     The door opens REVEALING Ed's father.

                         HANK
               Ed! Come in -

     They enter.


  166   INT. HOTEL ROOM
     It's depressing. There's a liquor bottle on the dresser. Ed
     sees it.

                         HANK (CONT'D)
               How've you been?

     Ed SHRUGS.

                         HANK (CONT'D)
               They don't get cable here, so 1
               can't watch you.

     Ed just GRUNTS.

     Hank takes LAUNDRY off a chair.

                         HANK (CONT'D)
               Sit down.

     He does. He looks around.

                         HANK (CONT'D)
               Quite a shithole, isn't it?

                         ED
               It could be, if you fixed it up.
               How did you... ? I mean how does
               anyone ... wind up like this?

                         HANK
               I was in jail.

                         ED
               The whole time? Eighteen years?

                         HANK
               No. Two times.

                         ED
               What...

                         HANK
               Check forging.

                         ED
               Oh, man! So...

                         HANK
               The last two years, I've been a
               limousine driver, but I don't see
               well anymore, so...

                         ED
               So you saw me on TV and you said
               "Hey, let me jump on this."

                         HANK
               I need help. How many times if
               just one little thing that I
               needed would've happened, it
               would've changed everything. If
               I had a few dollars when an
               opportunity came along or... the
               tumblers just never clicked for
               me.

     Ed doesn't know what to say. He's bitter towards Hank, but
     there's also some empathy.

                         ED
                    (to the camera)
               All right... This is my father,
               I don't know what the hell he can
               do, but if anyone out there can
               help him -- get him a job -
               I'11 ... help you. I'11 ...
               mention your business or ... I
               don't know, we'11 figure it out.
                    (quickly, to Hank)
               I gotta go.

                         HANK
               Ed... I'm sorry.

                         ED
                    (still bitter)
               Yeah? That's good. Sorry is
               good. You know I finished that
               model.

                         HANK
               What...

                         ED
               The pirate ship.

     Hank looks blankly at him.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               -- That we were doing "together."
               I finished it. It came out great!
               Because no one was standing over
               my shoulder bothering me -
               "That's too much glue. You're
               using too much glue."

                         HANK
               Do you still have it?

                         ED
               No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.

     He exits. Out in the hallway, he leans back against the door,
     drained. The camera is right on him, soaking it up.


  167   INT. TV STUDIO
     The same PBS-type panel of smart-looking people we met earlier.
     WE OPEN ON about half the panel.

                         MODERATOR
               Let's hear from our guest
               panelist. You've expressed some
               interesting thoughts on this,
               subject. What do you see as the
               meaning, if there is any, of Ed
               TV, John.

     REVEAL JOHN, sitting comfortably on the panel, looking very
     wise.

                         JOHN
               I feel that Ed is the apotheosis
               of a prevailing American
               syndrome. It used to be that
               someone became famous because
               they were special. Now people
               are considered special just for
               being famous. Fame, itself, is
               now a moral good in this country.
               It's its own virtue.

     The others NOD appreciatively as John puts a PIPE in his mouth.

     TV INTERVIEWS

                         OLD GUY
               I was Ed's Little League coach.
               He had no coordination. The big
               game, he struck cut with the
               bases loaded. Then he cried like
               a woman. It was sickening.

                                        CUT TO:

                         OLD WOMAN
               I was his third grade teacher.
               I said "Take him for tests.
               There's something wrong with
               him." They didn't listen.

                                        CUT TO:

                         ANOTHER GUY
               He used to steal things from my
               store. At least I think it was
               him. Yeah, it was probably him.


  168   EXT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY
     A MAN, on the sidewalk, has a STUFFED CAT stuck to his back to
     tease Ed.

                         CAT MAN
               Hey, look, I just fell off a
               table!

     Suddenly, a TUBFUL OF WATER crashes down on him.


  169   INT. ED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
     Ed at the window, with a now empty plastic tub.

                         ED
                    (yelling down)
               Okay, is that funny?

     Then he throws the tub out the window.

                         ED (CONT'D)
                    (to the camera)
               How was that? Was that funny?!


  170   INT. NETWORK OFFICE
     "DAY 78"

     Again, everyone there, including Cynthia. A Honcho is reading
     a report.

                         HONCHO #1
               Of more concern than the sag in
               Ed's ratings is what viewers are
               feeling about him now. The
               positives are down and the
               negatives are up.
               There's a feeling that Ed isn't
               cool anymore. We're starting to
               see a big L.F.

                         GREG
               Hm?
 
                         HONCHO #1
               L.F.  Loser Factor.

                         HONCHO #2
               That's deadly.

                         McILVAINE
               Not necessarily. I mean instead
               of running from the L.F., run
               with it. Create more moments
               like the table thing. We can
               package a video "Ed's Goofiest
               Moments." Let him be America's
               Goofball.

                         CYNTHIA
               Isn't this getting kind of
               pathetic. I mean we drank the
               juice, now we're just licking
               peel. Let it go!

                         SCHARLACH
               Cynthia, I think you're laboring
               under a misconception. You seem
               to believe that because you
               happened to predict this, we
               should be impressed. We're not.
               Anybody in any business can
               predict failure. 1 need people
               who prevent failure. I want to
               see this thing turned back in the
               right direction. Remember this

  171   INT. BAR - NIGHT
     "DAY 94"
     Tad and Barry -- as we met them, originally -- are watching TV.
     They're really enjoying it -- laughing, pounding the table.

                         TAD
               I don't know, I still love this guy.

                         BARRY
               Yeah only I wish they had the
               sister on more.

                         TAD
               Ooh, the sister! She is hot.

                         BARRY
               You know it.

     REVEAL that they are watching Joma. On the TV -- Joma is
     eating dinner in his apartment with TWO attractive WOMEN, who,
     apparently, both live there. Joma is upset (but he's funny
     when he's upset). What's upsetting him is that across the
     alley, in a window of another building, he can plainly see an
     OVERWEIGHT MAN, with his shirt off, exercising. The overweight
     man is apparently watching an exercise video and is bouncing up
     and down in place causing everything to jiggle unpleasantly.

                         JOMA'S FRIEND
               Ignore him.

                         JOMA
               I can't! It's like a mudslide.
                    (screams out the
                    window)
               Put on a shirt!

     ANGLE ON TAD AND BARRY, HYSTERICAL

     ANGLE ON TV

                         JOMA (CONT'D)
                    (yelling)
               I support the fact that your
               exercising but, for the love of
               God, put on a shirt.

                         JOMA'S FRIEND
                    (to Joma)
               Shut the curtains.

                         JOMA
               No! Let him shut the curtains.

     TAD AND BARRY

     Laughing and wiping their eyes.


  172   INT. ED'S BEDROOM
     Off the air. Ed ON the PHONE.

     INTERCUT WITH CYNTHIA

                         ED
               This Joma is so phoney! I mean,
               those things aren't really
               happening. I think they have
               writers making that stuff up for
               him. Hey, couldn't we do that?
               Hire some writers and have them
               write up some crazy situations I
               could get into?

     She's listening, amazed.

                         CYNTHIA
               Ed, everything goes off.
               "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --

                         ED
                    (getting angry)
               Yeah, but when they went off
               people weren't making fun of
               them. They weren't bozos! I'm
               Pumpkin Ass again!

                         CYNTHIA
                    (getting annoyed)
               Ed --

                         ED
               You know, everything you asked me
               to do I did. I call you for
               advice about Shari you say -
                    (mocking imitation)
               "Leave her be, see other people
               for a while." You just wanted me
               to get involved with Jill because
               it made for a better show.

                         CYNTHIA
               Ed --

                         ED
               No. You screwed up my life just
               so you could get higher ratings.
               You never gave a shit about me.

                         CYNTHIA
               Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.

     She HANGS UP and has an acid reflux.


  173   INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT
     Ed and John are playing.

                         JOHN
               Look, you put anybody on TV
               sixteen hours a day, at some
               point they're going to wind up
               rolling off a table on to a cat.
               I mean with no privacy, there's
               no... dignity.

     Ed thinks.

     Pause.

                         ED
               You know about that fireman who
               rescued that little girl?

                         JOHN
               When? Today?

                         ED
               No! Like, ten years ago. In
               Texas. Baby...
                    (tries to remember)
               Jessica!

                         JOHN
               Oh right, right! She fell down,
               like a...

                         ED
               Yeah, a thing. He became a big
               hero. He was on TV and there was
               a parade and a movie about him

                         JOHN
               Right, right...

                         ED
               And then, uh... you know it blew
               over and he went back to being a
               fireman again.

                         JOHN
                    (cheerfully)
               Right.

                         ED
               So he killed himself.

                         JOHN
                    (a little shaken)
               Oh.

     SILENCE. The cell phone RINGS.

     Ed PICKS UP the phone.

                         ED
               Hello.

     INTERCUT WITH JEANETTE IN A HOSPITAL

     She's crying.

                         JEANETTE
               Eddie...

                         ED
               Mom?

                         JEANETTE
               I'm at the hospital.

                         ED
               What's the matter?!

                         JEANETTE
               He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It
               was his heart.

                         ED
               Oh God. What hospital?

                         JEANETTE
               St. Joseph's.

                         ED
               I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.

     He hangs up.


  174   INT. TAD'S HOUSE
     Tad is watching TV and talking an the phone.

                         TAD
               I told you! I told you he was
               gonna die!


  175   INT. HOSPITAL - AN HOUR LATER
     Ed rushes in. He goes up to the desk. Carlos is with him.

                         ED
               Hi. I'm looking for my mother.
               Her name is --

     A DOCTOR spots him.

                         DR. GELLER
               Mr. Pekurny.

                         ED
               Yes?

                         DR. GELLER
               I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is
               just lying down for a few
               minutes. we gave her something
               to calm her down.

                         ED
               Thank you. Can I see her?

                         DR. GELLER
               Just wait here. She's coming
               right back out.

                         ED
               Mm...
                    (wearily)
               Oh, man...

                         DR. GELLER
                    (sympathetically)

                         ED
               What about him -- did he suffer
               any or was it quick? I'd hate to
               think he...

                         DR. GELLER
               Very quick. Between you and me,
               it's not a bad way to go. Making
               love to your wife... it's very
               sweet.

                         ED
               Really? They were..

                         DR. GELLER
                    (nods)
               According to your mother. When
               the paramedics got to the hotel,
               she told them that --

                         ED
               Hotel? What were they doing in
               a hotel?

                         DR. GELLER
               I ... don't know. I ...

                         VOICE (O.C.)
               Eddie. Thank God you're here.

     Eddie looks across the room and sees Al in his wheelchair, just
     entering from outside. He wheels towards Ed.

                         AL
               How's your mother?

                         ED
                    (shocked)
               Al!

                         AL
               Our neighbors gave me a ride.

                         ED
               Al!!

                         AL
               Where is she? Is she all right?

     Ed turns to the doctor.

                         ED
               I thought -- I thought he was dead.

                         DR. GELLER
               Who?

                         ED
               Al!

                         DR. GELLER
               No.
                    (reads his chart)
               The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.

               Good twist!


  177   INT. HOSPITAL

                         AL
               You thought it was me?

                         ED
               Yes!

                         AL
               It's your father. Hank. Your
               mother went to see him and he had
               a heart attack.

                         ED
               Went --

     Again, Ed turns to the doctor.

                         NURSE
               Dr. Geller, Dr. Stack wants to see you.

                         DR. GELLER
                    (to Ed)
               Excuse me.

                         NURSE
                    (to Ed)
               Could I get your autograph for my niece?

                         ED
                    (distracted)
               Um... yeah...

     Jeanette enters.

                         JEANETTE
               Al! How did you --

                         AL
               The Burkharts drove me. Are you
               all right?

                         JEANETTE
                    (nervously)
               I'm fine. I ...

                         AL
               Good. I gotta pee.

     He wheels off. Jeanette and Ed are left alone.

                         ED
                    (loud whisper)
               What happened?

                         JEANETTE
               It was horrible. He called me up.

                         ED
               Who?

                         JEANETTE
               Hank! He said he wanted to talk
               to me to apologize for everything
               he begged -- he cried.
               So I went to this horrible hotel
               he was staying in... I felt so
               sorry for him --

                         ED
               So you had sex with him?

     Jeanette GASPS.

                         JEANETTE
               What?

                         ED
               The doctor said you were having sex.

                         JEANETTE
                    (horrified)
               To you? In front of him?
                    (indicates Carlos)
               With the...

                         ED
               Yes. He assumed Hank was your
               husband. He didn't know.

                         JEANETTE
               Oh my god! On TV!

                         ED
               Why? How...

                         JEANETTE
               One thing led to another. He was
               my husband once.

                         ED
               But Al is your husband now!

                         JEANETTE
               Do you think it's been easy for
               me? It's been years. Al can't
               have sex.

                         ED
               Apparently, neither can Hank.
               What the hell did you do to him?

     Al comes rolling back, SINGING.

               Ed's family is the tip of the
               iceberg. You watch the daytime
               tabloid shows it's the same
               thing. I'm telling you, America
               is fast becoming a trailer park.

               Let's not overstate the case.
               There are millions of hard-
               working, sensible, moral,

               The stepfather can't do it at
               all and the father did it but it
               killed him.
                    (there's a drawing
                    of a tombstone)
               How did this family ever reproduce
               in the first place?


  181   EXT. CEMETERY GATES - DAY
     Ed is driving Jeanette and Al to the funeral. A CROWD is held back by
     POLICE. Someone yells "Adulterer". Someone else tries to offer Ed a
     lunchbox. Someone else is carrying a sign "What a Way to Go".


  182   EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
     Hank's COFFIN is being carried to his gravesite. Ed, Ray and Marcia
     are pall bearers. One of the others pall bearers is Ed's BODYGUARD.
     The OTHERS TWO are two guys who work for the mortuary. Carlos is
     shooting.

                         ED
                    (to Ray)
               You're not going to talk to me?
               You're not even gonna say hello?

                         RAY
               I have nothing to say to you.

     Ed gives up. He turns to Marcia.

                         ED
               How are you doing? Is Cliff here?

     She doesn't answer. Ed reacts.

                         RAY
               Cliff left her, thanks to you.

                         ED
               Me?!

                         RAY
               That's right. You put Cliff on
               television. So then he decided he
               was too good for her and he left.

                         ED
               I put his -- who --
                    (to Marcia)
               Look, Marsh, he's not that good
               a singer, he'll be back.

                         MARCIA
                    (too loudly)
               That's not funny!!

     Ed CRINGES.


  183   EXT. GRAVESITE - A LITTLE LATER
     The service ends. The small group begins to walk away. Ray
     and Marcia go off together, ignoring Ed. Jeanette is
     attempting to wheel Al away from the grave, but she's hitting
     ruts. Ed approaches.

                         ED
               I'11 take it.

                         JEANTTE
                    (to Al, uncomfortably)
               Sweetheart, I'm gonna go ahead
               and sign all the papers.

                         AL
               Right.

     She touches him but he pulls away. Ed wheels Al.

                         ED
               Are things gonna be okay with you
               and Mom? Is there anything I can --

                         AL
               I'm moving out.

                         ED
               What?!

                         AL
               I'm going to be living with my
               brother. He's not in such good
               shape as I am, but... I'm looking
               forward to the pillow fights.

                         ED
                    (really upset)
               Oh, Al ... This is just...

                         AL
               Hank was always good with the
               ladies. Always good-looking.
               Hell, he's been dead for two
               days, he still looks better than
               me.

     He stops wheeling and crouches down next to Al.

                         ED
               I want to tell you something...
               I love you. You're my father.

     Pause.

                         AL
               I love you, too.

     Al KISSES him.

                         AL (CONT'D)
               I'11 build a pirate ship with
               you.

     Ed wheels him away.


  184   INT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE
     She's watching. She's genuinely moved. She wipes her eyes.


  185   INT. BAR - NIGHT
     This place is sleazy. Ed enters, worn out. He crosses to the
     bar where we find, Jeanette nursing a drink. She's not drunk,
     but she is wallowing.

                         ED
               Hi, Ma.

                         JEANETTE
                    (startled)
               Ed! How did you know I was here?

                         ED
               You're famous. Somebody called
               me. What are you doing in a
               place like this?

                         JEANETTE
               Why shouldn't I be in a place
               like this? I'm a whore!

                         ED
                    (cringes)
               Ma...

                         JEANETTE
               I'm a tramp
                    (pulls on the sleeve of
                    the man next to her)
               Meet your new father. The whole
               nation is laughing at us!

                         ED
               And how is this helping? come on
               say, good-night to all your new
               friends and let's go home.

                         JEANETTE
                    (exiting)
               I'm a whore!
                    (yells at an employee)
               Your bathrooms are filthy!

     They're out.


  186   EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
     Ed is helping Jeanette. Ray arrives. He's ANGRY.

                         RAY
               I'11 take her. You humiliated
               our mother on national
               television. You've single-
               handedly destroyed this family.

                         ED
               I -- Oh, but that book you wrote
               was a real love-letter. That...
               toilet paper with covers.

                         BYSTANDER #1
               That book sucked. I want my
               money back.

                         ED
               Oh great. Where's Moe?

     He looks around. Moe is gone.

                         RAY
               Come on, Ma.

                         ED
                    (to Ray)
               Let's remember how I got into
               this. "Please, Eddie, do this
               for me. I can't get a break."
                    (pretends to cry)

                         RAY
               You know what your problem is?

                         ED
               Yeah. My problem is I've got a
               brother who writes a sentence
               like "We grew up in a small,
               little bedroom." As opposed to
               a big, little bedroom?

                         RAY
               I got paid by the word! No!
               Your problem is you don't ever
               want anything to be your fault.

                         ED
               Me?! That's you!

                         RAY
               I commit. I take a chance. You
               wanted to be the guy on TV, but
               you didn't want to say you wanted
               to. So you have me talk you into
               it so you get what you want, but
               if it goes bad it's not your
               fault.

                         BYSTANDER #2
               Right. Like you say you love
               Shari, but, you wouldn't mind
               noodling that model.

                         ED
               Moe!

                         BYSTANDER #3
               The truth hurts.

                         ED
               Yeah? So does a kick in the
               nuts.

                         RAY
               For once in your life, be honest
               with yourself. I know you, Ed.
               I know you look at me and Marcia
               and Mom and you think you're
               different.
               You're like "How did I end up in
               this family?" You're not
               different. you're worse.
               Because you have no guts. 
               You drift around, you don't commit,
               you make fun of me -- okay. Just
               don't kid yourself.
                    (to Jeanette)
               Let's go.

                         JEANETTE
               You're both good boys.

     Ray and Jeanette leave.


  187   INT. NETWORK CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
     Ed is there along with Cynthia and the Network Execs. There
     are more execs than before. Cynthia's people are not there.
     This entire meeting is on ED TV. Cynthia is quiet -
     observing. Ed looks whipped.

                         ED
               Three more months?

                         MR. SCHARLACH
               Absolutely! Ed TV is more
               popular than ever.
               Congratulations.

                         McILVAINE
               Only, Ed, we want you, in the
               next few weeks to spend a lot
               more time with your family.

                         ED
               You do?

                         SEAVER
               Definitely. Cynthia, explain it to him.

     Cynthia just stares at her, COLDLY.

                         SEAVER (CONT'D)
               I'11 do it.
                    (to Ed)
               People want to see what happens
               to them now. Do your mother and
               step-father get back together?
               How does your sister handle being
               alone? Your feud with your
               brother.

                         SCHARLACH
               In fact, we have a new concept.
               Since your family signed
               releases, we can follow them on
               camera even when you're not with
               them. We can cut around from
               family member to family member.
               Whoever's the most exciting at
               that moment.

                         McILVAINE
               And, of course, it's another big
               bonus payment for you.

     Pause.

                         ED
               A couple of years ago my Uncle
               Roy got bit on the ass by a dog.

     Silence. What the hell is he talking about?

                         ED (CONT'D)
               So he gave me his tickets to the U.S.
               Open -- the tennis matches.

     They still have no idea what he's talking about.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               So me and Ray, we tell our
               friends "Watch when Andre Agassi
               is gonna serve for the first
               time. When he's bouncing the
               ball and it's real quiet, we'11
               yell "Whoop". And you'11 all
               hear us."

     Pause.

                         SCHARLACH
               I see.
                    (he doesn't)

                         ED
               You know what that is? It's sad.
               I mean it was just so we could be
               heard. So we could stand out
               from the crowd for a second. So
               we did it. But we had nothing to
               say. Just "Whoop". That's it.
               And the stupid part  I mean the
               really stupid part is we
               thought it like... elevated us
               above the crowd. Where the fact
               is it made us stupider than the
               crowd.

                         SCHARLACH
               I see.

                         ED
               Stop saying "I see." You don't
               see. Cynthia, I owe you an
               apology.

                         CYNTHIA
               I don't think so.

                         ED
               Yeah. Because, you didn't talk
               me into anything. Everything you
               wanted me to do, I wanted to do.


  188   INT. SHARI'S PLACE
     Shari watching Ed TV.


  189   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

                         ED
                    (to the camera)
               Ray, you were right. It's like
               in school. I was always saying
               "the room was too hot, the
               teacher didn't like me" -- but it
               was me! Everything that's wrong
               with my life I did. Okay? So
               now this is it. My family has
               problems. Which are our fault.
               And TV is not the place to solve
               them. So I quit. I'm taking
               what very little dignity I've got
               left and I quit. Can someone
               validate my parking?

     Pause. SHOCK.

                         MR. SCHARLACH
               Well, Ed, that's ... not really
               possible.

                         ED
               All right, I'11 pay for the
               parking. Big network!

     Scharlach speaks carefully - gently. He's aware of the camera.
     He doesn't want to come off as a villain.

                         SCHARLACH
               No, I mean you can't quit.

     Ed thinks.

                         ED
               I can't?

                         MR. SCHARLACH
                    (very gently)
               Well, no. You agreed to stay on
               the air as long as we asked you
               to. The station entered into
               this on that understanding. If
               you had refused we'd have begun
               this with somebody else. You
               can't just change the rules in
               the middle of the game, son.
               It's not fair to us. More
               importantly, it's not fair to the
               viewers. They're interested in
               you. They've devoted hours and
               days and weeks of their lives to
               you.

                         ED
               Look, if you don't let me out of
               this... I'11 just... I'11 just
               sit in my apartment all day. I
               won't go anywhere, I won't do
               anything. What kind of show will
               that be?

                         MR. SCHARLACH
               Not too good. That's why it
               states in your contract that if
               you do not continue to live a
               normal life, you're in violation
               and are liable for the station's
               financial losses. Ed, I urge you
               to reconsider. I urge you on
               behalf of all those people out
               there whose lives have become so
               entwined with yours. Play fair
               with them, Ed.

                         ED
               All right. Let them decide.

     He turns right to the camera.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               I'd like you all to do me a
               favor. Turn me off. Just grab
               the remote and change the
               channel. I mean, basically, all
               you're watching now is a guy
               deteriorate.
               The only thing missing is the
               smell. You're better than that 
               Turn me off. Thank you.


  190   INT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE
     Greg bursts in, carrying a sheet of paper.

                         GREG
               Ratings are up across the board.
               Look at this!
                    (drones on)
               Men 18 to 35, women 18 to 35 ...

     Cynthia stares, amazed.


  191   EXT. STREET
     Ed WALKING ZOMBIE-LIKE- CROWDS SWARM.


  192   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY
     Ed is with STEVE, a lawyer. Steve has a huge contract on his
     desk.

                         STEVE
               This contract you signed? ... It's
               a masterpiece. Don't go to war
               with these guys. You fart in the
               wrong direction they can take
               everything you own and leave you
               naked by the side of the road.
               You ever going to get back with
               that Jill? Ooh -- she was nice.
               Shari, I didn't like that much
                    ("imitates" a gabby
                    girl)
               "yet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet."

                         ED
               Shut up.


  193   INT. DINER - NIGHT
     Ed is sitting alone, eating lunch. He's surrounded by cameras
     and shielded by BODYGUARDS.

     OUTSIDE the diner a CROWD of rubberneckers is out on the
     sidewalk, looking in at him, some of them acting up, some just
     staring in. Ed is tired. He glances out the window and makes
     a MONKEY FACE. Suddenly, he FREEZES.

     He sees Shari's face in the crowd. She puts her fist in her mouth.


  194   EXT. STREET - NIGHT
     Ed and Shari are walking -- on camera.

                         SHARI
               1 bailed. I bailed on you.

                         ED
               Kinda'.

                         SHARI
               It's what I do. I yell
               "Geronimo" and jump out of a
               relationship.

     He laughs.

     Pause.

                         SHARI (CONT'D)
               You weren't able to make me feel
               safe or secure -- no easy job for
               any  man, I admit -- and my
               problem is, if I think I'm
               losing, I pull myself out of the
               game. I bail. See? I told you,
               I'm the love coroner.

                         ED
               What did you do to your hair?

                         SHARI
               My truck overheated, so I opened
               the hood and my hair got caught
               in the fan belt. So I had to get
               a haircut.

                         ED
               It's nice.

     He touches her hair. They leap on each other. They're
     KISSING.


  195   INT. NETWORK CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
     Big meeting. Many Honchos, including Scharlach and Cynthia.
     All but Cynthia are focused. Cynthia looks bored.

                         HONCHO #l
               I think this could be great.
               What if Ed and Shari decide to
               get married? A wedding? The
               cute, little half-Asian nephew in
               a tuxedo, carrying the ring on
               one of those big fluffy pillows -
               we'11 kill. A sixty share.

     A secretary (MILDRED) enters. She's a little flustered.

                         MILDRED
               Um... Mr. Scharlach, um -- you're
               not watching TV?

                         SCHARLACH
               No, Mildred, we're working.

                         MILDRED
               Um... Ed -- and Shari are --

                         SEAVER
               Engaged?

                         MILDRED
               No. Here. They're in the
               building. They're on their way
               up.

     Scharlach indicates that he wants someone to turn on the TV.
     Someone does and they see Ed and Shari coming down the hall.
     They enter the conference room. The cameras, of course, are
     with them. Ed is carrying a CARTON.

                         ED
               Hi, kids. Busy?

     MUCH CONFUSION

                         ED (CONT'D)
               I just came up to pass out these
               Ed TV hats.

     He takes a lot of HATS out of the carton and begins placing on
     the heads of the Honchos.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               A guy made these up for me. He
               spelled Ed with two D's. Okay,
               listen. The real reason I came
               up here -- and then I'11 get out
               of your way -- is I've been
               thinking about what you said.
               About let's start having more fun
               with this show, you know? Let's
               give it a big kick in the ass.

                         HONCHO #1
               Well, we were thinking --

                         ED
                    (cheerfully)
               Shut up.

     He takes back that Honcho's hat.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Let's have a contest. Now this
               would mostly be open to
               professional investigators and
               detectives. But anyone can join
               in.

                         SHARI
                    (rehearsed)
               What do we have to do?

                         ED
               My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm
               glad you asked. The contest is
               who can dig up -- legally, of
               course -- I'm not suggesting
               that anyone break any laws --
               the most embarrassing and
               humiliating facts about any of
               the executives here at the North
               American Broadcasting System which
               owns Real TV.

     The Honchos staring blankly.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               But facts! They have to be
               verified. Anything from their
               past, their present, business,
               personal -- arrests, affairs ...
               And whoever comes up with the
               sleaziest, most degrading
               material -- I'11 give you ten
               thousand dollars. And you get to
               be on Ed TV.
                    (to the Honchos,
                    excitedly)
               Hah?

                         SHARI
               So act now. Here's Ed's home
               phone number.

     She holds up a CARD.


  196   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
     It's packed with LAWYERS and EXECS. Everyone is agitated,
     except Cynthia, who seems relaxed-Ed and Shari are gone.

                         SCHARLACH
               Legal?! How can this be legal?
               It's defamation! It's slander!
               It's...

                         LAWYER
               Not, technically. He is not
               showing a reckless disregard for
               the truth.

                         SCHARLACH
               You're fired!

     The meeting continues ANGRILY.


  197   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
     The Honchos are watching Ed TV. They look STRAINED, ANXIOUS.

     In Ed's home a BANK OF PHONES have been set up like for a
     telethon. Manning the phones are Ed, Shari, Ray, Marcia, Al
     and Jeanette. The PHONES KEEP RINGING.

                         RAY
                    (into phone)
               Uh-huh... uh-huh... Really?! She
               was how old?

     In the conference room one of the Execs looks DIZZY.

     The CAMERA PANS to Al on the phone.

                         AL
                    (shocked)
               He pays a prostitute to do what
               to him? I don't even want that
               on my shoes.

     IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM

     FEAR and SHOCK, except for Cynthia, who is LAUGHING and can't
     stop.

                         SCHARLACH
               Stop laughing or you're fired.

     She stops.
     Then she gets up.

                         SCHARLACH (CONT'D)
               Where are you going?

                         CYNTHIA
               I've got this great idea. We put
               together a video. "The Network
               Executives Goofiest Moments." And
               listen, i've really loved working
               here.

     On the word "loved" she shot Scharlach THE FINGER. She exits,
     LAUGHING.


  198   INT. ED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
     Ed is off the phone,

                         ED
               Okay. We have a winner. Now
               please don't feel badly if yours
               wasn't selected. In our eyes,
               you're all winners.

                         RAY
               And each contestant gets one of
               these.
                    (holds up a tee-shirt
                    with writing on it)
               An "I tried to screw a network
               executive" tee-shirt.

                         ED
               A hundred per cent cotton. Okay,
               here we go, Andy.

     Ed grabs a sealed ENVELOPE. Andy plays a DRUM ROLL -- not
     terribly well.

                         ED (CONT'D)
               Andy's available for executions.
               And the winner is ...

     As he opens the envelope.


  199   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
     The Executives staring, HORRIFIED.


  200   INT. ED'S APARTMENT
     He takes out the card and registers mock-surprise.

                         ED
               Hey, the winner is from right
               here in New York city.
               Carl Bowers a former orderly at
               the Martin Center -- a clinic
               that specializes in, what they
               call, male enhancement
               procedures.


  201   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
     Scharlach's EYES WIDEN in HORROR.


  202   INT. ED'S APARTMENT

                         ED
                    (to the camera)
               How many of you know what a
               penile implant is? As it was
               explained to me, what happens is--


  203   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
     As Ed explains, Scharlach reaches for the phone, fumbling it
     for a moment.


  204   INT. ED'S APARTMENT

                         ED
               And the man of the hour -- the
               executive with the winning secret
               the man who, thanks to the
               miracle of space-age science and
               a pump he keeps in his pocket,
               can now --

     A SHOT OF a television set tuned to Ed. Suddenly Ed is
     replaced by a Real TV logo.

                         ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
               And that concludes Real TV's
               coverage of Ed TV. Stay tuned
               for new programming information.

               A spokesperson for Real TV
               announced that Ed received a

               the air, his balloon payment and
               an additional bonus to show the

               his -- quote -- hard work and
               loyalty -- unquote. When asked --

     A NEWS REPORTER is reporting on a wedding.

               Marcia Pekurny, the woman known
               to most Americans as "Ed's
               sister" was married here today to
               Carlos Coto, who some of you may
               remember as the primary camera
               operator on "Ed TV" --

  209   INT. TV STUDIO
     A news show.

                         NEWS ANCHOR
               The current rage of "Reality
               Television" got a real dose of
               reality today. Lifestyle
               Televisions Joma was shot this
               evening, outside his apartment.
               Because Joma was on television
               twenty-four hours a day,
               Lifestyle's cameras were there to
               record the shooting.

     WE SEE Joma walking into his building. Somebody steps forward
     with a GUN. The ASSAILANT is jostled as he shoots and the
     bullet hits Joma in the ass. He falls to the sidewalk.

                         JOKA
               Ohhhh!!! ... my ass! He shot me
               in the ass!

     The CAMERA PANS to the Assailant, who we might recognize as
     someone who we've seen following Ed from time to time.

                         ASSAILANT
               Now I'm famous.

     REVEAL Ed and Shari watching this on television.

                         ED
               I know him. I gave him an autograph.

     Shari turns it off.
