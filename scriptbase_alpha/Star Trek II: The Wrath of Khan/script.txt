        Absolute quiet.  SOUND bleeds in.  Low Level b.g. NOISES
        of Enterprise bridge, clicking of relays, minor
        electronic effects.  We HEAR as FEMALE VOICE.


                                SAAVIK'S VOICE
                Captain's log.  Stardate eighty-
                one-thirty point three.  Starship
                Enterprise on training mission to
                Gamma Hydra.  Section Fourteen,
                coordinates twenty-two/eighty-seven/
                four.  Approaching Neutral Zone, all
                systems normal and functioning.
        INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE
        As the ANGLE WIDENS, we see the crew at stations; (screens
        and visual displays are in use); COMMANDER SULU at the
        helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Console, DR. BONES McCOY
        and SPOCK at his post.  The Captain is new - and
        unexpected.  LT. SAAVIK is young and beautiful.  She is
        half Vulcan and half Romulan.  In appearance she is Vulcan
        with pointed ears, but her sin is fair and she has none
        of the expressionless facial immobility of a Vulcan.
                                SULU
                Leaving Section Fourteen for

        The bridge takes another hit - a big one.  In its wake
        there is a second electrical EXPLOSION along the
        communications panel.  Uhura falls from her station.
        Bones rushes to her side amid the smoke and alarms.

                No power to the weapons, Captain.
        Another hit:   reverberating flashes of spark and flame
        on the bridge.  Spock dies.  Bones comes to him, but
        even as he coughs his way through the smoke, a final hit
        and Bones falls.  The room is smoke filled and a shambles.

        Saavik digests this for a painful moment.  Then, touching

        Spock rises and leaves.  Bones remains on the floor,

        Kirk rounds the corner and sees Spock, leaning against
        the wall.

                I assume you're loitering around
                here to learn what efficiency rating
                I plan to give to your cadets.
                                SPOCK
                I am considerably curious.

                As I recall you took the test
                three times yourself.  Your

                We are dealing with something
                that COULD be perverted into
                a dreadful weapon.  Remember that

        up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and look
        down.

        A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES, half-buried in
        sand.  They look at each other in consternation.  Chekov
        is worried; something about all this is familiar.
        They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the
        wreckage of some sort of space craft.
        They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half
        buried next to their feet.

                What the hell happened?  If they

        They wander as they talk, picking up objects that bespeak
        a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a laboratory
        in one hold, a kitchen; a LARGE SAND TANK filled with
        disgusting CETI EELS.

19      KHAN'S QUARTERS                         19
        on its side in the sand: the walls are not the floor,
        etc.  All in crookedness - like its owner.  On the
        floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall) is a BABY.
        Tentatively they come over to it, looking around -
20      ANGLE - CHEKOV'S POV                    20
        Lethal-looking odd swords on one wall, a bookshelf;
        CAMERA PANS by 20th Century volumes; MOBY DICK,
        KING LEAR, THE HOLY BIBLE - and a seat belt dangling
        with the name on it - BOTANY BAY.
        Chekov mouths the words, softly at first, then aloud -
                                CHEKOV
                Botany Bay... Botany Bay!! -
                Oh, no!  We've got to get out of
                here -- now!  Damn!  Hurry!

        Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN.  They
        seem to be waiting.  One of the men is JOACHIM.
        Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure.  A
        moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terrified.
        The mask is peeled back.

        KHAN is startled by the recognition; comes over and

                It was only the fact of my
                genetically engineered intellect

        The doors open..  Kirk and his staff are piped aboard by
        an electronic version of the boatswain's traditional
        whistle.  Kirk salutes the Federation symbol and steps
        forward to exchange salutes with Spock.

                Permission to come aboard,

                                SPOCK
                Welcome aboard, Admiral.  I think
                you know my training crew.  Certainly
                they have come to know you.
                                KIRK
                        (dryly to Saavik)
                Yes, we've been through death and
                life together.
        Saavik stiffens slightly - humor is not her forte.

                lifelessness.  It is a process
                whereby the molecular structure is
                reorganized at the sub-atomic level
                into life generating matter of equal
                mass.  Stage One of our experiments
                was conducted in the laboratory.
                Stage Two of the series will be
                attempted in a lifeless underground;
                Stage Three will involve the process
                on a planetary scale.  It is our

                device into a preselected space body,

        and tricorders.
        For a moment they look around, seeing emptiness.

        He shows signs of fear as he walks though the
        deserted place, like a scuba diver exploring a cave.
        We want him to go back.  A NOISE.  Bones reacts with
        brave apprehension.
        Rounding a corner, he starts:  A RAT scuttles right
        in front of him.
        Bones sighs with relief and moves forward.  We think
        he's safe.
        SUDDENLY SOMETHING FALLS RIGHT ON HIS FACE:  an upside-

        David makes a reckless bread for Terrell, Saavik
        instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as
        Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David -
        a killing ray.  Jedda dematerializes.  Carol SCREAMS
        and David reacts with horror and guilt.
        Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble.  Terrell
        himself is shaken by his reflexive action.  He's in
        semi-panic.

        Reactions by all - only Kirk and Bones are unsurprised.
        David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something.
        Chekov is close to a seizure.  Terrell fights
        conflicting mental signals.

        As though tearing off a leach,, Terrell grabs at the
        wrist recorder and flings it tot he ground.  A shockwave
        of pain hits Terrell.  He recovers, trembling and tries
        to obey.  Chekov is shaking badly.  Terrell aims his
        phaser at Kirk.  Chekov slowly raises his phaser and
        aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead.  We
        THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing.  Then,
        shockingly:  Terrell turns the phaser on himself.
                                KHAN'S VOICE
                        (still emanates from

        Terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion.

        He SCREAMS, horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his
        head.  Bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection
        device from his belt pack, jabs it into Chekov's arm.
        Chekov, almost with a sigh of relief, drops.

        Horror from all.  Kirk picks up a phaser.  As the eel
        clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it.  He shudders,
        then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.

        In the rocky cavern the transporter beam locks on to the

        As Kirk and the other watch, horrified, Khan beam sup
        the materials.  David tries to reach the torpedo, but

        Spock is oblivious.  Amid the fire-blue arcs, he moves
        to the control panel.  Between his hands and the controls,
        power arcs insanely.  Spock is an inferno, a radiation
        hell, fighting now with all his strength to control it.

                Come.
        The door whooshes open and closes to admit David.  The
        last person Kirk expected to see.
                                DAVID
                I don't mean to intrude.
                                KIRK
                No, not at all.  I should be on
                the bridge.
                                DAVID
                Look, can I talk to you for a
                minute?
                                KIRK
                I poured myself a drink.  Would you
                like it?
                                DAVID
                Lieutenant Saavik was right:  you
                never have faced a death.
                                KIRK
                        (hoarse)
                No.  Not like this.  I haven't faced
                death, I've cheated death.  I've
                tricked my way out of death and patted
                myself on the back for my ingenuity.
                I know nothing.
                                DAVID
                You knew enough to tell Saavik that
                how we face death is at least as
                important as how we face life -
                                KIRK
                Just words -

                                DAVID
                But good words.  That's where ideas
                begin.  Maybe you should listen to
                them.  I was wrong about you.
                        (pause)
                And I'm sorry.
                                KIRK
                Is that what you came here to say?
                                DAVID
                Mainly.
                        (he starts out,
                        then turns - )
                And also that I'm proud - very
                proud - to be your son.
        A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out:  for
        David, for Carol and for Spock.  He hugs his son,
        holding onto him as to life itself.

        The door whooshes.  Kirk strides on the bridge, David
        with him.  Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at
        what they see.

        PULLS BACK with him to railing to include McCoy and
        Carol looking at large screen with a full view of the
        new Genesis planet with the sun coming around its side.

                Starship Enterprise departed for
                Ceti Alpha Five to pick up the
                crew of the USS Reliant.  All is
                well.  And yet, I can't help
                wondering about the friend I
                leave behind.  there are always
                possibilities, Spock said.  And
                if Genesis is indeed "life from
                death," I must return to this place
                again.

                He's really not dead.  As long as
                we remember him.

                No.  Something Spock was trying to
                tell me.  On my birthday.
        Kirk shakes his head, remembering -
                                BONES
                You okay, Jim?  How do you feel?
