Vada Sultenfuss is obsessed with death.
Her mother is dead, and her father runs a funeral parlor.
She is also in love with her English teacher, and joins a poetry class over the summer just to impress him.
Thomas J., her best friend, is "allergic to everything", and sticks with Vada despite her hangups.
When Vada's father hires Shelly, a makeup expert, in his funeral parlor, and begins to fall in love with her, Vada is outraged and does everything in her power to split them up.
