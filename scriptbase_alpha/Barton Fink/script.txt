                                        Screenplay

                                            By

                                  Ethan Coen & Joel Coen


                                        FADE IN:

     ON BARTON FINK

     He is a bespectacled man in his thirties, hale but somewhat 
     bookish. He stands, tuxedoed, in the wings of a theater, 
     looking out at the stage, listening intently to end of a 
     performance.

     In the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a 
     flat, expressionlessly smoking a cigarette, one hand on a 
     thick rope that hangs from the ceiling.

     The voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen 
     stage:

                    ACTOR
          I'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for 
          good.  I'm kissin' it all goodbye, 
          these four stinkin' walls, the six 
          flights up, the el that roars by at 
          three A.M. like a castiron wind. 
          Kiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury!  
          I'll miss 'em – like hell I will!

                    ACTRESS
          Dreaming again!

                    ACTOR
          Not this time, Lil! I'm awake now, 
          awake for the first time in years. 
          Uncle Dave said it: Daylight is a 
          dream if you've lived with your eyes 
          closed. Well my eyes are open now! I 
          see that choir, and I know they're 
          dressed in rags! But we're part of 
          that choir, both of us – yeah, and 
          you, Maury, and Uncle Dave too!

                    MAURY
          The sun's coming up, kid. They'll be 
          hawking the fish down on Fulton 
          Street.

                    ACTOR
          Let 'em hawk. Let 'em sing their 
          hearts out.

                    MAURY
          That's it, kid. Take that ruined 
          choir.  Make it sing!

                    ACTOR
          So long, Maury.

                    MAURY
          So long.

     We hear a door open and close, then approaching footsteps. A 
     tall, dark actor in a used tweed suit and carrying a beat-up 
     valise passes in front of Barton: From offscreen stage:

                    MAURY
          We'll hear from that kid. And I don't 
          mean a postcard.

     The actor sets the valise down and then stands waiting int 
     he shadows behind Barton.

     An older man in work clothes – not wardrobe – passes in front 
     of Barton from the other direction, pauses at the edge of 
     the stage and cups his hands to his mouth.

                    OLDER MAN
          FISH! FRESH FISH!

     As the man walks back off the screen:

                    LILY
          Let's spit on our hands and get to 
          work.  It's late, Maury.

                    MAURY
          Not any more Lil...

     Barton mouths the last line in sync with the offscreen actor:

                    MAURY
          ...It's early.

     With this the stagehand behind Barton furiously pulls the 
     rope hand-over-hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts 
     of "Bravo!"  

     As the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down, somewhat 
     muting the applause, the backstage actor trots out of frame 
     toward the stage.

     The stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope, bringing the curtain 
     back up and unmuting the applause.

     Barton Fink seems dazed. He has been joined by two other 
     men, both dressed in tuxedos, both beaming toward the stage.

     BARTON'S POV

     Looking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as 
     the curtain rises on the enthusiastic house. The actors take 
     their bows and the cry of "Author, Author" goes up from the 
     crowd.

     The actors turn to smile at Barton in the wings.

     BARTON

     He hesitates, unable to take it all in.

     He is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed 
     gentlemen.

     As he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening.

     TRACKING SHOT

     Pushing a maitre 'd who looks back over his shoulder as he 
     leads the way through the restaurant.

                    MAITRE 'D
          Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink...  
          several members of your party have 
          already arrived...

     REVERSE

     Pulling Barton

                    FINK
          Is Garland Stanford here?

                    MAITRE 'D
          He called to say he'd be a few minutes 
          late... Ah, here we are...

     TRACKING IN

     Toward a large semi-circular booth. Three guests, two me and 
     a woman in evening wear, are rising and beaming at Barton. A 
     fat middle-aged man, one of the tuxedoed gentlemen we saw 
     backstage, is moving out to let Barton slide in.

                    MAN
          Barton, Barton, so glad you could 
          make it.  You know Richard St. 
          Claire...

     Barton nods and looks at the woman.

                    MAN
          ...and Poppy Carnahan. We're drinking 
          champagne, dear boy, in honor of the 
          occasion. Have you seen the Herald?

     Barton looks sullenly at his champagne glass as the fat man 
     fills it.

                    BARTON
          Not yet.

                    MAN
          Well, I don't want to embarrass you 
          but Caven could hardly contain 
          himself. But more important, Richard 
          and Poppy here loved the play.

                    POPPY
          Loved it! What power!

                    RICHARD
          Yeah, it was a corker.

                    BARTON
          Thanks, Richard, but I know for a 
          fact the only fish you've ever seen 
          were tacked to a the wall of the 
          yacht club.

                    RICHARD
          Ouch!

                    MAN
          Bravo! Nevertheless, we were all 
          devastated.

                    POPPY
          Weeping! Copius tears! What did the 
          Herald say?

                    MAN
          I happen to have it with me.

                    BARTON
          Please Derek –

                    POPPY
          Do read it, do!

                    DEREK
          "Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the 
          Common Man. The star of the Bare 
          Ruined Choirs was not seen on the 
          stage of the Belasco last night – 
          though the thespians involved all 
          acquitted themselves admirably. The 
          find of the evening was the author 
          of this drama about simple folk – 
          fish mongers, in fact – whose brute 
          struggle for existence cannot quite 
          quell their longing for something 
          higher. The playwright finds nobility 
          in the most squalid corners and poetry 
          in the most callused speech. A tough 
          new voice in the American theater 
          has arrived, and the owner of that 
          voice is named... Barton Fink."

                    BARTON
          They'll be wrapping fish in it in 
          the morning so I guess it's not a 
          total waste.

                    POPPY
          Cynic!

                    DEREK
          Well we can enjoy your success, 
          Barton, even if you can't.

                    BARTON
          Don't get me wrong – I'm glad it'll 
          do well for you, Derek.

                    DEREK
          Don't worry about me, dear boy – I 
          want you to celebrate.

                    BARTON
          All right, but I can't start listening 
          to the critics, and I can't kid myself 
          about my own work. A writer writes 
          from his gut, and his gut tells him 
          what's good and what's... merely 
          adequate.

                    POPPY
          Well I don't pretend to be a critic, 
          but Lord, I have a gut, and it tells 
          me it was simply marvelous.

                    RICHARD
          And a charming gut it is.

                    POPPY
          You dog!

                    RICHARD
               (baying)
          Aaa-woooooooo!

     Barton turns to look for the source of an insistent jingling. 
     We swish pan off him to find a busboy marching through the 
     restaurant displaying a page sign, bell attached, with 
     Barton's name on it.

     TRACKING IN TOWARD A BAR

     A distinguished fifty-year-old gentleman in evening clothes 
     is nursing a martini, watching Barton approach.

     PULLING BARTON

     As he draws near.

                    BARTON
          I thought you were going to join us.  
          Jesus, Garland, you left me alone 
          with those people.

                    GARLAND
          Don't panic, I'll join you in a 
          minute.  What's you think of Richard 
          and Poppy?

     Barton scowls

                    BARTON
          The play was marvelous. She wept, 
          copiously. Millions of dollars and 
          no sense.

     Garland smiles, then draws Barton close.

                    GARLAND
          We have to talk a little business. 
          I've just been on the phone to Los 
          Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures 
          wants to put you under contract. 
          They've offered you a thousand dollars 
          a week. I think I can get them to go 
          as high as two.

                    BARTON
          To do what?

                    GARLAND
          What do you do far a living?

                    BARTON
          I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try 
          to make a difference.

                    GARLAND
          Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, 
          because I respect you, but let me 
          point out a couple of things. One, 
          here you make a difference to five 
          hundred fifty people a night – if 
          the show sells out.  Eighty five 
          million people go to the pictures 
          every week.

                    BARTON
          To see pap.

                    GARLAND
          Yes, generally, to see pap. However, 
          point number two: A brief tenure in 
          Hollywood could support you through 
          the writing of any number of plays.

                    BARTON
          I don't know, Garland; my place is 
          here right now. I feel I'm on the 
          brink of success-

                    GARLAND
          I'd say you're already enjoying some.

     Barton leans earnestly forward.

                    BARTON
          No, Garland, don't you see? Not the 
          kind of success where the critics 
          fawn over you or the producers like 
          Derek make a lot of money. No, a 
          real success – the success we've 
          been dreaming about – the creation 
          of a new, living theater of, about, 
          and for the common man! If I ran off 
          to Hollywood now I'd be making money, 
          going to parties, meeting the big 
          shots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself 
          off from the wellspring of that 
          success, from the common man.

     He leans back and chuckles ruefully.

                    BARTON
          ...I guess I'm sprouting off again. 
          But I am certain of this, Garland: 
          I'm capable of more good work. Maybe 
          better work than I did in Choirs. It 
          just doesn't seem to me that Los 
          Angeles is the place to lead the 
          life of mind.

                    GARLAND
          Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm 
          just the ten percenter. You decide 
          what you want and I'll make it happen. 
          I'm only asking that your decision 
          be informed by a little realism – if 
          I can use that word and Hollywood in 
          the same breath.

     Barton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the 
     floor.

     Garland studies him.

                    GARLAND
          ...Look, they love you, kid – 
          everybody does. You see Caven's review 
          in the Herald?

                    BARTON
          No, what did it say?

                    GARLAND
          Take my copy. You're the toast of 
          Broadway and you have the opportunity 
          to redeem that for a little cash – 
          strike that, a lot of cash.

     Garland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none.

                    GARLAND
          ...The common man'll still be here 
          when you get back. What the hell, 
          they might even have one or two of 
          'em out in Hollywood.

     Absently:

                    BARTON
          ...That's a rationalization, Garland.

     Garland smiles gently.

                    GARLAND
          Barton, it was a joke.

     We hear a distant rumble. It builds slowly and we cut to:

     A GREAT WAVE

     Crushing against the Pacific shore.

     The roar of the surf slips away as we dissolve to:

     HOTEL LOBBY

     A high wide shot from the front door, looking down across 
     wilting potted palms, brass cuspidors turning green, ratty 
     wing chairs; the fading decor is deco-gone-to-seed.

     Amber light, afternoon turning to evening, slopes in from 
     behind us, washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights.  

     Barton Fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops 
     in the middle foreground to look across the lobby.

     We are framed on his back, his coat and hat. The lobby is 
     empty.  There is a suspended beat as Barton takes it in.  

     Barton moves toward the front desk.

     THE REVERSE

     As Barton stops at the empty desk. He hits a small silver 
     bell next to the register. Its ring-out goes on and on without 
     losing volume.

     After a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs.  
     Barton, puzzled, looks around the empty lobby, then down at 
     the floor behind the front desk.

     A TRAP DOOR

     It swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform, 
     holding a shoebrush and a shoe – not one of his own – climbs 
     up from the basement.

     He closes the trap door, steps up to the desk and sticks his 
     finger out to touch the small silver bell, finally muting 
     it.

     The lobby is now silent again.

                    CLERK
          Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I 
          help you, sir?

                    BARTON
          I'm checking in. Barton Fink.

     The clerk flips through cards on the desk.

                    CLERK
          F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be 
          you, huh?

                    BARTON
          Must be.

                    CLERK
          Okay then, everything seems to be in 
          order. Everything seems to be in 
          order.

     He is turning to a register around for Barton to sign.

                    CLERK
          ...Are you a tranz or a rez?

                    BARTON
          Excuse me?

                    CLERK
          Transient or resident?

                    BARTON
          I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, 
          uh, indefinitely.

                    CLERK
          Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a 
          week payable in advance. Checkout 
          time is twelve sharp, only you can 
          forget that on account you're a rez.  
          If you need anything, anything at 
          all, you dial zero on your personal 
          in-room telephone and talk to me. My 
          name is Chet.

                    BARTON
          Well, I'm going to be working here, 
          mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do 
          you have room service?

                    CLERK
          Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the 
          night clerk. I can always ring out 
          for sandwiches.

     The clerk is scribbling something on the back of an index 
     card.

                    CLERK
          ...Though we provide privacy for the 
          residential guest, we are also a 
          full service hotel including 
          complimentary shoe shine. My name is 
          Chet.

     He pushes a room key across the counter on top of the index 
     card.

     Barton looks at the card.

     On it: "CHET!" Barton looks back up at the clerk. They regard 
     each other for a beat.

                    CLERK
          ...Okay

                    BARTON
          Huh?

     The clerk.

                    CLERK
          Okey-dokey, go ahead.

                    BARTON
          What –

                    CLERK
          Don't you wanna go to your room?!

     Barton stares at him.

                    BARTON
          ...What number is it?

     The clerk stares back.

                    CLERK
          ...Six-oh-five. I forgot to tell 
          you.

     As Barton stoops to pick up his two small bags:

                    CLERK
          ...Those your only bags?

                    BARTON
          The others are being sent.

     The clerk leans over the desk to call after him:

                    CLERK
          I'll keep an eye out for them. I'll 
          keep my eyes peeled, Mr. Fink.

     Barton is walking to the elevator.

     ELEVATOR

     Barton enters and sets down his bags.

     An aged man with white stubble, wearing a greasy maroon 
     uniform, sits on a stool facing the call panel. He does not 
     acknowledge Barton's presence.

     After a beat:

                    BARTON
          ...Six, please.

     The elevator man gets slowly to his feet. As he pushes the 
     door closed:

                    ELEVATOR MAN
          Next stop: Six.

     SIXTH-FLOOR HALLWAY

     Barton walks slowly toward us, examining the numbers on the 
     doors.

     The long, straight hallway is carpeted with an old stained 
     forest green carpet. The wallpaper shows faded yellowing 
     palm trees.  Barton sticks his key in the lock of a door 
     midway down the hall.

     HIS ROOM

     As Barton enters.

     The room is small and cheaply furnished. There is a lumpy 
     bed with a worn yellow coverlet, an old secretary table, and 
     a wooden luggage stand.

     As Barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and 
     wash basin, a house telephone on a rickety night stand, and 
     a window with yellowing sheers looking on an air shaft.  

     Barton throws his valise onto the bed where it sinks, 
     jittering.  He shrugs off his jacket.

     Pips of sweat stand out on Barton's brow. The room is hot.  

     He walks across the room, switches on an oscillating fan and 
     struggles to throw open the window. After he strains at it 
     for a moment, it slides open with a great wrenching sound.  

     Barton picks up his Underwood and places it on the secretary 
     table. He gives the machine a casually affectionate pat.  

     Next to the typewriter are a few sheets of house stationary: 
     "THE HOTEL EARLE: A DAY OR A LIFETIME."

     We pan up to a picture in a cheap wooden frame on the wall 
     above the desk. A bathing beauty sits on the beach under a 
     cobalt blue sky. One hand shields her eyes from the sun as 
     she looks out at a crashing surf.

     The sound of the surf mixes up.

     BARTON

     Looking at the picture

     TRACKING IN ON THE PICTURE

     The surf mixes up louder. We hear a gull cry.

     The sound snaps off with the ring of a telephone.

     THE HOUSE PHONE

     On the nightstand next to the bed. With a groan of bedsprings 
     Barton sits into frame and picks up the telephone.

                    VOICE
          How d'ya like your room!

                    BARTON
          ...Who is this?

                    VOICE
          Chet!

                    BARTON
          ...Who?

                    VOICE
          Chet! From downstairs!

     Barton wearily rubs the bridge of his nose.

                    VOICE
          ...How d'ya like your room!

     A PILLOW

     As Barton's head drops down into frame against it.

     He reaches over and turns off the bedside light.

     He lies back and closes his eyes.

     A long beat.

     We hear a faint hum, growing louder.

     Barton opens his eyes.

     HIS POV

     A naked, peeling ceiling.  The hum – a mosquito, perhaps – 
     stops.

     BARTON

     His eyes move this way and that. After a silent beat, he 
     shuts them again.

     After another silent beat, we hear – muffled, probably from 
     am adjacent room – a brief, dying laugh. It is sighing and 
     weary, like the end of a laughing fit, almost a sob.

     Silence again.

     We hear the rising mosquito hum.

                                        FADE OUT

     EXECUTIVE OFFICE

     Barton Fink is ushered into a large, light office by an 
     obsequious middle- aged man in a sagging suit.

     There are mosquito bites on Barton's face.

     REVERSE

     From behind a huge white desk, a burly man in an expensive 
     suit gets to his feet and strides across the room.

                    MAN
          Is that him?! Barton Fink?!  Lemme 
          put my arms around this guy!

     He bear-hugs Barton.

                    MAN
          ...How the hell are ya? Good trip?

     He separates without waiting for an answer.

                    MAN
          My name is Jack Lipnik. I run this 
          dump. You know that – you read the 
          papers.

     Lipnik is lumbering back to his desk.

                    MAN
          Lou treating you all right? Got 
          everything you need?  What the hell's 
          the matter with your face? What the 
          hell's the matter with his face, 
          Lou?

                    BARTON
          It's not as bad as it looks; just a 
          mosquito in my room –

                    LIPNIK
          Place okay?

     To Lou:

                    LIPNIK
          ...Where did we put him?

                    BARTON
          I'm at the Earle.

                    LIPNIK
          Never heard of it. Let's move him to 
          the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, 
          he can stay at my place.

                    BARTON
          Thanks, but I wanted a place that 
          was less...

                    LIPNIK
          Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's 
          not a dirty word. Sat whatever the 
          hell you want. The writer is king 
          here at Capitol Pictures. You don't 
          believe me, take a look at your 
          paycheck at the end of every week – 
          that's what we think of the writer.
               (to Lou)
          ...so what kind of pictures does he 
          like?

                    LOU
          Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, 
          Mr.  Lipnik.

                    LIPNIK
          How's about it, Bart?

                    BARTON
          To be honest, I don't go to the 
          pictures much, Mr. Lipnik –

                    LIPNIK
          That's okay, that's okay, that's 
          okay – that's just fine. You probably 
          just walked in here thinking that 
          was going to be a handicap, thinking 
          we wanted people who knew something 
          about the medium, maybe even thinking 
          there was all kind of technical mumbo-
          jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. 
          We're only interested in one thing: 
          Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you 
          make us laugh, can you make us cry, 
          can you make us wanna break out in 
          joyous song? Is that more than one 
          thing? Okay.  The point is, I run 
          this dump and I don't know the 
          technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run 
          it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit.  
          Showmanship. And also, and I hope 
          Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner 
          than any other kike in this town. 
          Did you tell him that, Lou? And I 
          don't mean my dick's bigger than 
          yours, it's not a sexual thing – 
          although, you're the writer, you 
          would know more about that. Coffee?

                    BARTON
          ...Yes, thank you.

                    LIPNIK
          Lou.

     Lou immediately rises and leaves. Lipnik's tone becomes 
     confidential:

                    LIPNIK
          ...He used to have shares in the 
          company.  An ownership interest. Got 
          bought out in the twenties – muscled 
          out according to some. Hell, according 
          to me. So we keep him around, he's 
          got a family. Poor schmuck. He's 
          sensitive, don't mention the old 
          days. Oh hell, say whatever you want.  
          Look, barring a preference, Bart, 
          we're gonna put you to work on a 
          wrestling picture. Wallace Beery. I 
          say this because they tell me you 
          know the poetry of the street. That 
          would rule out westerns, pirate 
          pictures, screwball, Bible, Roman...

     He rises and starts pacing.

                    LIPNIK
          But look, I'm not one of these guys 
          thinks poetic has gotta be fruity.  
          We're together on that, aren't we? I 
          mean I'm from New York myself – well, 
          Minsk if you wanna go way back, which 
          we won't if you don't mind and I 
          ain't askin'. Now people're gonna 
          tell you, wrestling. Wallace Beery, 
          it's a B picture. You tell them, 
          bullshit. We don't make B pictures 
          here at Capitol.  Let's put a stop 
          to that rumor right now.

     Lou enters with coffee.

                    LIPNIK
          ...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. 
          Talking about the Wallace Beery 
          picture.

                    LOU
          Excellent picture.

                    LIPNIK
          We got a treatment on it yet?

                    LOU
          No, not yet Jack. We just bought the 
          story. Saturday Evening Post.

                    LIPNIK
          Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace 
          Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know 
          his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, 
          he'll have to get mixed up with a 
          bad element. And a romantic interest. 
          You know the drill.  Romantic 
          interest, or else a young kid. An 
          orphan. What do you think, Lou?  
          Wally a little too old for a romantic 
          interest?  Look at me, a writer in 
          the room and I'm askin' Lou what the 
          goddamn story should be!

     After a robust laugh, he beams at Barton.

                    LIPNIK
          ...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? 
          Dame?

                    BARTON
          ...Both maybe?

     There is a disappointed silence. Lipnik looks at Lou.  Lou 
     clears his throat.

                    LOU
          ...Maybe we should do a treatment.

                    LIPNIK
          Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at 
          it.  He'll get into the swing of 
          things or I don't know writers. Let's 
          make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. 
          We don't gotta tackle the world our 
          first time out. The important thing 
          is we all have that Barton Fink 
          feeling, but since you're Barton 
          Fink I'm assuming you have it in 
          spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. 
          We're off to a good start. Dammit, 
          if all our writers were like you I 
          wouldn't have to get so goddamn 
          involved. I'd like to see something 
          by the end of the week.

     Lou is getting to his feet and signaling for Barton to do 
     likewise.

                    LIPNIK
          ...Heard about your show, by the 
          way. My man in New York saw it. Tells 
          me it was pretty damn powerful. Pretty 
          damn moving.  A little fruity, he 
          said, but I guess you know what you're 
          doing. Thank you for your heart. We 
          need more heart in pictures.  We're 
          all expecting great things.

     TRACKING SHOT

     We are in the sixth-floor hallway of the Earle, late at night. 
     A pair of shoes sits before each door. Faintly, from one of 
     the rooms, we can hear the clack. clack. clack. of a 
     typewriter.

     It grows louder as we track forward.

     EXTREME CLOSE SHOT – TYPEWRITER

     Close on the typing so that we see only each letter as it is 
     typed, without context.

     One by one the letters clack on: a-u-d-i-b-l-e. After a short 
     beat, a period strikes.

     BARTON

     Elbows on his desk, he looks down at what he has just written. 
     He rolls the paper up a few lines, looks some more.

     THE PAGE

     It says:

                                        FADE IN:

     A TENEMENT BUILDING

     On Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is 
     audible.

     BARTON

     After a beat he rolls the sheet back into place.

     EXTREME CLOSE SHOT

     The letter-strike area. It is lined up to the last period, 
     which is struck over by a comma. The words "as is" are typed 
     in and we cut back to –

     BARTON

     – as he continues typing. He stops after several more 
     characters and looks.

     Silence.

     Breaking the silence, muffled laughter from an adjacent room. 
     A man's laughter. It is weary, solitary, mirthless.

     Barton looks up at the wall directly in front of him.

     HIS POV

     The picture of the girl on the beach.

     BARTON

     Staring, as the end-of-the-tether laughing continues. Barton 
     looks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work, but 
     the sound is too insistent to ignore.

     WIDE SHOT

     The room, Barton sitting at his desk, staring at the wall.  

     The laughter.

     Barton pushes his chair back, goes to the door, opens it and 
     looks out.

     HIS POV

     The empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. At the 
     end of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the 
     staircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of 
     wall sconces.

     The laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the 
     empty hall.

     Perhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because 
     it is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for 
     weeping.

     Barton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. He slowly 
     withdraws into his room.

     HIS ROOM

     Barton looks down at his typewriter for a beat. The 
     laughter/weeping continues.

     He walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house 
     phone.

                    BARTON
          Hello... Chet? This is Barton Fink 
          in room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's 
          someone in the room next door to 
          mine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh... 
          making a lot of... noise.

     After a beat:

                    BARTON
          ...Thank you.

     He cradles the phone. The laughter continues for a moment or 
     two, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the 
     telephone ringing next door.

     Barton looks at the wall.

     The muffled sound of a man talking.

     The sound of the earpiece being pronged.

     Muffled footsteps next door.

     The sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting.  

     Footsteps approaching the hall.

     A hard, present knock at Barton's door.

     Barton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door.

     ON THE DOOR

     As Barton opens it. Standing in the hall is a large man – a 
     very large man – in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened 
     tie. His face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of 
     sweat.

                    MAN
          Did you... Somebody just complained...

     Hastily:

                    BARTON
          No, I didn't – I mean, I did call 
          down, not to complain exactly, I was 
          just concerned that you might – not 
          that it's my business, but that you 
          might be in some kind of... distress. 
          You see, I was trying to work, and 
          it's, well, it was difficult –

                    MAN
          Yeah. I'm damn sorry, if I bothered 
          you.  The damn walls here, well, I 
          just apologize like hell...

     He sticks his hand out.

                    MAN
          ...My name's Charlie Meadows. I guess 
          we're neighbors...

     Without reaching for the hand.

                    BARTON
          Barton Fink.

     Unfazed, Charlie Meadows unpockets a flask.

                    CHARLIE
          Neighbor, I'd feel better about the 
          damned inconvenience if you'd let me 
          buy you a drink.

                    BARTON
          That's all right, really, thank you.

                    CHARLIE
          All right, hell, you trying to work 
          and me carrying on in there. Look, 
          the liquor's good, wuddya say?

     As he enters:

                    CHARLIE
          ... You got a glass? It's the least 
          I can do.

                    BARTON
          Okay... a quick one, sure...

     He gets two glasses from the wash basin.  Charlie sits down 
     on the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask.

                    CHARLIE
          Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, 
          all the carryings-on next door.

                    BARTON
          That's okay, I assure you. It's just 
          that I was trying to work –

                    CHARLIE
          What kind of work do you do, Barton, 
          if you don't mind my asking?

                    BARTON
          Well, I'm a writer, actually.

                    CHARLIE
          You don't say. That's a tough racket. 
          My hat's off to anyone who can make 
          a go of it. Damned interesting work, 
          I'd imagine.

                    BARTON
          Can be. Not easy, but –

                    CHARLIE
          Damned difficult, I'd imagine.

     As he hands Charlie a glass:

                    BARTON
          And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

                    CHARLIE
          Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, 
          you might say I sell peace of mind. 
          Insurance is my game – door-to-door, 
          human contact, still the only way to 
          move merchandise.

     He fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty 
     glass.

                    CHARLIE
          ...In spite of what you might think 
          from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.

                    BARTON
          Doesn't surprise me at all.

                    CHARLIE
          Hell yes. Because I believe in it. 
          Fire, theft, and casualty are not 
          things that only happen to other 
          people – that's what I tell 'em. 
          Writing doesn't work out, you might 
          want to look into it. Providing for 
          basic human need – a fella could do 
          worse.

                    BARTON
          Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.

                    CHARLIE
          What kind of scribbler are you – 
          newspaperman did you say?

                    BARTON
          No, I'm actually writing for the 
          pictures now –

                    CHARLIE
          Pictures! Jesus!

     He guffaws.

                    CHARLIE
          ...I'm sorry, brother, I was just 
          sitting here thinking I was talking 
          to some ambitious youngster, eager 
          to make good.  Hell, you've got it 
          made! Writing for pictures! Beating 
          out that competition!  And me being 
          patronizing!

     He gestures toward his face:

                    CHARLIE
          ...Is the egg showing or what?!

                    BARTON
          That's okay; actually I am just 
          starting out in the movies – though 
          I was pretty well established in New 
          York, some renown there,

                    CHARLIE
          Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm 
          not the best-read mug on the planet, 
          so I guess it's no surprise I didn't 
          recognize your name. Jesus, I feel 
          like a heel.

     For the first time Barton smiles.

                    BARTON
          That's okay, Charlie. I'm a 
          playwright. My shows've only played 
          New York. Last one got a hell of a 
          write-up in the Herald. I guess that's 
          why they wanted me here.

                    CHARLIE
          Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality.  
          What kind of venue, that is to say, 
          thematically, uh...

                    BARTON
          What do I write about?

     Charlie laughs.

                    CHARLIE
          Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, 
          that's it, Bart.

                    BARTON
          Well, that's a good question. Strange 
          as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I 
          write about people like you. The 
          average working stiff. The common 
          man.

                    CHARLIE
          Well ain't that a kick in the head!

                    BARTON
          Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, 
          that's exactly the point. There's a 
          few people in New York – hopefully 
          our numbers are growing – who feel 
          we have an opportunity now to forge 
          something real out of everyday 
          experience, create a theater for the 
          masses that's based on a few simple 
          truths – not on some shopworn 
          abstractions about drama that doesn't 
          hold true today, if they ever did...

     He gazes at Charlie.

                    BARTON
          ...I don't guess this means much to 
          you.

                    CHARLIE
          Hell, I could tell you some stories–

                    BARTON
          And that's the point, that we all 
          have stories. The hopes and dreams 
          of the common man are as noble as 
          those of any king. It's the stuff of 
          life – why shouldn't it be the stuff 
          of theater?  Goddamnit, why should 
          that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't 
          call it new theater, Charlie; call 
          it real theater. Call it our theater.

                    CHARLIE
          I can see you feel pretty strongly 
          about it.

                    BARTON
          Well, I don't mean to get up on my 
          high horse, but why shouldn't we 
          look at ourselves up there?  Who 
          cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop 
          and Lady Higginbottom and – and – 
          and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?

                    CHARLIE
          I can feel my butt getting sore 
          already.

                    BARTON
          Exactly, Charlie! You understand 
          what I'm saying – a lot more than 
          some of these literary types. Because 
          you're a real man!

                    CHARLIE
          And I could tell you some stories –

                    BARTON
          Sure you could!  And yet many writers 
          do everything in their power to 
          insulate themselves from the common 
          man – from where they live, from 
          where they trade, from where they 
          fight and love and converse and – 
          and – and... so naturally their work 
          suffers, and regresses into empty 
          formalism and – well, I'm spouting 
          off again, but to put it in your 
          language, the theater becomes as 
          phony as a three dollar bill.

                    CHARLIE
          Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right 
          there.

                    BARTON
          Frequently played, seldom remarked.

     Charlie laughs.

                    CHARLIE
          Whatever that means.

     Barton smiles with him.

                    BARTON
          You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad 
          you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well 
          I know I sometimes run on.

                    CHARLIE
          Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, 
          I'll let you know if I'm bored. I 
          find it all pretty damned interesting. 
          I'm the kind schmoe who's generally 
          interested in the other guy's point 
          of view.

                    BARTON
          Well, we've got something in common 
          then.

     Charlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door.

                    CHARLIE
          Well Christ, if there's any way I 
          can contribute, or help, or whatever–

     Barton chuckles and extends his hand.

                    BARTON
          Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by 
          just being yourself.

                    CHARLIE
          Well, I can tell you some stories –

     He pumps Barton's hand, then turns and pauses in the doorway.

                    CHARLIE
          ...And look, I'm sorry as hell about 
          the interruption. Too much revelry 
          late at night, you forget there are 
          other people in the world.

                    BARTON
          See you, Charlie.

     Charlie closes the door and is gone.

     Barton goes back to his desk and sits.

     Muffled, we can hear the door of the adjacent room opening 
     and closing.

     Barton looks at the wall.

     HIS POV

     The bathing beauty.

     From offscreen we hear a sticky, adhesive-giving-way sound.

                    BARTON
          He looks around to the opposite – 
          bed – wall.

     HIS POV

     The wallpaper is lightly sheened with moisture from the heat.  

     One swath of wallpaper is just finishing sagging away from 
     the wall. About three feet of the wall, where it meets the 
     ceiling, is exposed.

     The strip of wallpaper, its glue apparently melted, sags and 
     nods above the bed. It glistens yellow, like a fleshy tropical 
     flower.

     BACK TO BARTON

     He goes over to the bed and steps up onto it. He smooths the 
     wallpaper back up against the wall.

     He looks at his hand.

     HIS HAND

     Sticky with tacky yellow wall sweat.

     He wipes it onto his shirt.

     We hear a faint mosquito hum.

     Barton looks around.

                                        FADE OUT

     A TYPEWRITER Whirring at high speed. The keys strike too 
     quickly for us to make out the words.

     SLOW TRACK IN

     On Barton, sitting on a couch in an office anteroom, staring 
     blankly.  Distant phones ring. Barton's eyes are tired and 
     bloodshot.

     HIS POV

     A gargoyle secretary sits typing a document.

     The office door opens in the background and a short middle-
     aged man in a dark suit emerges.

     To his secretary:

                    EXECUTIVE
          I'm eating on the lot today –

     He notices Barton.

                    EXECUTIVE
          ...Who's he?

     The secretary looks over from her typing to consult a slip 
     of paper on her desk.

                    SECRETARY
          Barton Fink, Mr. Geisler.

                    GEISLER
          More please.

                    BARTON
          I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum 
          said I should drop by morning to see 
          you about the –

                    GEISLER
          Ever act?

                    BARTON
          ...Huh? No, I'm –

                    GEISLER
          We need Indians for a Norman Steele 
          western.

                    BARTON
          I'm a writer. Ted O –

                    GEISLER
          Think about it, Fink. Writers come 
          and go; we always need Indians.

                    BARTON
          I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're 
          producing this Wallace Beery picture 
          I'm working on.

                    GEISLER
          What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. 
          They've assigned me enough pictures 
          for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum 
          doesn't know you could almost squeeze 
          into the Hollywood Bowl.

                    BARTON
          Then who should I talk to?

     Geisler gives a hostile stare. Without looking at her, he 
     addresses the secretary:

                    GEISLER
          Get me Lou Breeze.

     He perches on the edge of the desk, an open hand out toward 
     the secretary, as he glares wordlessly at Barton.

     After a moment:

                    SECRETARY
          Is he in for Mr. Geisler?

     She puts the phone in Geisler's hand.

                    GEISLER
          Lou? How's Lipnik's ass smell this 
          morning?... Yeah?... Yeah?... Okay, 
          the reason I'm calling, I got a writer 
          here, Fink, all screwy. Says I'm 
          producing that Wallace Beery wrestling 
          picture – what'm I, the goddamn 
          janitor around here?...  Yeah, well 
          who'd you get that from?...  Yeah, 
          well tell Lipnik he can kiss my 
          dimpled ass... Shit! No, alright... 
          No, no, all right.

     Without looking he reaches the phone back. The secretary 
     takes it and cradles it.

                    GEISLER
          ...Okay kid, let's chow.

     COMMISSARY

     Barton and Geisler sit eating in a semicircular booth. Geisler 
     speaks through a mouthful of food:

                    GEISLER
          Don't worry about it. It's just a B 
          picture. I bring it in on budget, 
          they'll book it without even screening 
          it. Life is too short.

                    BARTON
          But Lipnik said he wanted to look at 
          the script, see something by the end 
          of the week.

                    GEISLER
          Sure he did. And he forgot about it 
          before your ass left his sofa.

                    BARTON
          Okay. I'm just having trouble getting 
          started. It's funny, I'm blocked up.  
          I feel like I need some kind of 
          indication of... what's expected –

                    GEISLER
          Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. 
          What do you need, a road map?

     Geisler chews on his cottage cheese and stares at Barton.

                    GEISLER
          ...Look, you're confused? You need 
          guidance? Talk to another writer.

                    BARTON
          Who?

     Geisler rises and throws his napkin onto his plate.

                    GEISLER
          Jesus, throw a rock in here, you'll 
          hit one. And do me a favor, Fink: 
          Throw it hard.

     COMMISSARY MEN'S ROOM

     Barton stands at a urinal.

     He stares at the wall in front of him as he pees. After a 
     moment, he cocks his head, listening.

     We hear a throat clearing, as if by a tenor preparing for a 
     difficult passage. It is followed by the gurgling ruch of 
     vomit.

     Barton buttons his pants and turns to face the stalls.

     There is more businesslike throat clearing.

     Barton stoops.

     HIS POV

     We boom down to show the blue serge pants and well-polished 
     shoes of the stall's kneeling occupant.

     A white handkerchief has been spread on the floor to protect 
     the trouser knees.

     The toilet flushes. The man rises, picks up his handkerchief 
     up off the floor and gives it a smart flap.

     BARTON

     He quickly straightens and goes to the sink. He starts washing 
     his hands. We hear the stall door being unlatched.

     Barton glances over his shoulder.

     HIS POV

     The stall door opening.

     BARTON

     Quickly, self-consciously, he looks back down at his hands.

     HIS POV

     His hands writhing under the running water. We hear footsteps 
     approaching.

     BARTON

     Forcing himself to look at his hands. We hear the man reach 
     the adjacent sink and turn on the tap.

     Barton can't help glancing up.

     THE MAN

     A dapper little man in a neat blue serge suit. He has warm 
     brown eyes, a patrician nose, and a salt-and-pepper mustache. 
     He smiles pleasantly at Barton.

     BARTON

     He gives a nervous smile – more like a tic – and looks back 
     down at his hands. We hear the man gargling water and spitting 
     into the sink.

     After a moment, Barton looks up again.

     THE MAN

     Reacting to barton's look as he washes his hands. This time, 
     a curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile.

     BARTON

     Looks back down, then up again.

     THE MAN

     Extends a dripping hand.

                    MAN
          Bill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor.

     His speech is softly accented, from the South.

                    BARTON
          Barton Fink.

     They shake, then return to their ablutions.

     We hold on Barton as we hear Mayhew's faucet being turned 
     off and his foot-steps receding. For some reason, Barton's 
     eyes are widening.

                    BARTON
          ...Jesus. W.P.!

     The dapper little man stops and turns.

                    MAYHEW
          I beg your pardon?

                    BARTON
          W.P. Mayhew? The writer?

                    MAYHEW
          Just Bill, please.

     Barton stands with his back to the sink, facing the little 
     man, his hands dripping onto the floor. There is a short 
     pause. Barton is strangely agitated, his voice halting but 
     urgent.

                    BARTON
          Bill!...

     Mayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile. Finally 
     Barton brings out:

                    BARTON
          ...You're the finest novelist of our 
          time.

     Mayhew leans against a stall.

                    MAYHEW
          Why thank you, son, how kind. Bein' 
          occupied here in the worship of 
          Mammon, I haven't had the chance yet 
          to see your play –

     He smiles at Barton's surprise.

                    MAYHEW
          ...Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the 
          news reaches us in Hollywood.

     He is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid.

                    BARTON
          Sir, I'm flattered that you even 
          recognize my name. My God, I had no 
          idea you were in Hollywood.

                    MAYHEW
          All of us undomesticated writers 
          eventually make their way out here 
          to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's 
          why I allus have such a powerful 
          thrust.

     He clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves 
     it at Barton.

                    MAYHEW
          ...A little social lubricant, Mistuh 
          Fink?

                    BARTON
          It's still a little early for me.

                    MAYHEW
          So be it.

     He knocks back some more.

                    BARTON
          ...Bill, if I'm imposing you should 
          say so, I know you're very busy – I 
          just, uh... I just wonder if I could 
          ask you a favor... That is to say, 
          uh... have you ever written a 
          wrestling picture?

     Mayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his throat.

                    MAYHEW
          ...You are drippin', suh.

     Barton looks down at his hands, then pulls a rough brown 
     paper towel from a dispenser.

     Mayhew sighs:

                    MAYHEW
          ...Mistuh Fink, they have not invented 
          a genre of picture that Bill Mayhew 
          has not, at one time or othuh, been 
          invited to essay. I have taken my 
          stabs at the wrastlin' form, as I 
          have stabbed at so many others, and 
          with as little success. I gather 
          that you are a fresh-man here, eager 
          for an upperclassman's council.  
          However, just at the moment...

     He waves his flask.

                    MAYHEW
          ...I have drinkin' to do. Why don't 
          you stop at my bungalow, which is 
          numbah fifteen, later on this 
          afternoon...

     He turns to leave.

                    MAYHEW
          ...and we will discuss wrastlin' 
          scenarios and other things lit'rary.

     THE NUMBER "15"

     We are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door.  

     Muted, from inside, we hear Mayhew's voice – enraged, 
     bellowing.  We hear things breaking. Softer, we hear a woman's 
     voice, its tone placating.

     REVERSE TRACKING SLOWLY IN

     On Barton, standing in front of the door.

     The noise abates for a moment. We hear the woman's voice 
     again.

     Barton hesitates, listening; he thinks, decides, knocks.  

     With this the woman's voice stops, and Mayhew starts wailing 
     again.

     The door cracks open.

     The woman looks as if she has been crying.

                    WOMAN
          ...Can I help you?

                    BARTON
          I'm sorry, I... My name is Fink... 
          Uh, Bill asked me to drop by this 
          afternoon.  Is he in?

                    WOMAN
          Mr. Mayhew is indisposed at the 
          moment–

     From inside, we hear Mayhew's wail.

                    MAYHEW
          HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!

     The woman glances uncomfortably over her shoulder and steps 
     outside, closing the door behind her.

                    WOMAN
          Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor, Mr. 
          Mayhew's personal secretary. I know 
          this all must sound horrid. I really 
          do apologize...

     Through the door Mayhew is still wailing piteously.

                    BARTON
          Is, uh... Is he okay?

                    AUDREY
          He will be... When he can't write, 
          he drinks.

                    MAYHEW
          WHERE ARE YOU, DAMMIT! WHERE'S 
          M'HONEY!!

     She brushes a wisp of hair out of her eyes.

                    AUDREY
          I am sorry, it's so embarassing.

                    BARTON
          How about you? Will you be alright?

                    AUDREY
          I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr 
          Fink?

                    BARTON
          Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – 
          please call me Barton.

     Audrey reaches out and touches Barton's hand.

                    AUDREY
          I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm 
          sure he'll want to reschedule your 
          appointment.

                    BARTON
          Perhaps you and I could get together 
          at some point also. –I'm sorry if 
          that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't 
          know anyone here in this town.

     Audrey smiles at him.

                    AUDREY
          Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.

                    BARTON
          Please, Barton.

                    AUDREY
          Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not 
          just Bill's secretary – Bill and I 
          are... I love. We-

                    MAYHEW'S VOICE
          M'HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!

     Audrey glances back as we hear the sound of shattering dishes 
     and heavy footsteps.

                    BARTON
          I see.

                    AUDREY
          ...I know this must look... funny.

                    BARTON
          No, no –

     Hurriedly:

                    AUDREY
          We need each other. We give each 
          other...  the things we need –

                    VOICE
          M'HONEY!!... bastard-ass sons of 
          bitches... the water's lappin' up...
          M'HONEY!!

                    AUDREY
          I'm sorry, Mr. Fink. Please don't 
          judge us. Please...

     Flustered, she backs away and closes the door.

     CLOSE ON A SMALL WRAPPED PACKAGE

     Hand-printed on the package is the message:

     "Hope these will turn the trick, Mr. Fink. – Chet!"  

     The wrapping is torn away and the small box is opened.

     Two thumbtacks are taken out.

     BARTON'S HOTEL ROOM

     Late at night. The swath of wallpaper behind the bed has 
     sagged away from the wall again, and has been joined by the 
     swath next to it.

     Barton enters frame and steps up onto the bed.

     He smooths up the first swath and pushes in a thumbtack near 
     the top.

     EXTREME CLOSE SHOT

     On the tack. As Barton applies pressure to push it in, tacky 
     yellow goo oozes out of the puncture hole and beads around 
     the tack.

     ON BARTON

     Smoothing up the second swath.

     As he pushes in the second tack he pauses, listening.  

     Muffled, through the wall, we can hear a woman moaning.  

     After a motionless beat, Barton eases his ear against the 
     wall.

     CLOSE ON BARTON

     As his ear meets the wall.

     The woman's moaning continues. We hear the creaking of 
     bedsprings and her partner, incongruously giggling.

     Barton grimaces, gets down off the bed and crosses to the 
     secretary, where he sits. He stares at the paper in the 
     carriage.

     HIS POV

     The blank part of the page around the key-strike area, under 
     the metal prongs that hold the paper down.

     We begin to hear moaning again.

     BACK TO BARTON

     Still looking; sweating.

     HIS POV

     Tracking in on the paper, losing the prongs from frame so 
     that we are looking at the pure unblemished white of the 
     page.

     The moaning is cut short by two sharp knocks.

     THE DOOR

     As it swings open.  Charlie Meadows leans in, smiling.

                    CHARLIE
          Howdy, neighbor.

                    BARTON
          Charlie. How are you.

                    CHARLIE
          Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting 
          you again. I heard you walking around 
          in here.  Figured I'd drop by.

                    BARTON
          Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really 
          gotten started yet – what happened 
          to your ear?

     – for Charle's left ear is plugged with cotton wadding. As 
     he enters:

                    CHARLIE
          Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic 
          thing.  Goes away for a while, but 
          it always comes back. Gotta put cotton 
          in it to staunch the flow of pus. 
          Don't worry, it's not contagious.

                    BARTON
          Seen a doctor?

     Charlie gives a dismissive wave.

                    CHARLIE
          Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell 
          me?  Can't trade my head in for a 
          new one.

                    BARTON
          No, I guess you're stuck with the 
          one you've got. Have a seat.

     Charlie perches on the corner of the bed.

                    CHARLIE
          Thanks, I'd invite you over to my 
          place, but it's a goddamn mess. You 
          married, Bart?

                    BARTON
          Nope.

                    CHARLIE
          I myself have yet to be lassoed.

     He takes his flask out.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Got a sweetheart?

                    BARTON
          No... I guess it's something about 
          my work. I get so worked up over it, 
          I don't know; I don't really have a 
          lot of attention left over, so it 
          would be a little unfair...

                    CHARLIE
          Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. 
          In my experience, they pretend to 
          give it, but it's generally a smoke-
          screen for demanding it back – with 
          interest. How about family, Bart?  
          How're you fixed in that department?

     Barton smiles.

                    BARTON
          My folks live in Brooklyn, with my 
          uncle.

                    CHARLIE
          Mine have passed on. It's just the 
          three of us now...

     He taps himself on the head, chuckling.

                    CHARLIE
          ...What's the expression – me myself 
          and I.

                    BARTON
          Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, 
          we're all alone in this world aren't 
          we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by 
          family and friends, but...

     He shrugs.

                    CHARLIE
          Mm... You're no stranger to 
          loneliness, then. I guess I got no 
          beef; especially where the dames are 
          concerned. In my line of work I get 
          opportunities galore – always on the 
          wing, you know what I'm saying. I 
          could tell stories to curl your hair 
          – but it looks like you've already 
          heard 'em!

     He laughs at his reference to Barton's curly hair, and pulls 
     a dog-eared photograph from his wallet. As he hands it to 
     Barton:

                    CHARLIE
          ...That's me in Kansas City, plying 
          my trade.

     THE PHOTO

     Charlie smiles and waves with one foot up on the running 
     board of a 1939 roadster. A battered leather briefcase dangles 
     from one hand.

                    CHARLIE
          ...It was taken by one of my policy 
          holders. They're more than just 
          customers to me, Barton.  They really 
          appreciate what I have to offer them. 
          Ya see, her hubby was out of town at 
          the time –

                    BARTON
          You know, in a way, I envy you 
          Charlie.  Your daily routine – you 
          know what's expected. You know the 
          drill. My job is to plumb the depths, 
          so to speak, dredge something up 
          from inside, something honest. There's 
          no road map for that territory...

     He looks from Charlie to the Underwood.

                    BARTON
          ...and exploring it can be painful. 
          The kind of pain most people don't 
          know anything about.

     He looks back at Charlie.

                    BARTON
          ...This must be boring you.

                    CHARLIE
          Not at all. It's damned interesting.

                    BARTON
          Yeah...

     He gives a sad chuckle.

                    BARTON
          ...Probably sounds a little grand 
          coming from someone who's writing a 
          wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.

                    CHARLIE
          Beery! You got no beef there! He's 
          good.  Hell of an actor – though, 
          for my money, you can't beat Jack 
          Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, 
          funny stuff. But don't get me wrong 
          – Beery, a wrestling picture, that 
          could be a pip. Wrestled some myself 
          back in school. I guess you know the 
          basic moves.

                    BARTON
          Nope, never watched any. I'm not 
          that interested in the act itself –

                    CHARLIE
          Okay, but hell, you should know what 
          it is. I can show you in about thirty 
          seconds.

     He is getting down on his hands and knees.

                    CHARLIE
          ...You're a little out of your weight 
          class, but just for purposes of 
          demonstration –

                    BARTON
          That's all right, really –

                    CHARLIE
          Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest 
          thing in the world! You just get 
          down on your knees to my left, slap 
          your right hand here...

     He indicated his own right bicep.

                    CHARLIE
          ...and your left hand here.

     He indicated his left bicep.

     Barton hesitates.

                    CHARLIE
          ...You can do it, champ!

     Barton complies.

                    CHARLIE
          ...All right now, when I say "Ready...  
          wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I 
          try and pin you. That's the whole 
          game. Got it?

                    BARTON
          ...Yeah, okay.

                    CHARLIE
          Ready... wrestle!

     With one clean move Charlie flips Barton onto his back, his 
     head and shoulders hitting with a thump. Charlie pins Barton's 
     shoulders with his own upper body.

     But before the move even seems completed Charlie is standing 
     again, offering his hand down to Barton.

                    CHARLIE
          Damn, there I go again. We're gonna 
          wake the downstairs neighbors.  I 
          didn't hurt ya, did I?

     Barton seems dazed, but not put out.

                    BARTON
          It's okay, it's okay.

                    CHARLIE
          Well, that's all that wrestling is. 
          Except usually there's more grunting 
          and squirming before the pin. Well, 
          it's your first time. And you're out 
          of your weight class.

     Barton has propped himself up and is painfully massaging the 
     back of his head. This registers on Charlie.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Jesus, I did hurt you!

     He clomps hurriedly away.

                    CHARLIE
          ...I'm just a big, clumsy lug. I 
          sure do apologize.

     We hear water running, and Charlie reenters with a wet towel.  

     Barton accepts the towel and presses it to his head.

                    CHARLIE
          ...You sure you're okay?

     Barton gets to his feet.

                    BARTON
          I'm fine, Charlie. Really I am. 
          Actually, it's been helpful, but I 
          guess I should get back to work.

     Charlie looks at him with some concern, then turns and heads 
     for the door.

                    CHARLIE
          Well, it wasn't fair of me to do 
          that. I'm pretty well endowed 
          physically.

     He opens the door.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Don't feel bad, though. I wouldn't 
          be much of a match for you at mental 
          gymnastics. Gimme a holler if you 
          need anything.

     The door closes.

     Barton crosses to the secretary and sits down, rubbing the 
     back of his head. He rolls up the carriage and looks at the 
     page in the typewriter.

     HIS POV

     The page.

                                        FADE IN:

     A TENEMENT BUILDING

     On Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is 
     audible, as is the cry fishmongers.

     BACK TO BARTON

     He rubs the back of his head, wincing, as he stares at the 
     page.

     His gaze drifts up.

     HIS POV

     The bathing beauty.

     BARTON

     Looking at the picture. He presses the heels of his hands 
     against his ears.

     HIS POV

     The bathing beauty. Faint, but building, is the sound of the 
     surf.

     BARTON

     Head cocked. The surf is mixing into another liquid sound.  
     Barton looks sharply around.

     THE BATHROOM

     Barton enters.

     The sink, which Charlie apparently left running when he wet 
     Barton's towel, is overflowing. Water spills onto the tile 
     floor.

     Barton hurriedly shuts off the tap, rolls up one sleeve and 
     reaches into the sink.

     As his hand emerges, holding something, we hear the unclogged 
     sink gulp water.

     BARTON'S HAND

     Holding a dripping wad of cotton.

     BARTON

     After a brief, puzzled look he realizes where the cotton 
     came from – and convulsively flips it away.

                                        FADE OUT

                                        FADE IN:

     ON THE TITLE PAGE OF A BOOK:

     "NEBUCHADNEZZAR  
     BY  
     W.P. Mayhew"

     A hand enters with pen to inscribe: "To Barton –

     May this little entertainment divert you in your sojourn 
     among the Philistines.  – Bill"

     The book is closed and picked up.

     WIDER

     As-thoomp!-the heavy volume is deposited across the table, 
     in front of Barton, by Mayhew.

     Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are seated around a picnic table. 
     It is one of a few tables littering the lot of a small stucco 
     open-air hamburger stand.

     It is peaceful early evening. The last of the sunlight slopes 
     down through palm trees. Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are the 
     only customers at the stand.

     Mayhew's black Ford stands alone at the edge of the lot.  

     Mayhew leans back in his chair.

                    MAYHEW
          If I close m'eyes I can almost smell 
          the live oak.

                    AUDREY
          That's hamburger grease, Bill.

                    MAYHEW
          Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish 
          on me – lyin' and deceitful...

     His eyes still closed, he waves a limp hand gently in the 
     breeze.

                    MAYHEW
          ...Still, I must say. I haven't felt 
          peace like this since the grand 
          productive days. Don't you find it 
          so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?

                    BARTON
          Well... actually, no Bill...

     Barton looks nervously at Audrey before continuing.

                    BARTON
          ...No, I've always found that writing 
          comes from a great inner pain. Maybe 
          it's a pain that comes from a 
          realization that one must do something 
          for one's fellow man – to help somehow 
          to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a 
          personal pain. At any rate, I don't 
          believe good work is possible without 
          it.

                    MAYHEW
          Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' 
          things up. Yessir. Escape... It's 
          when I can't write, can't escape 
          m'self, that I want to tear m'head 
          off and run screamin' down the street 
          with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. 
          Mm...

     He sighs and reaches for a bottle of Wild Turkey.

                    MAYHEW
          ...This'll sometimes help.

                    AUDREY
          That doesn't help anything, Bill.

                    BARTON
          That's true, Bill. I've never found 
          it to help my writing.

     Mayhew is becoming testy:

                    MAYHEW
          Your writing? Son, have you ever 
          heard the story of Soloman's mammy-

     Audrey, anticipating, jumps hastily in. She taps the book on 
     the table.

                    AUDREY
          You should read this, Barton. I think 
          it's Bill's finest, or among his 
          finest anyway.

     Mayhew looks at her narrowly.

                    MAYHEW
          So now I'm s'posed to roll over like 
          an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly 
          scratched.

                    AUDREY
          Bill –

                    BARTON
          Look, maybe it's none of my business, 
          but a man with your talent – don't 
          you think your first obligation would 
          be to your gift? Shouldn't you be 
          doing whatever you have to do to 
          work again?

                    MAYHEW
          And what would that be, son?

                    BARTON
          I don't know exactly. But I do know 
          what you're doing with that drink. 
          You're cutting yourself off from 
          your gift, and from me and Audrey, 
          and from your fellow man, and from 
          everything your art is about.

                    MAYHEW
          No son, thisahere moonshine's got 
          nothin' to do with shuttin' folks 
          out. No, I'm usin' it to build 
          somethin'.

                    BARTON
          What's that?

                    MAYHEW
          I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, 
          brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee 
          to keep that ragin' river of manure 
          from lappin' at m'door.

                    AUDREY
          Maybe you better too, Barton. Before 
          you get buried under his manure.

     Mayhew chuckles.

                    MAYHEW
          M'honey pretends to be impatient 
          with me, Barton, but she'll put up 
          with anything.

                    AUDREY
          Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.

                    BARTON
          You're lucky she puts up with as 
          much as she does.

     Mayhew is getting to his feet.

                    MAYHEW
          Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. 
          People who know about the human heart, 
          though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over 
          here, he gives his honey love, and 
          she pays him back with pity – the 
          basest coin there is.

                    AUDREY
          Stop it, Bill!

     He wanders over to a corner of the lot between two palm trees, 
     still clutching his bottle, his back to Barton and Audrey, 
     and urinates into the grass.

     He is singing – loudly – "Old Black Joe."

     Audrey walks over to him.

     BARTON

     Watching her go.

     HIS POV

     Audrey touches Mayhew's elbow. He looks at her, stops singing, 
     she murmurs something, and he bellows:

                    MAYHEW
          The truth, m'honey, is a tart that 
          does not bear scrutiny.

     She touches him again, murmuring, and he lashes out at her, 
     knocking her to the ground.

                    MAYHEW
          Breach my levee at your peril!

     BARTON

     He rises.

     AUDREY

     Coming back to Barton.

     MAYHEW

     Stumbling off down the dusty road, muttering to himself and 
     waving his bottle of Wild Turkey.

                    AUDREY
          Let him go.

                    BARTON
          That son of a bitch... Don't get me 
          wrong, he's a fine writer.

     He looks down the road. Mayhew is a small lone figure, weaving 
     in the dust.

                    MAYHEW
          I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, 
          and from there I'll... improvise.

                    BARTON
          Are you all right?

     We hear distant bellowing:

                    MAYHEW
          Silent upon a hill in Darien!

     Audrey bursts into tears. Barton puts his arms around her 
     and she leans into him.

                    BARTON
          Audrey, you can't put up with this.

     Gradually, she collects herself, wiping her tears.

                    AUDREY
          ...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for 
          him!

                    BARTON
          What?! He's a son of a bitch!

                    AUDREY
          No, sometimes he just... well, he 
          thinks about Estelle. His wife still 
          lives in Fayettesville. She's... 
          disturbed.

                    BARTON
          Really?...

     He considers this for a moment, but his anger returns.

                    BARTON
          ...Well that doesn't excuse his 
          behavior.

                    AUDREY
          He'll wander back when he's sober 
          and apologize. He always does.

                    BARTON
          Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –

                    AUDREY
          Barton. Empathy requires... 
          understanding.

                    BARTON
          What. What don't I understand?

     Audrey gazes at him.

     MAYHEW

     He is very distant now, weaving but somehow dignified in his 
     light summer suit. "Old Black Joe" floats back to us in the 
     twilight.

                                        FADE OUT

     BARTON'S HOTEL ROOM

     From a high angle, booming down on Barton.

     The room is dark. Barton lies fully clothed, stretched out 
     on the bed, asleep. The hum of the mosquito fades up in the 
     stillness.

     Suddenly Barton slaps his cheek. His eyes open, but he remains 
     still. The hum fades up again.  Barton reaches over and turns 
     on the bedside lamp. His eyes shift this way and that as he 
     waits, listening.

     The hum fades down to silence.

     Barton's eyes shift.

     HIS POV

     The typewriter sits on the secretary, a piece of paper rolled 
     halfway through the carriage.

     THE TYPEWRITER

     Barton enters frame and sits down in front of the typewriter.

     HIS POV

     Next to the typewriter are several crumpled pieces of paper.  
     The page in the carriage reads:

                                        FADE IN:

     A TENEMENT HOTEL

     On the Lower East Side. We can faintly hear the cry of the 
     fishmongers. It is too early for us to hear traffic; later, 
     perhaps, we will.

     BACK TO BARTON

     Looking down at the page.

     CLOSE ON BARTON'S FEET

     Swinging in the legwell.

     One foot idly swings over to nudge a pair of nicely shined 
     shoes from where they rest, under the secretary, into the 
     legwell.

     We hear typing start.

     THE PAGE

     A new paragraph being started: "A large man..."

     BARTON'S FEET

     As he slides them into the shoes.

     THE PAGE

     "A large man in tights..."

     The typing stops.

     BARTON

     Looking quizzically at the page. What's wrong?

     HIS FEET

     Sliding back and forth – swimming – in his shoes, which are 
     several sizes too large.

     We hear a knock at the door.

     BARTON

     He rises and answers the door.

     Charlie stands smiling in the doorway, holding a pair of 
     nicely shined shoes.

                    CHARLIE
          I hope these are your shoes.

                    BARTON
          Hi, Charlie.

                    CHARLIE
          Because that would mean they gave 
          you mine.

                    BARTON
          Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. 
          Come on in.

     The two stocking-footed men go into the room and Barton 
     reaches under the secretary for Charlie's shoes.

                    CHARLIE
          Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had 
          one of those days?

                    BARTON
          Seems like nothing but, lately.

     Chalrie perches on the edge of the bed.

                    CHARLIE
          Jesus, what a day. Felt like I 
          couldn't've sold ice water in the 
          Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't 
          want insurance, so okay, that's your 
          loss. But God, people can be rude. 
          Feel like I have to talk to a normal 
          person like just to restore a little 
          of my...

                    BARTON
          Well, my pleasure. I could use a 
          little lift myself.

                    CHARLIE
          A little lift, yeah...

     Smiling, he takes out his flask.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Good thing they bottle it, huh 
          pal?

     He takes a glass from the bedstand and, as he pours Barton a 
     shot:

                    CHARLIE
          ...Did I say rude? People can be 
          goddamn cruel. Especially some of 
          their housewives. Okay, so I've got 
          a weight problem. That's my cross to 
          bear. I dunno...

                    BARTON
          Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.

                    CHARLIE
          Defense against what? Insurance?  
          Something they need? Something they 
          should be thanking me for offering? 
          A little peace of mind?...

     He shakes his head.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Finally decided to knock off early, 
          take your advice. Went to see a doctor 
          about this.

     He indicates his ear, still stuffed with cotton.

                    CHARLIE
          ...He told me it was an ear infection.  
          Ten dollars, please. I said, hell, I 
          told YOU my ear was infected. Why 
          don't YOU give ME ten dollars? Well, 
          THAT led to an argument...

     He gives a rueful chuckle.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if 
          my problems amounted to a hill of 
          beans. How goes the life of the mind?

                    BARTON
          Well, it's been better. I can't seem 
          to get going on this thing. That one 
          idea, the one that lets you get 
          started – I still haven't gotten it.  
          Maybe I only had one idea in me – my 
          play. Maybe once that was done, I 
          was done being a writer.  Christ, I 
          feel like a fraud, sitting here 
          staring at this paper.

                    CHARLIE
          Those two love-birds next door drivin' 
          you nuts?

     Barton looks at him curiously.

                    BARTON
          How did you know about that?

                    CHARLIE
          Know about it? I can practically see 
          how they're doin' it. Brother, I 
          wish I had a piece of that.

                    BARTON
          Yeah, but –

                    CHARLIE
          Seems like I hear everything that 
          goes on in this dump. Pipes or 
          somethin'. I'm just glad I don't 
          have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee 
          hours.

     He laughs.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Ah, you'll lick this picture 
          business, believe me. You've got a 
          head on your shoulders. What is it 
          they say? Where there's a head, 
          there's a hope?

                    BARTON
          Where there's life there's hope.

     Charlie laughs.

                    CHARLIE
          That proves you really are a writer!

     Barton smiles.

                    BARTON
          And there's hope for you too, Charlie.  
          Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen 
          policies.

                    CHARLIE
          Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I 
          gotta pull up stakes temporarily.

                    BARTON
          You're leaving?

                    CHARLIE
          In a few days. Out to your stompin' 
          grounds as a matter of fact – New 
          York City. Things have gotten all 
          balled up at the Head Office.

                    BARTON
          I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie.  
          I'll miss you.

                    CHARLIE
          Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long 
          face!  This is still home for me – I 
          keep my room, and I'll be back sooner 
          or later...

     Barton rises and walks over to his writing table.

                    CHARLIE
          ...And – mark my words – by the time 
          I get back you're picture'll be 
          finished. I know it.

     Barton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to Charlie.

                    BARTON
          New York can be pretty cruel to 
          strangers, Charlie. If you need a 
          home-cooked meal you just look up 
          Morris and Lillian Fink.  They live 
          on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave.

     We hear a tacky, tearing sound.

     Barton looks toward the door.

     Charlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where Barton 
     sits.

     The two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau – the 
     slight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in a 
     hunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close 
     together.

     THEIR POV

     A swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from 
     the wall. It sags and nods.

                    CHARLIE
               (off)
          Christ!

     THE TWO MEN

     Frozen, looking.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Your room does that too?

                    BARTON
          I guess the heat's sweating off the 
          wallpaper.

                    CHARLIE
          What a dump...

     He heads for the door and Barton follows.

                    CHARLIE
          ...I guess it seems pathetic to a 
          guy like you.

                    BARTON
          Well...

                    CHARLIE
          Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean 
          to a guy from New York.

                    BARTON
          What do you mean?

                    CHARLIE
          This kind of heat. It's pathetic.

                    BARTON
          Well, I guess you pick your poison.

                    CHARLIE
          So they say.

                    BARTON
          Don't pick up and leave without saying 
          goodbye.

                    CHARLIE
          Course not, compadre. You'll see me 
          again.

     Barton closes the door.

     He goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewriter.  
     After a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the 
     ceiling.

     We hear a loud thump.

     HIS POV

     The ceiling – a white, seamless space.

     As we track in the thumping continues – slowly, rhythmically, 
     progressively louder – the effect, it seems, of odd doings 
     upstairs.

     LOOKING DOWN ON BARTON

     From a high angle, tipped back in his chair, staring at the 
     ceiling.

     We track slowly down toward him. The thumping continues, 
     growing louder, sharper.

     HIS POV

     Moving in on the ceiling. We close in on an unblemished area 
     and cease to have any sense of movement.

     With a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame 
     to land with a deafening crash, and an instant later it is 
     gone, having left a huge black "T" stamped into the white 
     ceiling.

     We are pulling back from the white, past the metal prongs of 
     the key-strike area on a typewriter. More letters appear 
     rapid-fire, growing smaller as the pull back continues. The 
     thumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter.

     BEN GEISLER

     Is emerging from his office.  As he enters the secretary 
     stops typing, glances down at a slip of paper, and murmurs 
     tonelessly, without looking up:

                    SECRETARY
          Barton Fink.

                    GEISLER
          Yeah. Fink. Come in.

     The clack of the typewriter resumes as Barton rises.

     GEISLER'S OFFICE

     The two men enter.

     This office is considerably smaller than Lipnik's, done in 
     grays and black. There are pictures on the wall of Geisler 
     with various celebrities.

     Geisler sits behind his desk.

                    GEISLER
          Wuddya got for me – what the hell 
          happened to your face?

                    BARTON
          Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.

                    GEISLER
          Like hell it is; there are no 
          mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos 
          breed in swamps – this is a desert 
          town. Wuddya got for me?

                    BARTON
          Well I...

                    GEISLER
          On the Beery picture! Where are we? 
          Wuddya got?

                    BARTON
          Well, to tell you the truth, I'm 
          having some trouble getting started–

                    GEISLER
          Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! 
          Started?!  You mean you don't have 
          ANYthing?!

                    BARTON
          Well not much.

     Geisler leaps to his feet and paces.

                    GEISLER
          What do you think this is? HAMLET? 
          GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED 
          GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big 
          men in tights! You know the drill!

                    BARTON
          I'm afraid I don't really understand 
          that genre. maybe that's the prob-

                    GEISLER
          Understand shit! I though you were 
          gonna consult another writer on this!

                    BARTON
          Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-

                    GEISLER
          Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a 
          souse!

                    BARTON
          He's a great writer –

                    GEISLER
          A souse!

                    BARTON
          You don't understand. He's in pain,
          because he can't write-

                    GEISLER
          Souse! Souse! He manages to write 
          his name on the back of his paycheck 
          every week!

                    BARTON
          But... I thought no one cared about 
          this picture.

                    GEISLER
          You thought! Where'd you get THAT 
          from?  You thought! I don't know 
          what the hell you said to Lipnik, 
          but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You 
          understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! 
          He's taken an interest. NEVER make 
          Lipnik like you. NEVER!

     Some puzzlement shows through Barton's weariness.

                    BARTON
          I don't understand-

                    GEISLER
          Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's 
          taken an interest! What the hell did 
          you say to him?

                    BARTON
          I didn't say anything-

                    GEISLER
          Well he's taken an interest!  That 
          means he'll make your life hell, 
          which I could care less about, but 
          since I drew the short straw to 
          supervise this turkey, he's gonna be 
          all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch 
          called me yesterday to ask how it's 
          going – don't worry, I covered for 
          you. Told him you were making progress 
          and we were all very excited. I told 
          him it was great, so now MY ass is 
          on the line.  He wants you to tell 
          him all about it tomorrow.

                    BARTON
          I can't write anything by tomorrow.

                    GEISLER
          Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't 
          read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell 
          him SOMEthing for Chrissake.

                    BARTON
          Well what do I tell him?

     Geisler rubs a temple, studies Barton for a beat, then picks 
     up a telephone.

                    GEISLER
          Projection...

     As he waits, Geisler gives Barton a withering stare. It 
     continues throughout the phone conversation.

                    GEISLER
          ... Jerry? Ben Geisler here. Any of 
          the screening rooms free this 
          afternoon?...  Good, book it for me. 
          A writer named Fink is gonna come in 
          and you're gonna show him wrestling 
          pictures... I don't give a shit which 
          ones! WRESTLING pictures!  Wait a 
          minute- isn't Victor Sjoderberg 
          shooting one now?... Show him some 
          of the dailies on that.

     He slams down the phone.

                    GEISLER
          ...This ought to give you some ideas.

     He jots an address on a piece of paper and hands it to Barton.

                    GEISLER
          ...Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at 
          Lipnik's house. Ideas. Broad strokes.  
          Don't cross me, Fink.

     SCREEN

     Black-and-white footage. A middle-aged man with a clapstick 
     enters and shouts:

                    CLAPPER
          DEVIL ON THE CANVAS, twelve baker 
          take one.

     Clap! The clapper withdraws. The angle is on a corner of the 
     ring, where an old corner man stands behind his charge, a 
     huge man in tights who is a little too flabby to be a real 
     athlete. His hair is plastered against his bullet skull and 
     he has a small mustache.

                    VOICE
          Action.

     The wrestler rises from his stool and heads toward center 
     ring and the camera. He affects a German accent:

                    WRESTLER
          I will destroy him!

     He passes the camera.

                    VOICE
          Cut.

     Flash frames.

     The clapper enters again.

                    CLAPPER
          Twelve baker take two.

     Clap! He exits.

     The wrestler moves toward the camera.

                    WRESTLER
          I will destroy him!

                    VOICE
          Cut.

     The clapper enters

                    CLAPPER
          Twelve baker take three.

     Clap!

                    WRESTLER
          I will destroy him!

     SLOW TRACK IN ON BARTON

     Seated alone in a dark screening room, the shaft of the 
     projection beam flickering over his left shoulder.

     As we creep in closer:

                    WRESTLER
               (off)
          I will destroy him!... I will destroy 
          him!... I will destroy him!... I 
          will destroy him!...

     Another off-microphone, distant voice from the screen:

                    VOICE
          Okay, take five...

     THE SCREEN

     A jerky pan, interrupted by flash frames. The wrestler is 
     standing in a corner joking with a makeup girl who pats down 
     his face as he smokes a cigarette.

     A cut in the film and another clapstick enters.

                    CLAPPER
          Twelve charlie take one-

     ON THE CLAP:

     BACK TO BARTON

     Staring at the screen, dull, wan, and forlorn.

                    VOICE
               (off)
          Action.

     THE SCREEN

     The angle is low – canvas level. We hold for a brief moment 
     on the empty canvas before two wrestlers crash down into 
     frame.

     The German is underneath, on his back, pinned by the other 
     man.

     The referee enters, cropped at the knees, and throws counting 
     fingers down into frame.

                    REFEREE
          One... two...

                    WRESTLER
          AAAAHHHH!!

     The German bucks and throws his opponent out of frame.

                    VOICE
          Cut.

                    CLAPPER
          Twelve charlie take two.

     Crash.

                    REFEREE
          One... two...

                    WRESTLER
          AAAAHHHH!!

     BARTON

     Glazed.

                    WRESTLER
               (off)
          AAAAAAHHHHHH!!... AAAAAAHHHHHH!!...  
          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!...

     PAGE IN TYPEWRITER

     The screaming drops out abruptly at cut. We hear only the 
     sound of heavy footfalls on carpet.

     Below the opening paragraph, two new words have been added 
     to the typescript:

     "Orphan?"

     "Dame?"  

     The foot falls continue.

     THE HOTEL ROOM

     Night. Barton paces frantically back and forth.

     He looks at his watch.

     HIS POV

     It is 12:30.

     CLOSE ON THE PHONE

     It is lifted out of the cradle.

                    BARTON
          Hello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in 
          605. Can you try a number for me in 
          Hollywood...  Slausen 6-4304.

     We pull back to frame in Barton as we hear his call ring 
     through.  Barton sweats.

                    BARTON
          Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-

                    AUDREY
          Hello.

                    BARTON
          Audrey, listen, I need help. I know 
          it's late and I shouldn't be calling 
          you like this – believe me I wouldn't 
          have if I could see any other 
          alternative, but I – I'm sorry -
          listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You 
          doing okay?

                    AUDREY
          ...Who is this?

                    BARTON
          Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.

     Through the phone, in the background, we hear Mayhew's drunken 
     bellowing.

                    MAYHEW
          Sons of bitches! Drown 'em all!

     We hear various objects dropping or being thrown to the floor.

                    AUDREY
          Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good 
          time-

                    MAYHEW
          Drown all those rascals...

                    BARTON
          I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know 
          I shouldn't ask, I just need some 
          kind of help, I just, I have a 
          deadline tomorrow-

                    MAYHEW
          I said drown 'em all! Who is that?

     There is more clatter.

     Audrey's voice is hushed, close to the phone:

                    AUDREY
          All right Barton, I'll see if I can 
          slip away-

                    MAYHEW
          Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come 
          into the house... sons of bitches...

                    BARTON
          If you could, I'd –

                    AUDREY
          If I can. He gets jealous; he-

                    MAYHEW
          Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!

                    BARTON
          I need help, Audrey.

                    AUDREY
          I'll try to slip out. If he quiets 
          down, passes out... I'm afraid he 
          thinks – well, he said you were a 
          buffoon, Barton. He becomes 
          irrational–

                    MAYHEW
          Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM!  
          DROWN 'EM! DROWN –

     WIDE ON THE ROOM

     Later. It is quiet. We are craning down toward the bed, where 
     Barton lies stretched out, his head buried beneath a pillow 
     as if to blot out the world.

     The track reveals the wristwatch on Barton's dangled arm: 
     1:30.

     THE HALLWAY

     At the end of the dimly lit corridor a red light blinks on 
     over the elevator, with a faint bell.

     BACK TO BARTON

     With two violent and simultaneous motions he whips the pillow 
     off his head and throws out his other wrist to look at his 
     watch.

     There is a knock at the door.

     Barton swings his feet off the bed.

     THE DOORWAY

     Barton opens the door to Audrey.

                    AUDREY
          Hello, Barton.

                    BARTON
          Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank 
          you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such 
          a... Thank you.

     They enter the main room, where Audrey perches on the edge 
     of the bed.

                    AUDREY
          Now that's all right, Barton.  
          Everything'll be all right.

                    BARTON
          Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?

                    AUDREY
          Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll 
          sleep for a while now. What is it 
          you have to do, exactly?

     Barton paces.

                    BARTON
          Well I have to come up with – an 
          outline, I'd guess you call it. The 
          story. The whole goddamn story. Soup 
          to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-

                    AUDREY
          It's alright, Barton. You don't have 
          to write actual scenes?

                    BARTON
          No, but the whole goddamn – Audrey?  
          Have you ever had to read any of 
          Bill's wrestling scenarios?

     Audrey laughs.

                    AUDREY
          Yes, I'm afraid I have.

                    BARTON
          What are they like? What are they 
          about?

                    AUDREY
          Well, usually, they're... simply 
          morality tales. There's a good 
          wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he 
          confronts at the end. In between, 
          the good wrestler has a love interest 
          or a child he has to protect.  Bill 
          would usually make the good wrestler 
          a backwoods type, or a convict. And 
          sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd 
          have the wrestler protecting an idiot 
          manchild.  The studio always hated 
          that. Oh, some of the scripts were 
          so... spirited!

     She laughs – then stops, realizing that she has laughed. She 
     looks at Barton.

                    AUDREY
          ...Barton.

     She shakes her head.

                    AUDREY
          ...Look, it's really just a formula. 
          You don't have to type your soul 
          into it.  We'll invent some names 
          and a new setting.  I'll help you 
          and it won't take any time at all. I 
          did it for Bill so many times –

     Barton's pacing comes up short.

                    BARTON
          Did what for Bill?

     Guardedly:

                    AUDREY
          Well... THIS.

                    BARTON
          You wrote his scripts for him?

                    AUDREY
          Well, the basic ideas were frequently 
          his-

                    BARTON
          You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus 
          Christ, you wrote his – what about 
          before that?

                    AUDREY
          Before what?

                    BARTON
          Before Bill came to Hollywood.

     Audrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path.

                    AUDREY
          Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so 
          to speak-

                    BARTON
          What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, 
          how long have you been his... 
          secretary?

                    AUDREY
          Barton, I think we should concentrate 
          on OUR little project-

                    BARTON
          I want to know how many of Bill's 
          books you wrote!

                    AUDREY
          Barton!

                    BARTON
          I want to know!

                    AUDREY
          Barton, honestly, only the last couple-

                    BARTON
          Hah!

                    AUDREY
          And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL,
          really, when he'd been drinking-

                    BARTON
          I'll bet. Jesus – "The grand 
          productive days." What a goddamn 
          phony.

     He resumes pacing.

                    BARTON
          ...W.P. Mayhew.  William Goddamn 
          Phony Mayhew. All his guff about 
          escape. Hah!  I'LL say he escaped!

     Barton sighs and looks at his watch.

                    BARTON
          ...Well, we don't have much time.

     He sits down next to Audrey. Audrey's tone is gentle.

                    AUDREY
          It'll be fine... Don't judge him, 
          Barton.  Don't condescend to him...

     She strokes Barton's hair.

                    AUDREY
          ...It's not as simple as you think. 
          I helped Bill most by appreciating 
          him, by understanding him. We all 
          need understanding, Barton. Even 
          you, tonight, it's all you really 
          need...

     She kisses him.

     As Barton tentatively responds, we are panning away.

     We frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward 
     the sink. We can hear the creak of bedsprings and Audrey and 
     Barton's breath, becoming labored.

     The continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the 
     sink to frame up its drain, a perfect black circle in the 
     porcelain white.  We track up to the drain and are enveloped 
     by it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of 
     pipes.

                                   BLACK

                                        FADE IN:

     BARTON

     The hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we are 
     looking down at Barton, in bed, asleep. It is dawn.

     Barton's eyes snap open.

     HIS POV

     The white ceiling. A humming black speck flits across the 
     white.

     BARTON

     Slowly, cautiously, he props himself up, his look following 
     the sound of the mosquito.

     His gaze travels down and to one side and is arrested as the 
     hum stops.

     HIS POV

     Audrey lies facing away on her side of the bed, half covered 
     by a blanket.

     BARTON

     Gingerly, he reaches over and draws the blanket down Audrey's 
     back.

     HIS POV

     The alabaster white of Audrey's back.

     The mosquito is feeding on it.

     EXTREME CLOSE ON BARTON'S EYES

     Looking.

     EXTREME CLOSE ON THE MOSQUITO

     Swelling with blood.

     WIDER

     As Barton's hand comes through frame and slaps Audrey's back.  

     She doesn't react.

     Barton draws his hand away. Audrey's back is smeared with 
     blood.

     ON BARTON

     He looks at his hand.

     HIS POV

     His hand is dripping with blood. Too much blood.

     BACK TO BARTON

     Eyes wide, he looks down at the bed.

     HIS POV

     Blood seeps up into the sheet beneath the curve of Audrey's 
     back.

     BARTON

     He pulls Audrey's shoulder.

     AUDREY

     She rolls onto her back. Her eyes are wide and lifeless.  

     Her stomach is nothing but blood. The top sheet, drawn to 
     her waist is drenched red and clings to her body.

     BARTON

     He screams.

     He screams again.

     We hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door, a door opening 
     and closing, and then a loud banging on Barton's door.  

     Barton's head spins towards the door. He is momentarily 
     frozen.

     Another knock.

     Barton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door.

     THE DOORWAY

     Over Barton's shoulder as he cracks the door.

     Charlie stands in the hall in his boxer shorts and a 
     sleeveless tee.

                    CHARLIE
          Are you all right?

     Barton stares dumbly for a moment.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Can I come in?

                    BARTON
          No!... I'm fine. Thank you.

                    CHARLIE
          Are you sure –

                    BARTON
          No... no...

     Barton is nodding as he shuts the door in Charlie's face.  

     He walks back into the room.

     HIS POV

     Audrey's corpse, in long shot, face up on the bed.

     BARTON

     He walks toward the bed, wheels before he reaches it, and 
     starts back toward the door.

     He stops short and turns back again to the room. He averts 
     his eyes – as it happens, toward the secretary.

     He walks stiffly over and sits, his back to Audrey.

     CLOSE ON BARTON

     As he sits in. He stares emptily down at the desk, in shock, 
     totally shut down. Behind him, we can see Audrey on the bed.  

     He stares for a long beat.

     Strange, involuntary noises come from his throat. He is not 
     in control.

     Becoming aware of the noise he is making, he stops.

     He lurches to his feet.

     THE DOORWAY

     As Barton enters, opens the door, and sticks his head out.

     HALLWAY

     Barton peers out the see if the coast is clear.

     HIS POV

     The long hallway.

     In the deep background, Chet, the night clerk, is stooping 
     in front of a door to pick up a pair of shoes. Next to him 
     is a castored shoe caddy.

     All of the doorways between us and Chet are empty of shoes.

     CHET

     Close on him as, mid-stoop, he looks up.

     CHET'S POV

     Up the long hall. In the deep background a door is closing.

     CHET

     He pauses, then straightens up and puts the shoes on the 
     shoe caddy. It squeaks as he pushes it on down the hall.

     BARTON'S ROOM

     Barton stands at the door, listening to a very faint squeak.  
     Eventually it becomes inaudible.

     He cracks the door again, looks out, and exits.

     HALLWAY

     Barton goes to Charlie's room and knocks.

     Footfalls end as the door is cracked open.

                    CHARLIE
          Barton. Are you all right?

                    BARTON
          No... Can I come in?

                    CHARLIE
          Why don't we go to your room-

                    BARTON
          Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta 
          help me.

     Once again he is breathing hard.

     Charlie steps out into the hall and shuts the door behind 
     him.

                    CHARLIE
          Get a grip on yourself, brother. 
          Whatever the problem is, we'll sort 
          it out.

                    BARTON
          Charlie, I'm in trouble – something 
          horrible's happened – I've gotta 
          call the police...

     Charlie leads him towards his room.

                    BARTON
          ...Will you stay with me till they 
          get here?

                    CHARLIE
          Don't worry about it, Barton. We can 
          sort it-

     He is pushing Barton's door open, but Barton grabs an elbow 
     to stop him.

                    BARTON
          Before you go in – I didn't do this. 
          I don't know how it happened, but I 
          didn't... I want you to know that...

     Charlie looks into his eyes. For a moment the two men stare 
     at each other – Charlie's look inquisitive, Barton's 
     supplicating.

     Finally, Charlie nods.

                    CHARLIE
          Okay.

     He turns and pushes open the door.

     BARTON'S ROOM

     The two men enter.

     Barton lingers by the door. Charlie walks into the foreground 
     to look off toward the bed.

     His eyes widen and he screams.

     He turns and disappears into the bathroom. We hear vomiting, 
     then the flush of a toilet.

                    CHARLIE
          Jesus... Jesus... Jesus have mercy...

     His reaction has not encouraged Barton, who is more and more 
     agitated.

     Charlie emerges from the bathroom, sweating.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is 
          this?  What're we gonna do?

                    BARTON
          I've gotta call the police – or you 
          could call for me –

                    CHARLIE
          Hold on –

                    BARTON
          You gotta believe me –

                    CHARLIE
          Hold on –

                    BARTON
          I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–

                    CHARLIE
          Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. 
          Tell me what happened.

                    BARTON
          I don't know! I woke up, she was... 
          God, you gotta believe me!

     Charlie, in spite of himself, is sneaking horrified glances 
     back into the room.

                    CHARLIE
          I believe you, brother, but this 
          don't look good.

                    BARTON
          We gotta call the police –

                    CHARLIE
          Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.

                    BARTON
          Yeah.

                    CHARLIE
          What do you think happened?

                    BARTON
          I don't know!  Maybe it was her...  
          boyfriend. I passed out. I don't 
          know.  Won't the police be able to –

                    CHARLIE
          Stop with the police! Wake up, friend!  
          This does not look good! They hang 
          people for this!

                    BARTON
          But I didn't do it – don't you believe 
          me?

                    CHARLIE
          I believe you – I KNOW you. But why 
          should the police?

     Barton gives him a dumb stare.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Did you... Barton, between you 
          and me, did you have sexual 
          intercourse?

     Barton stares at Charlie. He swallows.

     Charlie shakes his head.

                    CHARLIE
          Jesus... They can tell that...

                    BARTON
          They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They 
          gotta have mercy!

                    CHARLIE
          You're in pictures, Barton. Even if 
          you got cleared eventually, this 
          would ruin you.

     He turns and starts toward the bed.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Wait in the bathroom.

     BATHROOM

     Later. Barton, still in his underwear, sits leaning against 
     the wall, staring glassily at his feet.

     From the other room we hear the creak of bedsprings and the 
     sounds of bed clothes being torn off.

     Finally there is a last creak of bedsprings and the sound of 
     Charlie grunting under great weight.

     We hear heavy footsteps approaching.

     Barton looks up through the open bathroom door.

     HIS POV

     Charlie is groping for the front doorknob, cradling the 
     sheetswaddled body in his arms.

     BACK TO BARTON

     His neck goes rubbery. His eyes roll up. His head lolls back 
     to hit the wall.

     BLACK

     Slap! Slap!  

     We are low on Charlie, who is following through on a slap 
     and backing away, having aroused Barton. Charlie is now 
     wearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee, which has 
     blood flecks across the belly.

                    CHARLIE
          You passed out.

     Barton looks groggily up.

                    BARTON
          ...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?

                    CHARLIE
          She's dead, Barton! If that was her 
          name.

     TRACKING IN ON BARTON

     He stares at Charlie.

                    CHARLIE
               (off)
          Barton, listen to me. You gotta act 
          like nothing's happened. Put this 
          totally out of your head. I know 
          that's hard, but your play from here 
          on out is just to go about business 
          as usual. Give us some time to sort 
          this out...

     Barton looks at his watch.

     THE WATCH

     7:45.

                    CHARLIE
               (off)
          ...Just put it out of you head...

     TRACKING

     Toward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and 
     statuary set amid palms trees.

     Sunlight glitters angrily off the water; we are approaching 
     Jack Lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair.

                    LIPNIK
          Bart! So happy to see ya!

     REVERSE

     Pulling Barton, who is being escorted by Lou Breeze.

     Barton is haggard, sunken eyes squinting against too much 
     sun.

                    LIPNIK
          Sit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then 
          talk!  Drink?

     As Barton sits:

                    BARTON
          Yeah... rye whiskey?

                    LIPNIK
          Boy! You writers! Work hard, play 
          hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...

     He laughs, then barks at Lou Breeze.

                    LIPNIK
          ... Lou.

     Lou exits.

                    LIPNIK
          Anyway. Ben Geisler tells me things're 
          going along great.  Thinks we've got 
          a real winner in this one. And let 
          me tell you something, I'm counting 
          on it. I've taken an interest. Not 
          to interfere, mind you – hardly seems 
          necessary in your case. A writer – a 
          storyteller – of your stature.  
          Givitta me in bold strokes, Bart. 
          Gimme the broad outlines. I'm sitting 
          in the audience, the lights go down, 
          Capitol logo comes up... you're on!

     He beams expectantly at Barton.  Barton licks his parched 
     lips.

                    BARTON
          Yeah, okay... well... we fade in...

     Lipnik is nodding, already involved in the story.

                    BARTON
          ...It's a tenement building. On the 
          Lower East Side...

                    LIPNIK
          Great! He's poor, this wrestler! 
          He's had to struggle!

                    BARTON
          And then... well...

     Barton looks back out at the pool, his eyes closed to slits 
     against the sun. He looks back at Lipnik.

                    BARTON
          ...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?

                    LIPNIK
          CAN you?  You damn well better be. 
          Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my 
          business dealings – well, of course, 
          you can't always be honest, not with 
          the sharks swimming around this town 
          – but if you're a writer, you don't 
          think about those things – if I'd 
          been totally honest, I wouldn't be 
          within a mile of this pool – unless 
          I was cleaning it. But that's no 
          reason for you not to be. Honest, I 
          mean.  Not cleaning the pool.

     Lou has entered with a drink, which he sets next to Barton. 
     Lou sits.

     Barton looks around, takes the drink, sips at it greedily, 
     but must finally take the plunge.

                    BARTON
          Well... to be honest, I'm never really 
          comfortable discussing a work in 
          progress.  I've got it all worked 
          out in my head, but sometimes if you 
          force it out in words – prematurely 
          – the wrong words – well, your meaning 
          changes, and it changes your own 
          mind, and you never get it back – so 
          I'd just as soon not talk about it.

     Lipnik stares at him. His smile has disappeared. There is a 
     long beat.

     Lou Breeze clears his throat. He apparently feels obliged to 
     fill the silence.

                    LOU
          ...Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never 
          mind how long I've been in pictures. 
          Mr. Lipnik has been in pictures just 
          about since they were invented. HE 
          practically invented them.

     Lipnik has turned to look curiously at Lou.

                    LOU
          ...Now I think if he's interested in 
          what one of his contract employees 
          is doing while he draws pay, I think 
          that employee ought to tell him, if 
          he wants to stay an employee. Right 
          now the contents of your head are 
          the property of Capitol Pictures, so 
          if I were you I would speak up. And 
          pretty goddamn fast.

     Lou looks at Barton, expectantly. Lipnik continues to stare 
     at Lou.

     There is a long silence, terribly heavy.

     Finally, Lipnik explodes – at Lou.

                    LIPNIK
          You lousy sonofabitch! You're telling 
          this man – this ARTIST – what to 
          do?!

     Lou Breeze is stunned.

                    LOU
          Mr. Lipnik, I –

                    LIPNIK
          This man creates for a living! He 
          puts food on your table and on mine! 
          THANK him for it!  Thank him, you 
          ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or 
          YOU'RE fired!

     Barton is staring, aghast.

                    BARTON
          Mr. Lipnik, that's not really necessar-

     Lipnik, still staring at Lou, gives no sign of hearing Barton. 
     He rises and points.

                    LIPNIK
          Get down on your knees, you 
          sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees 
          and kiss this man's feet!

                    LOU
          Mr. Lipnik, please –

                    BARTON
          I – Mr. Lipnik –

                    LIPNIK
          KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!

     Lou, aghast, looks at Barton.

     Barton, aghast, can only return the same stunned look.

     Lipnik snarls at Lou:

                    LIPNIK
          ...Okay, get out of here. You're 
          fired, you understand me?  Get out 
          of my sight.

     Lou gets stiffly to his feet and stumbles away.

                    BARTON
          Mr. Lipnik, I –

                    LIPNIK
          I apologize, Barton.

                    BARTON
          No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been 
          a great help –

                    LIPNIK
          You don't have to cover for him. 
          It's noble of you, but these things 
          happen in business.

                    BARTON
          Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much 
          better if you could reconsider –

                    LIPNIK
          Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to 
          pull this out of your head. If that 
          sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to 
          you, goddammit, I will. I respect 
          your artistry and your methods, and 
          if you can't fill us in yet, well 
          hell, we should be kissing your feet 
          for your fine efforts.

     He gets down on his knees in front of Barton.

                    LIPNIK
          ...You know in the old country we 
          were taught, as very young children, 
          that there's no shame in supplicatin' 
          yourself when you respect someone.

     Barton stares, horrified, at Lipnik, on the ground at his 
     feet.

                    LIPNIK
          ...On behalf of Capitol Pictures, 
          the administration, and all a the 
          stockholders, please accept this as 
          a symbol of our apology and respect.

     BARTON'S POV

     Lipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him.

     Behind Lipnik the pool glitters.

     BARTON'S ROOM

     The cut has a hard musical sting. Out of the sting comes a 
     loud but distorted thumping noise.

     We are looking down, high angle, form one corner of the room. 
     We are presented with a motionless tableau: Barton sits, 
     hunched, in the far corner, elbows on knees, staring at the 
     bed in front of him. He wears only trousers and a T-shirt 
     and his body and face glisten with sweat. The bed's sheets 
     have been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous 
     rust-red stain in the middle.

     After a beat, in the foreground, the only motion in the scene: 
     A bead of tacky yellow wall-sweat dribbles down the near 
     wall.

     Silence, then the thumping repeats, resolving itself to a 
     knock at the door.

     Barton rises slowly and crosses to the door.

     THE DOOR

     Barton opens it to Charlie, who is dressed in a baggy suit, 
     his hair slicked back, a tan fedora pushed back on his head. 
     It is the first time we have seen him well turned out.

     A battered briefcase is on the floor next to him. He holds a 
     parcel in his left hand, about one foot square, wrapped in 
     brown paper and tied up with twine.

                    CHARLIE
          Barton. Can I come in?

     Barton stands back from the door and Charlie picks up his 
     briefcase and enters.

     THE ROOM

     As the two men enter.

                    BARTON
          Jesus... You're leaving.

                    CHARLIE
          Have to, old timer. Just for a while.

     Barton sounds desperate:

                    BARTON
          Jesus, Charlie, I...

                    CHARLIE
          Everything's okay, believe me. I 
          know it's rough mentally, but 
          everything's taken care of.

                    BARTON
          Charlie! I've got no one else here! 
          You're the only person I know in Los 
          Angeles...

     He starts weeping

                    BARTON
          ...that I can talk to.

     Charlie, also disturbed and unhappy, wraps both arms around 
     Barton.

     Barton sobs unashamedly into his shoulder. Charlie is somber.

                    CHARLIE
          It's okay... It's okay...

                    BARTON
          Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy 
          – like I'm losing my mind. I don't 
          know what to do... I didn't do it, 
          believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. 
          I just...

     His breath comes in short gasping heaves.

                    BARTON
          ...I just don't know what... to do–

                    CHARLIE
          You gotta get a grip on, brother. 
          You gotta just carry on – just for a 
          few days, till I get back. Try and 
          stay here, keep your door locked. 
          Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta 
          keep our heads and we'll figure it 
          out.

                    BARTON
          Yeah, but Charlie –

                    CHARLIE
          Dammit, don't argue with me. You 
          asked me to believe you – well I do.  
          Now don't argue with me.

     He looks at Barton for a beat.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Look, pal – can you do something 
          for me?

     Charlie hands him his parcel.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Keep this for me, till I get back.

     Barton, snuffling, accepts the package.

                    CHARLIE
          ...It's just personal stuff. I don't 
          wanna drag it with me, but I don't 
          trust 'em downstairs, and I'd like 
          to think it's in good hands.

     Still snuffling:

                    BARTON
          Sure, Charlie.

                    CHARLIE
          Funny, huh, when everything that's 
          important to a guy, everything he 
          wants to keep from a lifetime – when 
          he can fit it into a little box like 
          that. I guess... I guess it's kind 
          of pathetic.

     Wallowing in self-pity:

                    BARTON
          It's more than I've got.

                    CHARLIE
          Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll 
          bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll 
          help you finish your script. You'll 
          think about me...

     He thumps his chest.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Make me your wrestler. Then you'll 
          lick that story of yours.

     Barton is tearfully sincere:

                    BARTON
          Thanks, Charlie.

     Charlie solemnly thrusts out his hand.

                    CHARLIE
          Yeah, well, see you soon, friend. 
          You're gonna be fine.

     Barton shakes. As they walk to the door:

                    BARTON
          You'll be back?

                    CHARLIE
          Don't worry about that, compadre. 
          I'll be back.

     Barton shuts the door behind Charlie, locks it, and turns 
     around.

     HIS POV

     The room. The bed. The blood-stained mattress.

     Barton walks across the room and sits carefully at the edge 
     of the bed, avoiding the rust-colored stain. For a long beat, 
     he sits still, but something is building inside.

     Finally, when we hear the distant ding of the elevator 
     arriving for Charlie, it erupts:

     Barton sobs, with the unself-conscious grief of an abandoned 
     child.

     HIGH WIDE SHOT

     Barton weeping, alone on the bed, next to the rust-colored 
     stain.

                                        FADE OUT

                                        FADE IN:

     BATHING BEAUTY

     With the fade in, the sound of the surf mixes up.

     We pan down the picture to discover that a snapshot has been 
     tucked into a corner of the picture frame: it is the snap of 
     Charlie, smiling and waving, with his foot up on the running 
     board of the 1939 Ford roadster.

     BARTON

     Sitting at the desk, staring at the picture. From his glazed 
     eyes and the way his mouth hangs open, we may assume he has 
     been staring at the picture for some time.

     He notices something on the desk and picks it up.

     HIS POV

     The Holy Bible – Placed by the Gideons.

     Barton opens it, randomly, to the Book of Daniel. The text 
     is set in ornately Gothic type.

     "5. And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the 
     Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known 
     unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in 
     pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill."

     BARTON

     Staring at the passage. His mouth hangs open.

     THE BIBLE

     Barton riffles to the first page.

     In bold type at the top:

     "THE BOOK OF GENESIS"

     Underneath, in the same ornately Gothic type:

     "Chapter One 1. Fade in on a tenement building on Manhattan's 
     Lower East Side.  Faint traffic noise is audible; 2. As is 
     the cry of fishmongers."

     BARTON

     Squinting at the page through bloodshot eyes.

     His mouth hangs open.

     BARTON'S ROOM – DAY

     At the cut the harsh clackety-clack of typing bangs in. 
     Sunlight burns against the sheers of Barton's window, making 
     it a painfully bright patch in the room which itself remains 
     fairly dim.

     Barton sits at the secretary, typing furiously.

     He finishes a page, yanks it out of the carriage, and places 
     it face-down on a short stack of face-down pages.

     He feeds in a blank sheet and resumes his rapid typing. He 
     is sweating, unshaven, and more haggard even than when we 
     left him the previous night.

     The telephone rings. After several rings Barton stops typing 
     and answers it, absently, still looking at his work. His 
     voice is hoarse.

                    BARTON
          Hello... Chet... Who?...

     He puts the receiver down on the desk, leans over the 
     typewriter, and examines something he has just written.

     He picks the phone back up and listens for a beat.

                    BARTON
          ... No, don't send them up here. 
          I'll be right down.

     ELEVATOR

     A small oscillating fan whirs up in a corner of the elevator.  

     We pan down to Barton, who is riding down with Pete, the old 
     elevator operator. Barton's voice is hoarse with fatigue.

                    BARTON
          ...You read the Bible, Pete?

                    PETE
          Holy Bible?

                    BARTON
          Yeah.

                    PETE
          I think so... Anyway, I've heard 
          about it.

     Barton nods.

     They ride for a beat.

     LOBBY

     Late afternoon sun slants in from one side. The lobby has 
     the same golden ambiance as when first we saw it.

     Barton is walking toward two wing chairs in the shadows, 
     from which two men in suits are rising. One is tall, the 
     other short.

                    POLICEMAN
          Fink?

                    BARTON
          Yeah.

                    POLICEMAN #2
          Detective Mastrionotti.

                    POLICEMAN #1
          Detective Deutsch.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          L.A.P.D.

                    BARTON
          Uh-huh.

     All three sit in ancient maroon swing chairs. Mastrionotti 
     perches on the edge of his chair; Deutsch slumps back in the 
     shadows, studying Barton.

                    DEUTSCH
          Got a couple questions to ask ya.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          What do you do, Fink?

     Still hoarse:

                    BARTON
          I write.

                    DEUTSCH
          Oh yeah? What kind of write?

                    BARTON
          Well as a matter of fact, I write 
          for the pictures.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Big fuckin' deal.

                    DEUTSCH
          You want my partner to kiss your 
          ass?

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Would that be good enough for ya?

                    BARTON
          No, I – I didn't mean to sound –

                    DEUTSCH
          What DID you mean?

                    BARTON
          I – I've got respect for – for working 
          guys, like you –

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You 
          live in 605?

                    BARTON
          Yeah.

                    DEUTSCH
          How long you been up there, Fink?

                    BARTON
          A week, eight, nine days –

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Is this multiple choice?

                    BARTON
          Nine days – Tuesday –

                    DEUTSCH
          You know this slob?

     He is holding a small black-and-white photograph out toward 
     Barton.

     There is a long beat as Barton studies the picture.

                    BARTON
          ...Yeah, he... he lives next door to 
          me.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          That's right, Fink, he lives next 
          door to you.

                    DEUTSCH
          Ever talk to him?

                    BARTON
          ...Once or twice. His name is Charlie 
          Meadows.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

                    DEUTSCH
          His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Also known as Madman Mundt.

                    DEUTSCH
          He's a little funny in the head.

                    BARTON
          What did... What did he –

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate 
          people with a shotgun and then cut 
          their heads off.

                    DEUTSCH
          Yeah, he's funny that way.

                    BARTON
          I...

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Started in Kansas City. Couple of 
          housewives.

                    DEUTSCH
          Couple of days ago we see the same 
          M.O. out in Los Feliz.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.

                    DEUTSCH
          All of which he's now missin'.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Well, some of his throat was there.

                    DEUTSCH
          Physician, heal thyself.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Good luck with no fuckin' head.

                    DEUTSCH
          Anyway.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Hollywood precinct finds another 
          stiff yesterday. Not too far from 
          here. This one's better looking than 
          the doc.

                    DEUTSCH
          Female caucasian, thirty years old. 
          Nice tits. No head. You ever see 
          Mundt with anyone meets that 
          description?

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          But, you know, with the head still 
          on.

                    BARTON
          ...No. I never saw him with anyone 
          else.

                    DEUTSCH
          So. You talked to Mundt, what about?

                    BARTON
          Nothing, really. Said he was in the 
          insurance business.

     Deutsch indicates Mastrionotti.

                    DEUTSCH
          Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          No reputable company would hire a 
          guy like that.

                    BARTON
          Well that's what he said.

                    DEUTSCH
          What else?

                    BARTON
          He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, 
          really... He... He said he liked 
          Jack Oakie pictures.

     Mastrionotti looks at Deutsch. Deutsch looks at Mastrionotti.  
     After a beat, Mastrionotti looks back at Barton.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say 
          anything you might remember could be 
          helpful. But I'll be frank with you: 
          That is not helpful.

                    DEUTSCH
          Ya see how he's not writing it down?

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't 
          it?

                    BARTON
          Yeah.

     Mastrionotti gets to his feet, looking around the lobby.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Yeah, I didn't think this dump was 
          restricted.

     He digs in his pocket.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          ...Mundt has disappeared. I don't 
          think he'll be back. But...

     He hands Barton a card.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          ...give me a call if you see him. Or 
          if you remember something that isn't 
          totally idiotic.

     BARTON'S ROOM

     We are tracking toward the paper-wrapped parcel that sits on 
     the nightstand next to Barton's bed.   

     Barton enters and picks it up. He holds it for a beat, looking 
     at it, then brings it over to the secretary and sits.

     He shakes it.

     No sound; whatever is inside is well packed.

     Barton holds it up to his ear and listens for a long beat, 
     as if it were a seashell and he is listening for the surf.  

     Finally he puts it on his desk, beneath the picture of the 
     bathing beauty, and starts typing, quickly and steadily.

                                        DISSOLVE

                                  THROUGH TO:

     REVERSE

     Some time later; Barton still types. He is face to us; beyond 
     him we can see the bed with its rust-colored stain.

     The phone rings. Barton ignores it. It continues to ring.  

     Barton rises and exits frame; we hold on to the bed in the 
     background. We hear Barton's footsteps on the bathroom tile 
     as the phone continues ringing.

     Barton sits back into frame stuffing cotton into each ear. 
     He resumes typing.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Barton typing. The desk trembles under the working of the 
     typewriter.  Charlie's parcel chatters.

     Barton takes a finished page out of the carriage and places 
     it face down on the growing stack to his right. He feeds in 
     a new page. We hear the muted ding of the elevator down the 
     hall. Barton resumes typing.

     We hear a knock on Barton's door. Barton does not react, 
     apparently not hearing.

     THE DOORWAY

     We are close on the bottom of the door. Someone in the hallway 
     is sliding a note beneath the door; then his shadow disappears 
     and his footsteps recede.

     The note is a printed message headed: "While You Were Out... 
     " Underneath are the printed words: "You were called by" 
     and, handwritten in the space following: "Mr. Ben Geisler."  

     Handwritten below, in the message space:

     "Thank you. Lipnik loved your meeting. Keep up the good work." 

     Barton's offscreen typing continues steadily.

                                        FADE OUT

     HALLWAY

     A perfectly symmetrical wide low angle shot of the empty 
     hall.  Shoes are set put in front of each door except for 
     one in the middle background.

     At the cut in we hear faint, regular typing.

     We hold for a beat. There is no motion. The long, empty hall. 
     The distant typing.

     We hold.

     The typing stops. There is a beat of quiet.

     It is broken by the sound of a door opening. It is the 
     shoeless door in the middle background.

     A hand reaches out to place a pair of shoes in the doorway.  

     The hand withdraws.

     The door closes.

     A short beat of silence.

     The distant typing resumes.

     The long empty hall. The distant typing.

                                        FADE OUT

     OVER THE BLACK

     We hear the distant sound of a woman's voice, tinny and 
     indistinct.

                    WOMAN
          Just a minute and I'll connect you...

                                        FADE IN:

     CLOSE ON BARTON

     His eyes are red-rimmed and wild. He sits on the edge of his 
     bed holding the phone to his ear.

     His voice is unnaturally loud:

                    BARTON
          Hello? Operator! I can't... Oh!

     He stops, reaches up, takes a cotton wad out of his ear.

     We hear various clicks and clacks as the telephone lines 
     switch, and then a distant ring. The phone rings three or 
     four times before it is answered by a groggy voice.

                    VOICE
          ...Hello.

                    BARTON
          Garland, it's me.

                    GARLAND
          Barton? What time is it? Are you all 
          right?

                    BARTON
          Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to 
          talk to you. I'm calling long 
          distance.

                    GARLAND
          Okay.

     Muffled, we hear Garland speaking to someone else.

                    GARLAND
          ...It's Barton. Calling long distance.

     Back into the receiver:

                    GARLAND
          ...What is it Barton? Are you okay?

                    BARTON
          I'm fine, garland, but I have to 
          talk with you.

                    GARLAND
          Go ahead, son.

                    BARTON
          It's about what I'm writing, Garland. 
          It's really... I think it's really 
          big.

                    GARLAND
          What do you mean, Barton?

                    BARTON
          Not big in the sense of large – 
          although it's that too. I mean 
          important. This may be the most 
          IMPORTANT work I've done.

                    GARLAND
          Well, I'm... glad to hear that –

                    BARTON
          Very important, Garland. I just 
          thought you should know that. Whatever 
          happens.

                    GARLAND
          ...That's fine.

                    BARTON
          Have you read the Bible, Garland?

                    GARLAND
          ...Barton, is everything okay?

                    BARTON
          Yes... Isn't it?

                    GARLAND
          Well, I'm just asking. You sound a 
          little –

     Guardedly:

                    BARTON
          Sound a little what?

                    GARLAND
          Well, you just... sound a little–

     Bitterly:

                    BARTON
          Thanks, Garland. Thanks for all the 
          encouragement.

     He slams down the phone.

     OVER HIS SHOULDER

     A one-quarter shot on Barton from behind as he picks up the 
     cotton wad and sticks it back in his right ear.

     He resumes typing, furiously.

     After a beat he mutters, still typing.

                    BARTON
          ...Nitwit.

     THE BATHING BEAUTY

     Later. We hear typing and the roar of the surf.'

     CLOSE ON TYPEWRITER

     We are extremely close on the key-strike area. As we cut in 
     Barton is typing:

     "p-o-s-t-c-a-r-d-."

     The carriage returns a couple of times and "T-H-E–E-N-D" is 
     typed in.

     The paper is ripped out of the carriage.

     CLOSE ON A STACK OF PAGES

     Lying face down on the desk; the last page is added, face 
     down, to the pile.  The pile is picked up, its edges are 
     straightened with a couple of thumps against the desktop, 
     and then the pile is replaced on the desk, face up.  The 
     title page reads:

     "THE BURLYMAN 
     Motion Picture Scenario 
     By 
     Barton Fink"

     Barton's right hand enters frame to deposit a small cotton 
     wad on top of the script.

     Barton's left hand enters to deposit another small cotton 
     wad on top of the script.

     We hear Barton walk away. We hear bath water run.

     THE BATHING BEAUTY

     Still looking out to sea.

     USO HALL

     We are booming down to the dance floor as a raucous band 
     plays an up-tempo number.

     BARTON

     Dancing animatedly, almost maniacally, his fingers jabbing 
     the air.

     The hall is crowded, but Barton is one of few men not in 
     uniform.

     USO GIRL

     Giggling, dancing opposite Barton.

                    GIRL
          You're cute!

     BARTON

     Caught up in his dancing, oblivious to the girl.

     A white uniformed arm reaches in to tap Barton on the 
     shoulder.

                    SAILOR
          'Scuse me, buddy, mind if I cut in?

     Barton glares at him.

                    BARTON
          This is MY dance, sailor!

                    SAILOR
          C'mon buddy, I'm shipping out 
          tomorrow.

     For some reason, Barton is angry.

                    BARTON
          I'm a writer! Celebrating the 
          completion of something GOOD!  Do 
          you understand that, sailor? I'm a 
          WRITER!

     His bellowing has drawn onlookers' attention.

                    VOICES
          Step aside, four-eyes! Let someone 
          else spin the dame! Give the navy a 
          dance! Hey, Four-F, take a hike!

     Barton turns furiously against the crowd.

                    BARTON
          I'm a writer, you monsters! I CREATE!  
          He points at his head.

                    BARTON
          ...This is my uniform!

     He taps his skull.

                    BARTON
          ...THIS is how I serve the common 
          man!  THIS is where I –

     WHAPP! An infantry man tags Barton's chin on the button. 
     Bodies surge. The crowd gasps. The band blares nightmarishly 
     on.

     HOTEL HALLWAY

     Quiet at the cut.

     After a beat, there is a faint ding at the end of the hall 
     and, as the elevator door opens, we faintly hear:

                    PETE
          This stop: six.

     Barton, disheveled, emerges and stumbles wearily down the 
     hall. He stops in front of his door, takes his key out, and 
     enters the room.

     BARTON'S POV

     Mastrionotti is sitting on the edge of the bed reading 
     Barton's manuscript.

     Deutsch stands in front of the desk staring at the bathing 
     beauty.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Mother: What is to become of him. 
          Father: We'll be hearing from that 
          crazy wrestler.  And I don't mean a 
          postcard. Fade out. The end.

     He looks up at Barton.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          ...I thought you said you were a 
          writer.

                    DEUTSCH
          I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.

                    BARTON
          Keep your filthy eyes off that.

     Deutsch turns toward Barton and throws a folded newspaper at 
     him.

                    DEUTSCH
          You made morning papers, Fink.

     Barton opens the paper. A headline reads: Writer Found 
     Headless in Chavez Ravine. The story has two pictures – a 
     studio publicity portrait of Mayhew, and a photograph of the 
     crime scene: two plainclothes detectives stare down into a 
     gulley as a uniformed cop restrains a pair of leashed dogs.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Second one of your friends to end up 
          dead.

                    DEUTSCH
          You didn't tell us you knew the dame.

     With a jerk of his thumb, Mastrionotti indicates the 
     bloodstained bed.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?

                    DEUTSCH
          Give you nose bleeds?

     Barton crosses the room and sits at the foot of the bed, 
     staring at the newspaper.

                    DEUTSCH
          Just tell me one thing, Fink: Where'd 
          you put their heads?

     Distractedly:

                    BARTON
          Charlie... Charlie's back...

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          No kidding, bright boy – we smelt 
          Mundt all over this. Was he the idea 
          man?

                    DEUTSCH
          Tell us where the heads are, maybe 
          they'll go easy on you.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          Only fry you once.

     Barton rubs his temples.

                    BARTON
          Could you come back later?  It's 
          just...  too hot... My head is killing 
          me.

                    DEUTSCH
          All right, forget the heads. Where's 
          Mundt, Fink?

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          He teach you to do it?

                    DEUTSCH
          You two have some sick sex thing?

                    BARTON
          Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          You're a sick fuck, Fink.

                    DEUTSCH
          All right, moron, you're under arrest.

     Barton seems oblivious to the two men.

                    BARTON
          Charlie's back. It's hot... He's 
          back.

     Down the hall we hear the ding of the arriving elevator.  

     Mastrionotti cocks his head with a quizzical look.

     He rises and walks slowly out into the hall. Deutsch wathces 
     him go.

     HIS POV

     Mastrionotti in the hallway in full shot, framed by the door, 
     still looking puzzled.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          ...Fred...

     Deutsch stands and pushes his suit coat back past the gun on 
     his hip, revealing a pair of handcuffs on his belt. He 
     unhitches the cuffs and slips one around Barton's right wrist 
     and the other around a loop in the wrought iron footboard of 
     the bed.

                    DEUTSCH
          Sit tight, Fink.

     THE HALLWAY

     As Deutsch joins Mastrionotti.

                    DEUTSCH
          Why's it so goddamn hot out here?

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          ...Fred...

     Deutsch looks where Mastrionotti is looking.

     THE WALL

     Tacky yellow fluid streams down. The walls are pouring sweat.  

     The hallway is quiet.

     MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

     They look at each other. They look down the hall.

     THEIR POV

     The elevator stands open at the far end of the empty hall.  

     For a long beat, nothing.

     Finally Pete, the elevator man, emerges.

     At this distance, he is a small figure, stumbling this way 
     and that, his hands presseed against the sides of his head.  

     He turns to face Mastrionotti and Deutsch and takes a few 
     steps forward, still clutching his head.

     MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

     Watching.

     PETE

     He takes on last step, then collapses.

     As he pitches forward his hands fall away from his head. His 
     head separates from his neck, hits the floor, and rolls away 
     from his body with a dull irregular trundle sound.

     MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

     Wide-eyed, they look at each other, then back down the hall.  

     All is quiet.

     THE HALLWAY

     Smoke is beginning to drift into the far end of the hall.  

     We hear a muted rumble.

     MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

     Mastrionotti tugs at his tie. He slowly unholsters his gun.  
     Deutsch slowly, hypnotically, follows suit.

                    DEUTSCH
          ... Show yourself, Mundt!

     More quiet.

     THE HALLWAY

     More smoke.

     LOW STEEP ANGLE ON ELEVATOR DOOR

     The crack where the floor of the elevator meets that of the 
     hall.

     It flickers with red light from below. Bottom-lit smoke sifts 
     up.

     CLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI

     Standing in the foreground, gun at ready. Sweat pours down 
     his face.

     Behind him, Deutsch stands nervously in the light-spill from 
     Barton's doorway.

     The rumble and crackle of fire grows louder.

     THE HALLWAY

     More smoke.

     PATCH OF WALL

     Sweating.

     A swath of wallpaper sags away from the top of the wall, 
     exposing glistening lath underneath.

     With a light airy pop, the lathwork catches on fire.

     MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

     Sweating.

                    DEUTSCH
          ...Mundt!

     THEIR POV

     The hallway. Its end-facing-wall slowly spreads flame from 
     where the wallpaper droops.

     LOW STEEP ANGLE ON ELEVATOR DOOR

     More red bottom-lit smoke seeps up from the crack between 
     elevator and hallway floors.

     With a groan of tension relieved cables and a swaying of the 
     elevator door, a pair of feet crosses the threshold into the 
     doorway.

     JUMPING BACK

     Wide on the hallway. Charlie Meadows has emerged from the 
     elevator and is hellishly backlit by the flame.

     His suit coat hangs open. His hat is pushed back on his head. 
     From his right hand his briefcase dangles.

     He stands motionless, facing us. There is something monumental 
     in his posture, shoulders thrown back.

     MASTRIONOTTI

     Tensed. Behind him, Deutsch gulps.

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          There's a boy, Mundt. Put the policy 
          case down and your mitts in the air.

     CHARLIE

     He leans slowly down to put the briefcase on the floor.

     CLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI

     Relax. He murmurs:

                    MASTRIONOTTI
          He's complying.

     BACK TO CHARLIE

     He straightens up from the briefcase, a sawed-off shotgun in 
     his hands.

     BOOM! The shotgun spits fire.

     Mastrionotti's face is peppered by buckshot and he is blown 
     back down the hallway into Deutsch.

     Bellowing fills the hallway over the roar of the fire:

                    CHARLIE
          LOOK UPON ME! LOOK UPON ME! I'LL 
          SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!!

     THE HALLWAY

     The fire starts racing down the hallway.

     CLOSE STEEP ANGLE ON PATCH OF WALL

     Fire races along the wall-sweat goopus.

     TRACK IN ON DEUTSCH

     His eyes widen at Charlie and the approaching fire; his gun 
     dangles forgotten from his right hand.

     HIS POV

     Charlie is charging down the hallway, holding his shotgun 
     loosely in front of his chest, in double-time position. The 
     fire races along with him.

     He is bellowing:

                    CHARLIE
          LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE 
          OF THE MIND! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE 
          OF THE MIND!

     DEUTSCH

     Terrified, he turns and runs.

     REVERSE PULLING DEUTSCH

     As he runs down the flaming hallway, pursued by flames, smoke, 
     and Karl Mundt – who, also on the run, levels his shotgun.

     BOOM!

     PUSHING DEUTSCH

     His legs and feet spout blood, paddle futilely at the air, 
     then come down in a twisting wobble, like a car on blown 
     tires, and pitch him helplessly to the floor.

     PULLING CHARLIE

     He slows to a trot and cracks open the shotgun.

     PUSHING DEUTSCH

     Weeping and dragging himself forward on his elbows.

     PULLING CHARLIE

     He slows to a walk.

     BARTON'S ROOM

     Barton strains at his handcuffs.

     HIS POV

     Through the open doorway we see Charlie pass, pushing two 
     shells into his shotgun.

     PULLING DEUTSCH

     Charlie looms behind him and – THWACK – snaps the shotgun 
     closed.

     Deutsch rolls over to rest on his elbows, facing Charlie.  

     Charlie primes the shotgun – CLACK.

     He presses both barrels against the bridge of Deutsh's nose.

                    CHARLIE
          Heil Hitler.

     DEUTSCH

     Screams.

     CHARLIE

     Tightens a finger over both triggers. He squeezes.

     BLAM!

     TRACK IN ON BARTON

     He flinches.

     The gunshot echoes away.

     Barton strains at the handcuffs.

     We hear Charlie's footsteps approach – slowly, heavily.

     THE DOORWAY

     Charlie, walking down the hall, glances in and seems mildly 
     surprised to see Barton. The set of his jaw relaxes. His 
     expression softens. He pushes his hat farther back on his 
     head.

                    CHARLIE
          Barton!

     He shakes is head and whistles.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Brother, is it hot.

     He walks into the room.

     BARTON'S ROOM

     As Charlie wearily enters.

                    CHARLIE
          How you been, buddy?

     He props the shotgun in a corner and sits facing Barton, who 
     stared at him.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Don't look at me like that, 
          neighbor.  It's just me – Charlie.

                    BARTON
          I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.

     Charlie reaches a flask from his pocket.

                    CHARLIE
          Jesus, people can be cruel...

     He takes a long draught from his flask, then gives a haunted 
     stare.

                    CHARLIE
          ...if it's not my build, it's my 
          personality.

     Charlie is perspiring heavily. The fire rumbles in the 
     hallway.

                    CHARLIE
          ...They say I'm a madman, Barton, 
          but I'm not mad at anyone. Honest 
          I'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry 
          for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to 
          think about what they're going 
          through. How trapped they are. I 
          understand it. I feel for 'em. So I 
          try and help them out...

     He reached up to loosen his tie and pop his collar button.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels 
          like, when things get all balled up 
          at the head office. It puts you 
          through hell, Barton. So I help people 
          out. I just wish someone would do as 
          much for me...

     He stares miserably down at his feet.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Jesus it's hot. Sometimes it gets 
          so hot, I wanna crawl right out of 
          my skin.

     Self-pity:

                    BARTON
          But Charlie – why me? Why –

                    CHARLIE
          Because you DON'T LISTEN!

     A tacky yellow fluid is dripping from Charlie's left ear and 
     running down his cheek.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Jesus, I'm dripping again.

     He pulls some cotton from his pocket and plugs his ear.

                    CHARLIE
          ...C'mon Barton, you think you know 
          about pain? You think I made your 
          life hell?  Take a look around this 
          dump. You're just a tourist with a 
          typewriter, Barton. I live here. 
          Don't you understand that...

     His voice is becoming choked.

                    CHARLIE
          ...And you come into MY home... And 
          you complain that I'M making too... 
          much... noise.

     He looks up at Barton.

     There is a long silence.

     Finally:

                    BARTON
          ...I'm sorry.

     Wearily:

                    CHARLIE
          Don't be.

     He rises to his feet and kneels in front of Barton at the 
     foot of the bed.

     The two men regard each other.

     Charlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame, still staring 
     at Barton. His muscles tighten, though nothing moves. His 
     neck fans with effort. All of his muscles tense.  His face 
     is a reddening grimace.

     With a shriek of protest, the metal gives. The bar to which 
     Barton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and Barton 
     slides the cuff off it, free.

     Charlie gets to his feet.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm getting off the merry-go-round.

     He takes his shotgun and walks to the door.

                    CHARLIE
          ...I'll be next door if you need me.

     A thought stops him at the door and he turns to face Barton.  
     Behind him the hallway blazes.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Oh, I dropped in on your folks. 
          And Uncle Dave?

     He smiles. Barton looks at him dumbly.

                    CHARLIE
          ...Good people. By the way, that 
          package I gave you? I lied. It isn't 
          mine.

     He leaves.

     Barton rises, picks up Charlie's parcel, and his script.

     THE HALLWAY

     As Barton emerges. Flames lick the walls, causing the 
     wallpaper to run with the tack glue sap. Smoke fills the 
     hallway. Barton looks down the hall.

     HIS POV

     Charlie stands in front of the door to his room, his briefcase 
     dangling from one hand, his other hand fumbling in his pocket 
     for his key.

     With his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders slumped 
     with fatigue, he could be any drummer returning to any hotel 
     after a long hard day on the road.

     He opens the door and goes into his room.

     BACK TO BARTON

     He turns and walks up the hallway, his script in one hand, 
     the parcel in the other.

     A horrible moaning sound – almost human – can be heard under 
     the roar of the fire.

     BLACKNESS

     STUDIO HALLWAY

     We are tracking laterally across the lobby of an executive 
     building. From offscreen we hear:

                    BARTON
          Fink! Morris or Lillian Fink! Eighty- 
          five Fulton Street!

     Filtered through phone:

                    OPERATOR
          I understand that, sir –

                    BARTON
          Or Uncle Dave!

     Our track has brought Barton into frame in the foreground, 
     unshaven, unkempt, bellowing into the telephone. In a hallway 
     in the background, a secretary gestures for Barton to hurry 
     up.

                    OPERATOR
          I understand that, sir, but there's 
          still no answer. Shall I check for 
          trouble on the line?

     Barton slams down the phone.

     LIPNIK'S OFFICE

     Barton enters, still clinging on to Charlie's parcel.

     Lou Breeze stands in one corner censoriously watching Barton.  
     Lipnik is at the far end of the room, gazing out the window.

                    LIPNIK
          Fink.

                    BARTON
          Mr. Lipnik.

                    LIPNIK
          Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.

     He turns to face Barton and we see that he is wearing a 
     smartly pressed uniform with a lot of fruit salad on the 
     chest.

                    LIPNIK
          ...Siddown.

     Barton takes a seat facing Lipnik's desk.

                    LIPNIK
          ...I was commissioned yesterday in 
          the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau 
          arranged it. He's a dear friend.

                    BARTON
          Congratulations.

                    LIPNIK
          Actually it hasn't officially gone 
          through yet. Had wardrobe whip this 
          up. You gotta pull teeth to get 
          anything done in this town. I can 
          understand a little red tape in 
          peacetime, but now it's all-out 
          warfare against the Japs. Little 
          yellow bastards.  They'd love to see 
          me sit this one out.

                    BARTON
          Yes sir, they –

                    LIPNIK
          Anyway, I had Lou read your script 
          for me.

     He taps distastefully at the script on his desk, which has a 
     slightly charred title page.

                    LIPNIK
          ...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't 
          wash.

                    BARTON
          With all due respect, sir, I think 
          it's the best work I've done.

                    LIPNIK
          Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion 
          mattered, then I guess I'd resign 
          and let YOU run the the studio. It 
          doesn't and you won't, and the 
          lunatics are not going to run THIS 
          particular asylum. So let's put a 
          stop to THAT rumor right now.

     Listlessly:

                    BARTON
          Yes sir.

                    LIPNIK
          I had to call Beery this morning, 
          let him know we were pushing the 
          picture back.  After all I'd told 
          him about quality, about that Barton 
          Fink feeling. How disappointed we 
          were. Wally was heartbroken. The man 
          was devastated. He was – well, I 
          didn't actually call him, Lou did. 
          But that's a fair description, isn't 
          it Lou?

                    LOU
          Yes, Colonel.

                    LIPNIK
          Hell, I could take you through it 
          step by step, explain why your story 
          stinks, but I won't insult your 
          intelligence. Well all right, first 
          of all: This is a wrestling picture; 
          the audience wants to see action, 
          drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. 
          They don't wanna see a guy wrestling 
          with his soul – well, all right, a 
          little bit, for the critics – but 
          you make it the carrot that wags the 
          dog. Too much of it and they head 
          for exits and I don't blame 'em.  
          There's plenty of poetry right inside 
          that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten 
          Feet Square".

                    LOU
          "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".

                    LIPNIK
          Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". 
          These are big movies, Fink. About 
          big men, in tights – both physically 
          and mentally. But especially 
          physically. We don't put Wallace 
          Beery in some fruity movie about 
          suffering – I thought we were together 
          on that.

                    BARTON
          I'm sorry if I let you down.

                    LIPNIK
          You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. 
          We don't live or die by what you 
          scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler 
          down. He liked you. Trusted you. And 
          that's why he's gone. Fired.  That 
          guy had a heart as big as the 
          outdoors, and you fucked him. He 
          tried to convince me to fire you 
          too, but that would be too easy. No, 
          you're under contract and you're 
          gonna stay that way.  Anything you 
          write will be the property of Capitol 
          Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will 
          not produce anything you write. Not 
          until you grow up a little. You ain't 
          no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn 
          write-off.

                    BARTON
          I tried to show you something 
          beautiful.  Something about all of 
          US –

     This sets Lipnik off:

                    LIPNIK
          You arrogant sonofabitch!  You think 
          you're the only writer who can give 
          me that Barton Fink feeling?!  I got 
          twenty writers under contract that I 
          can ask for a Finktype thing from. 
          You swell-headed hypocrite!  You 
          just don't get it, do you?  You think 
          the whole world revolves inside 
          whatever rattles inside that little 
          kike head of yours. Get him outta my 
          sight, Lou. Make sure he stays in 
          town, though; he's still under 
          contract. I want you in town, Fink, 
          and outta my sight. Now get lost. 
          There's a war on.

     THE SURF

     Crashing against the Pacific shore.

     THE BEACH

     At midday, almost deserted. In the distance we see Barton 
     walking.

     The paper-wrapped parcel swings from the twine in his left 
     hand.

     BARTON

     He walks a few more paces and sits down on the sand, looking 
     out to see. His gaze shifts to one side.

     HIS POV

     Down the beach, a bathing beauty walks along the edge of the 
     water. She looks much like the picture on the wall in Barton's 
     hotel room.

     BARTON

     He stares, transfixed, at the woman.

     THE WOMAN

     Very beautiful, backlit by the sun, approaching.

     BARTON

     Following her with his eyes.

     THE WOMAN

     Her eyes meet Barton's. She says something, but her voice is 
     lost in the crash of the surf.

     Barton cups a hand to his ear.

                    BEAUTY
          I said it's a beautiful day...

                    BARTON
          Yes... It is...

                    BEAUTY
          What's in the box?

     Barton shrugs and shakes his head.

                    BARTON
          I don't know.

                    BEAUTY
          Isn't it yours?

                    BARTON
          I... I don't know...

     She nods and sits down on the sand several paces away from 
     him, facing the water but looking back over her shoulder at 
     Barton.

                    BARTON
          ...You're very beautiful. Are you in 
          pictures?

     She laughs.

                    BEAUTY
          Don't be silly.

     She turns away to look out at the sea.

     WIDER

     Facing the ocean. Barton sits in the middle foreground, back 
     to us, the box in the sand next to him.

     The bathing beauty sits, back to us, in the middle background.  
     The surf pounds.

     The sun sparkles off the water.

     THE END
