ULTRA SLO-MO
Bodies. Hardly distinguishable as bodies even. More like Blurs. Forms. Shadows. Falling. Thrashing. Colliding. A surrealistic, choreographed human demolition derby intermittently lit by pulsating strobes.
(All cloaked in pure mysterious SILENCE like some underwater ballet...

One of the SLO-MO BODIES in particular is singled out, spotlighted. A lean, pubescent KID with messy hair. His fair-skinned, nubile torso emerging as his ripped t-shirt gets more and more ripped (like practically torn off his body) in the swirling melee.
   
SUDDENLY
The action explodes into real-time 24fps FRENZY as eardum-pulverizing INDUSTRIAL-DEATH THUNDER obliterates the silence. It's the Apocalypse set to a disco beat. (And here is as good a place as any to mention the double-LP soundtrack composed by like Trent (NINE INCH NAILS) Reznor (or whoever)).
   
The Kid, JORDAN WHITE (17), is in the middle of a slamdancing pit - gyrating, whirling, fists flying, his "Life is Shit" t-shirt shredding in the sweaty firestorm.

int-THE SMOKECHOKED FRINGES.night
   
Off on the sidelines, hovering in the dim, noise-drowned recesses is AMY BLUE (18, a tiny raven-haired innocent beneath her hard, clad-in-goth-black image - like a teenage Anna Karina with an asymmetrical A-cut). Behind her, in the BG over the bar, a crude undergroundish sign declares "WELCOME TO HELL".
   
An unlit cigarette dangling from her ebony lips, Amy scowls (cutely) as she forages through her lunchbox/purse which is plastered with Cocteau Twins, Misfits, etc stickers.
   
   AMY

   
   

   Fuck.
   

   
Her rummaging grows more desperate.
   
   AMY

   
   

   Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...
   

   
PEANUT, a behemoth of a skinhead slathered with tattoos, approaches.
   
   PEANUT

   

   
   Hey Amy, got any crystal?
   

   
Amy looks at Peanut (he towers like a foot and a half above her), makes a gas face.
   
   AMY

   

   
   Fuck off
   

   
   PEANUT

   
   

   Shit, who pissed in your Fruit Loops?
   

   
   AMY

   
   
   Peanut, why don't you go passionately fuck yourself?

   

   
   PEANUT

   
   
   I can, y'know.
   


   
   AMY
(sneering)

   
   
   Yeah, I heard your dick is shaped like a banana.
   


   
   PEANUT

   
   
   It reaches spots you've never had touched before. Wanna take it for a test
spin?
   


   
   AMY

   
   
   I'd rather be shot point blank in the head.
   


   
PEANUT

   
   
   Amy, you're about as charming as a pus-encrusted herpes lesion. Anybody
ever told you that?
   


   
Amy makes another, uglier gas face, resumes searching through her lunchbox.

The song ends and Jordan, like a warrior staggering off the battlefield in a Kurosawa film, comes over. His pink, hairless nipples protruding from the remnants of his decimated shirt, he wraps an arm around Amy, kisses her sweetly on the cheek.
   
   AMY
(recoiling)

   
   

   Yuk, you're all sweaty.
   

   
   JORDAN
(unfazed by her bitchiness)

   
   

   Whatcha lookin' for?
   

   
   AMY

   
   
   My skull lighter. I swear, if it's gone, I'll slit my wrists.

   

   
   PEANUT

   
   
   Now that would be a great loss to the human race.
   


   
   AMY
(holding up her middle finger)

   
   
   Sit and spin.
   


   
   PEANUT
(to Jordan, ignoring her)

   
   
   Hey, Jordan. Y'know what the difference between a pussy and a cunt is?
   


   
Jordan shrugs.
   
   PEANUT
(glowering at Amy while delivering the punchline)

   
   
   A pussy is a nice, warm, comfortable place and a cunt is the person who

owns it.
   


Yukyukyukking it up, Peanut disappears into the dark recesses. Amy rolls her eyes.
   
   AMY

   
   
   That guy has the intelligence of a stool sample.

   

   
   JORDAN
(reaching into his pocket)

   
   
   He's OK.

   

   (takes out his own lighter, gallantly lights her cigarette)

   
   
   I think he's got brain damage. But he's OK.
   


   
Amy takes a deep, deep drag from her cig.
   
   AMY

   
   
   I cannot breathe.
   


   
   JORDAN
(full of affection)

   
   
   Maybe if you cut down to like ten packs a day...
   


   
   AMY

   
   
   I smoke because I'm hoping for an early death. Duh.
   


   (coughs a couple times)

   
   
   This place is so fucking boring I wish someone would burn it to the
ground.
   

   

   JORDAN
(another shrug)

   
   
   It's not that boring.
   

   

Amy blows out a tense stream of smoke.
   
   AMY

   
   
   Let's get the fuck out of here.
   

   

   JORDAN

   
   
   'K.
   

   
He looks at her (and we notice now as the seedy light strikes his face just so, how genuinely beautiful he is - with a face like an angel and infinitely dark eyes that you could just swim in forever...).
   

   JORDAN

   
   
   Wanna go to Heaven?
   

   
Amy takes another drag, shrugs indifferently.
   

   AMY

   
   
   I guess.

ext.HEAVEN-night

Token TRACKING SHOT across the local staked-out turf known as "Heaven" which resembles ruins leftover from the last A-Bomb test (in actuality it's the rotting, abandoned lot of a deceased drive-in theatre). Cars doing donuts. Dueling stereos blasting out competing trendy NOIZE. KIDS of all sizes, shapes and colors loitering, getting high, screwing, y'know, doing all that Rebellious Youth stuff.

We're TRAILING a NEONAZI-TYPE, no shirt, muscles, bitchin tattoos, a SNAKE draped over his shoulders like a mink stole, who zigzags through the flotsam and jetsam on his skateboard with MUSIC ("Sex On Wheelz" by THRILL KILL KULT or some such thing) cascading from his ghettoblaster.

The CAMERA comes to rest at an ultra-cool, faded sky-blue '70 Ford Torino with totally fogged-up windows.

int-TORINO.night
   
Steam condenses and forms droplets on the windshield. A shrunken head dangles from the rearview mirror and there's tons of weird gothic toys and knickknacks populating the dashboard.
   
We hear the OS panting and rustling of teen sex in progress.
   
   AMY (OS)


   
   
   Go ahead and stick it inside.
   

   
Shifting and struggling.
   
   AMY (OS)


   
   
   C'mon.
   

   
More moving around, repositioning.
   
   AMY (OS)


   
   
   Jordan, put your dick in me.
   

   
   JORDAN (OS)


   
   
   I'm tryin'...
   

   
There's a heavy sigh.
Finally, Jordan sits up (looking especially lovely in the diffuse backlight) in the passenger half of the immense frontseat.
   
   JORDAN

(staring out his window)

   
   
   I'm sorry. I just...
   

   
   AMY (OS)


   
   
   What?
   

   
Jordan stares out his window some more.
   
   JORDAN


   
   
   I'm afraid of catching AIDS.
   

   
   AMY (OS)


   
   
   But we're both virgins.
   

   
Jordan looks at her. Starts fishing through the glove compartment.
   
   JORDAN


   
   
   Where's the fuckin cigarettes?
   

   
Amy sits up into the frame (she's shirtless too) and removes a pack of Death cigarettes from under the visor on her side. She takes one, hands another to Jordan. Like a ritual, he lights her cig first, then his.
   
   JORDAN


   
   
   I dunno what it is, but I feel really weird tonight. Like something's gonna
happen.
   

   
   AMY

(inhaling a drag)

   
   
   Me too.
   

   
Jordan looks at her.
   

   JORDAN

   
   
   You hate me now, don't you?
   

   
Amy looks at him.
   

   AMY

   
   
   No. Dork.
   

   (she gives him a tender, reassuring kiss on the lips)

   
Jordan looks at Amy for a significant beat, his cigarette smoldering.
   
   JORDAN

   
   
   Hey, Amy...
   


   (his liquid eyes shimmering)

   
   
   Do you love me?
   

   

Amy looks at him.
   
   AMY

   
   
   Yeah. Totally.
   

   (drags on her cig)


   
   
   Why?
   

   
Jordan shrugs.
   
   JORDAN

(tracing designs in the moisture collected on his window)

   
   
   It's just "I love you" can mean a lot of things, like "You'll do till someone
better comes along", or "I can't describe how I really feel but I know I'm
supposed to say this", or "Shut up, I'm watchin' TV"...
   


   
Amy gives him a look.
   
   AMY

   
   
   Are you stoned?
   


   
They crack up.  Amy blows a trio of perfect smokerings.
   
   AMY

   
   
   I think sometimes this city is sucking away my soul. Like yesterday I was
stuck in this humongous traffic jam on the 405 freeway and I just couldn't

wait to get to the dead bodies lying there on the bloody asphalt. All I cared
about was getting out and moving again...
   

   
   JORDAN

   

   
   I know. I feel like a gerbil smothering in Richard Gere's butthole.
   

   
They young lovers' eyes meet as they wallow together in their Tortured Teen Sadness.
They kiss again, gently with their moist, pouty lips. Look at each other some more.
   
   AMY


   
   
   There just is no place for us in this world.
   

   
At that moment, a BODY is hurled against their windshield with such force it makes a loud, cracking THUD. A gang of four BIG GOONS clad in hideous retro-70s fashions (like Redd Kross on steroids) descend upon the Body, pummelling him with fists, brass knuckles, ninja sticks, etc.
   
   BIG GOON 1


   
   
   Wake up, cocksucker! It's time to DIE.
   

   
The Body rolls into a fetal ball, shielding himself from his attacker's blows and removing something from his left DocMarten... a SWITCHBLADE, which he lashes out in a vicious arc, badly slicing two of the Goons.
   
All of this happens so fast Amy and Jordan can only sit and stare.
   

There's JUMPCUT blood, confusion.
   
   AMY
(finally reacting)

   
   
   Hey! Get off my fuckin car!

   

   
She starts HONKING the horn which only adds to the chaos.
   
Then, before Amy and Jordan can blink, the Body materializes, like lightning in a bottle, inside the car, in the passenger seat, literally on Jordan's lap. And we get our first good look at XAVIER RED (22, intensely sexy, industrial haircut, his perfect face spattered with crimson blood spangles, and his eyes, electric blue enough normally, juiced up past overload given the circumstances). Locking the door behind him, he waves the red dripping knife at Amy and Jordan (who're still half-naked by the way), with more desperation than menace.
   
   XAVIER

   

   
   Pedal to the metal, sweetheart!
   

   
The two remaining Goons, whipped up into a murderous frenzy, POUND on the doors and windows of the Torino.
   
   AMY
(screaming at the Goons outside)


   
   
   You're denting my fucking car!
   

   
   XAVIER

(going absolutely insane)

   
   
   Yo, bitch, would you just GO??!
   

   
   JORDAN


   
   
   uh...Amy...
   

   
   AMY
(going alittle berserk herself)


   
   
   GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF MY CAR!!!!
   

   
She fires up the engine and REVS it with a very impressive, testosterone-charged ROAR.
   
   AMY

(muttering)

   
   
   Goddamnmotherfucking....
   

   

She stomps on the gas and tires SQUEALING, the Torino nearly mows down the hate-crazed Goons. The G-force sends Xavier tumbling into the backseat, causing him to accidentally cut himself on the leg with his knife.
   
   XAVIER

   
   
   ...fuck..!..

The Torino peels out of the garbage-strewn lot, leaving the Goons behind in the dust. As it speeds away, we SEE the car's tail end which is plastered with death, gloom and industrial stickers as well as one that proclaims "EAT SHIT AND DIE MOTHERFUCKER".

   What the fuck're you talking about? OW...
   

   (wincing in pain)

   

   
   This car is older than you and your jaibait boyfriend combined...
   

   
Amy turns to glare at him.
   
   AMY

   

   
   I love this car.
   

   (horrified)

   

   
   OhmyGOD, you're getting blood all over the upholstery!
   

   
   XAVIER

   
   

   Jesus, don't potty in your panties about it.
   

   
He starts wiping up the blood with the tail of his Revolting Cocks t-shirt.
   
   AMY

   
   

   Jordan, he is bleeding all over my upholstery!
   

   
   JORDAN

   

   
   It's OK Amy, he's cleanin' it up.
   

   
Jordan, hanging over the seat, gazes at the red stuff coming from Xavier's basket area.
   
   JORDAN

   

   
   You alright, man?
   

   
   XAVIER

   
   

   Sure. I'm totally into getting the fuck beat out of me and slicin' up my own fuckin leg...
   

   
   AMY

   
   
   You are really fuckin rude. Y'know that? You are really fuckin rude.

   

   
Xavier rolls his eyes and finding a rag, starts tying a makeshift bandage around his upper thigh.
   
   JORDAN

   
   
   Hey, that's my shirt.

   

   
   XAVIER
(looks at it)

   
   
   Oh... sorry

   It's cool. Go ahead, use it.

   That is so gross.

   

   
   ANDY

   
   
   So who were those guys back there anyway?

   

   
   XAVIER
(finally stopping the bleeding)

   
   
   Assholes. Dickheads. Fanatical Young Republicans.

   

   
Xavier pulls the bandage taut around his muscular leg and CLICKS his blade shut, sliding it back into its proper place inside his left Doc Marten. In the nocturnal blue luminescence of the backseat, we notice now just how mesmerizingly, almost supernaturally handsome he is, vibrating with dangerous sexuality and a tragic vulnerability. You can tell by looking into his fathomless eyes that he's had a totally fucked up, crazy couple decades on the planet.
   
He starts distractedly gazing out his window.

The Torino SCREECHES to a halt in the shadow of a gigantic, surreal, all-lit-up oil refinery which looms, spewing poison into the blackness like some menacing death factory.
   
Amy leaps out of the idling auto, holding the door open.
   
   AMY

   
   

   Get OUT of my fucking car!

(sticking his head out)

   
   

   C'mon, Amy. He didn't mean it. He's just jokin' around...

   Right X? Tell her...

   

   
Amy stands there, her breath forming clouds and her nipples hardening in the crispy night air.
   
   XAVIER
(sticking his head out too, his eyes all atwinkle)

   
   

   Yeah, Amy. Don't get your uterus all tied in a knot.
   

   
   AMY
(practically poking Xavier's eye out with her finger)

   
   

   Listen, gism-breath. I want you out of my car right this fucking
second.
   

   
   XAVIER
(to Jordan)


   
   
   Is she always this aggressive, Jordo?
   

   
Jordan doesn't even have time to reply before Amy grabs Xavier by his t-shirt collar. They're face-to-face in an intensely tight CU.
   
   AMY


   
   
   I'm not kidding, Scumfuck. Get. Lost.
   

   
They have a long stare-off, their faces so close they're practically kissing...
Xavier takes this opportunity to lick his upper lip (the tip of his tongue barely grazes Amy's lips in the process).
Then, as he sumptuously bites his thick lower lip, a smile, so sexy it's actually scary, creeps over his face.
   

   XAVIER

   
   
   You're, uh, giving me an erection.
   

   
   AMY


   
   
   You're repugnant.
   

   
Xavier's only response to Amy's fury is a bigger, more sinister smile (like he's either on drugs or just plain fucking crazy...).
   
   XAVIER


   
   
   OK, Miss America. You win...
   

   
(looks heavenward)

   

   
   Beam me up, Scotty.
   

   
He and Amy retreat, disappearing off opposite sides of the frame, leaving Jordan's RACK-FOCUSED face in the BG center.
   
   XAVIER
(to Jordan as he exits)


   
   
   Later, gator.
   

   
He gets out of the car.
   
   JORDAN


   
   
   Hey, what about my shirt?
   

   
Xavier looks down at the blood-soaked rag wrapped around his thigh.
Smiling, he removes it and tosses it back to Jordan who catches it in mid-air.
   
   JORDAN


   
   
   Thanks, X.
   

   
He slips the still-warm, moist, red-stained thing back on over his lean torso.
   
   XAVIER


   
   
   My pleasure, Nutlicker.
   

   
Without a word, Amy marches back to the car, steps in and SLAMS the door shut.
Xavier leans over toward her window and looks into her eyes with sincere
   
   XAVIER

(beaming)

   
   
   Will you marry me?
   

   
Amy makes a face full of hate and tromps on the gas pedal.

The Torino tears off into the night, with Jordan waving goodbye forlornly from his window.

Jordan can tell she's not exactly in the mood for a discussion (they've been going out for a long time after all (three months), and hey, he's a sensitive guy).
He changes the subject.

Gross CU
Bright fuchsia raspberry slushie oozing plasmalike out of the stainless steel dispenser.
   

Smacking his lips, Jordan finishes filling his extra-large sportsbottle and licks the excess slushie gobs from the lid with his pink tongue.
He plunks his drink down on the "food area" counter next to his three SuperJumbo footlong hotdogs which are piled obscenely high with relish, ketchup, onions, etc.
It's an aesthetic/gastronomical nightmare.

   CLERK (OS)


   
   
   Hey. No smoking in store, girlie.
   

   
Amy turns to find the CLERK, a vile-looking Vietnamese guy with a Coors cap on, leering at her.
Behind him, his three Kewpie Doll KIDS sit in a row, totally decked out in Ninja Turtles merchandise, staring transfixed at an ultraviolent shoot-em-up COP SHOW on a tiny portable TV.
   
   AMY

(it really has been a rough night)

   
   
   Jesus.
   

   
She demonstratively grinds her cig out on the upturned sole of her pointy black goth boot then defiantly drops the butt to the filthy linoleum.
The Clerk sneers.
   

   CLERK

   
   
   Pick up... girlie.
   

   
Amy rolls her eyes, makes a belligerent (but cute) face.
   

   AMY

   
   
   Eat my fuck.
   

   
   JORDAN

(wanting to avoid a scene)

   
   
   Amy...
   

   
Casually, without fanfare, the Clerk pulls out a SAWED-OFF 12 GAUGE from behind the counter, points it at Amy and Jordan.
   

   JORDAN

   
   
   holy shit.
   

   
   CLERK


   
   
   Pick up, girlie.
   

   
(The Kids behind him are still totally oblivious. Actually, one of them, a little girl, looks up at her father nonchalantly - like this happens every night - and returns her attention to the TV.)
   
   AMY

(with a sour expression, like she's smelled something bad)

   
   
   I'm so sure.
   

   

She bends over, retrieving the butt (and the Clerk gets a gross thrill watching her nubile form straining at the seams of her tight, all black outfit).
Then crosses to the trashcan and theatrically disposes of the incriminating butt.
   
   AMY
(mega-smug smile)

   
   
   We happy?
   


   
The Clerk nods, still holding his mighty gun on Amy while he rings up Jordan's titanic midnight snack.
   
   CLERK

   
   
   That be six dollar, sixtysix cents.
   


   
Anxious to get out of there, Jordan fishes through the pockets of his baggy levis.
   
   JORDAN
(puzzled)

   
   
   huh. That's weird. Must've fallen out in the car...

   

   
He looks towards Amy who rolls her eyes and sighs, annoyed.
   
   JORDAN

   
   
   I'll pay you right back...

   

   
Amy doesn't want to hear about it. She reaches into the inside pocket of her huge, thrashed leatherjacket.
Searches for a minute... Then looks up at Jordan. The lightbulb of realization goes on simultaneously for both of them.
   

   
   
   JORDAN
   

   AMY

(like a crazy singsong mantra)

   
   

   Six dollar, sixtysix cents.
   

   
Jordan looks at Amy. Amy looks at Jordan (Like this is another fine mess...).
   
There's the CA-CHUK of the shotgun being cocked as the Clerk levels the barrel right at them.
   
   AMY

   

   
   You fuckin kook. We left our wallets in the car. Let me just run out and--
   

   
Amy's movement towards the door gets the gun aggressively aimed between her eyes.
The Clerk shakes his head. Nuh uh. (It becomes clear that he gets some kind of kinky satisfaction from holding our teens, especially ripe passion flower Amy, at bay.)
   
   CLERK

   Six dollar. Sixtysix cents.

(furious to the Clerk)
   

   

   
   What're you gonna do, shoot us? Imean, what is this, some kind of joke -
like "Candid Camera" or something?
   

   
The Clerk makes no reply, only continuing to squint at Amy over the barrel of his raised gun...
   

SUDDENLY
in an arty ULTRA SLO-MO BLUR, a Figure bursts in from nowhere, tackling the evil Clerk.
The shotgun goes of like a thunderclap, BLASTING the cigarette rack overhead, sending packs and stray cigs flying everywhere.
(This fracas actually causes the Kids to look up from the TV, but that's all they do: look up. They don't scream, run for cover, nothing...)
   
It's (who else?)
   
   XAVIER
(to the stunned Amy and Jordan)

   
   
   Scram.

   

   
In the ensuing commotion, Jordan drops his hotdog fiasco to the floor, upsidedown, SPLAT.
Amy runs for the door, scooping up a few packs of ciga on the way, while Jordan kipes a couple sixers of Bud from a nearby display (Imean, why not?).
   
The Clerk starts BABBLING in Vietnamese as his Kids just sit there watching, like a row of weird little robot monkeys.
   
   AMY
(to Xavier, flabbergasted)

   

   
   What the fuck d'you think you're doing?

   AMY


   
   
   Jordan, he is getting us into Deep Shit.
   

   
From the back storeroom, the Clerk's WIFE appears, wielding a LARGE MACHETE and likewise JABBERING in a foreign tongue.
(Wearing one of those big rice farmer hats and a black peasant blouse, she could pass for an extra from The Killing Fields.)
   

   WIFE

   
   
   EEEEEEEEEEEEEYAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!
   

   
The Wife takes a slice at Xavier and ends up imbedding the blade in the plastic cash register which starts BLEEPING uncontrollably as the drawer flies open.
   

   JORDAN
(getting a mite frantic)

   
   
   Would you guys get the hell out of here?!
   

   

   AMY

The Wife by now has joined the fracas, trying to pry Xavier off her husband.
(And the Kids are still just watching like it's an episode of their favorite TV show.)
   
   JORDAN
(dragging Amy towards the door)

   
   
   Come on.

   

   
Just then, a gunshot EXPLODES OS. BLOOD sprays everywhere in the vicinity - the chattering Wife, the VitaminPaks, the neon pink-and-green sunglasses display, the row of Kids sitting there staring...
   
And the Clerk's head (just his HEAD, or what's left of it anyway) lands with a sickening THUK in the condiment bin across the room, right in the middle of the relish, onions and jalapeno peppers.
   
Xavier is left hugging a decapitated, bloodspewing corpse. Behind him, the Wife gapes in horror, making unsettling, animalish HOWLING sounds. And the weird Kids just keep on staring.
   
Amy and Jordan stand there, dumbstruck, looking first at Xavier, then across the room at the head perched upright in the condiment...
It all seems like some insane, drug-induced hallucination.
   
Then crazily, it (the dismembered head) starts talking, emitting this guttural, unintelligible, scary-as-shit GIBBERISH (as well as a grody rivulet of oozy blood-juice).
   

Xavier, Amy and Jordan FREAK. Xavier drops the beheaded cadaver to the floor, and Amy and Jordan, petrified a second ago, now cannot scurry fast enough towards the door.
Xavier follows, pausing only to snatch some greenery (which is spattered with blood and brain bits) from the gaping open register.

Jordan goes over to the toilet. Undoes his jeans and takes a long, loud pee. The SOUND of it fills the
warm, moist space. Amy looks at Jordan. Jordan looks back at Amy. They're suspended there a minute:
him standing by the toilet, her dripping in the tub.
   
Everything - their confusion, teenage doubt, insecurity, fear, their goofy strange love - all that and more
flows silently between them like electrical current.
   
Not even bothering to stuff his still dribbling, semi-erect (though, of course, discretely OS) cock back
into his pants, Jordan goes over to Amy and sets his beer bottle down with a THUNK. The two lovers
begin passionately sucking face, becoming a pretzel of grabbing hands and intertangling limbs. As they
both work to rip Jordan's clothes off, Amy pulls her semi-naked boyfriend into the hot water and they
make insane, violent love: their hormone~charged, pentup emotion transformed into raw, obsessive
fucking. They're like two terrified animals slaughtering each other.

   Hold it, Sandy. Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't lots of people,
especially trendy teenagers following the latest "fad", kids who are
otherwise perfectly "normal", don't they wear earrings similar to the one
shown here?

   Yes, well, Chet, that is a problem...

XAVIER
blankly taking this all in like it's an acid flashback or something. Finally giving up on the media
vaudeville, he rolls off the bed.

HIS POV
of Amy and Jordan going at it in the tub. Trying, not very successfully, to contain their teen sex-whimpering.

BACK TO SCENE
Xavier is fascinated and enormously aroused by what he's seeing. CAMERA TILTS down following his hand as it delves into the dark recesses beneath the waistband of his torn levis. As he begins to stroke himself, the buttons of his worn fly start opening all by themselves.
   
CU
Tight on Xavier's enraptured face as we hear the OS rustle of his pants coming apart and slipping down...

SERIES OF SHOTS
Amy, Jordan and Xavier rapidly approaching orgasm, framed progressively tighter, tighter, tighter. The CUTS build in speed. rhythm and intensity, coming faster and faster until all three of them reach a wild, brutal simultaneous climax (with Amy and Jordan practically drowning each other in the process).
   
(After this strenuous bit of MONTAGE, the film calms down some, breathing easier, as both the compositions and the editorial pace relax...)

Xavier is left with a gooey mess on his hands. He goes to get something (his own discarded t-shirt) to
wipe himself with.

int-BATHROOM.night
   
Amy and Jordan are out of breath but at the same time, totally wired, trembling in the aftermath of their carnal knowledge. Amy leans back, letting her head tip into the warm water while Jordan sprawls over the edge of the white tub. He looks over at her and unable to restrain himself, bursts out laughing. Amy starts laughing too, submerging her whole head underwater.
   

Amy spits a mouth flil of water at Jordan which starts a huge splashing water fight (they're acting like the kids they never truly got the chance to be). In their horsing around, Jordan slips on the slick porcelain and KABONKS his head on the tiled rim.
   
   JORDAN

   
   
   SHIT. Owwww...
   

   

Blood begins flowing from his nose, red liquid trickling all over his hands, on Amy's nude body,
dripping into the tepid water. Amy is grossed out by the spectacle, but giggles at the same time.
   
   AMY

   
   
   Smooth move, ex-lax.
   

   

   JORDAN

   
   
   Oh, man...
   

   
   AMY


   
   
   Here. Pinch the bridge of your nose.
   

   
   JORDAN


   
   
   Huh?
   

   
   AMY
(reaching over to demonstrate)


   
   
   Pinch it. There...
   

   
SUDDENLY
The door is KICKED OPEN, causing both Amy and Jordan to just about jump out of their wet, taut skin.
   

   XAVIER

   
   
   I'm so fuckin hungry I could eat my leg. How 'bout a little foodular action?
   

   
Amy and Jordan, stark naked, dripping water and blood, just look at Xavier who stands over them
grinning.
   

   XAVIER

   
   
   C'mon, you fornicators.
