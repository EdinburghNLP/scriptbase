FADE IN:
EXT. A JAIL IN MEXICO - DAY

It's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an 
unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder 
blocks. The camera pans with the OFFICER as he exits his car and 
walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue JAIL HOUSE. He is 
carrying a greasy bag of fast food.


INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY

The Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his 
PARTNER who is sitting at a desk. He grabs a tin cup and walks 
over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so CRIMINALS, from 
drunks to drug dealers are sleeping peacefully in their cell on 
Block A. The Officer rattles the tin cup between the entrance 
bar.


INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY

The inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit up. 
The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the block 
which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and one 
bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound of 
scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the 
cell. It is AZUL jottin ginto a business ledger while chatting on 
his cellular phone. His cell is equipped with a small desk and a 
refridgerator. He hangs up the phone and continues writing. 


INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY

The Officer with the tin cup sits in a couch across from his 
partner, who is now eating, and reads a magazine.


INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY

Azul picks up his phone and makes another call. He talks 
business. In the other cell, prisoners are getting up and looking 
around. Azul hangs up the phone and writes.


EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

A gorgeous, bikini-clad BABE struts slowly into a tighly framed 
glamour shot. She pauses, takes a deep breath, then dives a 
'perfect ten' dive into a house-side moat. She swims long, slow 
motion strokes around the moat as the camera tracks alonside her, 
lovingly admiring her tan lines and hydrodynamic build. She 
slides out of the water and walks up a cobble stone walk, 
dripping as she passes a seated GENTLEMAN in a white suit. His 
face is unrevealed. As she enters the house, he sets his drink 
down by a phone. He lifts up the receiver and dials. 


INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY

Azul's phone rings. He looks up at it, startled, as if no one has 
ever called him before. He glances at his watch, and then back at 
the phone, hesitating to answer it. He looks around the cell 
block as if someone might be playing a trick on him. Finally he 
answers it, pausing before saying hello. It is El Moco.

MOCO (V.O.)
Good morning, Azul. Do you know who this is?

AZUL
(into phone)
Moco... What the hell do you want after all these years?


EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

MOCO is sitting on his porch drinking tequila.

MOCO
(into phone)
We've got a lot to talk about. I'm just a few town away with a 
whole new gang. I heard you were nearby so I thought I'd give you 
a call, amigo.

AZUL (V.O)
That's sweet of you, asshole. I don't suppose you could get me 
out of there, and then maybe hand me over my share of money.

MOCO
(into phone)
Yes, I figured you'd want your money, my friend. That is why I 
have called you. I heard you were getting out soon, and figured I 
should deal with our situation. But do you really need me to help 
you get out? From what I hear, you're running quite a business 
out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men. It keeps you 
well protected I hear. Not a bad idea. I may try that myself 
sometime.

AZUL (V.O.)
I could stay in here and earn peanuts compared to what you owe me 
if I were to get out. So, yes, I want you to help me... my 
friend.

MOCO
(into phone)
Soon my friend, soon. I'm sending you some people in a few days 
to get you.

AZUL (V.O.)
Really? Well, that's more like it. Just like the Moco I used to 
know.

Azul is walking towards his window at the sound of a truck racing 
in.

MOCO
(into phone)
Just hang in there my friend. I won't forget that you have been a 
big part of our success. What's wrong. 


EXT. JAIL - DAY

A large truck drives up to the jail, parking beside the police 
car. Two tall, well-dressed MEN step out. They reach into the cab 
and pull out machine guns. They walk briskly towards the jail.


INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY

Azul walks to his toilet and stands on it to see out his barred 
window.

AZUL
(into phone)
There's something going on outside. Is this a double surprise? 
Are you getting me out today, Moco?

There is no response from Moco.


INT. JAIL - DAY

The Guard reading the magazine stands when he sees someone 
approaching the door.


EXT. JAIL - DAY

Close tracking shot of guns as Tall Men open the door and enter 
the jail.


INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY

Azul looks out of the jail cell suspiciously. Peering down the 
hall, he sees the guys with the guns. He hides behind the wall, 
peering out to see what happens next.


INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY

The Tall Men walk right up to the guard, and hand him a huge wad 
of money. The Guard tosses the money to his partner (still 
eating), then turns to unlock the block entrance bars.


INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY

Azul puts the receiver back up to his mouth.

AZUL
(into phone)
There are two men here with guns. Did you send them?


EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

Moco, glancing at his watch, hangs up.


INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY

Azul hangs up the phone and kicks his Bodyguard awake. The 
Bodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as Azul hides in a 
corner.


INT. TALL MEN IN HALL - DAY

The Tall Men walk steady and alert, ready to kill. They enter 
Azul's block and scope out the cells.

The Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun from 
under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the sink. He 
stands ready to fight.

The Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat cautious. 
They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he sticks the 
shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them before they can 
react. The shot one stumbles back into his buddy's arms. Azul's 
Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his cell door effortlessly, 
and walks out as if to greet them. The Tall Men hear the sound of 
the other cells opening, so they turn around. The other prisoners 
on the block begin exiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov 
cocktails. The Tall Man drops his gun. Finally, Azul exits his 
cell carrying his phone. The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into 
an empty cell, closing and locking the door.

Azul presses the #-button on his phone. Moco's phone number is 
automatically redialed. 

Moco answers.

AZUL
(into phone)
I'm still here, Moco. And so are your little friends. But not for 
long. They have something they want to scream to you. Listen 
close, because you're going to repeat it to me when I come to 
visit you.


INT. TALL MEN IN CELL - DAY

The cellmates throw their Molotov cocktails into the cell. Moco 
hears the men screaming as they burn to death. Azul is holding 
the phone at arm's length into the cell.


INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY

The Guards exchange glances when they hear the screaming, they 
smile and shrug, then go back to what they were doing. As Azul 
and his Bodyguards exit the block, the Guard with the magazine 
stands up as if to stop them, but Azul tosses him a wad of money 
and the guard sits back down to count it.


EXT. JAIL - DAY

A blue truck races towards the jail.

Azul exits the jail carrying a shotgun. His Bodyguards get inside 
the Tall Men's truck and start it. Azul waits patiently for his 
blue truck.

As the blue truck pulls up, two little rat-like VATOS exit the 
blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case. Azul tosses it onto 
the hood. The Bodyguards wave as they drive away. Azul waves 
back. He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of weaponry. Azul 
notices one piece is missing. One Rat quickly pulls the missing 
weapon from his jacket and replaces it in the case. Azul is 
unamused. He grabs his MAC-10 machine gun from the guitar case 
and aims it at the thieving Rat's head.

Suddenly, the Guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of money, 
as if complaining.

Azul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead. A few blasts later 
Azul and his rats pack up and go as the Guard twitches helplessly 
on the ground, still clutching the money in his bloody hand.


CREDIT SEQUENCE

EXT. AZUL / MARIACHI ON HIGHWAY - DAY

The blue truck barels down the highway and the camera pans with 
the truck as it passes a hitchhiker, MARIACHI, standing in the 
sun with a thumb in the air. The truck passes him up so he 
continues walking. Mariachi is carrying a guitar case in one hand 
and a black jacket in the other. He is wearing a white T-shirt, 
black pants. The camera pans to a sign that reads "ACUÑA 18 
miles".


EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Mariachi is walking around downtown Acuña. He notices a bar 
across the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on his 
jacket and crosses over to it. He stops to read a sign on the 
building that says "MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS ONLY". He prays 
silently to himself before confidently walking inside.


INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY

Mariachi enters the club, greeting the PATRONS as ge makes his 
way to the bar. No one seems to greet him back. He sits on a 
barstool near some OTHER DRINKERS, laying his guitar case down 
lovingly beneath his stool. He looks around the place, as if 
sizing it up.

BARTENDER
What do you want to drink?

MARIACHI
Refresco.

The other drinkers stare at him.

Glancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table-shaped 
object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room.

Sitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes. Mariachi 
is served his drink.

MARIACHI
No hay musica?

BARTENDER
(cleaning a glass)
Why?

MARIACHI
I'm a mariachi. A good one. I play beautiful ballads, old classic 
ballads, on an old-fashioned guitar.

BARTENDER
So what?

MARIACHI
I could add a little class to this place. I work for fairly 
cheap, I live mostly off tips. But I need steady work, and I can 
guarantee bringing in more customers.

BARTENDER
(nodding)
Tell me, why would I need one little guitar player when I've 
already got a full band?

Mariachi gives him a silent "what" look.

The BARTENDER motions to a YOUNG MAN sitting near the small 
draped table.

The Young Man removes the drape revealing a keyboard. Puts on his 
mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and rubs his 
fingers together (as if warming up for the big show). He hits a 
few switches in EXTREME CLOSEUP as...

... Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat.

The Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds like 
an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses another switch 
and a horn section swells to a crescendo and waltzes the familiar 
riffs. He adds the string and horns accents by banging on the 
keys. He sounds awful.

Mariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender who 
seems to enjoy it.

The Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down.

BARTENDER
(nodding with satisfaction)
There you see? Either I can pay one guy to sound like a full 
mariachi band...

Mariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his full 
drink. He looks disappointed.

BARTENDER
... or I could spend the same money only get one little guitar 
player... Understand?

MARIACHI
(walking away)
Thank you, sir.

BARTENDER
You want to earn a living? Get a real musical instrument.

The Bartender picks up the bottle of soda pop Mariachis left 
behind and offers it to the other men on the table. They say no, 
pay, and leave. The Bartender offers it to the MEAN DUDES at the 
table.

They all shake their heads no.

The Bartender shrugs and dumps it.


EXT. CORONA CLUB - DAY

Mariachi walks out and looks up and down the street. He decides 
to walk south.

As he walks down the sidewalk, the camera pans into a CLOSEUP of 
another guitar case that is moving towards the Corona Club. The 
camera falls back a little revealing the backside of Azul, 
dressed also in black. Azul walks into the bar.


INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY

Azul enters the bar, notices to his left the table with the four 
mean-looking Dudes, drinking and eating chips and salsa.

The oldest one, with his back to Azul, takes a sip from his mixed 
drink, then stands and excuses himself to the restroom.


INT. BATHROOM - OLD MEAN DUDE - DAY

The Old Mean Dude walks into the first stall and sits down.


INT. CORONA CLUB - AZUL - DAY

The three remaining Dudes notice Azul's guitar case. So does the 
Bartender. They all look at each other and laugh.

BARTENDER
(laughing and rolling his eyes)
What the hell is this, mariachi day? There is no work for you 
here!

Azul walks the mean Dude's table. Their laughing quiets down a 
bit as Azul stands before them. The Bartender stops smiling.

AZUL
Bartender... one beer.

The Bartender nods and grabs a frosty glass. He begins to fill up 
at the tap.

AZUL
(without looking at him)
In a bottle, wey.

Bartender stops filling the beer, stares at the half-full glass 
for a moment, then drinks the beer.

Azul is staring at the three Mean Dudes. They stare back.

The Bartender slaps the unopened bottle down at the counter.

BARTENDER
Ready.

Azul doesn't pay attention to him.

AZUL
I'm looking for an old friend of mine. His name is... Moco. Do 
you know where I can find him.

MAIN MEAN DUDE
You can sometimes find him here. He owns this place.

AZUL
So you know him?

MAIN MEAN DUDE
We work for him.

AZUL
That's too bad.

Azul turns to the mean Dude sitting to his left, and places the 
guitar in his hands. The Mean Dude is confused.

AZUL
Hold it please.

Azul opens the case and pulls out the MAC-10. The other two Mean 
Dudes are already reaching for their pistols.

The Bartender ducks beneath the counter.

Azul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the 
other is holding the case in shock). Their chests explode, 
causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly everywhere. 
The Mean Dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear. He 
manages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes die a 
slow, bloody death. The barrel of the MAC-10 is smoking. Azul 
turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case. Azul aims his 
MAC-10 in the Dude's face. Still frozen holding the case, he 
spends his last moments looking down the gun's barrel.


INT. BATHROOM - DAY

The shots caused Old Mean Dude to peer out from his stall as the 
toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll across the 
floor. He now watches it roll as more shots ring out. He pulls up 
his pants and and walks toward the door slowly. He is sweating 
profusely. He slowly picks up the toilet paper, plotting his next 
move. It grows silent... He takes a deep breath and rushes out 
the door.


INT. CORONA CLUB MAIN ROOM - DAY

The Old Dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper in 
his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face.

The Bartender rises up from behind the counter.

The camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes. Their blood-bathed 
faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions. The camera 
continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding the guitar 
case. His face is a bloody pulp. The camera stops dollying to the 
old Dude's mixed drink. A hand is stirring it with a straw. The 
camera pans up the arm to reveal Azul, standing expressionless 
with his gun sling over his shoulder.

Shot at 16fps the Old Dude quickly drops the toilet paper and 
runs back inside the bathroom.

Azul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another 
weapon. He grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm like 
a waiter, then casually follows the Old Dude into the bathroom.

The Bartenders glance at each other. One pours a shot glass full 
of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it. Shots ring out 
and the Bartender spills the drink over himself.

Without warning Azul bursts from the bathroom and walks calmly to 
his case. He replaces the weapon, picks up the case and leaves.

A few seconds pass before the bartender grabs the phone and 
furiously dials.

BARTENDER
(into phone)
Get me Moco!!!

The door bursts open as Azul reenters, storming to the bar.

The Bartender is so petrified he doesn't think to drop the phone.

Azul walks right up to the Bartender.

The Bartender shuts his eyes. The sound of the beer bottle 
popping open canbe heard, along with the sound of thirsty 
guzzling. The Bartender opens his eyes to Azul.

CLOSEUP of the empty bottle slamming to the counter.

The Bartender glances down at the bottle.

CLOSEUP of Azul tossing a few coins near the bottle as payment. 
Azul leaves.

A few seconds pass as the Bartender is standing there. You hear 
Moco yelling into the receiver asking what's going on.


EXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

Moco is on the porch trying to get the Bartender to answer him.

MOCO
(into phone)
WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE, ANSWER ME!!!


INT. CORONA CLUB - BARTENDER - DAY

You hear Moco's voice through the phone. The camera dollies into 
the Bartender as he screams into the receiver.

The camera dollies in to the corpses...


EXT. CORONA CLUB - AZUL - DAY

... and finally a low outdoor frontal tracking shot of Azul 
walking away smiling as the image fades out.


EXT. HOTEL COAHUILA - DAY

Low angle of Hotel Coahuila sign. MEAN DUDE #5 enters the frame 
as his beeper goes off. He runs into the Hotel Coahuila.


INT. HOTEL COAHUILA LOBBY - DAY

Mean Dude #5 enters the lobby where an OLD CLERK is sitting at 
the counter reading a yellowed newspaper. There is a pit bull on 
the floor beside him.

MEAN DUDE #5
Da me telefono.

VIEJO CLERK
(without looking)
Take it.

Mean Dude #5 grabs the phone and dials Moco's number. He glances 
down at the PIT BULL lying on the floor.

MEAN DUDE #5
Pit bull?

VIEJO CLERK
Yeah, pit bull.

The line is picked up and Mean Dude talks into the phone. He 
pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it on 
the counter. He begins jotting down four names. He then slowly 
crosses their names out.

MEAN DUDE #5
(into phone)
Dead?

The Viejo Clerk glances up from his paper. The Pit Bull also 
glances up.

MEAN DUDE #5
(into phone)
All of them? How long ago? OK, What does this guy look like?

Clerk goes back to reading his paper. Pit Bull is still paying 
attention, though.


EXT. HOTEL CAOHUILA - MARIACHI - DAY

Same low-angle shot of the outdoor sign displaying the name Hotel 
Coahuila. Mariachi walks into frame, and pulls out his wallet. 
Mariachi pulls out a few measly bucks then seems to be 
considering what to do next.


INT. HOTEL COAHUILA LOBBY - DAY

An inside shot looking out of the front glass reveals Mariachi 
looking at his wallet as Mean Dude talks to the phone. No one 
notices him.

MEAN DUDE #5
(into phone)
... carries a guitar case... And what was he wearing?... all 
black...

The Pit Bull turns and looks out of the window. Seeing Mariachi, 
he gets up and walks to it.


EXT. HOTEL COAHUILA - MARIACHI - DAY

Mariachi is putting his last few dollars back into his wallet. As 
he is walking away he notices the Pit Bull and he bends down for 
a closer look.

MEAN DUDE #5
(into phone)
Don't worry, Moco. We'll find him, and we'll mess him up real 
good.
(ad lib)


EXT. HOTEL COAHUILA - DAY

Low shot with long lens at full zoom of Mariachi tapping on 
glass.

CLOSEUP of dog responing.

CLOSEUP of Mariachi tapping.


INT. HOTEL COAHUILA LOBBY - DAY

Mean Dude hangsup the phone. He writes a few more things. He 
turns to leave.

MEAN DUDE #5
Gracias señor...

As he passes the camera you can see Mariachi still playing with 
the dog. Inside view CLOSEUP of Mariachi tapping on glass.

VIEJO CLERK
Callate, hombre!!!


SLOW MOTION SEQUENCE (?)

Mariachi looks up at the Clerk, then stands.

The Mean Dude turns around and looks and looks at the Clerk. 
Clerk turns to look at Mean Dude, who is walking back to the 
counter.

Mariachi picks his guitar from the ground. He is in full view, 
but no one is looking at him.

MEAN DUDE #5
Viejo, if you see anyone new in town, carrying a guitar case, 
dressed in black... you can call this number, OK?

Mean Dude writes down a phone number and the description of Azul 
on a little card.

VIEJO CLERK
(nodding sarcastically)
And if I don't call, you'll kill me...

MEAN DUDE
(handing him the card)
No. I won't kill you... he will...

The sarcastic smile fades from the old man. Mean Dude walks away. 
The old man reads the card, then glances out the window. Mariachi 
is gone.


MARIACHI / MEAN DUDE #5 OUTSIDE HOTEL

Mariachi is turning a corner just as Mean Dude #5 exits the 
hotel. The Mean Dude walks off in the other direction.


EXT. BOYSTOWN SALOON DOMINO'S - DAY

Mariachi enters Domino's bar. DOMINO is waiting on a few bar bums 
that are nursing their jaws. Mariachi sits with them, asks for a 
refresco, He gets looks again. Domino serves him and he asks to 
see the owner. She says he's looking at the owner. He then asks 
her for work as a mariachi. She says she has no money to pay him. 
He looks arund the classy joint and knows she's lying (it turns 
out to be true, she has no money). When he asks how a girl can 
take care of herself in a town like this she stuffs a gun barrel 
in his mouth. He nurses his jaw, pays and leaves, as the others 
laugh.


MARIACHI CHECKS IN TO HOTEL - DAY

Mariachi enters the run-down lobby of the motel. The Viejo Clerk 
at the counter is reading his yellowed newspaper. Mariachi sees 
the Pit Bull laying by the counter.

MARIACHI
Pit bull.

VIEJO CLERK
Yeah, pit bull.

MARIACHI
I need a cheap room for a week, and I'd prefer to pay you in a 
few days, after I've found some work.

VIEJO CLERK
Sí, later...

MARIACHI
Thank you...

The Old Man hands Mariachi a key for the second floor.

MARIACHI
Thank you, friend.

As Mariachi walks away, the Clerk notices the guitar case and 
black clothes and he rereads the card Mean Dude left him.

VIEJO CLERK
(different tone of voice)
Uh, excuse me señor? I forgot, I need a small deposit...

Mariachi stops in his tracks. He turns back to the Clerk 
slowly... thinking.

MARIACHI
(walking back slowly)
You can trust me.

VIEJO CLERK
I am very sorry, señor. But... how much can you spare?

The dog is watching the event.

MARIACHI
(disappointed)
I've only got a few pesos... I plan on finding work in town.

VIEJO CLERK
(grabbing money)
Oh, that's enough for now, sir, thank you and... enjoy your stay.

The Clerk deposits the money, slams the register shut, and 
continues reading his yellow paper. Confused, Mariachi pockets 
his empty wallet and turns to find his room. The Clerk peeks over 
his paper, eyeing the guitar case as Mariachi goes. He hears the 
sound of Mariachi's footsteps trailing off. The old man drops the 
paper and bolts silently to the phone as he dials El Moco's phone 
number...


INT. MARIACHI'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Mariachi opens his room, tosses his guitar onto the bed and hangs 
his jacket in the closet. He has only his white T-shirt 
underneath. He glances above the bed to a plaque bearing a mace 
and two crossed swords. He checks out the shower and washes his 
face in the sink. He sits down on his bed. A few seconds later he 
drops back and lays there a minute before kicking the door shut. 
He tries to sleep.

The Old Clerk is talking on the phone to the bad guys. He hangs

town. He stands up.

VARIOUS SHOTS of the empty town with nothing and nobody.

rolls it to Mariachi.

like a speeding truck. Mariachi smiles at the boy.

They run to the room numbered 127 and cautiously stalk towards it

as...

Men kick open the door and burst into the room.

VIEJO CLERK
(pointing in Mariachi's direction)
Pendejos!!!

CLOSEUP of his feet as he lands, causing the register to burst

later the Mean Dudes run in, one jumps over the counter to see if 
he's there.

his face.

Camera dollies into the guitar case on Mariachi's bed.


EXT. DOWN THE BLOCK - DAY

Mariachi runs back in the direction of the hotel, but as he turns 
the corner he has to slow down for the Mean Dudes are everywhere. 
Each one has his gun out and is looking around for the man in 
black. Mariachi walks slowly, whistling and nodding to everyone 
as they pass. A few look suspiciously at him but continue 
searching. Mariachi ducks inside the hotel.


INT. HOTEL COAHUILA LOBBY - DAY

Mariachi enters the lobby and winks at the old Clerk who is 
standing over his open register in shock. His eyes widen when he 
sees Mariachi. He runs out of the hotel.

VIEJO CLERK
(screaming, pointing inside)
PENDEJOS!!!

Mariachi rushes in, grabs his jacket and puts it on. He grabs his 
guitar case and squeezes it tight, his eyes shut. Slow dolly into

mace, swining it around a few times. He feels secure, now. He 
turns to leave.


EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD - DAY

Mariachi rushes out the door, he looks down and sees the Mean 
Dudes entering the courtyard. He ducks his head back just as they 
look up to see him. Mariachi runs up a smal flight of steps, 
where he then tosses his guitar onto a balcony, which he then 
jumps over to himself.

The men rush up the steps shooting at the balcony. Bullets 
narrowly miss Mariachi as he climbs over the balcony to safety.


INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

Mariachi dashes down the hallway out onto a balcony. He sees no 
way down.


EXT. COURTYARD BALCONY - DAY

The Mean Dudes are climbing over the balcony like spiders. 
Mariachi runs back and slams his guitar into the first guy to 
make it over the balcony. His dummy falls down the stairs and 
over the narrow railing. The Dude splats on the ground in 
gruesome CLOSEUP.

The old man looks over at him as he dies, then turns back as if 
nothing happened. Mariachi bolts back down the hill.

Mariachi jumps onto another car and then down into the street.

Mean Dudes exit the hotel and chase him on foot while a few get 
in the truck and chase him. The truck takes a short cut.

Mariachi is running through the sidewalks and streets in front os 
curioso shops, jumping small carts and children and cars to 
escape the two men behind him. He enters a small cutoff where the 
truck tries to stop him by heading off. The bad guys stick their 
heads and guns out of their windows and laugh as they ready to 
shoot him. Mariachi, though, already having built momentum, runs 
right up the front of the trucks as the guys try to shoot him but 
not succeed in only shooting each other as he runs up and over 
the cab, into the bed, and onto the street. He swings his guitar 
case into another guy's groin and grabs is gun, reaiming it to 
shoot Mean Dude #5. Mariachi shoots him in the arm, and Mean Dude 
#5 drops his gun and cowers away in pain. Mariachi then turns the 
guy's gun on him and shoots him in the chest. Mariachi grabs his 
case and as Mean Dude #5 turns to get s look at him, all he sees 
is the case coming into his face. Mariachi heads back for 
Domino's.


INT. BOYSTOWN SALOON DOMINO'S - DAY

Mariachi stumbles through city streets, pausing against a 
telephone pole as he gazes at Domino's Saloon across the street.

Mariachi stumbles across, almost getting hit by a few cars, and 
drags himself into the saloon.


INT. AMADEUS - DAY

Mariachi staggers into Amadeus and washes his face in a fountain 
by the door. He makes his way to the bar as a patron pays and 
leaves.

DOMINO
What happened to you, Mariachi? Too much refresco?

MARIACHI
I just killed four guys.

Domino turns around and looks at Mariachi, wondering hard is he's 
joking. He lifts up a bloody hand, grabs a napkin, and then seems 
to ask permission with his eyes before wiping his hands clean.

DOMINO
Is it true?

Mariachi nods an ashamed yes.

Domino reaches for her gun under the counter.

The camera is on Mariachi when she brings it out and points at 
him.

MARIACHI
(exhausted)
Wait a minute... what's your name?

DOMINO
Domino.

MARIACHI
Wait a minute, Domino! It was self-defense.

She cocks the pistol.

MARIACHI
(frantic)
I'm new in town. I don't know everyone!!! I have no friends 
here... and no enemies.

DOMINO
(lowering the gun a bit)
Thieves?

MARIACHI
(nodding)
No way. They were well-dressed men. I checked into the cheapest 
hotel in town, no money, nothing of value, except this guitar and 
maybe this coat, which they could have taken when I left my room, 
but they didn't. They were only interested in killing me.

DOMINO
(lifting the gun back up)
So why do you come here? You want to get me killed?

MARIACHI
I need a place to stay until I figure this out. They've got me 
mixed up with someone else.

DOMINO
And you've never seen them before? Not even in another town?

MARIACHI
(long pause)
Are you saying they followed me, a mariachi, here? What for?

DOMINO
Maybe they hate your music.

Mariachi stares at her expressionless. She stares back at him.

DOMINO
Maybe you were singing in another town, they hated your voice, 
and now they're trying to kill you.

MARIACHI
Are you serious?

DOMINO
(nodding)
Yes.

She laughes.

MARIACHI
Are you going to help me, or am I gonna have to die on your 
porch?

DOMINO
I have a room upstairs. My room. Don't touch anything. I'll be up 
after awhile and we can call a friend of mine.

Mariachi shakes her hand.

MARIACHI
Thank you. I'll never forget this.

He tries to kiss her hand. She slides it away and effortlessly 
slaps him.

DOMINO
This way.

He follows her to a doorway revealing an unlit staircase. When he 
enters, the darkness swallows him as she shuts the door behind 
him.


INT. UPSTAIRS DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY

Mariachi enters a roomy, luxurious apartment above the main bar. 
There is a free-standing porcelain tub in the center of the room. 
Mariachi places his guitar halfway between the entrance and the 
tub. The camera is tracking backwards with him as he walks, 
making th room look endless. He removes his jacket as he makes 
his way to the tub. He drops his jacket onto the floor and gently 
climbs into the tub. The camera faces him as he settles back. The 
camera slowly dollies into him as he lays back, crosses his 
fingers, and gives a relaxed smile.


INT. AMADEUS - DAY

Domino is washing a glass. She the then remembers she has the gun 
in her waist belt, so she removes it and sticks it back under the 
counter. Wounded Mean Dude #5 comes in limping. She takes out a 
towel and drops it on the counter.

MEAN DUDE #5
Good morning, Domino.

DOMINO
What happened?

MEAN DUDE #5
Give me the phone. I have to call Moco.

She brings up the phone and sets it down where the cloth was. He 
picks up the cloth and wraps his arm with it.

MEAN DUDE #5
It's not as bad as it looks. Domino, has anyone come through 
here? A stranger, maybe?

DOMINO
This is a boder town. I get strangers all the time.

MEAN DUDE #5
Dressed all in black, carrying a guitar case?

DOMINO
No.

MEAN DUDE #5
Well, he shot me... and has killed ten of Moco's men... all in 
one day.

Domino looks a little upset. She slides the phone towards him a 
bit.

DOMINO
Aren't you gonna call your boss?

MEAN DUDE #5
(nodding)
I have to tell Moco that he got away again... So, you better give 
me a drink first.

Domino smiles and pours him half a beer mug with tequila. He 
laughs and drinks. As he's dialing, the camera is on Domino as 
she cleans up a few things, every once in a while glancing 
upstairs.

MEAN DUDE #5
(into phone)
Moco, he got away. Shot me in the arm. Killed La Palma. Pepino, 
Sunday. This guy is one slick maricon. Yeah. Also, I didn't get a 
look at him. So, unless he's still carrying that guitar around 
and hasn't changed clothes, I won't even spot him, and I don't 
think he'll be that obvious...

MOCO (V.O.)
Don't worry. If there's one thing I know, it's that he'll always 
wear black and he'll always carry that guitar with him. It's his 
signature. Besides, that's not a guitar he's carrying. It's a 
guitar case full of weapons. Find him.

Mean Dude hangs up and puts his head in his hands.

DOMINO
Que paso?

MEAN DUDE #5
I screwed up. The guy left his guitar case in the hotel room. We 
chased him out, but he came back for the case.

DOMINO
Maybe he loves his guitar. It's probably an antique.

MEAN DUDE #5
It wasn't a guitar. It was a guitar case full of weapons that he 
uses on his victims. Adios, I'm gonna take a nap. And thanks for 
the drink.

Mean Dude #5 stumbles as he tries to stand.

MEAN DUDE #5
If you see this guy, call us.

He is about to walk off with the bloody towel and he turns back 
pointing at it. She waves her hand at him, as if granting him 
permission to take it. She cleans his glass, and when he is gone 
she slams the glass down and runs for the stairs. A few seconds 
later she comes back into the bar, grabs the gun from under the 
counter and calls her assistant to watch the bar. He sees the gun 
and wonders what she's up to. She storms upstairs.


INT. DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY

Domino opens the door abruptly and finds Mariachi taking a bath. 
He bolts upright, pulls a towel up from the floor and sits frozen 
waiting for Domino's next move. She laughs and walks to the 
counter.

DOMINO
(friendly)
I thought I told you not to touch anything.

MARIACHI
Sorry. I needed to relax. I can...

DOMINO
(smiling)
No, it's alright, Finish up. Do you want shampoo?

MARIACHI
(laying back, closed eyes)
Yes, please.

Domino tunrs to a counter and her smile fades. She looks like she 
wants to rip Mariachi's throat out with her teeth. She puts the 
gun down on the counter. She finds an omnious-looking knife and 
then grabs a bottle of shampoo. She walks over to him, then pulls 
the knife up to his throat with one hand while grabbing his hair 
with the other. He opens his eyes wide. The shampoo hits the 
floor and begins to roll.

DOMINO
Who are you?!

MARIACHI
(choking)
I'm a musician!

The shampoo bottle rolls into the guitar case and stops. Domino 
sees this, and with her foot reaches out and pulls the case 
toward her.

DOMINO
What do you have in here? GUNS? KNIVES?

Mariachi tries to catch his breath, pausing before answering her 
as if wondering if all this is really happening.

MARIACHI
No! My guitar!

Domino slides her foot out of her shoe, and unsnaps one of the 
latches with her toe.

DOMINO
We'll see...

She unsnaps another. The latches snap loud and echo in the quiet 
room. Mariachi gasps as she tightens her grip.

DOMINO
You're very modest, Mariachi...

She squeezes his hair and unsnaps another latch.

DOMINO
(through gritted teeth)
You told me you killed four men, when you really killed seven. Or 
were they still breathing even you shot out their hearts?

Another latch snaps.

MARIACHI
(groing dizzy)
I'm a mariachi...

SNAP!

MARIACHI
... not a murderer...

SNAP!

DOMINO
Aren't you going to watch?

She lifts the lid with her foot. It seems an eternity before the 
case is fully open. Domino is looking into the case, but Mariachi 
is not. He knows what's in there.

MARIACHI
I told you... I am a musician.

Slow dolly into the case, which contains a white, well-kept 
classical guitar. Domino is seeing it, and for a moment she 
almost believes he is telling the truth.

She rushes to it, grabs the guitar and tosses it to Mariachi. He 
catches it, choking after she releases the blade. She is on the 
other side of the tub, now. She jams the knife down between 
Mariachi's legs. Mariachi's eyes bug.

DOMINO
Play it.

MARIACHI
(still choking)
W...w...what?

Domino shoves the knife in deeper and Mariachi grimaces horribly.

DOMINO
Play it, damnit, play something sweet!!!

Mariachi is sweating and his face is extremely red. He pauses for 
a long time before plucking an odd note. She squints as if she's 
caught him. But he eventually starts picking out a sweet little 
melody.

DOMINO
(growing impatient)
SING!

Mariachi starts to sing but chokes on the words. He starts over, 
playing a "Rancho Grande" sounding song with his own made up 
words.

MARIACHI
(in a high sweet voice)
What is this place?
That treats me like a murderer?
They've all got their heads up their butts...
Even this beautiful girl,
With a knife to my balls,
Should I kiss her or hit her...
Or both?

He finishes his song, bowing and thanking his imaginary audience. 
Domino is smiling. She pulls the knife slowly out of the water 
and wipes it off on her apron.

DOMINO
You're a mariachi, all right. And a good one.

Mariachi bows a solemn thank you.

MARIACHI
I think this is the best I've ever played. You... inspired me.

CLOSEUP of the knife.

She laughs.

MARIACHI
Hire me.

Domino looks at him with a silent "what?".

MARIACHI
I'm good. Hire me to play in your bar. I'll work mostly from 
tips. But, I need steady work.

DOMINO
I couldn't pay you. I have no money.

MARIACHI
This fancy place and you have no money?

DOMINO
It's the truth.

MARIACHI
I'll work for room and board, then. Please, I'm desperate.

DOMINO
(thinking)
Will I have to keep a knife at your balls to get you to play like 
that?

MARIACHI
(smiling)
Not if you're paying me room and board. Please... until I find a 
permanent job.

DOMINO
(thinking)
You won't find a permanent job in this town... but OK.

She gets up slowly, and turns to leave. Mariachi settles back, 
smiling triumphantly. Suddenly she darts around and slams the 
knife between his legs again with a furious look on her face. He 
bolts up out of this triumphant daze with a look of complete 
shock. She loosens up and laughs.

DOMINO
You're going to need a better sense of humor than that, if you're 
gonna work for me, kid.

She flings her knife aside. It sticks into a wall. She shrugs, 
smiles a beautiful smile, turns, and goes downstairs. Mariachi 
settles back down, closing his eyes. The knife slips out of the 
wall and clangs to the ground. Mariachi jumps again, rolls his 
eyes, and sinks underwater as the picture fades.


INT. AMADEUS - EVENING

Mariachi plays in Amadeus.


INT. AZUL'S HIDEOUT - DAY

Camera tracks past a pool table where TWO RATS are playing nine 
ball. They make a few shots, then the phone rings. The camera 
continues to track past a small table where Azul's guitar case 
lies open. Weapons adorn it, with each knife, each gun in its 
pocket, in its own place. The camera continues tracking to a 
dresser on which sits Azul's cellular phone. A delicate female 
hand lifts the receiver. The camera is now positioned above the 
bed as the GIRL answers the phone.

GIRL #1
(into phone)
Yes? One moment please...

He rolls over and wakes a GIRL sleeping beside her. Girl #2 takes 
the phone and passes it to a third GIRL as Girl #2 tries to wake 
Azul (he is sleeping between Girls #2 and #3.).

Girl #3 has the phone to her ear as if listening for background 
conversation.

The two Rats playing pool are staring longingly at the three 
Girls in Azul's bed. They look hungry and deprived. One hits the 
other, signaling it's his shot. While one shoots, the other 
watches.

Azul awakens and grabs the phone.

AZUL
(into phone)
Yeah.


EXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

Moco is sitting in his pool. A swimming WAITER is bringing him 
drinks.

MOCO
(into phone)
Amigo! I'm glad I've reached you! You've not answered all day. 
Killing ten of my men must have been very time consuming!

AZUL
(into phone)
Six.

MOCO
(into phone)
What?

AZUL
(into phone)
I've only killed six! You were always bad at maths, Moco. I guess 
that's why you never paid me half of the money. You thought it 
all belonged to you.

MOCO
(into phone)
I knew half was yours... I got greedy, my friend. It's my nature. 
But you!!! You are modest! You've killed ten of my men!! I know, 
because I'm having them buried in my yard right now. With my dogs 
and cats.

AZUL
(counting on his fingers, into phone)
I killed six. But don't bother counting so soon. The number will 
triple by tomorrow.

MOCO
(into phone)
I'm sorry things turned out this way. My friend. I got greedy. I 
should never have tried to kill you. It would have been cheaper 
for me to pay you. Now I've got to find ten new men.

AZUL
(into phone)
Six.

MOCO
(into phone)
Ten.

AZUL
(into phone)
I tell you what. You give me my money, and I won't kill any more 
of your men... And I won't kill you.

MOCO
(takes a sip, into phone)
No, it's too late for that. We're going to have to see this 
through.

AZUL
(into phone)
Just like the Moco I used to know. Still wearing white?

MOCO
(looking down at his clothes, into phone)
What do you think?

AZUL
(into phone)
I think you should change clothes. I'd hate to ruin a white suit 
with your stupid blood.

Azul hangs up. He gets dressed and leaves. The little Rats are 
about to follow, but one Rat walks over to get one look at the 
girls. The girls tease him, and when he tries to advance them, 
they pull guns and laugh as the Rat runs away.


INT. AMADEUS - DAY

Domino walks by with a trash can. Mariachi is sitting on a 
barstool.

MARIACHI
I need to get my money back from that hotel. I'll be right back.

DOMINO
Are you crazy? If you go anywhere with that jacket and that case 
you could be killed. Leave that stuff here.

Mariachi gets up and is about to get his guitar case from under 
the stool.

Mariachi leaves it under the stool and takes off the jacket.

MARIACHI
I never go anywhere without it. Take care of it.

Mariachi leaves. Domino drops the trash can and tells her 
assistant to watch the bar. She heads for the staircase.


INT. DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY

Domino walks out onto her balcony, peering down into the street.

POV shot of Mariachi walking through the street.

Domino turns and walks to the phone. She dials a number by heart 
and sits in a plush chair.


EXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

Moco answers the phone. Towel around his neck, wet hair.


INT. DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY

DOMINO
(dolly in slow, into phone)
Hi. It's Domino.

MOCO
(into phone)
I know who it is...
Dolly into Moco.
INT. HOTEL COAHUILA - DAY

The Clerk is reading a paper. He hears a noise and pulls it 
aside. Mariachi is standing at the counter smiling. The Clerk 
jumps in his seat, then after a few frozen seconds he sets down 
his paper and reaches for Mariachi's old room key.

Mariachi shakes his head "no", points to the register, and makes 
the money sign with his hand. The Clerk slowly moves over to the 
register. He depresses a few keys to open it. It won't open. He 
makes a gesture like it's stuck or something (he is not very 
convincing). He tries again and again; each time pretending to 
get more impatient.Mariachi glances down at the Pit Bull. The Pit 
Bull is eyeing Mariachi. Mariachi points to the Clerk as if he 
has an inside joke with the dog ("this guy..."). Mariachi climbs 
over the counter and stands next to the Clerk. The Clerk things 
Mariachi is a lunatic. Mariachi holds up a finger as if cueing 
the Clerk for a demonstration. Mariachi then leaps over the 
counter landing firmly back on the other side of the counter.

CLOSEUP of his feet landing hard, just as before.

The register opens. Mariachi shrugs, smiles, and reaches into the 
register, taking his money out himself. He counts it. After a 
brief consideration, he decides to leave the old man a tip. 
Mariachi waves a "good-bye" wave and dances out. The old man, 
still standing there with his arms outstretched as if he was 
robbed, dashes to the phone and calls Moco's men.


INT. AMADEUS - DAY

The bar Assistant is cleaning the bar. He walks over to grab a 
few glasses and when he returns, Azul is sitting at the barstool 
Mariachi was on earlier. The Assistant looks around, wondering 
where Azul appeared from.

ASSISTANT
Can I get something to drink or eat?

AZUL
One beer.

The Assistant grabs a mug and starts to fill it at the tap. He 
fills it halfway when...

AZUL
In a bottle, wey.

ASSISTANT
(laughs)
Sorry.

He grabs a bottle and hands it to Azul, then lifts the mug, 
toasts and drinks it straight down.

Azul drinks his straight down, too.

AZUL
(looking around)
Isn't there a girl that works here?

ASSISTANT
Yeah, she owns the place.

AZUL
(heading a few bills to the Assistant)
She owns it, now? Then she is Moco's girl?

ASSISTANT
(looking around)
So-so. She's onto this new musician.

Azul takes out a few more bills and hands them to the Assistant, 
and begins to stand up.

AZUL
Thank you.


EXT. STREET - DAY

a guitar case. Mariachi runs into the saloon.

Mariachi runs inside and checks to see if his case is still 
there. Domino comes downstairs.

MARIACHI
I just saw a guy with a guitar case like mine. It's him they 
want.

DOMINO
(to Assistant)
Did he say anything?

ASSISTANT
(nodding)
No, he just ordered a drink.

MARIACHI
I don't look anything like him...


EXT. STREET - DAY

Azul is walking to his truck when he turns to a corner and Mean 
Dude #4 sticks his gun in his face. Two more guns appear, pointed 
at the back of his head.

MEAN DUDE #10
Is this the guy?

MEAN DUDE #5
I'm not sure...


EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY

The two Rats are in the blue truck half a block away. One hits 
the other to look at what's happening to Azul.

They look at each other, start the truck and speed away.


EXT. STREET - DAY

MEAN DUDE #5
What's in the case?

AZUL
My guitar.

MEAN DUDE #5
Yeah? You're one of those old-time mariachis, huh?

AZUL
(pause)
Yes.

MEAN DUDE #5
OK, let's take a look.

Mean Dude #4 takes the case and lays it flat in Azul's palms.

MEAN DUDE #5
If it's a guitar like you say it is, we'll never bother you 
again...

Mean Dude #4 unsnaps two of the latches, SNAP SNAP.

MEAN DUDE #5
If it's not...

He unsnaps three more... SNAP... SNAP... SNAP!

MEAN DUDE #5
... then we'll spray paint this street with your brains.

He points the gun deep into Azul's face and cocks it. Azul closes 
his eyes. Mean Dude #5 lifts the lid. Azul hears a faint 
strumming sound, followed by the sound of the Mean Dude slamming 
the case shut. Azul opens his eyes. The Mean Dude resnaps the 
latches. SNAP... SNAP... SNAP-SNAP-SNAP!!!

MEAN DUDE #5
(walking away)
Sorry....

They walk away leaving Azul wondering what happened.


INT. AMADEUS - DAY

Domino, Mariachi, and Assistant are standing at the bar.

DOMINO
Look, as long as you don't carry the case around, they'll leave 
you alone. It's that guy they're after.

MARIACHI
(putting on his coat)
I better put this upstairs...

He grabs the case and begins to take it to the stairs, but he 
pauses for it feels different to him. He slowly looks down at it.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Azul watches the Mean Dudes go and when tey turn the corner he 
puts the case on the ground to open it.

The Mean Dudes are rounding the corner, but Mean Dude #5, who is 
last, snaps his fingers and motions to the others to keep quiet 
and to watch Azul


INT. AMADEUS - DAY

Mariachi shakes the case, and puts it on the counter as if to 
open it... but he doesn't need to check it. He knows it's not his 
guitar.

DOMINO
What's wrong?

Mariachi looks at her startled, then runs out of the bar with the 
case.

Mean Dudes are watching Azul unsnap his case.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Azul opens the lid, revealing Mariachi's guitar.


EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

That's him...

The Mean Dudes start walking towards Azul as the camera tracks 
back with them. Azul slams the case shut, wondering what the hell 
is going on. He looks up and notices the Mean Dudes walking 
towards him. He stands up and slowly walks in the other 
direction.


EXT. A BLOCK AWAY - DAY

Mariachi is running through the streets and onto the sidewalk.


EXT. STREET - DAY

The bad guys are pulling out their weapons.

Mariachi bolts around the corner. Now everyone is on the same 
sidewalk. Mariachi and Azul are on each end of the street with 
the Mean Dudes in between them.

Azul turns and sees Mariachi with his guitar case. Mean Dude #5 
turns and sees Mariachi, too.

MEAN DUDE #5
That's him...

The two other Mean Dudes exchange glances. Mean Dude #5 stalks 
after Mariachi, so the other two follow. Mariachi looks to Azul 
for help. Azul tips the imaginary hat to Mariachi and walks away.


EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY

Mariachi runs through the street almost getting hit. Bullets are 
flying as the Mean Dudes are firing at him as they run.


EXT. DEAD END - DAY

Mariachi leaps up over a few cars and ends up in a dead end. He 
turns around, drops the case on the ground and opens it. A 
million weapons seem to stare back at him when he opens it. He is 
frantic. He grabs a small gun, shakes it in his hand, doesn't 
like the feel. He tosses it back in.


EXT. STREET - DAY

The Mean Dudes are barreling down the street. One turns towards 
the dead end.


EXT. DEAD END - DAY

Mariachi pulls out the MAC-10 and blasts the first Mean Dude he 
sees. He grabs the case and runs out into the street, jumping 
onto a truck and blasting the other Mean Dude from up there. He 
sees Mean Dude #5 run away.

Mariachi comes off the truck and walks through the streets in 
slow motion. Peolple are staring at him as if he was Azul the 
killer. Mariachi walks straight to the bar. A BOY is bouncing a 
ball on one of the sidewalks.


INT. AZUL'S HIDEOUT - DAY

The camera dollies past the vacant pool table, and over to a Rat 
sitting in a chair, drinking a beer. The other Rat is pacing back 
and forth in front of the sitting Rat. Azul enters the room. 
Throwing his guitar case onto the pool table as a grand entrance 
gesture. The sitting Rat stands beside the pacing Rat.

RAT #1
I'm sorry we left...

RAT #2
... We didn't know what to do...

RAT #1
... We figured you could defend yourself!!!

Rat #2 nods in agreement. Azul unsnaps one of the latches. SNAP!

AZUL
You thought I could defend myself...

SNAP! SNAP!

AZUL
... against three armed men...

SNAP!

AZUL
... using this?

He opens the case and the guitar sparkles at them. The Rats 
exchange glances. They look at the guitar then back at Azul.

AZUL
My case got switched with some maricon mariachi!

RAT #1
Where is this mariachi?

AZUL
He's dead by now... So, I want you to go look for my case.

The two Rats are about to leave.

AZUL
Leave me a wepon.

Both Rats take out their guns. Azul takes Rat #2's gun.

AZUL
That was disloyal of you to leave me out there. You should be as 
loyal to me as you are to each other.

The Rats exchange glances, then aim their eyes back to the floor. 
Azul turns to Rat #2.

AZUL
Are you loyal?

RAT #2
(after glancing at Rat #1)
Yes.

AZUL
(to Rat #1)
Are you loyal?

RAT #2
Yes.

Azul gestures to Rat #2.

AZUL
Then shoot him.

Rat  #1 turns to Rat #2 who is in shock.

AZUL
You are loyal, are you not? SHOOT HIM. Or I shoot you.

Azul aims his gun at Rat #1, who immediately aims his gun at Rat 
#2. Rat #2 is sweating bullets. Rat #1 puts his gun down.

RAT #1
I can't.

AZUL
Why not?

RAT #1
You said we should be as loyal to you as we are to each other. I 
couldn't shoot him, for that would be as disloyal as shooting 
you.

Rat #2 glances back and forth between Rat #1 and Azul.

AZUL
Very good. Now go find my case.

Azul puts his gun down and motions the rats to leave. They leave. 
When they exit, Rat #1 turns to Rat #2 and snaps his fingers. Rat 
#2 shakes his hand. They leave.


INT. DOMINO'S LOFT - NIGHT

Domino is dabbing hydrogen peroxide onto a cotton swab. She 
applies it to Mariachi's body scars on his back. Mariachi has his 
eyes closed. He washes the blood from his face.

MARIACHI
Where were you when he came into the bar?

DOMINO
I was on the phone, talking to a friend that knows what's going 
on.

MARIACHI
Did you mention me?

DOMINO
No... He told me the man in black is Azul.

MARIACHI
If his name is Azul, why doesn't he wear blue?

DOMINO
I don't know... Anyway, he's killing the men of the town drug 
dealer. The dealer's name is Mauricio. But he's known as Moco.

MARIACHI
And Moco is sending these men to find Azul. So, why do they chase 
me?

DOMINO
They have never seen Azul... only Moco knows him. My friend says 
the description Moco gave his men was that he wears black, and 
carries a guitar case. Sounds like you, no?

MARIACHI
Couldn't you tell your friend that there are two people like that 
in his town? One is a killer, and one is a mariachi.

DOMINO
Only special people can talk to Moco. Besides, you've killed a 
few of his men, now. Your best option is to keep out of sight, 
stop wearing black, and to hide that stupid case until this is 
all over.


EXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

Mean Dude #5 comes in and approaches Moco.

MEAN DUDE #5
He got away... but I got a good look at him.

Moco takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth.

MEAN DUDE #5
Coca, Caca, Beto were killed.

Moco takes out a match.

MEAN DUDE #5
He won't get away again, Moco. I promise.

Moco lights his match across Mean Dude #5's face and lights his 
cigarette. Mean Dude #5 walks away, as Moco flicks his match at 
him in slow motion.


INT. DOMINO'S LOFT - NIGHT

Mariachi is about to lay on the floor. She tosses him a blanket.

MARIACHI
Are you always closed Monday nights, or did you close since I 
can't play my guitar tonight?

DOMINO
Mondays are my day off. Want to play a game?

MARIACHI
Sure.

The phone rings. Domino gets up to answer it. Mariachi reaches 
under his blanket for a small mirror and combs his hair, putting 
spit in his hair to slick it down. He quickly stashes the mirror.

DOMINO
(into phone)
Hello?

MOCO
(into phone)
Come see me.

DOMINO
(into phone)
I can't.

MOCO
(into phone)
Please.

Moco is sitting at a table playing cards.

DOMINO
(into phone)
I don't feel well. I've got to go.

MOCO
(into phone)
Have you ridden the bike?

DOMINO
(into phone)
No... I've got to go...

She hangs up.

MARIACHI
Boyfriend.

DOMINO
(quiet as if thinking)
No...

MARIACHI
I can't figure out something. You tell me you're poor. Poor 
family. Yet you've got this place.

DOMINO
(sighing)
This place is a gift.

MARIACHI
From who?

DOMINO
From Mauricio.

MARIACHI
From EL MOCO? The man trying to kill me?

DOMINO
He's not trying to kill you, his man had you confused with Azul.

MARIACHI
Same thing.

DOMINO
Look, you now how if you want to impress a girl, you send her 
flowers, candy, jewelry until you win her love?

MARIACHI
Yes.

DOMINO
If one present doesn't work, you keep sending bigger and better 
things until you win her or you're broke?

MARIACHI
Correct...

DOMINO
Well, Mauricio sent me flowers, then jewelry, then he gave me a 
job at his saloon, then he gave me the whole saloon... etc.

MARIACHI
He's still giving you things?

DOMINO
He'll never run out of money.

MARIACHI
And you accept it all? What's the last thing he sent you?

Domino walks over to the counter and picks up a key.

DOMINO
A motorcycle.

Mariachi laughs.

DOMINO
He wants me to ride out to his ranch when I've decided to be his. 
He thinks he's close to having me.

MARIACHI
Is he?

DOMINO
(pause)
He was.

She sits next to Mariachi.

DOMINO
Not anymore.

They kiss. She gets up and is about to turn off the lights.

MARIACHI
So, you really are from a poor family.

CLICK!

DOMINO
(in the dark)
I remember when I was growing up, we were so poor, that my 
brothers and sisters and I all slept on the same blanket 
stretched out across the floor. We had to sleep in a circle, with 
our fingers in each other's ears, to keep the bugs from crawling 
into them.

MARIACHI
(after a pause)
Ay, wey...

Domino laughs.


INT. AMADEUS - DAY

Domino hands Mariachi a wad of money.

Mariachi sees the money and looks up at her bewildered.

DOMINO
Here's a little bit I've saved. I want you to go get a new 
guitar.

Mariachi starts to put up his hand as if to refuse it.

DOMINO
Take it, stupid. I'm not saying go by the best one, just a 
temporary one so you can play again tonight.

Mariachi stops and thinks... He looks up at her questioningly, 
then he shrugs an "OK" and grabs the money and jogs out 
excitedly. Domino is smiling.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Mariachi walks down the sidewalk, passing curioso shops. The 
camera is low and zoomed in all the way. Mariachi stops by one of 
the window that has a guitar in the glass. He pulls his money and 
counts it. He stops after he notices someone's reflection in the 
window. He turns around and sees it is Mean Dude #5 right across 
the street. He meets up with another Mean Dude. They are standing 
right behind Mariachi. Mariachi is pretending to still look at 
the window. The Mean Dudes walk past Mariachi so Mariachi walks 
in the opposite direction. Mean Dude #5 stops and then turns 
around slowly. Far zoomed shot of Mariachi walking down the 
street with guys behind him. They start after him.

MEAN DUDE #5
That's him...

Tracking shot following Mariachi.

Tracking shot in front of Mean Dudes walking at Mariachi.

Mean Dude #5 pulls out a small walkie-talkie and calls his buddy 
in the truck a block away.

MEAN DUDE #5
(into walkie-talkie)
Loco, he's headed your way... black pants, white shirt.


IN A TRUCK DOWN THE STREET

LOCO starts the truck and starts driving slowly across the 
street. As he turns on the corner, Mariachi sees the truck and 
casually climbs inside and hides in the back. Mean Dude #5 turns 
the corner when whispers into walkie-talkie.

MEAN DUDE #5
(into walkie-talkie)
Where did he go, Loco?

LOCO
(laughs, into walkie-talkie)
He got in my truck.

Mean Dude #5 laughs.

MEAN DUDE #5
(into walkie-talkie)
Take him around the block.

Mean Dude #5 taps his buddy and they start running down the 
block.

Mariachi is in back the truck searching for a weapon. The truck 
stops. Mariachi rolls to the side and gently lifts his head.

POV Mariachi sees the two Mean Dudes walking at him. Mariachi 
turns and Loco is there to knock him in the face with the rifle 
butt. Mariachi falls into truck, blood trickling from his 
dizzying head. He tries to get up a bit, but Loco is in the truck 
now, and slams the rifle down into his face hard... Blackout.


DUSTY ROAD TO MOCO'S

Mariachi is unconcious in the back of Loco's truck. Mean Dude #5 
and other Mean Dudes are riding in back with Mariachi.


EXT. ROAD TO MOCO'S - DAY

The above scene intercuts back and forth with the arrival of 
Loco. Loco arrives at the gate, Mean Dude #5 opens the gate, they 
drive through. The truck is facing Moco so he can't see Mariachi 
yet. Mean Dude #5 closes the gate and walks over to the truck, 
opens the back door, and calls Moco over. Moco walks over to the 
truck and looks inside.


EXT. TRUCK - DAY

Mariachi is laying there unconcious, Moco puts his arm around 
Mean Dude #5, who is looking very proud, and Moco pulls out a 
cigarette and a match.

MOCO
That's not him.

Moco strikes the match behind Mean Dude #5's head. Mean Dude #5 
stops smiling.


INT. AMADEUS - DAY

Domino is waiting on customers. She glances at her watch. A few 
seconds later she glances at it again. She looks very worried.


INT. AZUL'S HIDEOUT - DAY

Azul's Rats burst into the hideout. FOUR GIRLS pop up over the 
partition with guns. The Rats stop in their tracks. The girls 
sigh a "oh, it's them" sigh and slink back to bed. Top shot of 
them trying to wake Azul. Azul wakes up and looks over the 
partition.

AZUL
Where's my case?

RAT #1
We couldn't find it.

RAT #2
We heard they caught you and were taking you to Moco's ranch.

RAT #1
... so we came to see if it was true.

Azul thinks a moment. He stands up.

AZUL
They caught the mariachi.

Azul dresses, smiling...


INT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

Mariachi is in a holding cell at the ranch. He twitches, finally 
waking up.

He sees a GUARD outside and finds a way to escape.

He grabs the guard's assault rifle and turns a corner. Two men 
grab him. He slams the butt of the rifle, knocking the wind and 
teeth out of BAD GUY #1, then he kicks down and breaks the shin 
bone of BAD GUY #2 who screams out in agony. Mariachi silences 
him by karate punching his throat. The Bad Guy gurgles and hits 
the ground.

Angle from the ground as Mariachi smashes the guy with is gun.

He crawls up a wall, trying to escape as quietly as he can. He 
sees TWO MORE MEN running towards him since they heard some 
noise. Mariachi aims his assault rifle at the blue Chevy parked 
behind him. He fires and it explodes.

Mariachi jumps Loco, gets him to drive him to the saloon. He also 
takes Loco's money.


EXT. BOYSTOWN SALOON - DAY

Azul walks into frame, looks around then proceeds into the bar.


INT. AMADEUS - DAY

Azul goes inside and finds Domino tending the bar.

DOMINO
What can I get you?

AZUL
One beer.

She grabs a bottle and slams it down on the counter unopened. He 
eyes her admirably and then pops the top with one hand.

He guzzles the drink, slamming it down empty.

DOMINO
Anything else?

AZUL
(nodding)
My guitar case.

DOMINO
Where's Mariachi?

AZUL
Where's my case?

DOMINO
Upstairs.

AZUL
Get it.

Domino grabs another beer for him and runs to get the case.

(In between this time, Mariachi escapes with Loco.)

She returns, slamming it to the floor.

AZUL
If you want your mariachi back, come with me.

DOMINO
Why will you help me?

AZUL
Because you know where Moco's ranch is... I don't.

Domino calls her Assistant.

AZUL
You help me, I'll help you.

DOMINO
Let's go.

They leave. The Assistant tends to the bar.


ROAD TO MOCO'S

They drive out to Moco's ranch in Azul's truck. Little do they 
know, they passed Loco's truck with Mariachi crouched in the 
passenger seat. He gets up after the truck passes. Mariachi 
didn't know it was Domino in Azul's truck or he could have turned 
around and kept her from going to Moco's ranch.

They arrive at the gate and het out of the truck.

DOMINO
(over the gate)
Mauricio!!

Azul grabs Domino and points a gun to her head. He whispers to 
her...

AZUL
Play along...

He kicks at the gate.

AZUL
Open the gate or she's dead!

The gate opens and we see Moco standing at a three-quarter 
stance, flanked with his men on both sides. Azul drags Domino in 
and faces her at Moco with a gun to her head.

MOCO
(to Domino)
I'm sorry he used you to get to me, Domino.

Azul cocks the pistol.

MOCO
Azul, let her go and you'll get your money.

AZUL
Moco, give me my money or I ruin your clothes with her blood.

Moco signals his men to get the money.

DOMINO
What have you done with Mariachi?

MOCO
Who?

DOMINO
The musician your men confused with Azul.

MOCO
(staring at her)
So that's why you were busy that night...

Azul is glancing between Domino and Moco.

MOCO
... you had that little monkey climbing all over you.

AZUL
Give me my money or I kill her NOW!!!

MOCO
After all I've done for you, this is how you treat me?

DOMINO
I never asked you for anything until now. Let Mariachi go.

Azul is anxious now.

AZUL
I swear I'll kill her!

MOCO
No you won't. I will.

Moco pulls out his gun and shoots her in the heart. She falls 
limp in Azul's arms. Azul tries hold her up, but she's dead. Azul 
rests her on the ground, looking down at her, wondering why it's 
all come to this.

AZUL
All I wanted was my rightful share. But you've got to kill 
everybody.

MOCO
You feel sorry for her, don't you? See, that's why you can't ever 
be as big as me.

Azul slowly looks at Moco.

MOCO
(aiming gun)
Because you have too much heart.

Moco shoots Azul in the heart. Azul had his hands to his side, 
and now he falls to his knees. Moco shoots him again, and Azul 
dies next to Domino.

Mean Dude #5 is exchanging glances with the others. No one seems 
to be on Moco's side.


EXT. NEAR SALOON - DAY

Mariachi is still in Loco's truck.

MARIACHI
Stop here.

Loco stops the truck and Mariachi gets out. Loco drives back when 
Mariachi motions for him to leave. Mariachi watches him go then 
dashes around the corner to the saloon.


INT. AMADEUS - DAY

Mariachi runs into the bar...

MARIACHI
Domino!!! We're leaving!!! Right now!!!

The Assistant rushes over to Mariachi.

ASSISTANT
She's gone.

MARIACHI
Where is she?

ASSISTANT
Looking for you.

Mariachi is about to race upstairs.

ASSISTANT
She gave the case back to that guy. She left with him to find 
you.

Mariachi tries to make sense of it all for a minute before 
grabbing the gun from under the counter and rushing upstairs.


INT. DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY

Mariachi grabs the key to the motorcycle and runs out. The 
motorcycle burns down the road.


MARIACHI ON THE ROAD TO MOCO'S

Mariachi barrels down the road on the motorcycle.


EXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

Moco is walking away from the bodies.

MOCO
Bring that musician out here so he can be reunited with my 
Domino.

Some men go to check.

Cut back and forth with Mariachi coming.

MEN
He's gone, sir.

MOCO
Find him!!

Mariachi rides through the semi-open gate... stopping at the 
bodies. He dismounts the bike and holds Domino.

He has the gun in the back of his pants. You can see it while his 
back is to the camera and men are approaching him. Moco comes for 
the show.

MOCO
(good shot)
So you're the little mariachi that came to town, killed my men, 
and stole my girl...

Mariachi slowly lifts his eyes to Moco.

MOCO
You are very talented.

Mariachi stands, hands up.

MOCO
I bet you play the guitarra real well, huh?

Mariachi says nothing.

MOCO
(raising gun)
Not anymore.

Moco fires into Mariachi's left hand. Mariachi grimaces, 
crumbling to the floor. He keeps a tight grip on his hand. When 
he opens his hand to see the damage, the camera can see right 
through his hand for a reverse shot of his face through the hole.

MOCO
Now get the hell off my property and take your hand with you!!!

Moco is laughing and looking at his men for support, but no one 
else laughs. Mariachi tries to stand, but he falls back. When he 
rises again he has the gun in his hand. He shoots Moco in the 
chest. Moco falls back and hits the ground hard. He gasps for 
air...

Moco's men gather around him. Mean Dude #5 crouches down to check 
Moco's throat pulse. Moco's dead. Mean Dude #5 strikes a match 
across Moco's face and lights up a cigarette. He turns and walks 
away. The others follow.

Mariachi wraps a tourniquet on his arm, kisses Domino, opens 
Azul's case, sees the weapons, and rides off with it.


MARIACHI ON THE ROAD

He looks back at the town behind him, then places his hand on the 
motorcycle to drive off. We notice the metal brace on his hand.

Mariachi rides into the sunset road. He speeds pas a sign: "ACUÑA 
18 miles"

"Coming soon
EL MARIACHI II"

FADE OUT
