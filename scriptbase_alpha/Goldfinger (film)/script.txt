(transcript)

GUN BARREL LOGO

An animated white dot moves in from frame-left and centres on
frame-right.  Iris veins surround the dot to fill the frame.  A MAN
enters the dot walking from right to left, the iris moving to
centre-frame with him.  He jumps to face f.g., pointing a gun and
shooting.  Red colour falls in f.g. from the top of the frame.  The iris
wanders then starts to fall to bottom-frame.  The iris and man fade out
and the dot gets smaller.

				IRIS CUTS OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. RAMIREZ' WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

In a very LONG SHOT, TWO GUARDS patrol past enormous oil storage tanks. 
PULL BACK to reveal an outer rock wall.  It obscures the men.  CRANE
DOWN to reveal a harbour.  A seagull swims by in f.g.

CLOSE SHOT - THE SEAGULL

rises out of the water revealing Bond in a black diving suit.  The
seagull is a decoy atop his head.  Bond grips the bottom rung of a
ladder.

WIDER SHOT - BOND

tears his headgear off and tosses it behind him.  It lands in the water.

ON THE QUAY

Bond, wearing a backpack, walks to the wall and points a Very pistol at
its top.

He fires the pistol.  A rope flies over the top of the wall.

A GUARD

hears a cracking sound and looks back.

A GRAPPLING HOOK

at the end of the rope snags the inside of the wall.

THE GUARD

walks forward, feeling for his gun.  Suddenly Bond jumps on him from
above.  TILT DOWN as they fall.  Bond rises and, as the guard attempts
to rise, Bond kicks him in the face.  The guard falls onto his back.

Bond jumps over his supine body and runs toward the storage tanks.

WIDE ANGLE - THE STORAGE TANKS

The other guard walks away between two of the tanks.  The moment he
leaves view, Bond runs to one of them.  He stops and kneels at a cover.

MEDIUM SHOT - BOND

feels behind the cover.  A door in the side of the tank swings open. 
Bond rises quickly.

INT. STORAGE TANK - SAME TIME

Bond enters, closes the door behind him and turns on the lights.

WIDE ANGLE

There are poppy pods in f.g., a desk and numerous boxes.  DOLLY BACK and
PAN on Bond as he moves to the centre of the room.

CLOSE SHOT - BOND

looks around.

WIDE ANGLE

DOLLY IN as Bond takes off a plastic tubular belt and walks to three
drums in f.g. labeled "NITRO."  He holds the belt over the first drum.

ANGLE ON THE FIRST DRUM

Bond squeezes a white jelly from the belt onto the drum.  He moves to
the next drum.  He squirts more jelly onto it.  Then he takes off his
backpack, sets it on a drum, opens it and takes out a timer with wires
leading to a primer.

CLOSE ON THE TIMER

Bond pivots his wrist to check his watch, which reads 12:07, then sets
the timer to 12:20.  It ticks loudly.  Bond looks down.

ONE OF THE TANKS

He presses the primer into the jelly on the drum.

WIDE ANGLE

PAN on Bond as he runs to the door, turns off the lights, slips outside
and closes the door.

CLOSE SHOT - THE TIMER

between two drums ticks away.

EXT. STONE WALL - SAME TIME

Bond jumps down different levels from the top of the wall to the ground.


He pulls off his diving suit to reveal him wearing a white tuxedo and
black bow-tie.  He takes a red carnation from his back pocket, puts it
in his lapel and exits.

				CUT TO:

INT. EL SCORPIO CAFE - NIGHT

BONITA dances amidst a crowd at tables.

enters, passes hanging wicker baskets, takes out a cigarette case and
removes a cigarette.  He looks down.

MEDIUM SHOT - BONITA

shimmies at a customer then looks up, noticing Bond.

MEDIUM SHOT - BOND

lights a cigarette lighter and holds it up to his watch.

INT. STORAGE TANK - SAME TIME

The timer hits 12:20.

EXT. STORAGE TANKS - SAME TIME

A huge explosion occurs.

WIDER ANGLE

A fireball extends over the rock wall.

IN THE CANTINA

Bond casually lights his cigarette as the explosion continues, glasses
crash and the crowd jumps up and screams.

WIDE ANGLE

Bond walks down some steps as people run past him toward the entrance.

ANGLE ON BONITA

She kneels without an audience as people run away.

AT THE BAR

DOLLY BACK as Bond approaches the bar past fleeing customers.  A man in
a gray suit sits at the bar -- SIERRA.

SIERRA

Congratulations.

Bond

Thank you.

Sierra

Mister Ramirez and his friends will be out of business.

CLOSE ON BOND

Bond

At least they won't be using heroin-flavoured bananas to finance
revolutions.

He looks off.

BONITA

angrily exits into her dressing room.

TWO-SHOT - AT THE BAR

Sierra

Don't go back to your hotel, seÓor.  They'll be watching you. 

Bond takes a key from his pocket.

Sierra

There's a plane leaving for Miami in an hour.

REVERSE ANGLE - ON BOND

He fingers the key.

Bond

I'll be on it.  But, uh, first I have some unfinished business to attend
to.

	(he looks at the key)

				CUT TO:

INT. BONITA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

She scrubs herself in a tub.  She looks up.

ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY

Bond enters shutting the door behind him.  He tosses the key aside,
takes a towel from a hook and throws it off to Bonita.  We hear water
plop.  Bond removes his jacket, revealing a shoulder holster and gun. 
He hangs the jacket on a hook.

Bond

Well...

WIDER ANGLE

Bonita, naked but holding the towel against herself, goes to Bond.  He
hugs her and they kiss.  Suddenly she backs up.

Bonita

Oh!

BOND

	(touching his gun)

Forgive me.

He walks to a hook on the wall removing his holster.

Bonita

Why do you always wear that thing?

Bond

	(hanging his holster

	 on the hook)

I have a slight inferiority complex.

	(he turns to her)

Where was I? -- Oh, yes.

TRACK IN slightly as he embraces her.

ANGLE OVER THEM

As Bond kisses her, an assailant -- CAPUNGO -- approaches from behind a
wardrobe in b.g., brandishing a cosh.

FAVORING BONITA

She opens her eyes and looks at him over Bond's shoulder.

CAPUNGO

approaches raising the cosh.

FAVORING BOND

He leans back from Bonita looking into her eyes.

BOND'S POV - BONITA'S LEFT EYE

The pupil reflects Capungo approaching with the raised cosh.

MEDIUM SHOT

Bond suddenly swings Bonita around.  Capungo smashes her on the head.

SERIES OF SHOTS

- As she drops, Bond grabs Capungo's raised arm and brings it down.

- Bond knees Capungo under the chin.  He flies backwards.

- Capungo bounces off a settee, grabs a chair and smashes it against
Bond's back, throwing him forwards.

- Bond falls backwards against the wardrobe.  Capungo punches him in the
jaw, sending him sideways to the door, then punches him twice in the
stomach.  Bond groans.  Capungo readies another punch.  Bond suddenly
pulls him forward.

- Bond throws Capungo over his back.

- Capungo lands on his back on the floor, then swivels to get up.

- Bond lunges at him.

- Capungo, arms braced against a table behind him, tries to kick Bond. 
Bond grabs his leg and twists it.  Capungo lays a hand across Bond's
face, pushing him back.

- CLOSER:  Capungo keeps pushing.  Bond grabs his arm.

- Bond hurls him backwards.

- Capungo falls on his back into the tub, arms flailing.

- Bond, almost grinning, looks at him ready to strike again.

- Capungo reaches for Bond's gun in the hanging holster.

- His hand gropes for it.

- Bond looks on in alarm.

- Capungo aims the gun at Bond.

- Bond slaps a small electric fan toward the tub.

- The fan lands in the tub at Capungo's feet, lighting the water red and
sending sparks flying.

- Capungo's legs, glowing red, fly into the air as he is electrocuted.

- Bond looks on as a sizzling sound occurs off-screen.

ANGLE ON BOND

PAN on him as he walks through smoke to the tub, takes his gun, puts it
in his holster, takes his holster from the hook and puts it on.

Bond

Shocking.

He walks to his jacket, reaches for it, then hears a female groan and
looks back.

BONITA

is on the floor trying to raise herself.

ANGLE ON BOND

as we see Bonita and Capungo's upturned feet in f.g.

Bond

Positively shocking.

He puts on his coat and goes out the door, closing it sharply behind
him.

				CUT TO:

MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

Images of Bond's exploits are projected on a voluptuous, bikini-clad
lady as superimposed titles appear.  Titles end on black.

FADE IN:

EXT. BLUE SKY - DAY

A banner flies by that says "WELCOME TO MIAMI BEACH."

				DISSOLVE TO:

WIDER ANGLE

The banner trails a small plane flying over a strip of Miami Beach
hotels.  A blimp sails by in b.g.

				DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

We move in on the hotel then swing behind it and move in on the high
dive of a swimming pool.  A MAN jumps off the high dive, doing a series
of somersaults.

UNDERWATER

The man splashes into the water, then a GIRL swims by.  PAN OVER to
reveal we're looking through a window on the pool along with FELIX
Leiter in a business suit.  He grins and moves on past a roller-skating
rink where a BOY is spinning a GIRL around.

EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY

A bevy of girls sunbathe there.  Felix walks past them looking around
and approaches a row of cabanas.

CLOSER ANGLE

PAN on Felix as he walks into f.g. then hears voices:

DINK (O.S.)

How's this?

BOND (O.S.)

That's nice.  Very nice.

FELIX' POV - A LOUNGE CHAIR

Bond lies on his stomach as DINK massages his back.

Dink

Just here?

Bond

No, a little lower, darling.

MEDIUM SHOT - FELIX

Felix

I thought I'd find you in good hands.

BOND

looks back, breaks into a smile and starts to raise himself.

Bond

Felix!

FELIX

laughs.

WIDER

DOLLY BACK as Bond approaches Felix, followed by Dink.

BOND

Felix, how are you?

They shake hands.

Bond

Dink, meet Felix Leiter.

Dink

Hello.

Bond

Felix, say hello to Dink.

Felix

Hi, Dink.

Bond

Dink, say good-bye to Felix.

Dink

Hmm?

Bond

Uh, man-talk.

He pivots her around and slaps her butt.  She walks off.

DOLLY IN as Bond feels his arm then walks into his hut, Felix
following.

Felix

You must be slipping double-o seven, letting the opposition get that
close to you.

Bond takes a blue terry-cloth top from a chair and puts it on.

Bond

They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica, didn't they? -- Well, what's on
your mind?  I'm on holiday.

Felix

	(taking out a letter)

Not any more, you're not.  Signal from London.

DOLLY IN as Bond takes it from him.

Bond

I might have known "M" wouldn't book me into the best hotel in Miami
Beach out of pure gratitude.

Felix

He asked us to keep an eye on him for you.

Bond

	(reading the cable)

Auric Goldfinger.  Sounds like a French nail varnish.

Felix

He's British, but he doesn't sound like it.  Big operator, world-wide
interests, all apparently quite reputable.  Owns one of the finest stud
farms in the States.

Bond

	(zipping up his top)

What's the tie-up with Washington?

Felix

He's clean as far as C.I.A.'s concerned.

Bond

And where do I find him?

Felix points off.  Bond looks that way.

[END OF REEL 1.  START REEL 2.]

EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - DAY - SAME TIME

AURIC GOLDFINGER, wearing a yellow top and a hearing aid, walks down
some stairs from an upper deck.  He looks off grumpily and keeps
walking.

BOND AND FELIX

Felix

	(pointing the other way)

That's his pigeon waiting for him now.

Bond looks off.

BOND'S POV - THE POOL

SIMMONS sits in a chair at a poolside table shuffling a deck of cards in
his hand.

Felix

Goldfinger's been taking him to the cleaners every day for a week.

TRACKING SHOT - GOLDFINGER

walks past sunbathers then sees Simmons and smiles.

AT THE TABLE

Goldfinger walks up to Simmons.

Goldfinger

Good morning, Mister Simmons.  Ready for our little game?

Simmons'

Sure I'm ready.  When you're ten grand in the hole, you're ready for
anything.

Goldfinger

	(pointing to Simmons'

	 chair)

Could I have my usual seat?

Simmons

	(rising)

Oh, you and your suntan!

BOND AND FELIX

As Bond picks up his towel:

Felix

That Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.

AT THE TABLE

Goldfinger picks up a pencil and starts to write on a notepad.

Goldfinger

Same stakes?

Simmons

Let's double it.  Five dollars a point.

Goldfinger looks up in surprise then takes a hearing-aid amplifier from
his pocket and turns up the volume.

Goldfinger

Did you say five?

Simmons

My luck's got to change sometime.

Goldfinger

	(returning the amplifier

	 to his pocket)

Okay.

He writes on the notepad.  Simmons sets the deck of cards on the table.

BOND AND FELIX

Bond now has the towel over his shoulder.

Felix

I'll get back to the office and cable "M" you're on the job.

Bond

You can fill me in on the rest at dinner.

Felix

Fine.  I'll call you later.

Felix walks off.  Bond keeps looking at Goldfinger.

AT THE TABLE

The two men hold cards.  Goldfinger takes one from the deck.

Bond walks toward the table.  He stops for a moment, watching, then
walks closer.

Goldfinger takes another card.

Bond looks from the men to the hotel.

Goldfinger suddenly lays his cards down.

Goldfinger

Four.

Simmons

	(stunned)

So soon?

Bond keeps looking at the hotel, then back at the table.

Goldfinger

How many?

Simmons

Seven, twelve, eighteen, thirty-two, forty-four...

Goldfinger laughs.

Bond keeps looking at the table, then circles behind it looking over
Goldfinger's shoulder, then walks off.

Goldfinger smiles at Simmons.  Simmons shuffles the cards.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

TRACK after a MAID walking down the hall.  Bond rounds a corner up ahead
and walks to her.

Bond

Miss?

He takes a key hanging by a cord from her waist and, pulling her with
him, unlocks a door (number 905).

Maid

Hey, what are you...?  But that's Mister Goldfinger's suite!

Bond

	(happily)

Yes, I know.

He opens the door, starts to enter then looks back at her.

Bond

You're very sweet.

He closes the door behind him.  The maid walks away.

INT. GOLDFINGER'S SUITE - SAME TIME

PAN then DOLLY ALONGSIDE Bond as he walks through a well-appointed
reception room to a glass door to a veranda.  As he approaches the door
we hear a female voice outside -- that of JILL MASTERSON:

Jill (O.S.)

He just drew the king of clubs.  That makes his hand fifty-nine.  He's
got a diamond run, eight, nine, ten.

Bond starts to open the door.

BOND'S POV - THE VERANDA

Jill lies face-down on a chaise lounge looking downward through fixed
binoculars and talks into a microphone attached to an intercom.

Jill

He's holding onto the six of spades...

REVERSE ANGLE

Jill lies face-up as Bond looks at her through the open doorway behind
her.

Jill

	(into the microphone)

... so I guess he thinks you want it.  That last draw was the eight of
hearts.

Bond approaches her.

ANGLE ON JILL

She lies face-down, still talking, unaware of Bond behind her.

Jill

He needs kings and queens.

Bond reaches down and turns off the intercom.

JILL

lying face-down whirls around to face him.

Jill

Who are you?!

UPWARD ANGLE ON BOND

DOLLY IN as he approaches.

Bond

Bond.  James Bond.

He looks down.

BOND'S POV - THE POOL AREA

The view from the veranda shows everything.

AT THE TABLE

Goldfinger tries raising the volume on his amplifier.

Simmons looks at his cards.

DOLLY IN on Goldfinger touching his earpiece.

Simmons looks up irritated.

Simmons

Come on, come on!

Goldfinger randomly throws down a card.  Simmons grabs it.

Simmons

	(happily)

Ah!  That's more like it!

ON THE VERANDA

CRANE DOWN with Bond as he sits beside Jill, who sits face-up.

Bond

What's your name?

Jill

Jill.

Bond

Jill who?

Bond looks through the binoculars.

BOND'S POV

He sees Simmons' entire hand.  Simmons sets a card down, then
Goldfinger's hand reaches in and takes a card from the deck.

Jill (O.S.)

Jill Masterson.

BACK TO SCENE

Bond

	(looking at her)

Tell me, Jill.  Why does he do it?

Jill

He likes to win.

Bond

	(looking through the

	 binoculars again)

Why do you do it?

Jill

He pays me.

Bond

	(looking back at her)

Is that all he pays you for?

Jill

And for being seen with him.

Bond

Just seen?

Jill

	(emphatically)

Just seen.

Bond

I'm so glad.

He looks through the binoculars again and sees Simmons setting down
another card.

Bond

You're much too nice to be mixed up in anything like this, you know.

He reaches down.

CLOSE SHOT - THE INTERCOM

Bond turns it on again.

INTERCUT - BOND AND GOLDFINGER (THROUGH BINOCULARS)

Bond snaps his fingers against the microphone.

Goldfinger suddenly looks up, quaking from the noise.

Bond looks through the binoculars.

Bond

	(into microphone)

Now hear this, Goldfinger.

Goldfinger looks up at his balcony.

BOND

Your luck has just changed.

Goldfinger keeps looking up.

Bond

I doubt very much if the Miami Beach police would take kindly to what
you're doing.

He grins at Jill then looks back through the binoculars.

Bond

Nod your head if you agree.

Goldfinger sits in silent fury.

Bond

Nod!

Goldfinger nods as subtly as he can.

Bond

Good.  Now start losing, Goldfinger.  Shall we say, eh, ten thousand
dollars?

	(looks at Jill)

No, let's be generous.  Let's make it fifteen thousand.

Goldfinger's face reflects even greater anger.

Jill

	(to Bond)

May I see?

Bond leans back helpfully.  Jill sits up and looks through the
binoculars.  Bond sniffs her hair.

AT THE TABLE

Goldfinger reluctantly throws another card down, his gaze not moving
from his balcony.  Simmons takes it.

Simmons

Well, I can see this is really my day!

	(lays his cards down)

Gin!

ON THE VERANDA

Jill smiles and leans back.  Bond looks through the binoculars again.

BOND'S POV - GOLDFINGER

has a snarling expression on his face.  The binoculars tilt down in time
to see him snap his pencil in half.  He jabs one end of it into the
tabletop.

ON THE VERANDA

Bond

	(into microphone)

Over and out.

He looks over and switches off the intercom.

TWO-SHOT - BOND AND JILL

She looks up at him smiling.

Bond

That should keep him occupied for some time.

SLOW DOLLY IN.

Jill

I'm beginning to like you, Mister Bond.

Bond

	(laying his arm against

	 her face)

No, call me James.

Jill

More than anyone I've met in a long time, James.

Bond

Well, what on earth are we going to do about it?

Jill

Yes... What?

Bond

I'll tell you at dinner.

Jill

Where?

Bond

Well, I know the best place in town.

He pulls the couch and her head toward him and kisses her.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BOND'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT on the remains of a meal.  PAN OVER to the bed.  First we
just see Bond's and Jill's feet rubbing against each other.  Then,
PANNING FURTHER, we see them embracing and kissing, Bond shirtless and
Jill in panties wearing his shirt.

PAN even further -- to the nightstand where a portable radio is playing.

RADIO ANNOUNCER

Station W.E.D.S. brings you the latest in world news.  Washington.  At
the White House this afternoon, the President said he was entirely
satisfied...

Bond's hand reaches over and switches the radio off.  PAN over to the
bed and DOLLY IN as Bond wraps his arms around Jill again.

Bond

That makes two of us.

They start to kiss.

INSERT - A TELEPHONE

rings.

ANGLE ON THE BED

Bond rolls over and answers the phone.

Bond

Hello.

Felix (over phone)

Leiter here.

Bond

Oh, Felix.

He swings his legs off the bed.

Felix (over phone)

Well, now?

Bond

Uh, what's that?

Jill rises behind him, puts her chin on his shoulder and rubs a lock of
her hair against her ear.

Bond

Dinner?  Uh, no.  Look, I'm sorry, I can't.  Something big's come up.

Felix (over phone)

Right.

Bond scratches his ear and pushes the hair away.

Bond

Uh, how about breakfast?

Felix (over phone)

Okay.

Jill

	(whispering into Bond's

	 ear)

Not too early.

Bond cups a hand over the phone, plants his other hand on her face and
shoves her back.  PAN on her as she lands on the bed smiling and pulls
her shirt down.

Felix (over phone)

I'll call you around nine.

Bond (O.S.)

Yes, nine o'clock will be fine.

ANGLE ON BOND

Felix (over phone)

So long, James.

Bond

Good night, Felix.

He hangs up then looks at Jill.

CLOSE-UP - JILL

looks back at him seductively, lips parting.

BOND

smiles.  PAN on him as he lays atop her, then:

Bond

	(disappointed)

Oh, it's lost its chill.

CLOSE SHOT - CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE

Bond's hand is feeling the bottle.  He picks it up.  TILT UP as he
raises it.

Jill

Why, you...

Bond

It's all right.  There's another in the fridge.

Bond gets up.  Jill rolls over to face him, grinning.

Jill

Who needs it?

WIDE ANGLE

Bond sets the bottle on a dressing table and picks up his bathrobe.

Bond

My dear girl, there are some things that just aren't done...

PAN on him as he walks into the kitchen putting on the bathrobe.  A
bamboo screen separates the kitchen from the bedroom.

Bond

... such as drinking Dom Perignon 'fifty-three above a temperature of
thirty-eight degrees Fahrenheit.  That's as bad as listening to the
Beatles without ear-muffs.

He opens the refrigerator and kneels.

CLOSER ON BOND

He looks in the fridge.

Bond

Now, where is this passion juice?

A MAN'S HAND suddenly comes up into frame.  He wears a black jacket.

DOLLY IN as the hand approaches bond.  Bond opens a refrigerator drawer,
finding the champagne bottle and taking it.

The hand gives Bond a sharp karate chop on the neck, knocking him to the
floor.  TILT DOWN as he falls, face-up, the bottle rolling beside him.

ANGLE ON THE WALL

The man's shadow appears on wood paneling on the kitchen wall.  He turns
sideways.  He is thickly built and sports a bowler hat.  He is ODDJOB.

WIDER ANGLE

As Bond lies unconscious in f.g., the shadow on the wall moves away.

				SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BOND'S HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT

Bond and the champagne bottle lie on the floor.

DOLLY BACK.  Bond begins to move, regaining consciousness.  He rolls
onto his side and slowly lifts himself.  He braces a hand on the stove
and feels the side of his head, then starts moving off.

ANGLE ON THE KITCHEN ENTRYWAY

Bond emerges around the bamboo screen and walks forward.

Bond

	(calling)

Jill?!

He turns a corner then suddenly stops, turns on the lights and looks off
aghast.

BOND'S POV - THE BED

Jill lies face-down naked, coated in gold paint, one arm hanging over
the side of the bed -- dead.

BOND

looks unmoving.

BOND'S POV - JILL

lying there.

CLOSER ON BOND

His face registers terrible concern.

WIDER ANGLE

PAN and TILT UP on Bond as he moves to the bed.

BOND'S POV - JILL'S UPPER TORSO

Her entire face and hair are painted gold.  She looks oddly serene.

BOND

sits on the bed beside her and touches her shoulder.  His expression
shows he recognizes she is dead.

He picks up the phone.  DOLLY IN closer.

Receptionist (on phone)

Yes, Mister Bond?

Bond

Beach seven-nine-four-three-two, room one-one-nine...

As he waits he looks at

JILL'S LEGS

which are completely painted gold.

ANGLE ON BOND

waiting for a response.  Then:

Felix' voice (over phone)

Hello?

Bond

Hello, Felix?  Get over here right away.

Felix (over phone)

What's up?

Bond

The girl's dead.

Felix (over phone)

	(in alarm)

Dink?

Bond

No, Masterson.  Jill Masterson.  And she's covered in paint.  Gold
paint.

				DISSOLVE TO:

A BLUE SKY

dotted with clouds.  TILT DOWN to reveal

EXT. LONDON - DAY

Big Ben and Westminster Palace in f.g.

				CUT TO:

INT. "M'S" OFFICE - DAY

Bond stands at attention in f.g., "M" in b.g. by a window looking at
him.

"M"

Gold?  All over?

Bond

	(nodding)

She died of skin suffocation.  It's been known to happen to cabaret
dancers.

TRACK LEFT as "M" paces toward a bookcase.

Bond

It's all right provided you leave a small bare patch at the base of the
spine to allow the skin to breathe.

TRACK RIGHT as "M" paces back toward the window.

"M"

Somebody obviously didn't.

Bond

And I know who.

"M" stops and walks up to him.

"M"

This isn't a personal vendetta, double-o-seven.  It's an assignment like
any other.  And if you can't treat it as such, coldly and objectively,
then double-o-eight can replace you.

PAN on "M" as he walks behind his desk.

"M"

You've hardly distinguished yourself, have you?  You were supposed to
observe Mister Goldfinger, not borrow his girlfriend.

INTERCUT - BOND AND "M"

Bond looks patiently at "M" as "M" gives him his "medicine."

"M" (O.S.)

Instead of that, Goldfinger goes off to Europe and it's only by the
grace of God, your friend Leiter, and my intervention with the British
Embassy in Washington that you're not in the custody of the Miami Beach
police.

Bond

Sir, I'm aware of my short-comings.  But I am prepared to continue this
assignment in the spirit you suggest -- if I knew what it was about...
sir.

"M"

	(putting on his glasses)

What do you know about gold? -- Not paint, bullion.

Bond

I know it when I see it.

"M" picks up a piece of paper and reads it.

"M"

	(without looking up)

Meet me here at seven.  Black tie.

Bond looks back at "M" then turns and walks to the door.  "M" continues
reading the paper.

[END OF REEL 2.  START REEL 3.]

INT. MISS MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

MISS MONEYPENNY turns from a filing cabinet with a file as Bond emerges
through the outer doorway of "M's" office.  He closes the padded door
behind him.  DOLLY IN closer.

Bond

And what do you know about gold, Moneypenny?

PAN on Bond as he walks to the hat-rack and takes his hat.

Moneypenny

	(leaning back against

	 her desk)

Oh, the only gold I know about is the kind you wear...

	(holding her hand up)

... you know, third finger of your left hand?

DOLLY IN further as Bond approaches her.

Bond

Hmm.  One of these days we really must look into that.

Miss Moneypenny

Well, what about tonight?

	(she takes his hat)

You come round for dinner...

She tosses his hat.  In an insert, it lands on the hat-rack.

Miss Moneypenny

... and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.

Bond, looking in surprise at the hat-rack, turns back to Miss
Moneypenny.

Bond

Nothing would give me greater pleasure.  But unfortunately, I do have a
business appointment.

She pushes him back and walks behind her desk.

Miss Moneypenny

That's the flimsiest excuse you've ever given me.  Ah, well, some girls
have all the luck.  Who is she, James?

Just then "M's" voice comes over the intercom:

"M" (filtered)

She is me, Miss Moneypenny.

IN "M'S" OFFICE - SAME TIME

"M" stands over his intercom holding a switch down.

"M"

And kindly omit the customary by-play with double-o-seven.  He's dining
with me and I don't want him to be late.

IN MISS MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE

Bond shuts off the intercom.

Miss Moneypenny

	(surprised)

So there's hope for me yet?

Bond kisses her cheek then walks to the hat-rack.

Bond

Moneypenny, won't you ever believe me?

He takes his hat and opens the door.

ANGLE ON MISS MONEYPENNY

She sits behind her desk smiling as we hear the door close.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BANK DINING ROOM - NIGHT

In MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT we see three men sitting at the table:  COLONEL
SMITHERS at the head of the table, "M" on the left and Bond on the
right.  Each has a brandy snifter in front of him and there is a
decanter in front of Smithers.  "M" takes a sip.

A servant, BRUNSKILL, walks over holding a cigar box.  He offers it to
"M" who takes a cigar, then crosses behind Bond and offers it but Bond
waves him off.

At the same time we PULL BACK across the extremely long table until we
see a candelabra at each end and an end table in f.g.

Smithers

We here at the Bank of England, Mister Bond, are the official depository
for gold bullion, just as Fort Knox, Kentucky is for the United States. 
We know, of course, the amounts we each hold, we know the amounts
deposited in other banks, and we can estimate what is being held for
industrial purposes.  This enables the two governments to establish
respectively the true value of the dollar and the pound.  Consequently,
we are vitally concerned with unauthorized leakages.

Bond

I take it you mean...

TWO-SHOT - BOND AND SMITHERS

Bond

...smuggling.

Smithers

Yes.

Brunskill holds the box out to Smithers and he takes a cigar, then hands
it back so Brunskill can clip its end.  Meanwhile "M" off-screen lights
his cigar and blows out a puff of smoke.

Smithers

Gold, gentlemen, which has been melted down and recast, is virtually
untraceable, which makes it, uh, unlike diamonds, ideal for smuggling,
attracting the biggest and most ingenious criminals.

Brunskill, bowing slightly, hands Smithers the clipped cigar.

Smithers

Thank you, Brunskill.  That will be all.

Brunskill

Thank you, sir.

Brunskill exits.  Smithers picks up the decanter and hands it to Bond.

Smithers

Have a little more of this, uh, rather disappointing brandy.

MEDIUM SHOT - "M"

"M"

Well, what's the matter with it?

BOND AND SMITHERS

Bond

	(looking at the decanter)

I'd say it was a thirty-year-old fiend indifferently blended, sir...

"M"

holding his snifter, looks at Bond.

BOND

takes out the stopper and sniffs the contents.

Bond

... with an overdose of Bon Bois.

"M"

"M"

Colonel Smithers is giving the lecture, double-o-seven.

BOND

pouring some brandy from the decanter into his glass, freezes.

THREE-SHOT

The decanter with the stopper in it now sits on the table in front of
Bond, his hand on it.

Smithers

Gentlemen, Mister Goldfinger has gold bullion on deposit in Zurich,
Amsterdam, Caracas and Hong Kong, worth twenty million pounds.  Most of
it comes from this country.

Bond passes him the decanter.

Bond

Well, why move it?

Smithers passes the decanter to "M."

Smithers

Because the price of gold varies from country to country.  If you buy it
here at thirty dollars an ounce, you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at a
hundred and ten dollars and triple your money...

"M"

holding the stopper in his hand, sniffs at the decanter then looks up at
Bond.

Smithers (O.S.)

... providing, of course, you have the facilities for melting it down.

BOND

Bond

And has he?

THREE-SHOT

"M" puts the stopper back in the decanter and sets it down.

Smithers

	(lowers his cigar)

Apart from being a legitimate bullion dealer, Mister Goldfinger poses --
eh, no, that's not quite fair...

CLOSE SHOT - SMITHERS

now holds the cigar at his mouth.

Smithers

... is, among his many other interests, a legitimate international
jeweler.  He's, uh, legally entitled to operate modest metallurgical
installations.

BOND

sits thinking.

THREE-SHOT

Smithers

His British one is down in Kent.  As yet, we have failed to discover how
he transfers his gold overseas, and Lord knows we've tried.

	(he turns to "M")

If your department can establish that it is done illegally, then the
Bank could institute proceedings to recover the bulk of his holdings.

"M" looks on in agreement.

SMITHERS AND BOND

Bond

I think it's time Mister Goldfinger and I met -- socially, of course.

Smithers

I was hoping you'd say that.

Smithers rises.  PAN on him as he walks off frame, leaving "M" in f.g.

"M"

It might lead to a business talk -- Mister Goldfinger's kind of
business.

BOND

Bond

I'll need some sort of bait.

Smithers (O.S.)

I quite agree.

THREE-SHOT

TRACK with Smithers as he returns to the table holding an object wrapped
in green cloth.

Smithers

This is the only one we have, from the Nazi hoard from the bottom of
Lake Toplitz in the Salzkammergut, but there are undoubtedly others.

He sets it on the table and unwraps the covering, revealing:

CLOSE SHOT - A BAR OF GOLD

Smithers (O.S.)

Mister Bond can make whatever use of it he thinks fit...

THREE-SHOT

Smithers sits back in his chair.

SMITHERS

... providing he returns it, of course.  It's worth five thousand
pounds.

He lifts his snifter.

CLOSE SHOT - THE BAR OF GOLD

gleams beautifully.

BOND

looks at it then reaches forward.

THE BAR OF GOLD

Bond's hand touches it.

"M"

holds a hand up, stopping him.

"M"

You'll draw it from "Q" branch with the rest of your equipment in the
morning.

BOND

looks back at him and straightens his cuff.

Bond

But of course, sir.

"M"

grins enigmatically at Bond then raises his snifter.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. "Q" BRANCH - DAY

TWO MEN in a glass cubicle wearing gas masks face a parking meter.  One
of them puts a coin into it.  White gas instantly shoots from it,
filling the cubicle.

WIDER ANGLE

Bond stands outside the cubicle watching the gas expand.  DOLLY BACK as
Bond walks with a hand in his pocket to a bench.

"Q" bends over the bench beside a sitting man and points to an object
he's working on.

Bond picks up a hand grenade and looks at it.

Bond

Good morning, "Q."

"Q" immediately takes it from him and sets it down in a container.

"Q"

Good morning, double-o-seven.  This way, please.

DOLLY WITH THEM as they walk away from the bench.

Bond

My, we are busy this morning.

TWO MEN in an alcove behind them come into view.  One wears a trench
coat, the other aims a machine gun at him.  Suddenly the gunner fires at
the other man.  Bond and "Q" react and look back.

CLOSER ANGLE

The gunner keeps firing.  The other man looks to one side, apparently
not feeling the shots.  The gunner stops shooting and the other man
pulls back his trench coat, revealing a bullet-proof vest.  He looks
down at it.

WIDER ANGLE

The man lowers his hands and feels his crotch as the shooter looks on. 
The man looks at the shooter then feels his crotch again.

"Q" turns to Bond.

"Q"

It's not perfected yet.

Bond

Where's my Bentley?

"Q"

It's had its day, I'm afraid.

DOLLY BACK as they walk forward.  A large "NO SMOKING" sign comes into
view behind them.

Bond

But it's never let me down.

"Q"

"M's" orders, double-o-seven.

"Q" points off.  PAN OVER to reveal a gray Aston-Martin.  The license
plate, white-on-black, reads "BMT 216A."

"Q" (O.S.)

You'll be using this Aston-Martin D.B.-Five with modifications.

TWO-SHOT

Bond and "Q" look down at the car.

"Q"

Now pay attention, please.

"Q" steps over to the car and taps the windshield.

"Q"

Windscreen, bullet-proof...

	(points backwards)

... as are the side and rear windows.

He reaches in, turning a switch on the dashboard.

"Q"

Revolving number plates, naturally.

CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT LICENSE PLATE

It revolves to a white-on-black plate, 4711-EA-62, then a black-on-white
plate, LU-6789, then back to the original plate.

"Q" (O.S.)

Valid all countries.

TWO-SHOT

"Q" reaches into his pocket and takes out a small silver case.  DOLLY IN
on "Q" and Bond.

"Q"

Here's a nice little transmitting device called a "Homer."

CLOSE SHOT - THE "HOMER"

"Q" (O.S.)

You prime it by pressing that back, like this.  You see?

He pulls back the outer cover and the device beeps.  Then he holds up a
tiny version of the same device.

"Q"

The smaller model is now standard field issue, to be fitted into the
heel of your shoe.  Its larger brother is magnetic.

He releases the tiny version and it sticks to the larger one.

TWO-SHOT

Bond takes the devices from "Q."

"Q"

Right.  To be concealed in the car you're trailing while you keep out of
sight.

"Q" opens the passenger door and sits inside.

"Q"

Reception on the dashboard, here.

CLOSE SHOT - THE DASHBOARD

"Q" presses a button and a small grill on the dashboard opens with a
humming sound, revealing a green "scope."

"Q"

Audio-visual range a hundred and fifty miles.

He turns a dial.  An indicator "blip" appears in the middle of the scope
and makes a beeping sound.

Bond (O.S.)

Ingenious -- and useful, too.

TWO-SHOT

Bond

Allow a man to stop off for a quick one on route.

"Q"

	(exasperated)

It has not been perfected after years of patient research and time for
that purpose, double-o-seven.

"Q" gets out of the car and shuts the door.  Bond glances at the gadgets
in his hand then leans an arm on the roof of the car.

"Q"

And incidentally, we'd appreciate its return, along with all your other
equipment -- intact, for once, when you return from the field.

Boned

Well, you'd be surprised the amount of wear-and-tear that goes on out
there in the field.  Anything else?

"Q" walks forward.  DOLLY IN on Bond, looking bored.

"Q"

Well, I won't keep you for more than an hour or so if you give me your
undivided attention.  We've installed some rather interesting
modifications.

Bond signs and leans more heavily against the car.

"Q"

walks around to the driver's side and points in through the window.

"Q"

You see this arm here?

Bond looks in through the passenger window.

CLOSE SHOT - THE CONSOLE

"Q's" hand reaches inside and taps the top of the console.

"Q" (O.S.)

Now open the top, and inside are your defense mechanism controls:

"Q" opens the top, revealing numerous switches.  He points to many (but
not all) of them.

"Q" (O.S.)

... smoke screen, oil slick, rear bullet-proof screen, and left and
right front-wing machine guns.

He closes the top.

BOND

looks on patiently but without much interest.

"Q" (O.S.)

Now this one I'm particularly keen about.

Bond looks inside again.

CLOSE SHOT - THE STICK SHIFT

"Q's" finger points to it.

"Q" (O.S.)

You see the gear lever here?  Now, if you take the top off...

	(he flips the top

	 open, revealing a

	 red button)

... you'll find a little red button.

He closes the top again.

MEDIUM SHOT - "Q"

"Q"

Whatever you do, don't touch it.

MEDIUM SHOT - BOND

Bond

And why not?

MEDIUM SHOT - "Q"

He holds his hands over the roof.

"Q"

Because you'll release this section of the roof...

	(points inside again)

... and engage and then fire the passenger ejector seat.

	(throws a hand upwards)

Whoosh!

MEDIUM SHOT - BOND

Bond

Ejector seat?  You're joking!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - "Q"

"Q"

	(miffed)

I never joke about my work, double-o-seven.

EXT. GOLF CLUB - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

A golf shop and large hotel are in b.g.  GOLFERS walk past in f.g.
pulling wheeled golf carts.  A gold Rolls Royce is parked near the
hotel, and beyond it Bond's Aston-Martin.

INT. GOLF SHOP - DAY - SAME TIME

The proprietor, BLACKING, winds tape around a golf club in f.g. 
Goldfinger walks in.  He is dressed like his name:  brown coat over a
yellow sweater, brown striped tie, brown golfing pants and shoes, and he
holds a matching brown cap.

Goldfinger

Ready, Blacking?

Blacking

Yes, sir.

DOLLY BACK to reveal Bond in f.g.  He wears a purple sweater and black
slacks and is looking at a rack of golf clubs.

Blacking

	(to Goldfinger)

Uh, there's an old member dropped by, sir.  Same handicap as yours.  I
wondered if you would rather play with him?

Goldfinger

Where is he?

Blacking turns to Bond.

Blacking

Uh, Mister Bond?

BOND

turns to Blacking.

Bond

Yes?

Blacking (O.S.)

This is Mister Goldfinger.

GOLDFINGER

turns and looks at Bond.  He studies him a moment, then speaks.

Goldfinger

How do you do?

BOND

looks back at Goldfinger.

Bond

How do you do?

GOLDFINGER

keeps looking at Bond.

BOND

keeps looking at Goldfinger.

Blacking (O.S.)

You can go straight off.  The first tee is clear.

THREE-SHOT

DOLLY IN as Bond walks past them to the door.

Bond

Fine.

Blacking

I'll get Hawker to carry for you, Mister Bond.

Bond

	(turning back)

Well, that'll be splendid.

	(to Goldfinger)

Shall we make it a shilling a hole?

Goldfinger

Um-hmm.

Bond smiles at him and walks out the door.

EXT. GOLF SHOP - SAME TIME

As Bond emerges we hear Goldfinger talking to Blacking:

Goldfinger (O.S.)

I'll take some tees.

Blacking (O.S.)

Ah, yes.  Of course.

Bond suddenly looks ahead and stops.

BOND'S POV - THE GOLF COURSE

ODDJOB steps into a rigid stance right across from him.  A golf bag
hangs incongruously from his shoulder.

ANGLE ON BOND

Goldfinger comes out of the shop behind him, smiling at Bond's concerned
look.

Goldfinger

Oh, you must excuse Oddjob, Mister Bond.  He's an admirable manservant,
but mute.  He's not a very good caddy.

PAN on them as they walk past Oddjob.

Goldfinger

	(shrugging at Oddjob)

Golf is not yet the national game of Korea, eh?

Oddjob waits until they are some distance away then follows.

				SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

Bond stands on a putting green at his ball.  He wears a black hat and
takes aim with his putter.  Goldfinger's ball is closer to the hole than
Bond's.  HAWKER stands nearby with Bond's golf bag.

Bond putts and sinks the ball.

PAN on him as he walks to the hole, revealing Goldfinger approaching
with his putter and Oddjob standing nearby.  Goldfinger is in his
sweater and wears his brown cap.

Goldfinger

This meeting is not a coincidence, eh?

CLOSER ANGLE

Goldfinger and Bond stand in f.g., with Oddjob and Hawking standing in
b.g. on opposite sides.  Goldfinger leans down with his putter.

Goldfinger

What's your game, Mister Bond?

INTERCUT

- Bond looks at Goldfinger.

- Goldfinger looks down taking aim.

- His putter moves back and forth at his ball.

- Bond keeps looking at him.

Bond

My game?

- Goldfinger keeps looking down.

Goldfinger

You didn't come here to play golf.

- His putter keeps moving back and forth.  Suddenly Bond's gold bar
lands beside it with a thud.

- Goldfinger's eyes widen as he looks at the bar.

- The bar glistens in the sunlight.

- Goldfinger looks back at his ball.

- His putter taps the ball, which rolls aside missing the hole.

WIDE ANGLE

Goldfinger hands his putter to Oddjob as Bond picks up the gold bar and
gives it to Hawker.

BOND AND GOLDFINGER - TRACKING SHOT

They walk together across the green.

Goldfinger

The 1940 smelt from the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.

Bond

Part of a smelt of six hundred.

Goldfinger

They vanished in 1944.

Bond

When the Nazis were on the run.

Goldfinger

And you have access to more?

Bond

Yes, from the same source.

Goldfinger

Interesting.

WIDE ANGLE

They approach a teeing ground where a marker says "17."

Goldfinger

Two holes to go.

Bond

Yes, and all square.

Bond plants his ball on a tee.

Goldfinger

Then you have no objection to increasing the stakes?

Bond

	(getting into putting

	 position)

No.  What do you have in mind?

INTERCUT - GOLDFINGER AND BOND

Goldfinger

The bar of gold you have with you, naturally.

Bond

	(looking up)

It's worth five thousand pounds.

Goldfinger

	(laughing it off)

Oh, I'll stake the cash equivalent.

Bond

Naturally.

	(he looks nervously

	 down at his ball)

WIDE ANGLE

Bond raises his club to swing.

Goldfinger

	(suddenly)

Strict rules of golf?

BOND

freezes in mid-stroke and lowers the club.

Bond

But of course.

GOLDFINGER

nods and sways from side to side.

WIDE ANGLE

Bond swings at the ball, striking it cleanly across the fairway.

Goldfinger watches it go.  So does Oddjob.

BOND'S POV - THE FAIRWAY

The ball sails far away then lands.

[END OF REEL 3.  START REEL 4.]

Smiling tightly, Bond crosses Goldfinger, who takes a club from Oddjob
and approaches the tee.  Bond watches.

Goldfinger sets his ball down and readies himself.  In a reverse angle
on his legs, his club hits the ball squarely and the ball flies into the
distance.

Goldfinger watches it go.  So does Bond, who steps forward grinning.

AN AREA OF ROUGH

Goldfinger's ball sails across an area of rough and lands near some
trees.

BOND AND GOLDFINGER

Bond looks over Goldfinger's shoulder at the rough, Oddjob behind them.

Bond

Oh, bad luck.  You're in the rough.

Goldfinger puts his hand on his hip then walks forward.

standing.)

BOND AND HAWKER

Bond

Oh, what a pity.  Here it is.

They look down at a ball.

Hawker

No, it's not.  He plays a Slazenger One.

Hawker hands Bond the ball.  Bond looks at it.  It is marked "Slazenger

A lost ball will cost you stroke and distance!

Goldfinger keeps looking through the rough.

ODDJOB

PAN on him as he walks with a hand in his trouser pocket.  He stops
walking.  TILT DOWN to his legs as a ball rolls out of his trousers onto
the turf.

He raises his arm.

Oddjob

	(calling)

Aagh aagh!

GOLDFINGER

looks over and waves his club.

Goldfinger

Uh-huh.

He walks off.

BOND AND HAWKER

Goldfinger walks past them.

Goldfinger

I'm still training him as a caddy.

Oddjob, off to the side, grins at Bond.

Bond

Successfully, too.

He and Hawker walk off.

WIDE ANGLE

Goldfinger walks to Oddjob in f.g.  Meanwhile Bond and Hawker walk

Goldfinger looks down at "his" ball, which lays inches from the fairway.
 It is marked "Slazenger 1."

Goldfinger

Slazenger Number One.  Good.

He holds his hand out.  Oddjob passes him a club.

BOND AND HAWKER

Bond stops searching and looks up at Goldfinger.  Hawker walks up.

Hawker

If that's his original ball, I'm Arnold Palmer.

Bond

'Tisn't.

Hawker

How do you know?

Bond

I'm standing on it.

Hawker looks down.  Bond raises his foot revealing the ball.

Hawker

	(laughing)

Why you crafty old...

Hawker starts to reach down.

Bond

Leave it.

Bond holds up the other ball.

Hawker

The ball you found, sir?

Bond

Yes.  Slazenger Seven.

	(looking off)

Let's have a little fun with Mister Goldfinger.

He slips the ball into his pocket.

Bond's ball lays inches from the cup, Goldfinger's a few yards away. 
Bond approaches his ball.

Would you like me to mark it or knock it in?

Goldfinger

Um-hmm, play it.

Bond taps his ball into the cup.

Goldfinger walks up to his ball.

Goldfinger

This for a half.

Bond

That's right.

Goldfinger leans over with his club.  In an angle on his legs, he hits
the ball and it rolls into the cup.

Bond, hand in his pocket, looks up at him.

Goldfinger rises haughtily and grins.

Bond glances back at Hawker then, as we TILT DOWN, takes his hand from
his pocket.  We glimpse the hidden ball in his hand.

He reaches into the cup and withdraws two balls.  TILT BACK UP to his
face.

Bond

	(to Goldfinger)

One to go.  That'll be the clincher.

Goldfinger

Fine.

Bond tosses a ball to Goldfinger, who reaches out gracefully and catches
it.  The foursome start walking.

BOND AND HAWKER - TRACKING SHOT

It's all right.

GOLDFINGER

bends over and sets his ball on a tee.  He rises.  The ball falls off
the tee.

WIDER ANGLE

Goldfinger angles his club then notices the ball on the ground.  He

ball is equidistant on the other side of the hole.

GOLDFINGER

Down in five.

Bond

	(preparing to putt)

I'll have to sink this to have the game, right?

Bond putts.  The ball curves away from the hole, just missing it.

Bond

Yaagh!  You win, Goldfinger.

Goldfinger

It seems I am too good for you.

Bond reaches into the cup and takes out both balls.  He looks at one.

Bond

Hmm.  You play a Slazenger One, don't you?

Goldfinger, who has been leaning triumphantly on his club, approaches.

Goldfinger

Yes.  Why?

Bond

	(holding Goldfinger's

	 ball up)

This is a Slazenger Seven.

Goldfinger takes it.  Bond holds up the other ball.

Bond

Here's my Penfold Hearts.

Goldfinger looks in shock at the ball in his hand.

Bond

You must have played the wrong ball somewhere on the eighteenth fairway.
 We are playing strict rules, so I'm afraid you lose the hole and the
match.

Goldfinger glares up at Oddjob.  Oddjob looks back without expression.

Goldfinger hurls his ball to the ground and walks off as Bond smiles.  
Hawker approaches with the flag, grinning broadly, and plants it beside
the hole.

				DISSOLVE TO:

DOLLY IN on Bond as he approaches the trunk.  He takes a Homer from his
pocket, primes it and plants it inside the trunk.

FOLLOWING ODDJOB

DOLLY BACK as he approaches again carrying a folded umbrella.  Bond
gently strokes the car's gold exterior as Oddjob sets the umbrella in

CLOSER ON GOLDFINGER APPROACHING

DOLLY BACK as he walks up to Bond.

Goldfinger

You are a clever, resourceful man, Mister Bond.

Bond

Why, thank you.

Goldfinger

Perhaps too clever.

Goldfinger

Twice our paths have crossed.  Let's leave it at that.

PAN on Goldfinger as he opens the car's back door.

Goldfinger

I should have thought our first meeting would have convinced you.

MEDIUM SHOT - BOND

Bond

Oh, I see.

PAN on him as he walks over to Goldfinger.  Goldfinger's left arm is
linked around the window-frame, revealing a gold wristwatch and band, a
gold cufflink and a gold ring.  Oddjob stands watching on the other side
of the car.

Bond

You're worried about me not giving you a return game.

Goldfinger

Both of us know perfectly well what we are talking about, Mister Bond. 
But I see that it is necessary to remind you.  Oddjob!

PAN on Oddjob as he walks past the front of the car then stands at
attention across from them.

Goldfinger (O.S.)

Many people have tried to involve themselves in my affairs --

TWO-SHOT - BOND AND GOLDFINGER

Goldfinger

-- unsuccessfully.

Goldfinger looks off at Oddjob then touches the brim of his hat and
points into the distance.

THEIR POV - A STATUE

It is a classic Greek statue of a woman.

ODDJOB

takes off his bowler hat, steps over to Bond and Goldfinger, and flings
his hat at the statue.

The hat flies through the air and crosses the statue, knocking the head
off.  The head and hat land at the base of the statue.

BOND AND GOLDFINGER

look up at Oddjob, who walks off to retrieve his hat.  DOLLY IN on Bond
and Goldfinger.

Bond

Remarkable.  But what does the club secretary have to say?

Goldfinger.

Oh, nothing, Mister Bond.  I own the club.

Goldfinger wipes his eye, opens the car door, gets in and lowers a
tabletop.

Goldfinger

I assume you want the check made out to cash.

Bond

That would be perfectly satisfactory.

Goldfinger looks at him with a sneer.

ODDJOB

PAN on him and he returns to the car straightening his hat.  He passes
behind the car to the driver's side.  Meanwhile Goldfinger tears a check
from his checkbook and hands it to Bond.

Goldfinger

Goodbye, Mister Bond.

Goldfinger shuts his door as Oddjob gets in behind the wheel.  Bond
plays with a ball in his hand then tosses it to Oddjob who catches it.

Bond

Oh, uh... I believe this is yours.

Oddjob glares at Bond and squeezes the ball.  Bond looks on.  The ball
fractures into little pieces that Oddjob flings to the ground.  Bond

Are you all right?  Here, let me help you.

He opens the driver's door and she steps out.

Bond

You know, you're lucky to be alive.

Tilly

No thanks to you.  You should have pulled over further.

She crosses behind the back of her car and looks at her tires.

The rear tire is completely shredded.

Tilly

Look at them!

Bond

A double blow-out!  I've never seen one of these before.

Tilly looks over at Bond's car.  It sits innocently on the side of the
road.

Tilly

How could new tires...?

Bond

Defect of some kind, most likely.

	(sits on the edge of

	 her trunk)

Anyway, I'm so glad that it's only the car and not you.  You don't look
like the sort of girl who should be ditched.

Tilly

Never mind that.  Please take me to the nearest garage.

Bond

Certainly.

She crosses back to the driver's side and grabs her handbag.  Bond
follows.

Bond

By the way, my name Is Bond.  Would you --

Tilly

Um, as quickly as possible.

I've had an accident.

The SCOPE

indicator is stationary again, near a mountainside.

Puzzled, Bond looks off as if the source is nearby, then he looks at the
scope again.

The indicator remains stationary.  We hear Tilly again:

How long will it take?... Thank you.  Appreciate it.

Bond looks down and turns off the scope then opens the door and starts
to step out.

Oh, jump in.  I'll run you down.

Tilly

That won't be necessary.

BOND

Well, I hate to leave you here alone.

Bond reaches into the car and hands Tilly her suitcase.

Tilly

I can take care of myself.

Bond

Yes, I'm sure you can.

DOLLY BACK and PAN on Bond as he passes the building.  The shadows of
the other men cross it.  He looks back then runs ahead.

AT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING

Bond rounds the corner and leans back against the building, then glances
back.  The other men round the corner of the building behind him.  They
are laughing.

Bond runs off, passing some metal drums and a sign on a wall that says,
in German, "EINTRITT STRENGSTENS VERBOTEN" ("entry strictly forbidden").
 He quickly finds himself in a dead-end, blocked by another building. 
He looks back desperately.

ALONGSIDE THE BRICK BUILDING

The two guards continue forward.

BOND

runs back past the sign, mounts a fire-escape ladder and starts climbing
up.  He stops on a ledge, then climbs up to the next level.

ON A LEDGE

Louvers on the building's windows provide ventilation.  Bond comes
around the corner, stopping on the ledge near the louvers.  He looks
down to see the two guards turn the other way.  Then he turns to the
louvers and looks inside.

BOND'S POV - INSIDE THE BUILDING

Goldfinger's Rolls is partially dismantled.  WORKERS -- all of them
wearing blue jumpsuits and yellow sashes --  pass to and from it as red
smoke rises from a furnace in b.g.

BOND

tilts the louvers so he can have a better view.  He looks inside again.

BOND'S POV - INT. FACTORY - SAME TIME

The Roll's grill is in f.g.  A worker removes one of the golden
headlamps, walks back and sets it down.  Meanwhile two others remove one
of the golden doors, carry it back and set it down.

At the same time, Goldfinger and LING -- a Chinese operative in a Mao
jacket -- approach from b.g.:

Goldfinger

Smuggling is an art, Mister Ling...

ANGLE ON OTHER WORKERS

They pour molten gold into an ingot mold.

Goldfinger (O.S.)

... and art requires...

Steam sounds from the melted gold, drowning out the rest of his
sentence.

In this case, the bodywork of my Rolls Royce is eighteen carat gold.

CLOSE SHOT - BOND

keeps looking in through the louvers, excited at his find.

INSIDE

Goldfinger escorts Ling past a dolly bearing gold ingots.

Goldfinger

We dismantle it here.  We reduce the gold in this special furnace, which
in turn...

	(noise drowns him out)

... weighing approximately two tons.

He raises his fist to his mouth, coughing, then leads Ling off.

Goldfinger

I make six trips a year to the continent in the Rolls Royce, Mister
Ling...

OUTSIDE

Bond looks downward in satisfaction.  He has solved his case.  He looks
again through the louvers, then suddenly looks to the side.

BOND'S POV - THE FACTORY ENTRANCE

Ling exits the factory then leans against a railing as Goldfinger
follows.

Ling

Perhaps it would be wiser to suspend your other activities.

Goldfinger

Now, Mister Ling, please assure your principals Operation Grand Slam
will have my undivided attention.

Goldfinger leads him down a few steps and around a corner of the
building.

GOLDFINGER

Now, there are certain matters we must discuss...

ANGLE ON THE MERCEDES

Oddjob alights from the back seat, other Koreans following with their
guns.  Oddjob crosses to the crashed Aston-Martin; a pillar lays atop
it.  He looks up.

ODDJOB'S POV - A MIRROR

It is mounted above them and reflects the Aston-Martin and Oddjob
grinning.

ODDJOB

turns aside.

The mirror

shows him moving to the Aston-Martin's driver's door.

CLOSER ANGLE

Oddjob opens the door.  Bond's head falls backwards from the seat,
unconscious.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LASER ROOM - NIGHT

Bond lies in darkness on his back on a metal table.  He comes to.  DOLLY
BACK as he struggles to rise.  He finds his arms and legs are tied to
the table.

The lights come on with a swooshing sound.  Bond looks to one side.

Goldfinger (O.S.)

Good evening, double-o-seven.

Bond looks the other way.

WIDE ANGLE - THE LASER ROOM

The table is in the middle of the room.  A laser gun is aimed just
behind Bond's head.

Beyond him, stairs lead up to a control room.   Goldfinger walks down
the stairs, wearing a gold dinner jacket, a shirt with gold buttons and
a black bow-tie.  Behind him are LING, KISCH, MELLINGER and three
guards.

Bond

My name is James Bond.

Goldfinger

	(slipping his hands

	 into his pockets)

And members of your curious profession are few in number.

CLOSER ANGLE

Goldfinger approaches the table.

Goldfinger

You have been recognized -- let's say by one of your opposite numbers,
who is also licensed to kill. -- Oh, that interesting car of yours!

PAN on Goldfinger as he moves to the right.  The laser gun comes into
view.  Goldfinger wipes his eye and laughs.

Goldfinger

I, too, have a new toy, but considerably more practical.

BOND

glances up at the laser gun.

Goldfinger (O.S.)

You are looking at an industrial laser...

BOND'S POV - THE LASER GUN

Goldfinger (O.S.)

... which emits an extraordinary light, not to be found in nature.

Goldfinger

looks down at him and paces back past the table.

Goldfinger

It can project a spot on the moon -- or, at closer range, cut through
solid metal.  I will show you.

Goldfinger turns and snaps his fingers at the control room.

Delsing flips a switch as Kisch, Ling and Wong look on.

The barrel of the laser gun moves down Bond's torso.  He raises himself
onto his elbows and looks at it.

TILT UP to show its blue coils gleaming as it keeps moving downwards.

LONG SHOT - THE LASER ROOM

The barrel of the laser gun comes to rest, aiming between Bond's legs. 
Suddenly the laser light goes on, gleaming red.

Bond looks down at it.

The laser beam starts cutting the outer edge of the tabletop, which is
gold-coloured.

Goldfinger looks down smiling.

Bond looks down not smiling.

The laser beam continues burning through the table-top.

INTERCUT - BOND AND GOLDFINGER

Goldfinger

	(pointing to the table-top)

This is gold, Mister Bond.  All my life I've been in love with its
colour, its brilliance, its divine heaviness.

Bond looks up at Goldfinger then down at his legs.

The laser beam keeps cutting through the table-top, moving toward
Bond's crotch.

Goldfinger

I welcome any enterprise which will increase my stock, which is
considerable.

Bond looks at Goldfinger then down at his crotch again.

The laser beam keeps cutting through the table-top.

Bond

I think you've made your point, Goldfinger.  Thank you for the
demonstration.

Goldfinger

	(studying the beam)

Choose your next witticism carefully, Mister Bond.  It may be your last.

The laser beam continues cutting upwards.  Bond looks at it then up at
Goldfinger.

Goldfinger

The purpose of our two previous encounters is now very clear to me.  I
do not intend to be distracted by another.  Good-night, Mister Bond.

Goldfinger turns away.

Bond looks from Goldfinger to a spot between his legs.  The laser beam
keeps cutting upwards toward his crotch.

WIDE SHOT

Bond lies in f.g. on the table as Goldfinger starts walking up the steps
to the control booth, his left hand in his pocket.

Bond

Do you expect me to talk?

GOLDFINGER

stops on the steps and looks down, both hands in his pockets.

Goldfinger

No, Mister Bond.  I expect you to die!

INTERCUT - BOND AND GOLDFINGER

Bond looks up at him.

Goldfinger continues up the steps.

Goldfinger

There is nothing you can talk to me about that I don't already know.

Bond looks at the laser beam.  It keeps cutting through the table-top. 
Bond tries to think of something to say.

IN THE CONTROL BOOTH

Goldfinger talks animatedly to Ling.  Kisch and Delsing look on.

BOND

looks down at the laser beam.  It keeps cutting upwards toward his
crotch.  He turns sideways.

Bond

	(calling)

You're forgetting one thing!

Goldfinger and Ling turn to look at him.

Bond

If I fail to report, double-o-eight replaces me!

Goldfinger

I trust he will be more successful!

Goldfinger touches Ling's arm and they turn away.

Bond looks down at the laser beam again.  It keeps cutting toward his
crotch.

Bond

Well, he knows what I know!

Goldfinger looks back.

Goldfinger

You know nothing, Mister Bond!

Bond

Operation Grand Slam, for instance!

GOLDFINGER AND LING

Ling freezes and looks at Bond but Goldfinger keeps his cool.  He
watches Bond and the laser beam about to slice into him.  Goldfinger
steps forward smirking as Ling looks imploringly at him.

Bond looks up at Goldfinger.  The laser beam keeps cutting.  Bond looks
at Goldfinger again.

Goldfinger stands consulting with Ling and Kisch.

Bond looks again at the tabletop.  The beam keeps cutting.

Goldfinger continues consulting with the others.

Bond looks down at the beam.  It is almost at his crotch.  Bond looks
up.

WIDE ANGLE

Bond in f.g. again, Goldfinger beyond in the control room.  Goldfinger
turns to Bond.

Goldfinger

Two words you may have overheard which cannot possibly have any
significance to you or anyone in your organization.

As Goldfinger talks, Bond looks in exasperation at the approaching laser
beam.  It slices easily through the metal.  Goldfinger steps forward
smugly.

Bond

Can you afford to take that chance?

Goldfinger hesitates.  Bond looks over at him, then back at the table. 
The beam keeps cutting.

Bond looks at Goldfinger again.  Goldfinger smiles, relenting.  He turns
back and snaps his fingers (soundlessly) at his assistants.

EXTREME LONG SHOT

The laser beam switches off as Kisch walks down the steps from the
control room.

BOND

looks up at the laser gun then down at his legs.

Goldfinger

You are quite right, Mister Bond.  You are worth more to me alive.

WIDE ANGLE

As Bond lies in f.g. and Goldfinger looks on, Kisch approaches the
table.

Bond looks up at Kisch, then Goldfinger, then Kisch.  Kisch raises a
large pistol and points it at Bond's chest.

Goldfinger looks on smugly as Kisch aims.

Kisch fires the pistol; it makes a thumping sound.  Bond's head lowers
to the tabletop.

Goldfinger looks on with even greater smugness.

LONG SHOT

We see the entire tableau -- Bond unconscious, Kisch beside him and
Goldfinger looking on.

				FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. JET PLANE - FLYING - DAY

Bond lies sleeping in a seat.  We hear the hum of the engines.  He comes
to and looks up, surprised.

BOND'S POV - PUSSY GALORE

She is out-of-focus, then comes into focus peering at him.  She smiles.

INTERCUT - BOND AND PUSSY

Bond

Who are you?

Pussy

My name is Pussy Galore.

Bond

I must be dreaming.

Pussy looks down at him.  Bond looks back at her.  She keeps looking at
him.

Bond feels his chest.

Bond

I thought I'd wake up dead.

Pussy

	(holding up a pistol)

Tranquilizer gun.  Knockout shot.

Bond

I see.  Well, I 'm delighted to be here.

DOLLY BACK as Pussy walks away.

Bond

And, uh, by the way: where is here?

Pussy sets the pistol down and looks out the window.

Pussy

Thirty-five thousand feet, flying south-west over Newfoundland.

Bond

Well, that explains the humming.

DOLLY BACK IN.

Pussy

The humming means you're on Mister Goldfinger's Jet-Star heading for
Baltimore.  And you're his guest.

Bond

I'm honoured.  I never realized he enjoyed my company that much.

Pussy

I don't suppose it will be all fun and games.

	(calling off)

Mei Li!

REVERSE ANGLE

An Oriental stewardess in a gold top -- MEI LI -- steps toward Bond.

Mei Li

Can I do something for you, Mister Bond?

BOND AND PUSSY

Bond

Uh, just a drink.  A martini, shaken, not stirred.

Mei Li bows to him and walks off.  Bond looks at her butt then swivels
in his chair to face Pussy.

Bond

Won't you join me?

Pussy

Not on duty.  I'm Mister Goldfinger's personal pilot.

Bond

You are?  And, uh, just how personal is that?

Pussy

	(glaring back at him)

I'm a damned good pilot.  Period.

Bond

Well, that's good news.  And by the way, where is our host?

Pussy

He flew on ahead.

PAN OVER from Bond to include Mei Li approaching him with a golden cup
on a tray.  Bond takes the cup.

Bond

Thank you.

Mei Li turns away.  Bond looks at her butt again then faces forward and
raises his drink.

Pussy looks at a clipboard.

Bond sips his drink.

Bond

Well, here's to Operation Grand Slam.

Pussy, ignoring him, puts the clipboard away.  Bond watches her.  Pussy
opens the door to the cabin.

Bond

This should be a memorable flight.

Pussy

	(turning to him)

You can turn off the charm.  I'm immune.

Bond sips his drink then swivels again in his chair, looking back at Mei
Li.  She stands in b.g. at the bar.

INT. COCKPIT - SAME TIME

Pussy sits in the pilot's seat beside a female co-pilot, SYDNEY.  Pussy
picks up a microphone.

Pussy

	(speaking into the mic)

We'll be landing in Baltimore...

IN THE CABIN

Bond hears Pussy's voice over a speaker.  He holds a brandy snifter. 
Mei Li stands in b.g.

Pussy

	(continuing)

... our port of entry into the United States, in fifty-five minutes.

Bond rises.  DOLLY IN as he walks to Mei Li.

Bond

Mei Li, I would like to arrive more, uh, appropriately dressed.

	(he sits on a barstool)

Did any of my luggage survive with me?

She starts to reach down.

Bond

Ah!

He reaches in front of her and picks up his suitcase.

Bond

And, uh, my attachÊ case?

Mei Li

Black attachÊ case damaged when examined.  So sorry.

Bond

Apologies quite unnecessary.

Bond rises.  Mei Li gestures ahead of him.  He opens a padded door to
the washroom and goes inside.

IN THE WASHROOM

Bond shuts the door behind him.

IN THE COCKPIT

Sydney is reading a magazine.  A red light behind her blinks with a
beeping sound.

Pussy

Sydney, tell Mei Li to keep an eye on him.

Sydney sets down her magazine, removes her headphones and rises.

IN THE WASHROOM

Bond opens his suitcase and takes out a shaving kit.  He sets it by the
sink.

Then he takes out a gray suit on a hanger,  He closes the suitcase and
reaches up to hang the suit on a hook.

CLOSER

Bond notices a wall clock.

STILL CLOSER

There is a peephole in it.

INT. CABIN - SAME TIME

Mei Li looks through a peephole in the washroom door.

IN THE WASHROOM

Bond leans back against the wall, then takes his suit and hangs it over
the clock.

IN THE CABIN

Mei Li backs away, her view blocked.   She moves to a gold portal and
opens it, revealing another peephole.  She looks through it.

IN THE WASHROOM

Bond opens a cabinet mirror and looks behind it.

He holds his hand in front of the mirror and sees it through the back of
the mirror.

Bond turns, picks up his suitcase and opens it so that the lid blocks
the view through the mirror.

IN THE CABIN

Mei Lei backs away, her view blocked again.

IN THE WASHROOM

Bond takes a razor from his shaving kit.

He unscrews the handle, drops a mini-Homer device into his hand and
primes it.  It beeps.  He reaches down, slides back the heel of his
shoe, inserts the device into a slot and closes the heel.

Bond rises, shutting his suitcase and picking up a can of shaving cream.

IN THE CABIN

Mei Li looks through the peephole again.

IN THE WASHROOM

Bond has lathered his face.  He picks up the shaving cream can, aims it
at the mirror and squirts a circle of soap on it.

IN THE CABIN

Mei Li backs up, thwarted again, and shuts the portal.

EXT. PLANE - FLYING - DAY

The plane continues flying through clouds.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CABIN - DAY

Mei Li dusts a tabletop.  Bond emerges from the washroom behind her,
wearing a gray suit and vest.  DOLLY BACK as he looks ahead at Pussy.

Pussy

We'll be landing in twenty minutes.  Do you want to play it easy...

	(she aims a revolver

	 at him)

... or the hard way?  And this isn't a tranquilizer.

DOLLY BACK to include Pussy as Bond walks up to her.

Bond

Uh, Pussy, you know a lot more about planes than guns.

Pussy looks back at him.

Bond

That's a Smith and Wesson forty-five.  If you fire it at this close
range, the bullet will pass through me and the fuselage like a blowtorch
through butter.  The cabin will depressurize and we'll both be sucked
into outer space together.

	(he sits in his

	 swivel chair)

But if that's how you want to enter the United States, you're welcome. 
As for me -- I, uh, prefer the easier way.

Pussy

	(looking down at him)

That's very sensible.

Bond

Well, besides, there's always so much going on around Mister Goldfinger.
 Oh, I wouldn't dream of not accepting his -- uh, hospitality.

Pussy approaches him.

Pussy

He'll be very glad to see you, too.

Bond looks up at her.  She rubs the barrel of the revolver under his
chin.

Pussy

You like close shaves, don't you?

She turns away.  Bond picks up his snifter and sips.

INT. "M'S" OFFICE - DAY

He puts a book in a bookcase, then hears a voice over his intercom:

phone.

"M"

	(into phone)

"M" here.

Felix (over phone)

Leiter, sir.

"M"

Leiter!

INT. FELIX' OFFICE - SAME TIME

Felix is on a beige phone.  The White House is visible out the window
behind him.

Felix

It's about double-o-seven, sir.  We picked up his Homer signal.  It's
monitored into Friendship Airport, Baltimore, where he's just landed.

INTERCUT - "M" AND FELIX

"M"

Baltimore!  Nice of him to let us know.  Last we heard, he was in
Switzerland.

Felix

He came in on a private jet ex Geneva, registered to our old friend
Auric Goldfinger.

"M"

I'm glad he's making progress.

Felix

Yes, sir.

"M"

Keep an eye on him for us.

Felix

Their flight plan gives Blue Grass Field, Kentucky as their final
destination.

"M"

Don't charge in on him and spoil anything, will you?  He's evidently
well on top at the moment.

				CUT TO:

EXT. BLUE GRASS AIRFIELD - DAY

Goldfinger's jet plane taxis by and approaches a hangar where a sign
hanging from the roof reads, "PUSSY GALORE'S FLYING CIRCUS."  On the
side of the plane in gold lettering are the words "AURIC ENTERPRISES,
INC."

				DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSER ANGLE - THE SIGN

TILT DOWN to show the plane entering the hangar.  Two Koreans await in
blue jumpsuits and yellow sashes.

IN THE HANGAR

The plane rolls to a stop.  The Koreans approach.

The cabin door opens.  DOLLY BACK as Mei Li starts to lower the steps.

Mei li

Mr. Bond?

Bond

Of course.

Mei Li

Please.

Bond lowers the steps for her.

Bond

Any time.

Mei Li

Thank you.

Mei Li descends the steps.  Bond follows.  PAN with them.  She starts
talking to the two Koreans.  PAN back to the plane.  Pussy descends the
steps.  A coat hangs over her arm.

Bond

	(taking her hand)

Do mind you step, captain.

Pussy pulls back her hand and lifts the coat to reveal she holds a
revolver.

Pussy

Just keep playing it easy.

Bond walks on ahead as Pussy turns to Mei Li.  (This time Pussy
pronounces her last name "lie" instead of "lee.")

Pussy

Mei Li, will you see everything's arranged for Mister Goldfinger?

Mei Li

Of course.

Bond strolls to the entrance to the hangar and looks outside.  As Pussy
approaches him, Bond looks up at the sky.

BOND'S POV - PUSSY'S FLYING CIRCUS

Five planes fly in a V-formation.

Bond keeps looking up.

The planes now fly in a circle.

Pussy arrives at Bond's side.

Bond

Talented chaps.

Pussy

They should be.  I trained them.  Come on.

TRUCK with them as they walk alongside the hangar.

Bond

You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.  I believe that the bourbon and
branch water's rather splendid here in Kentucky.  Now that we're off
duty, perhaps --

Just then Oddjob comes into view, standing beside a red station wagon. 
Two Koreans sit in the back seat.  A blue pickup truck is parked behind
it.

Oddjob glowers at Bond.

REVERSE ANGLE

Oddjob motions to Bond to get in the car.  PAN on Bond as he walks past
him.

Bond

Manners, Oddjob.  I thought you always took your hat off to a lady.

Bond gets in the back seat.  Oddjob slams the door shut and opens the
driver's door.  Mei Li crosses in b.g., walking to the station wagon
with her two Koreans.

CLOSER ON BOND

Bond

You know, he kills little girls like you.

PAN on Pussy as she walks up to him.

Pussy

Little boys, too.

She bangs twice on the car roof.  It drives off.  Pussy watches it go
then turns aside.

AERIAL SHOT - THE PLANES

The five planes fly across a grass field, coming in for a landing.

Pussy steps forward onto a perimeter track.

The planes taxi toward her then come to a stop.

From one of the planes, a gorgeous blonde pilot (ALTHEA) emerges.  PAN
on her as she jogs toward Pussy, revealing the other four planes behind
her.  From them four more BLONDE PILOTS emerge.  They all jog over to
Pussy.

She looks at them with admiration.

PAN on the girls as they reach her.

Pussy

Well?

Goldfinger

Ah!  Welcome to Auric Stud, Mister Bond.  Lovely animal, isn't she?

Bond

Certainly better bred than the owner.

Goldfinger

	(gesturing to Oddjob)

Show Mister Bond to his quarters, please.

Oddjob and the two guards escort Bond to a staircase that runs down
under a wooden building.

Goldfinger watches with a disappointed expression, then takes off his
gloves and walks away.

INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

The walls are made of stone and there are elaborate wooden cross-beams.

PAN over to reveal a GUARD opening a heavy metal cell door.  There is a
small barred window in it.  Oddjob takes off his hat and motions to
Bond.  Bond steps inside the cell.

Goldfinger

Gentlemen!

Men all over the room stop what they're doing and look at him.

Midnight

Goldfinger, why weren't we told that New York and the West Coast were in
on this?

Laurence

Look who's talking!

TRACK BACK on Goldfinger as he walks past Strap and Solo.

Strap

I do not do business with Chicago!

Solo

I thought we had a private business deal to settle.  Now I find I'm
attending a hoods' convention!

Goldfinger stops at the pool table.

Strap

Goldfinger, I made a delivery.  Where is my money?

Laurence

I made a delivery, too.

Goldfinger

	(leaning on the pool

	 table)

You all made the deliveries we contracted for.

Midnight

And you owe me one million bucks.

Goldfinger

I owe each of you a million -- in gold bullion.

Strap

So pay.

Goldfinger rolls a ball across the table.

Goldfinger

Gentlemen, you can have the million today...

	(he picks up another

	 ball then sets it

	 down for emphasis)

... or ten millions tomorrow!

Strap

Did you say ten million?

Goldfinger

As soon as my bank opens in the morning.

Solo

Banks don't open on Sunday.

Goldfinger

My bank will!

Goldfinger laughs.  TILT DOWN as he reaches under the pool table and
flips a switch.  The sound of a motor humming begins and the pool table
starts moving.

INTERCUT - AROUND THE ROOM

The pool table revolves counter-clockwise and the tabletop inverts to
reveal a console.

Strap

What's with that trick pool table?

Goldfinger crosses to the console as the table stops moving and the
humming ends.

He reaches out and turns three white dials.  Indicator lights go on and
another humming sound starts.

[END OF REEL 7.  START REEL 8.]

A large wood panel lowers over the windows.

Laurence

Cover him!

Strap

Hey, cover those doors!

Solo

Turn those lights back on!

Three gangsters back up in the dark.

A large aerial photograph rises from the floor and interior lights go
on.

Goldfinger

There is no cause for alarm, gentlemen.

He turns a black knob.  The humming sound increases.  He looks up.

The large photograph flattens against the wall as side panels come into
place beside it.

Laurence (O.S.)

I don't like being cooped up like this. -- What's that map doing there?

Goldfinger takes a pool cue from a rack by the table.  PAN on him as he
crosses to the aerial photo.  It depicts Fort Knox and the surrounding
area.

Goldfinger

	(pointing with the cue)

This is my bank.  The gold depository at Fort Knox, gentlemen.  In its
vaults are fifteen billion dollars -- the entire gold supply of the
United States.

Strap

	(laughing)

Knock off Fort Knox?!

The gangsters laugh at him.

Laurence

Got a key or somethin'?

Goldfinger

Of a kind.

PAN on him as he walks back to the console.

Solo

There are thirty-five thousand troops stationed around there.

Goldfinger

	(setting down the cue)

Forty-one thousand.

Midnight

And who's going to say "boo" to them, Goldfinger?

Goldfinger turns the white dials again and the humming sound resumes.

The bar starts to swivel around and the centre of the floor retracts,
revealing a hidden model of Fort Knox.  The gangsters panic.

Midnight

Hey, what's going on here?!

Another Gangster

Hey, what is this?!

Another Gangster

It's the floor!

ANOTHER GANGSTER

Say, what is this, a merry-go-round?!

The bar swivels into a new position.  Goldfinger looks off.  A lighting
apparatus lowers from the ceiling above the model.  The model starts to
rise.

The gangsters look at it in amazement.  Goldfinger approaches the model
holding his pool cue.

Goldfinger

Man has climbed Mount Everest.  Gone to the bottom of the ocean.  He has
fired rockets to the moon.  Split the atom.  Achieved miracles...

	(the humming stops)

... in every field of human endeavor -- except crime!

IN BOND'S CELL

Bond paces to the door.  He looks out through the bars.  A Korean guard
sits outside watching him.

Bond waves to him.  The guard looks back expressionless.

Bond turns, paces to the far end of the cell and returns to the bars.

The guard sits staring at him.  Bond waves to him again and turns away. 
The guard continues to watch expressionless.

Bond paces to the bars again and smiles at the guard.  The guard stares
back.  Bond winks at him.  The guard stares back.  Bond smiles and
suddenly lowers himself below the window.

The guard keeps looking.  Bond is no longer visible.

THE GUARD

gets up, walks to the door and looks through the bars.  The cell appears
empty.

He takes out a gun, unlocks the door and kicks it open.

IN THE CELL

The door slams against the inner wall.  The guard walks in.  Bond hides
above him in the rafters.

The guard looks around, seeing an empty cell.

UPWARD ANGLE ON THE GUARD

Bond, above him, braces himself.

BOND

suddenly jumps down.  He grabs the guard from behind.  They tussle and
fall to the floor.

They struggle for the gun.  Bond slams the guard's hand against the bed
frame and the gun falls.

The guard shoves Bond against the wall.  Bond kicks him under the chin
and the guard falls flat on his back.

ZIP PAN over to the gun under the cot.  Bond takes the gun and his
jacket and backs out of the cell as the guard lies unconscious in f.g.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Bond shuts the cell door behind him, lays the key on a pile of rags and
walks down the corridor putting on his jacket.

As he nears the end of the corridor, we see a basement control room
ahead containing a hydraulic lift and we hear voices from above:

Goldfinger (O.S.)

The underworld will rock with applause for centuries.

Midnight (O.S.)

Cut the commercial.

Strap (O.S.)

Yeah, get to the point!

IN THE RUMPUS ROOM

Seven of the gangsters are lined up on the platform facing Goldfinger. 
He holds the pool cue and approaches Solo.

Solo

You're wasting my time, Goldfinger.  The depository is impregnable.

Strap

	(steps forward counting

	 on his fingers)

Look, the joint is bomb-proof, electrified, lousy with machine guns,
tear gas --

Goldfinger

Bear with me, please!  Fort Knox is a bank, like any other.  Larger,
better protected perhaps, but nonetheless a bank!

PAN OVER as he points the pool cue at the model.

Goldfinger

It can be, I think the expression is, blown.

ZOOM IN on the model.  Bond's eyes look out through windows in the
replica of Fort Knox.

Goldfinger (O.S.)

My plan is foolproof, gentlemen.

UNDER THE MODEL

Bond stands on the hydraulic platform.  He jumps down, looks around,
tears a piece of paper from a rolled-up document and grabs a pencil.

He runs back under the model and looks through it again.  Meanwhile we
hear Goldfinger continue:

Goldfinger (O.S.)

I call it Operation Grand Slam.  I have devoted fifteen years of my life
to it.  Every detail has been scrupulously prepared.  Every eventuality
has been considered.  We'll operate on a split-second schedule.  Your
organization, Mister Midnight, brought in a consignment of these
canisters...

IN THE RUMPUS ROOM

Goldfinger holds up a gold canister the size of a wine bottle.

Goldfinger

... across the Canadian border.  They contain Delta Nine.

UNDER THE MODEL

Bond prepares to write on the piece of paper.

IN THE RUMPUS ROOM

Midnight

Delta Nine?  What's that?

Goldfinger

	(gesturing emphatically)

An invisible nerve gas which disperses fifteen minutes after inducing
complete unconsciousness for twenty-four hours!

Goldfinger hands the canister to one of the gangsters and paces past
them.

Goldfinger

Tomorrow at dawn, the Flying Circus of my personal pilot, Miss Pussy
Galore...

UNDER THE MODEL

GOLDFINGER (O.S.)

... will spray it into the atmosphere!

Bond starts writing.  PAN OVER to the piece of paper.  He writes:

"007 to CIA

AERIAL NERVE GAS

PRECEDES DAWN RAID

FORT KNOX

TOMORROW"

Goldfinger (O.S.)

Once the population, including the military, has been immobilized, my
task...

IN THE RUMPUS ROOM

Goldfinger

... force, which Mr. Strap and his people smuggled across the Rio Grande
from Mexico, will approach Fort Knox in motorized equipment along
Bullion Boulevard...

He points to the model with the pool cue.

Goldfinger

... which runs past the depository here, and intersects with Gold Vault
Road.  This fence surrounding the depository, as Mister Strap reminded
us, is electrified.  It will be dynamited.  My task force will then move
to the main entrance and demolish it.

Solo

How, may I ask?

Goldfinger

You made that possible, Mister Solo, by arranging, through your
considerable influence in shipping circles, to bring through customs
uninspected a consignment labeled machine parts.  All that will then
remain is to descend to the vaults where the bullion is stored.

Solo

I've heard enough.

Strap

Let him finish.

Solo

	(interrupting)

If you have no objection...

	(to Goldfinger)

... I'll take my money now.

Strap

What's the matter, Solo?  Too big for you to handle?

Goldfinger looks over at other gangsters.  They look back at him.  He
looks at another group of gangsters.  They look back.

Under the model, Bond watches.

Goldfinger

Gentlemen, we must respect Mister Solo's decision.  Please excuse me for
a few minutes while I take care of him.  Make yourselves comfortable.

Goldfinger leads Solo toward the door.

UNDER THE MODEL

Bond takes the Homer from his heel, folds the paper around it and slips
it into his pocket.

He looks through the model again.  He hears general hubbub from the
gangsters, and a few clear words:

FIRST GANGSTER

How do we get it out?

Second Gangster

That's the bit I want to hear.

Third Gangster

Yeah, and it had better be good.

TILT DOWN to Bond's feet.  Suddenly a pair of hands grab his ankles and
yank on them.  He falls face-down onto the platform.

The hands pull him back and hurl him against a wall.  He turns around
and suddenly stops.

His assailant is Pussy.  She glares at him with her hands on her hips.

Bond

Pussy!  Well, who taught you judo?

She holds her hand out.  DOLLY BACK as she steps forward; a guard
crosses behind her.

Pussy

The gun you took.

Bond

Oh, the gun.  The gun, of course.

He takes it from his pocket and hands it to her handle-first.  She
motions to him to go back down the corridor.  He starts walking.  She
hands the gun to one of the guards.

Bond

We must have a few fast falls together sometime.

ANGLE ON THE BASEMENT CONTROL ROOM

Kisch steps forward, presses a button and sliding armoured doors glide
shut.

IN THE BASEMENT CONTROL ROOM

DOLLY after Kisch turns to a control panel and switches on two t.v.
monitors.  They show different angles on the rumpus room.

IN THE RUMPUS ROOM

Gangsters hover around the model.

Midnight

Hey, Strap, y'know, if he's got the right answers, you and me don't even
have to be there.  The boys can handle everything.

IN THE BASEMENT CONTROL ROOM

Kisch dons a gas mask.  Then he presses a button on a control panel. 
Indicator lights go on.

ON ONE OF THE MONITORS

We see the fireplace hood shut over the grate and some lights go off.

IN THE RUMPUS ROOMS

The gangsters react with panic.

Gangster

Hey, they closed up the fireplace!

PAN over to the wall-sized photo.  A shielding lowers over it, sealing
the room.

Another Gangster

I don't like this!

Four teargas canisters rise from a console table.

Midnight

What's goin' on here?

IN THE BASEMENT CONTROL ROOM

Kisch turns a switch.

THE TEARGAS CANISTERS

DOLLY IN as they start hissing.

WIDER ANGLE

Blue lights start flashing.  The gangsters choke and run around.

Midnight

The gas!

Gangsters fall to the ground.

The canisters keep hissing.

The last of the gangsters drop to the ground.

EXT. PLANTATION HOUSE - DAY

A Korean guard loads bars of gold into the trunk of a car.  DOLLY BACK
to show it is a Cadillac.

Goldfinger and Solo emerge through the front doorway of the house. 
Another guard follows behind them with a briefcase and overcoat.

Goldfinger

Such a pity you did not choose to remain with the others, Mister Solo. 
However...

The guard closes the trunk.  Solo glances up.  Goldfinger notices and
looks back.

Pussy walks up to them with Bond.  Bond takes his hand from his pocket,
holding the piece of paper with the Homer.

Goldfinger

Ah, Mister Bond.  I thought you were resting in your quarters.

FOUR-SHOT

Solo, Goldfinger, Pussy and Bond.

Bond

Oh, they are delightful, but it's much too nice to stay indoors.  I ran
into Miss Galore and she suggested that we join you.

Goldfinger

	(turning between the

	 two men)

Mister Solo, Mister Bond, another of my distinguished guests.

Solo

Hello.

Bond

Leaving us so soon, Mister Solo?

Goldfinger

Unfortunately, he has a pressing engagement.

Solo

Yeah.  I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.

He calls behind him to the guard.

Solo

Boy!

Solo approaches the car followed by the guard.

Bond

Ah, when you gotta go, you gotta go.

Solo opens the passenger door.  Bond slips the paper into his pocket.

Goldfinger

My plane will get you to New York on time.  With you excess luggage.

	(he laughs)

Solo takes the briefcase and overcoat from the guard and gets into the
car.

Bond

	(closing the door)

Allow me.

Oddjob approaches from b.g.

Goldfinger

My chauffeur's an excellent driver.  You will be at the airport in a few
minutes.

Oddjob gets in behind the wheel.

Goldfinger

Goodbye, Mister Solo.  Some other time, perhaps...

Bond

	(leaning forward)

Happy landings, old boy.

PAN on the car as it drives off.

[END OF REEL 8.  START REEL 9.]

THREE-SHOT

Goldfinger, Pussy and Bond.

Pussy

I found him under the model.

Goldfinger looks at Bond.  Bond looks back.

Bond

Operation Grand Slam.  I did enjoy your briefing.

Goldfinger looks back at Bond.  Bond looks back at Goldfinger.

Goldfinger

	(grins slightly)

So did I.

PAN on him as he walks off.  Bond and Pussy watch him go.

Goldfinger heads for the stables.

EXT. STREET - DAY

PAN on Oddjob's Cadillac as it drives by.

OUTSIDE COLONEL SANDERS'

Johnnie again sits in the driver's seat of the Thunderbird.  He hears
the scope beeping and looks at it.

The beep indicator is moving.

He gets out of the car and honks the horn.  Felix hurries out of the
restaurant eating.

Johnnie

He's on the move!

Felix takes another bite and heads for the car.

Johnnie backs the car up.  Felix rushes into the passenger seat and they
take off.

THE CADILLAC

turns a corner at "Joe's Drive-In" and heads up another street.

THE THUNDERBIRD

follows up the same street.

IN THE THUNDERBIRD

Felix looks at the scope.  The beep indicator moves upwards.

Felix

Slow down.  Don't crowd him.

The Thunderbird keeps following.

THE CADILLAC

cruises along.  Solo sits impassively in the back seat as Oddjob drives.

The Cadillac passes under bridge where a sign reads, "INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT."  Then it passes a sign at the side of the road that reads,
"AIRPORT."

Solo

	(looking back)

Are you blind or something?  You missed the turn!

Oddjob looks purposefully ahead.

ON A SIDE ROAD

The Cadillac rounds a corner.  It stops at the side of the road.  Solo,
puzzled, looks back.

Oddjob picks up a pistol with a silencer and aims it at him.

Solo looks forward again and sees the gun.  His eyes open wide in shock.

Oddjob shoots him in the chest.  Solo falls back against his seat then
drops out of view.

Oddjob peers down at him smugly.

THE CADILLAC

drives forward again.

IN THE THUNDERBIRD

Felix studies the scope.

Felix

Hmm.  He turned to the right just ahead here somewhere.

The Thunderbird stops, backs up and heads in a different direction.

ODDJOB

drives serenely.

ANGLE ON THE STREET

The Cadillac races by under a bridge.

IN THE THUNDERBIRD

The beeping continues.

Johnnie

	(glancing at the scope)

Where's this old pal of yours heading?

Felix

Ten'll get you one, it's a drink or a dame.

Johnnie looks at him and smiles.

ANGLE ON THE STREET

The Thunderbird continues under the same bridge.

IN THE CADILLAC

Oddjob keeps driving serenely.

ANGLE ON THE STREET

He turns into a scrap yard where scrap metal is piled into pyramids.  A
sign on the wall reads, "ATLANTIC IRON & METAL CO."

IN THE SCRAP YARD

Oddjob pulls to a stop, gets out of the Cadillac and walks away.

Just then grab hooks descend onto the car.  They surround the roof,
gripping the car, and raise it into the air.

The hooks swing the car overhead then drop it into a car-crushing
machine.  The flanges of the machine start to close on the car.

SERIES OF SHOTS

The machine's hydraulics compress the car into a foot-square cube.

The flanges retract and a gateway opens.  A metal arm pushes the cube
out through the gateway.

An electromagnet snags the cube from above.  It lifts the cube into the
air then lowers it into the back of Oddjob's blue pickup truck as Oddjob
(looking thinner) approaches the truck.

Oddjob gets in behind the wheel and glances back as the cargo is lowered
into place.

Oddjob drives away.

IN THE THUNDERBIRD

Felix tries adjusting the controls of the scope but the beeping has
stopped.

Felix

Dead.

Johnnie

Mechanical failure maybe.

Felix

Unless he switched it off.

Felix keeps trying to adjust the scope.

Johnnie

Why would he do that?

Felix

Drive to the farm.  It's all we can do.

Johnnie

Right.

PAN on the Thunderbird as it drives on.  Then the pickup truck comes
down the other side of the road.  PAN on it into the other direction.

				DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PATIO OF GOLDFINGER'S PLANTATION HOUSE - DAY

Pussy sits at a table with Goldfinger.  A SERVANT sets mint juleps in
front of them.

Pussy

Thank you.

The servant moves off.  DOLLY in to a tighter two-shot of Pussy and
Goldfinger.

Goldfinger

Your share of Operation Grand Slam will make you a very rich woman, my
dear.

Pussy

Why else would I be in it, Mister Goldfinger?

She reaches for her glass.  He strokes her hand.

Goldfinger

You'll retire to England, I suppose?

He continues stroking her hand.

Pussy

No.  I've spotted a little island in the Bahamas.  I'll hang up a sign
--

She takes the glass, rejecting Goldfinger's hand.

Pussy

-- no trespassing, and go back to nature.

Goldfinger taps the tabletop, acknowledging the rejection.

THREE-SHOT

Pussy, Goldfinger and Kisch.

Kisch walks up to them.

Goldfinger

Yes, Kisch?

Kisch

Two men in a car, with binoculars.

Goldfinger

Touts looking for racing tips.

OUTSIDE THE FARM - DAY

Felix and Johnnie stand at a fence, the Thunderbird parked behind them. 
Felix hands Johnnie a pair of binoculars.  Felix looks through them.

GOLDFINGER

starts thinking.

Goldfinger

There is another possibility, however.  Kisch, ask Mister Bond to join
us.

Kisch walks off.  DOLLY IN on Pussy and Goldfinger.

Goldfinger

	(to Pussy)

We were quite right to spare Mister Bond's life in Switzerland.  If
those gentlemen are his friends, let us convince them he needs no
assistance.  For their benefit, Pussy, let's make him as happy as
possible.  I suggest you change into something more suitable.

Pussy

Certainly.

	(sets her glass down)

Business before pleasure.

He chortles.  She gets up.  Her chortles again as he watches her go,
then turns to his drink.

IN BOND'S CELL

Bond sits on the cot, his back against the wall and legs in a
V-position, wearing his suit.  DOLLY BACK and PAN OVER to reveal three
guards watching him.

Kisch appears in the doorway and gestures to Bond with a gun.

Kisch

He wants you.

Bond gets up.

EXT. STUD FARM - AT THE FENCE - DAY

Felix and Johnnie stand looking over the fence, Felix with the
binoculars.  He pans over, seeing something.

FELIX' POV - THE PORCH OF THE PLANTATION HOUSE

Kisch follows Bond to the porch where Goldfinger still sits at the
table.

Goldfinger

	(casually, gesturing)

Ah, Mister Bond.  Sit down, please.  A mint julep?  Traditional, but
satisfying.

Bond

Yes, thanks.

	(to the servant)

Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.

The servant nods and walks away.

Bond

	(slips his hands in

	 his pockets)

You disappoint me, Goldfinger.  You know Operation Grand Slam simply
won't work.  Incidentally, Delta Nine nerve gas is fatal.

Goldfinger

You are unusually well informed, Mr. Bond.

The servant approaches with Bond's drink on a tray.

Bond

You'll kill sixty-thousand people uselessly.

	(to servant)

Ah!

He takes his drink.  The servant moves off.  Kisch, though, lingers
behind them.

INTERCUT - BOND AND GOLDFINGER

Goldfinger

American motorists kill that many every two years.

Bond

Yes, well, I've worked out a few statistics of my own.

	(sits across the

	 table from him)

Fifteen billion dollars in gold bullion weighs ten thousand, five
hundred tons.  Sixty men would take twelve days to load it onto two
hundred trucks.  Now, at the most, you're going to have two hours before
the army, navy, air force, marines move in and make you put it back.

Goldfinger

Who mentioned anything about removing it?

Bond stops drinking.  Kisch leans back against a pillar behind them,
watching.

Goldfinger

Is the julep tart enough for you?

Bond

	(thinking)

You plan to break into the world's largest bank, but not to steal
anything.  Why?

Goldfinger

Go on, Mister Bond.

Bond

Mister Ling, the Red Chinese agent at the factory.  He's a specialist in
nuclear fission. -- But of course!

Goldfinger smiles back at him.

Bond

His government's given you a bomb!

Goldfinger

I prefer to call it an atomic device.  It's small, but particularly
dirty.

Bond

Cobalt and iodine?

Goldfinger

Precisely.

Bond

Well, if you explode it in Fort Knox, the, uh, entire gold supply of the
United States will be radioactive for... fifty-seven years!

Goldfinger

Fifty-eight, to be exact.

Bond

I apologize, Goldfinger.  It's an inspired deal.  They get what they
want -- economic chaos in the West -- and the value of your gold
increases many times.

Goldfinger

I conservatively estimate ten times.

Bond

Brilliant.  But the atomic device, as you call it, is already, obviously
in this country.

Goldfinger

Obviously.

Bond

But bringing it to Fort Knox, uh, undetected could be risky -- very
risky.

Goldfinger

Oh the contrary, Mister Bond.  The risk is all on your side.  If the
authorities should attempt to locate it, who knows where it might be
exploded, eh?  Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens at New London, Cape
Kennedy, near the White House... But we are speculating idly.  Operation
Grand Slam will be successful.  You will be there to see for yourself --
to closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

[END OF REEL 9.  START REEL 10.]

Bond looks off.  He sees the blue pickup truck returning.  The truck
stops in front of the house.

Goldfinger approaches it, followed by Bond.

Goldfinger

Forgive me, Mister Bond, but, uh, I must arrange to separate my gold
from the late Mister Solo.

Goldfinger approaches the pickup truck.

Bond

As you said he had a pressing engagement.

As Goldfinger reaches the back of the truck, Pussy emerges through the
front door of the house wearing casual clothes.

Goldfinger

Ah, very chic, Miss Galore.

	(to Bond)

Don't you agree?  Please entertain Mister Bond for me, Pussy.  I'll join
you both later.

He bangs on the back of the truck and walks off with it.

Pussy crosses behind Bond and links an arm through his.

Pussy

Well, how about it, handsome?  Don't you think it's about time we got to
know each other socially?

Bond

Well, the new Miss Galore.  Where do you hide you gold knuckles in this
outfit?

Pussy

	(escorting him forward)

Oh, uh, I never carry weapons after business hours.

Bond

Yeah?  So you're off duty.

Pussy

I'm completely defenseless.

Bond

	(looking at her)

So am I.

Pussy laughs.

AT THE FENCE

Felix continues looking through the binoculars, Johnnie beside him.

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS

Bond and Pussy walk casually across the grounds toward a stable.

FELIX

lowers the binoculars and passes them to Johnnie.

Felix

That's my James.

TRACKING SHOT - BOND AND PUSSY

They walk past the stable, her arm still linked through his.

Bond

Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.

Pussy

Yes.  I'm glad you're enjoying it.

Bond

Too bad it all has to end tomorrow morning.

He faces Pussy.  She looks back at him.

Bond

He's quite mad, you know.

Pussy keeps looking at him.

Bond turns to the entrance to the stable.

Bond

Well, now.  What do we have here?

He walks inside, Pussy following.

AT THE FENCE

Felix looks through the binoculars again.

Felix

Double-o-seven seems to have the situation well in hand.  Come on, I'm
bushed.  Let's get back to the motel.

They turn away toward the Thunderbird.

INT. STABLE - DAY - SAME TIME

Bond paces in front of Pussy.

Bond

You're quite a girl, Pussy.

Pussy

I'm strictly the outdoor type.

Bond

I'd like to think you're not in on all of this, uh, caper.

Pussy

Skip it.  I'm not interested.  Let's go.

He grabs her arm and turns her back.

Bond

What would it take for you to see things my way?

Pussy

A lot more than you've got.

Bond

	(looking into her eyes)

How do you know?

Pussy

	(looking back)

I don't want to know.

She turns to the door again.  He grabs her and holds her back.

Bond

Isn't it customary to grant the condemned man his last request?

Pussy

You've asked for this.

She hurls him with a Judo move.  He summersaults and lands on his butt
in hay.  He looks back at her.  She exhales.

Pussy walks up to him.

Pussy

Get up!

Bond grabs her leg and drops her into the hay.

Bond

	(rising)

Certainly.

He offers a hand to help her up.  She rises.  She tries to throw him but
he twists her around and tosses her over his back.  She lands in the
hay.

She recovers and looks back, glaring.

Bond smiles, walks toward her and sits beside her.

Bond

There.  Now let's both play.

She tries to kick him but he jumps on top of her.  She places her hands
at his throat, trying to push him away, but he steadily lowers himself. 
She turns her head to the side.

Bond's mouth comes down on hers and they kiss.  Struggling at first,
Pussy finally relents and lets him kiss her.  Her hands move from his
neck to his shoulders, then the flings her arms around him.

hands him a wooden box.

Kisch opens it.  Inside is a measuring device with a meter registering
"TOXIC UNITS PER CC X100" and a label that says "AURIC SPECTROMETER." 
The needle is at zero.

Kisch gives the box back to the Korean.

across the top of the door.

The guards aim it further along.  Kisch watches.  The beam keeps
cutting.

The guards aim it further to the side.  Bond and Oddjob watch.  The beam
reaches the other end of the door.

controls.  Ling sets his box on the shielding.  Bond, Goldfinger and
Oddjob look on.

Ling takes a primer from the box and places it in a slot by the
controls.

Goldfinger signals up to the control room.  A guard nods, turns to a
switchboard and looks down through a viewer.
