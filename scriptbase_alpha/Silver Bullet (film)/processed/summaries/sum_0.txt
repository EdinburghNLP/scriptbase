The small town of Tarker's Mills was a place that was very peaceful, where nothing extraordinary ever happened until one night when murders began.
The townspeople believe it's some maniacal killer on the loose whom they intend to hunt down.
Marty, a young handicapped boy, believes the killer is no man at all, but a werewolf.
After a run-in with the werewolf, Marty and his sister Jane hunt all over town for the man who is the werewolf.
