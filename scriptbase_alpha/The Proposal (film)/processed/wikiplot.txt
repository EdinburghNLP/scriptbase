Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is an executive editor in chief of a book publishing company.
After learning she is about to be deported to Canada because of an expired visa, she persuades her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), to marry her.
Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare), a U.S. immigration agent, informs them that he suspects they are committing fraud to avoid Margaret's deportation.
Gilbertson tells them that they'll be asked questions about each other separately.
If their answers don't match, Margaret will be deported to Canada and Andrew will be convicted of a felony punishable by a $250,000 fine and five years in prison.
Andrew insists that Margaret make him an editor after their marriage and publish his book.
Margaret agrees.

The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, Andrew's home town, to meet his family.
Margaret meets Andrew's mother Grace (Mary Steenburgen) and grandmother Annie a.k.a "Gammy" (Betty White).
During the trip to the family home, Margaret notices that nearly every shop in town carries the name Paxton and learns that Andrew's family is in fact very wealthy.
During a welcome home party, Andrew confronts his father, Joe (Craig T. Nelson), who is angry about Andrew's dating the boss he has so long disliked and thinks he is using her to get ahead in his career.
After their argument, Andrew announces the engagement to everyone.
Margaret also meets Gertrude (Malin Åkerman), Andrew's ex-girlfriend.
After the party is over, Grace and Gammy show Margaret and Andrew the bedroom they will share during the weekend.

The next day, Grace and Annie take Margaret to a local bar to watch a strip dance by a locally famous but over-the-hill exotic dancer, Ramone (Oscar Nunez).
Stepping away from the show, Margaret learns from Gertrude that Andrew wanted to become an editor and make his own life and that Andrew had proposed to Gertrude.
However, Gertrude refused because she didn't want to leave Sitka for New York.
Returning home, Margaret learns of the conflict between Andrew and Joe.
That night, Margaret asks Andrew about his relationship with his father, but Andrew refuses to talk.
Instead, Margaret opens up to Andrew.

The next day, the family convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka.
After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away from town with him.
She tells him she has been alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had forgotten what it felt like to have a family.
She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat.
Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat.
Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her.
At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty four hours to leave for Canada.
Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things.
Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving his book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it.
Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks if he is going to go after her.
As he rushes out of the house to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe.
Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she "passes away".
Annie admits faking the attack.
Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret.
Andrew goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff.
They kiss and then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time.
