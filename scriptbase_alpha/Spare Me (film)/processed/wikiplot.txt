This film is the story of Theo (Lawton Paseka), the "Bad Boy of Bowling", suspended from the pro-tour for bashing an opponent in the head on national TV.
Desperate to circumvent the 100-year suspension and get back into the game, Theo seeks out his estranged father Buzz, a man of legendary power in the bowling world - a man he has never met.

But Buzz has turned to the dark side of the sport and runs an illegal dwarf bowling operation with his nefarious partner Miles Kastle.
"And nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it."

Kastle's pyromaniac daughter Sheila (Christie MacFadyen) has the hots for Theo.
Her psychotic brother Junior has just broken out of a mental institution and wants to murder Buzz.
Kastle offers to get Theo back in the pins - for a price, and Theo finds himself faced with one of the impossible 7-10 splits of life.
