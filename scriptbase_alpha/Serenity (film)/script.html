<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
          It's a group of twelve-year-olds, serious and well dressed.
          They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small
          wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them. The
          tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage. People walk
          about and vehicles glide quietly overhead. A utopian vista.

<b>          GIRL
</b>          Now that the war's over, our
          soldiers get to come home, yes?

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          Some of them. Some will be
          stationed on the rim planets as
          Peace Enforcers.

<b>          BOY
</b>          I don't understand. Why were the
          Independents even fighting us?
          Why wouldn't they look to be more
          civilized?

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          That's a good question. Does
          anybody want to open on that?

<b>          GIRL
</b>          I hear they're cannibals.

<b>          ANOTHER BOY
</b>          That's only Reavers.

<b>          ANOTHER GIRL
</b>          Reavers aren't real.

<b>          ANOTHER BOY
</b>          Full well they are. They attack
          settlers from space, they kill
          them and wear their skins and rape
          them for hours and hours --

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          (in Chinese)
<b>          
</b>
<b>          (CALMER)
</b>          It's true that there are...
          dangers on the outer planets. So
          let's follow up on Borodin's
          question. With all the social and
          medical advancements we can bring
          to the Independents, why would
          they fight so hard against us?

</b>
<b>          RIVER
</b>          We meddle.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          River? 
          RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand
          and "typing" with the other. (Typing consists of holding a
          long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different
          columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen.) She is
          a good two years younger than the other kids.

<b>          RIVER
</b>          People don't like to be meddled
          with. We tell them what to do,
          what to think, don't run don't
          walk we're in their homes and in
          their heads and we haven't the
          right. We're meddlesome.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          (gently taking her

<b>          STYLUS)
</b>          River, we're not telling people
          what to think. We're just trying
          to show them how.
          She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's forehead

<b>          INT. LAB - NIGHT
</b>
           And we FLASH CUT to the actual present: a 16 year old RIVER
          sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one
          right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a
          technician. A second monitors her brain patterns.
          The lab is cold, blue, steel. Insidiously clean.

<b>          2ND TECHNICIAN
</b>          She's dreaming.

<b>          FIRST TECHNICIAN
</b>          Nightmare?

<b>          2ND TECHNICIAN
</b>          Off the charts. Scary monsters.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight-
          drop.
          DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for
          that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied
          with himself.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          4.
</b>          Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And
          making him a little nervous.
          The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates
          -- no
          substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton
          longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          See, most of our best work is done
          when they're asleep. We can
          monitor and direct their
          subconscious, implant
          suggestions...
          River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector
          starts forward, slowly.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          It's a little startling to see,
          but the results are spectacular.
          Especially in this case. River
          Tam is our star pupil.
          The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold,
          staring at the girl with no emotion at all. His name, as we
          will very soon learn, is SIMON.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          I've heard that.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          She's a genius. Her mental
          capacity is extraordinary, even
          with the side-effects.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          Tell me about them.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Well, obviously, she's unstable...
          the neural stripping gives them
          heightened cognitive reception,
          but it also destabilizes their own
          reality matrix. It manifests as
          borderline schizophrenia... which
          at this point is the price for
          being truly psychic.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          (moves toward her)
          What use do we have for a psychic
          if she's insane?

<b>          5.
</b>
<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          I don't have to tell you the
          security potential of someone who
          can read minds. And she has lucid
          periods -- we hope to improve upon
          the... I'm sorry, Sir, I have to
          ask if there's some reason for
          this inspection.

<b>          SIMON
</b>
<b>          (TURNING)
</b>          Am I making you nervous?

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Key members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.
          I was told their support for the
          project was unanimous. The
          demonstration of her power --

<b>          SIMON
</b>          (turns back to her)
          How is she physically?

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>           Like nothing we've seen. All our
          subjects are conditioned for
          combat, but River... she's a
          creature of extraordinary grace.

<b>          400
</b>
<b>          SIMON
</b>          Yes. She always did love to dance.
          He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.

<b>          ANGLE: THE BATON
</b>          As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade),
          flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting
          forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room,
          flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out.
          Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her
          head and swabs her, whispering:

<b>          SIMON
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          River. Wake up. Please, it's
          Simon. River. It's your brother.
          Wake up...
          She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking
          out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly's tunic
          beneath.

<b>          6.
</b>          River is suddenly next to him. He jumps a little.

<b>          RIVER
</b>          Simon.
          A beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion.

<b>          RIVER
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          They know you've come.

<b>          INT. GUARD STATION - CONTINUING
</b>
          As a guard looks at a monitor. He mostly resembles a secret
          service man -- more bureaucrat than thug. A second man rolls
          into frame on a chair behind him, also watching the screen.

<b>          INT. RESEARCH CENTER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING
</b>
          Simon walks River through the corridor. They approach a pair
          of double doors.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          We can't make it to the surface
          from inside.
          Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at
          them from the other side of the doors.
          4wo SIMON

<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          Find a --
          But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab
          equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds
          herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and
          outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support.
          The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing
          the lone orderly. Passing right under River.

<b>           EXT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          It's small, 15 feet by 15 feet. Goes a long way up and a
          long way down. One wide hinged window looks in on the hall
          inside. Simon and River approach with quiet haste.
          They slip through the window. Simon shuts it, wedges his
          baton into the handle as the SECURITY AGENTS APPROACH. They
          fire at the glass, but their lasers have no effect.
          Wind whips River's hair about as she looks up to see a small
          patch of daylight visible ten stories up. Sees the sky
          blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them.

</b>          ANGLE: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills,
          the city gleaming far beyond. This facility is well hidden.
          A gurney-sized section of the ship's belly detaches and drops
          down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship. It
          comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          Get on!
          He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is
          right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might.
          Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as
          the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up
          in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her
          holding one of the cables --

</b>
<b>           (CONTINUING)
</b>          Lovely. Lovely. Backtrack.
          The action REVERSES, taking us back to the moment of Simon
          and River on the gurney just before it rises.

          There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and
          he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event.
          The Government's man. We'll just call him THE OPERATIVE.
          He is thoughtful, a little removed. Wire-rimmed glasses, a
          suit too nondescript to be a uniform, too neat to be casual
          wear. He is in:

          -- which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic
          records, a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of
          Simon and River floats), and a table with computer and chair.
          The Operative crosses to the table, looks over some papers.

          Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from
          the opening) and a nervous young female intern following.
          Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Excuse me! No one is allowed in
          the records room without my
          express permission.

</b>          (over this, quietly)
          Enter the doctor.
          (to Mathias)
          Forgive me. I prefer to see the
          event alone, without bias.
          Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          I need to see your clearance.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          You're right to insist. I know
          you've had security issues here.
          He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks
          at the readout, and drops the bluster.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Apologies. An Operative of the
          Parliament will of course have
          full cooperation.
          (looks at screen)
          I'm not sure what... I see no
          listing of rank, or name.

          A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until
          her brother walked in eight months
          ago and took her from you.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          It's not quite so simple.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          I'm very aware of that.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          He came in with full creds. He
          beat the ap-scan, the retinal...
          There was no way I could --

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          No, no. Of course. The boy spent
          his fortune developing the
          contacts to infiltrate this place.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Gave up a brilliant future in.

</b>          Madness, no. Something a good

          looked at this scan carefully? At

</b>          It's love, in point of fact. He
          loved his sister and he knew she

</b>          Why are you here?

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          I'm here because the situation is
          even less simple than you think.

</b>          It's pride.
          He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps
          to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating:

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Key members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.
          I was told their support --

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          She was... she read cards, nothing
          more.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          It's come to our attention that
          River became much more unstable,
          more... disturbed, after you
          showed her off to Parliament. Did
          she see something very terrible in
          those cards?

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Whatever... secrets she might have
          accidentally gleaned... it's

          beneath --

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          But they are in her. Her mind is
          unquiet. It's the will of the

          the brother. Because of your sin.

          to his briefcase)
          You know, in certain older
          civilized cultures, when men
          failed as entirely as you have,
          they would throw themselves on
          their swords.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          (fed up)
          Well, unfortunately I forgot to
          bring a sword to --
          The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          The Parliament has no further
          interest in psychics. They
          represent a threat to the harmony
          and stability of our Alliance.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          I would put that down right now if
          I were you.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          Would you be killed in your sleep,
          like an ailing pet? Whatever your
          failings, I believe you deserve
          better than that.
          The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him
          with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out
          his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent
          reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm.
          The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as
          quietly as the first.
          Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He
          bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine.
          Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile.
          The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace
          for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and
          holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point
          tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror
          as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it.
          The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door.

          back to us. No matter how far out
          Simon has taken her, we can --
          He's almost startled when the Doctor's body drops into frame,
          slowed suddenly by the sword. It squeaks down the blade, the
          Doctor unable to cry out, as the Operative whispers to him:

          of them, better worlds.
          Mathias is dead. The Operative pulls the sword out as the
          body rolls over. As he wipes the sword down:

          We move away from the ship. The name is on the nose, under
          the bridge. It sticks out from the body of the ship like a
          craning neck. The body is bulbous, with propulsion engines
          on either side and a giant glowing back. There are two small
          shuttles tucked in over the 'wings' of the engines. It's not
          the sleekest ship in the 'verse, to be sure.
          As it hits atmo, the propulsion engines take over and she
          starts to rock a bit, noise filling our ears. Camera comes
          around the front, at the windows and into the bridge, to see
          the Captain, MALCOLM 'MAL' REYNOLDS, standing and watching.
          At that moment, a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes
          flying past the window.

          [Note: the following sequence will take us through the ship
          in one extended STEADICAM shot.]
          The bridge is small: two pilot seats on either side, and a
          tangle of wires and machinery all about.
          Mal wears the knee-length brown coat and boots of an old
          Independent. Gun at his hip. He's not unlike the ship --
          he's seen a bit of the world and it left him, emotionally at
          least, weathered. Right now, though, he's mostly startled.

          ladders leading down to crew's personal quarters.
          The hulking mercenary JAYNE is coming up out of his bunk as

</b>
          It's the communal space of the ship, homey and messy. There
          is food left lying on the table. Mal swipes a dumpling from
          a plate, pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and
          sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor.

          Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the
          doorway, raising his voice above the din.

          He turns to see Simon behind him. Simon is more seasoned
          than before, but still contrasts the Captain entirely in
          dress and manner. He is implacably proper. Also pissed.

          This is my boat. Y'all are guests

          He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to:

<b>          INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING
</b>
          Simon is right on his heels as we lead them down the stairs.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          Guests? I earn my passage,

<b>          MAL

          the middle of that.

<b>          MAL
</b>          Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'.
          It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine.
          The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the

</b>          Honestly, doctor, I think we may

          Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mal's arm.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          Do you understand what I've gone
          through to keep River away from

</b>          Are you threatening to --

          I get -- which is less and less,
          case you ain't been keeping track.
          He starts away, Simon still keeping pace.

<b>          MAL
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          Every year since the war the
          Alliance pushes just a little
          further out towards the rim.
          Makes it a chore for naughty men
          like us to slip about -- and
          keeping you two on board means
          working twice as hard to avoid the

          They enter the biggest space on the ship. Giant doors sit at
          the front, which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering
          ramp. Catwalks surround the space, leading up at the front to
          the foredeck hall. We've come all the way through Serenity.

<b>          MAL
</b>          So here is us, on the raggedy
          edge. Don't push me and I won't
          push you. 
          Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him:

</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          Things get gritty I will keep her
          from the fray, but she's coming.
          Best you get her ready.
          As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the Mule, a four-man
          hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling. Jayne and
          Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it.

<b>          MAL
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          Zoe, is Wash gonna straighten this
          boat out before we get flattened?

<b>          ZOE
</b>          Like a downy feather, sir. Nobody
          flies like my mister.
          The camera picks up Simon's feet as they enter foreground on
          the catwalk, and track with them to find:

<b>          SIMON
</b>          River...
          She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose
          summer dress draped over her small frame.

<b>          RIVER
</b>          I know. We're going for a ride.

<b>          EXT. LILAC -- DESERT GULCH - DAY
</b>
          Serenity settles gently down as the cargo bay door opens.

<b>          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
</b>
          The chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship.
          The mule floats just above the floor, Jayne piling in next to
          River in the back:

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>          SIMON
</b>          Now, River, you stay behind the
          others. If there's fighting you
          drop to the floor or run away.
          It's okay to leave them to die.
          River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother.

<b>          RIVER
</b>          I'm the brains of the operation.

<b>          ZOE
</b>          We should hit town right during
          Sunday worship. Won't be any
          crowds.

<b>          MAL
</b>          If Fanty and Mingo are right about
          the payroll, this could look to be
          a sunny day for us.

<b>          SIMON
</b>
<b>          (APPROACHING)
</b>          Captain, I'll ask you one last
          time...

<b>          MAL
</b>          Doctor, I'm taking your sister
          under my protection here. If
          anything happens to her, anything
          at all, I swear to you I will get
          very choked up. Honestly. There
          could be tears.
          He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him...

<b>          KAYLEE
</b>          Don't mind the Captain none,
          Simon. I know he'll look out for
          her.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          It's amazing. I bring River all
          the way out to the raggedy edge of
          the 'verse so she can hide from
          the Alliance by robbing banks.

<b>          KAYLEE
</b>          It's just a little Trading
          Station. They'll be back 'fore

<b>          EXT. LILAC - DAY
</b>
          We see the town sprawled before us, as the mule heads in.
          The town embodies the lives of folk out here: adobe and wood
          mix with metal and plastic -- whatever's on hand to build
          with. Right now the streets are mainly empty.

<b>          EXT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING
</b>
          The mule pulls up, Zoe hitching it as they speak:

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          What are we hoping to find here
          that equals the worth of a turd?

<b>          MAL
</b>          Alliance payroll. There's peace
          enforcing squads stationed all
          about this quadrant. Can't use
          credits out here -- they got to
          pay their boys in cashy money.
          Which once a month rests here.

<b>          ZOE
</b>          Something about stealing from the
          Alliance just warms a body like
          whiskey in winter.

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          (cocks his gun)
          Shiny. Let's be badguys.
          Mal turns back to River.

<b>          MAL
</b>          You ready to go to work, darlin'?

<b>          RIVER
</b>          There's no pattern to the pebbles
          here, they're completely random.
          I tried to count them but you
          drove too fast. Hummingbird.

<b>          MAL
</b>          (never mind)
          Right. Great. Let's go.

<b>          INT. TRADING STATION - DAY

          We are in a camera's eye view, right above the door.

</b>          The door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following
          and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking.
          Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with
          "Welcome to Lilac" on it for the millisecond before it's
          blown to bits.
          There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers,
          farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids. It's a combination
          post-office, general store, bank, and most other things.

<b>          MAL
</b>          Hands and knees and heads bowed
          down! Everybody, now!
          Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others.
          Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks.
          Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very
          much new in design.
          The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a
          great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right
          upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! --
          bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold.

<b>          MAL
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          Y'all wanna be looking very
          intently at your own belly
          buttons. I see a head start to
          rise, violence is gonna ensue.
          The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else.
          Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty
          shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform.

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          Looks like this is the place.
          He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front
          door. She does, and River steps in.
          ANGLE: RIVER'S BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched-
          over customers as Mal addresses them.

<b>          MAL
</b>          You've probably guessed we mean to
          be thieving here, but what we are
          after is not yours. So let's have
          no undue fussing.
          As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office,
          finding the small vault locked.

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          She's locked up.
          River suddenly looks around, perturbed.
          CLOSE ON: a young tough.
          River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the
          young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt.
          He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek.

<b>          ZOE
</b>          You know what the definition of a
          hero is? It's someone who gets
          other people killed. You can look
          it up later.
          He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor.
          Mal moves to the Trade Agent. Hauls him up, tosses him
          toward the vault. Zoe and Jayne follow.

<b>          TRADE AGENT
</b>          This is just a crop moon, don't
          think you'll find what you --

<b>          MAL

<b>          140 
</b>          The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall
          safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive.
          Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in.

<b>          ZOE
</b>          At last. We can retire and give
          up this life of crime.
          Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot
          hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming
          metal and blue light. Zoe smiles. Jayne peers down as Mal
          addresses the Trade Agent.

          The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below.

          Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into:

<b>          INT. VAULT - CONTINUING
</b>
          Which is as modern as something off the Central Planets. A
          short corridor leads to a real vault door, that the guard is
          already opening. Behind that door, a few bags of the real
          deal: neatly stacked cash, waiting to be robbed.

<b>          INT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          We move in on River as something crosses her face. Worry.

<b>          EXT. TRADING STATION - DAY

          The doors burst open, Jayne and Zoe coming out first, Mal
          behind with River in hand. She is freaked, in her own space.
          Jayne and Zoe throw the bags on --

          1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands
          River up to Jayne's care. As the craft powers up, slowly
          moving, the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon
          bursts out of the station, grabbing the back of the mule.

</b>          It's too many. Drive, Zoe.
          A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size
          of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded
          conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator,
          pure. It disappears over the rooftops.

          Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors
          it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust.
          As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows
          and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun.
          He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back.
          Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the
          chest, slumps down dead.

<b>          ANGLE: THE EDGE OF TOWN
</b>          As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff
          shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street,
          right abreast of our gang.

<b>          ANGLE: THE CENTER OF TOWN
</b>          We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one
          come to hover over it, Reavers dropping down on cable lines
          to swarm into it.

          The mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain.
          The skiff swings closer, but Jayne peppers it with automatic
          fire and it swings away. There is sporadic return fire.

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          How come they ain't blowing us out
          of the air?

          River is squashed down on her back, being very small.

          The line holding the harpoon is split by Mal's third shot.

          Serenity rushes across the desert floor, not much higher off

          Simon moves next to the huge sliding doors at the front, hits
          a couple of buttons. The doors pull open, as the huge ramp
          beyond them opens down, letting in a rush of wind and light.

          The mule reaches the flats, away from the rocks.

           And only its forward momentum keeps it from being squashed as

          A flaming portion of the top flies in, skids to the floor as
          small fires erupt from the mule as well -- Simon pulls a
          lever and jets of C02 shoot out of the floor.
          Simon hits the button to start the outer ramp closing, then
          runs to the mule. The C02 stops and he finds River sitting
          in her seat, completely unharmed. Zoe is climbing painfully
          out of the other seat, Mal and Jayne both having been thrown.

          A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top.
           He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth --
           Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe
           both fire at the same time. The freak takes too long to go
           down, but down he goes. Dies sitting against the s i op.

</b>
          And here she is, moving back and down into frame, her eyes
          half closed in passion. She settles on a cluster of brocaded
          pillows, and we see another head lowering in for a kiss...
          Come around to see it's another lovely young woman -- and
          that there is a group of ten others watching intently, all in
          saris, on their knees. Two handsome young men with shaved
          heads in the back, also on their knees.
          Inara stops before the kiss, smiling and coming back up. She
          speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she
          repositions the one she's with, lowering again; showing her
          the motion of surrender as if it were a dance step.

          the woman whose voice we heard. She hands Inara a drink.

<b>          INARA
</b>          On Sihnon we started training at
          twelve. Years of discipline and
          preparation before the physical
          act of pleasure was even
          mentioned. Most of these girls --

<b>          SHEYDRA
</b>          They're all of good family, the
          highest academic standards --

<b>          INARA
</b>          Control. Was the first lesson.
          And the last and these worlds are
          not like the Central Planets.
          There is barbarism dressed up in
          the most civil weeds. Men of the
          highest rank who don't know the
          difference between a Companion and
          a common whore. It's unsafe.

<b>          SHEYDRA
</b>          All the more reason the girls look
          to you. You came out here alone,
          before the Alliance ever thought
          to establish a House this remote.
          You've seen so much. You're a
          figure of great romance to them.

          Great romance has nothing to do
          with being a Companion, Sheydra.

          We start on a CorVue screen, showing a news report. On the
          screen is a shot of the town our gang robbed, now half of it
          a smoking ruin.

          blinking light behind it, come THROUGH the wiring of the back
          to look out at the bar, with the word "recording" in the
          corner. Every screen is a camera, even down here.

<b>          40
</b>          We pick up Mal and Kaylee heading down into the bar. Cutting
          away from the camera's view, we can looks two stories
          straight down as they go, to a close group of dark tables and
          booths and a second screen playing in the corner.

          They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have

          Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the

</b>          Miranda.
          She turns and looks back at the crowd.
          What happens next happens very fast.
           She strides silently to the first table -- two men drinking
          quietly -- and she slams her foot into one's face, then whips
           it back into the other's, knocking them both unconscious as --
           people are turning, just registering that this girl --
          kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a
          bottle off it behind her -- the bottle hits a man behind her
          square in the face, a man she never even looked at -- people
          are rising, fleeing or pushing forward --

          precision -- Two men come from either side, one whipping out
          a knife -- she does a perfect split, grabs his wrist above
          her head, using his momentum to stab the other one --
          Mal fights to get back to the gunrack. The bouncer reaches
          her and she wrests his shockrod from him, uses it on him, on
          Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls
          the rod at her head, knocks her cold...
          She's everywhere. On tables, chairs, under your legs, using
          the room itself to take out every single person there. One
          man hides behind a wall -- impossibly, she swings her leg
          around the corner and nails his face.

          spins, facing him, and flat-heels his nose with her palm,
          V0 twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over, dispatching
           of another while she cracks Jayne's head with a small table --
          Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to
          scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut --
          Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River
          knocks the other guy's gun in the air, kicks someone else and
          then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up with
          his, they are pointed right at each other --

          And River drops to the ground, fast asleep.
          There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and Simon,
          who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing.
          He looks down at River. She lies unconscious, helpless.

</b>          No. Right. But I think somehow
          when they triggered you it brought
          this up, this memory --

<b>          RIVER
</b>          It isn't mine. The memory. I

</b>          Don't say that. Not ever. We'll
          get through this.
          She reaches out and touches his face, affectionately.

</b>          Things are going to get much much
          worse.

           She is nestled in a gorge, overhanging rocks all but burying
          her from view. The shuttle on the right lifts off from the
          side of the ship and glides off, keeping low.

           A line of young trainees files by in robes and red shawls
          pulled over their heads -- one trainee a good deal larger
          than the others.

<b>          INT. INARA'S ROOM - LATER
</b>
          She is kneeling in front of a statue of Buddha, lighting a
          few incense sticks.
          The room is sparsely lush -- not as opulent as the shuttle
          where she entertained men, but still beautifully furnished
          and draped. A lace curtain hangs in front of the light,
          casting its pattern in shadow over everything. Including the
          rather large figure in a red shawl who kneels beside Inara.

<b>          MAL

          Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all
          around it, and tosses it to the Operative.

          He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The
          Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway.
          The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind.

          He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a
          blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts,
          but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds.
          Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative
          kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets
          to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose
          dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.

</b>          Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's
          precision is wearing Mal down.
          Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick
          V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara,
          breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara
          places her hand on his arm.
          The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out
          his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of
          fascination as he looks at it.

          a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound.

<b>          40

          The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored
          soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and
          Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them.

          grenade out of his pocket. Pops the top and hurls it over at
          the foursome.
          CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out
          one by one, counting down --

          soundlessly in the nothing of space.

          And we pull back out to see the whole of Serenity for the

          within, long scars, welded-on parts and war paint... the

          about. Some turn in gentle drifts, as though looking around.

          area, so that the nose is sticking back out at the runway but
          the body of the ship is hidden from it.

          A massive harpoon CRASHES through the windshield and impales
          him to his chair. It's as thick around as a telephone pole.
          Wash has time to open his mouth in surprise before he is dead.

          Mal rips her away and to the floor as another projectile
          slams through the window into the wall above them.

<b>          EXT. LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING

          We see the ship that has fired the harpoons as Reavers start
          out of it. A second Reaver vessel enters frame from above,
          about to land next to it.

          The cargo bay door opens -- just the little door housed
          inside the ramp -- and Jayne comes out with his biggest gun.
          He looks up, toward the edge of the runway, but no Reavers
          have arrived yet.

<b>          JAYNE

          The entire crew piles out, all heavily bedecked with weapons.

          A small double-sized doorway leads to the "Black Room", which
          is the entrance proper to the facility.
          Mal hits a button and huge, thick, blast doors open from the
          sides AND the top and bottom, creating the effect of a square
          hole getting bigger. The hall itself is smaller than the
          black room, but still has the arrows on the ceiling, that
          point to an elevator some fifty feet away.

          In the black room, the door nearly buckles from the
          explosion. Everyone takes positions behind the crates. Zoe
          stands calmly, her back to the door, loading her sawed-off.

          He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look
          for as long as they can. Then he's in the elevator and gone.

          He looks back at their army: A companion, a doctor, a

          The elevator stops and Mal makes his way to the island of
          screens and machines in the center of the space.
          The first thing he takes in is that every broadwave port has
          been destroyed. The second:

          from his chair.

<b>          V0
</b>          Mal comes close. Nothing. He starts to move away again and
          the lovebot turns her head, her eyes focusing with an audible
          whir. She speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness,
          and a warped, computery version of Mr Universe's voice.

          to go helpless on us.

          Jayne and I take the first wave.
          Nobody shoots less they get past

          Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as hell. The bangs on
          the door continue.

<b>          KAYLEE

          Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the
          door.

          down, having clearly entered from a different location.

          Mal has reached it and surveys the situation.
          Before him is a railing, and he can look down on the
          generator shaft. It's miles deep, with machines rotating and
          grinding, and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it.
          On the other side is a platform, with the broadwave console
          sitting behind a clear plastic partition. Cables and chains
          run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs.

          The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to
          squeeze through and charge.
          Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head. He arcs back hard
          as the second comes, Zoe shoots him, calmly walking toward
          the door --

          bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing, single shots,
          each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo.
          The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the
          precision of military training still in her as she flips him,
          wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame,
          bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open
          and she's rushed from behind ---
           But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot,

          comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a
          blade, she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in
          his neck.

          Mal is on the railing, reaching for the 'rungs' on the
          ceiling just above him. He can almost get them -- one wrong
          move and he pitches into the jaws of death...
          A laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches, legs
          sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the
          backs of his legs, flipping painfully onto his face as he
          falls, mercifully, back onto the platform.
          The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot
          as Mal gets shakily up.

          master, shoots the gun out of the Operative's hand and gets
          two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover.

          The Operative hides behind some machinery. Tries to peek out
          at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover.
          Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him, starts
          going hand over hand to the island, moving as fast as he can.
          The Operative sees his moment, dives for his gun -- but it's
          been ruined by Mal's shot. He looks over at Mal with death
          in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and
          grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another.
          He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies
          4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the
          Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and
          pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes
          swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform.
          He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward
          the platform from above.

          River watches, the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and
          starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like
          projectiles. She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the
          projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as

          and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything
          suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly, one foot
          lifted, a confused expression on his face -- then speeding
          right back up as he slams down on his back, gasping for air.
          River's mouth opens in a scream she doesn't make.
          Blood spreads from Simon's belly. Inara rushes to him, grabs
          cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon's hand on it.

          She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she DIVES
          through the hole in the doors, then Simon SCREAMS her name,
          the scream following us back into the Black Room where River
          lands in a perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers.
          Without a moment's hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets
          the doors closing. She dodges a blade, but a blow to,the
          back of the head shakes her. She weaves around a couple of
          Reavers to get to the closing doors, but at the last second
          her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her.
          The last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm
          over her.
          ANGLE: THE BLAST DOORS, as they shut with a shuddering RLUNG.

<b>          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          Mal gets up the chain to the platform. The Operative is on
          Mal before he gets his footing, tackles him as Mal's gun goes
          skittering over the edge into oblivion. There is a railing
          here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back with
          a couple of hammer blows, gets the Operative off him.
          They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest,
          knocking over tools and computer parts.
          The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword
          gracefully from the holster under his jacket.
          Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver.
          He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets
          inside sword range and tries for the neck with the
          screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the sword
          point against the edge of Mal's stomach. Starts pushing
          slowly, despite Mal's resistance, and breaks skin.

          all the way through Mal's belly. Mal's eyes go wide.

</b>          You know what your sin is, Malcolm?

          Aw hell, I'm a fan of all seven.
          He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so
          hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword. The
          Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the
          screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it,
          gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck
          in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin.
          The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword
          still in his belly.

          He stabs down at his foe's face -- but the Operative rolls
          out of the way, kicks Mal from the ground and is up in a
          second, grabbing Mal's sword hand -- the sword drops -- and
          punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound.

          Mal goes down hard, spitting up blood. He sees the sword,
          moves -- but the Operative kicks him in the face. Picks him
          lod up, Mal too tired to throw a decent punch.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          I'm sorry.
          The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right
          into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias
          with. Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of pain.
          The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword.
          Mal trembles, trying to move -- but nothing happens.

          He lunges -- and Mal twists gracefully out of the way,
          grabbing the Operative's swordhand and pulling it forward --
          while driving his elbow into the Operative's neck with
          staggering force.

</b>          Iwo Well, I'm known for that.
          The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back,
          unable to make a sound.
          Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own
          through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his
          arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we
          hear his arms crack.
          Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his
          sword, saying:

           the clear plastic partition, right in front of the Operative.
           There are images first of the city -- of bodies, on the
           street, in homes and offices... image after image, jus.t as

          piles of Reavers already, she never breaks concentration as
          she uses their own blades against them, throws them, does
          everything in her power to stay one step ahead of -- or
          above -- the mob.
          She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors --

          Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons,
          as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to
          reveal River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver
          blades, is bloody but unbowed. And the only one alive.
          We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped
          completely away.
          Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the

          We are close on a gravestone. It is rounded, looks more like
          a bell than a headstone. It is topped by a jar built'into
          the stone. The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom, but
          glass in the middle. Inside the glass we can see one of
          those slightly moving photos. It is of Mr Universe and his
          lovebot, and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the
          stone beneath.
          The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone,
          40 this one bearing the image and inscription: Shepherd Derrial
          Book.
          The third is Hoban Washburne. Wash.
          The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses
          a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it
          instead of a picture-jar. And fixing another slip of paper
          to it is River.
          She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise. They're
          flanked by the crew: Jayne, Inara (to whom Mal moves),
          Simon, who stands holding River before him and hand in hand
          with Kaylee. He has a crutch supporting his other side.
          There is a moment, then they all move aside, saying nothing.
          Between them walks Zoe, in a simple white funeral gown,
          holding a burning taper.
          She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to
          the rocket fuse. Stands back with the others.
          The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky. They all watch
          its sputtering tail a moment, then it it explodes in a series

<b>          W MAL
</b>          They take you down, I don't expect
          to grieve overmuch. Like to kill
          you myself, I see you again.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          You won't. There is...
          (small, grim smile)
          .nothing left to see.
          Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head
          inside. The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops
          to look up at the nose of the ship.
          ANGLE: the newly painted Serenity, standing tall in the rain.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          "Serenity". You lost everything
          in that battle. Everything you
          had, everything you were... how
          did you go on?
          Mal hits the button to close the inner doors, steps inside as
          they slide together. Glances at the Operative, unimpressed.

<b>          VAO
</b>
<b>          MAL
</b>          You still standing there when the
          engine starts, you never will
          figure it out.
          The Operative watches the door shut. A moment, and he goes.

<b>          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
</b>
          Mal stows the gear as Zoe approaches.

<b>          MAL
</b>          (to himself)
          What a whiner...

<b>          ZOE
</b>          Sir, we have a green light.
          Inspection's pos and we're clear
          for upthrust.

<b>          MAL
</b>          Think she'll hold together?

<b>          J

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          124.
</b>
<b>          ZOE
</b>          She's tore up plenty. But she'll
          fly true.

<b>          VW
</b>          A beat between them before:

<b>          MAL
</b>          Make sure everything's secure.
          Could be bumpy.

<b>          ZOE
</b>          Always is.
          She takes off and Mal heads up the stairs.

<b>          INT. FOREDECK HALL - CONTINUING
</b>
          Mal comes in and runs into Inara. Jayne passes through as
          they talk, heading down into his bunk. Pays them no mind.
          Neither do Simon and Kaylee, in the dining room stowing
          supplies.

<b>          MAL
</b>          We're taking her out. Should be
          about a day's ride to get you back
          to your girls.

<b>          INARA
</b>          Right.

<b>          VW
</b>
<b>          MAL
</b>          (moving past her)
          You ready to get off this heap and
          back to a civilized life?

<b>          INARA
</b>          I, uh...
          (he stops)
          I don't know.
          He looks at her, a smile in his eyes.

<b>          MAL
</b>          Good answer.
          He turns and heads into the bridge.

<b>          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
</b>
          Mal eases himself into his seat. Takes a moment to adjust
          one of Wash's dashboard dinosaurs, then looks to his left.

<b>          4

</b>
<b>          MAL
</b>          You gonna ride shotgun, help me
          fly?
          V0 River is in the copilot's seat, looking intently at the
          screens and buttons.

<b>          RIVER
</b>          That's the plan.

<b>          MAL
</b>          Think you can work out how to get
          her in the --
          She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship
          hums to life.

<b>          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING
</b>
          Her engines fire up and tilt. She lifts gently off the
          ground.

<b>          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
</b>
          Mal looks slightly, only slightly nonplussed.

<b>          MAL
</b>          Okay, clearly some aptitude for
          the... but it ain't all buttons
          A0 and charts, .
          You know what the first rule of
          flying is? Well, I suppose you
          do, since you already know what
          I'm about to say.

<b>          RIVER
</b>          I do. But I like to hear you say
          it.
          He looks out at the rain on his windows, at his screens,
          taking her up as he says:

<b>          MAL
</b>          Love. You can learn all the math
          in the 'verse, but you take a boat
          in the air you don't love, she'll
          shake you off just as sure as the
          turning of worlds. Love keeps her
          in the air when she oughta fall
          down, tells you she's hurting
          'fore she keens. Makes her a home.
          River also looks out at the sky.

<b>        
</b>
<b>          126.
</b>
<b>          RIVER
</b>          Storm's getting worse.

<b>          MAL
</b>          We'll pass through it soon enough.

<b>          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING
</b>
          As we shoot up with her through sheeting rain, towards the
          top of the sky.

<b>          EXT. SPACE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          We are looking down on the stormclouds as Serenity bursts out
          of them, comes at us, flared by the sun behind the planet as
          she passes us, her Firefly effect lighting up, about to shoot
          off into the heavens --
          There is a spark and a piece of paneling pops off, whips at
          camera, blacking out the frame.

<b>          MAL (0. S . )
</b>          What was that?
