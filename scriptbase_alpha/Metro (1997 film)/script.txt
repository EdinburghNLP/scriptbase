FADE IN:

CLOSEUP OF SCOTT ROPER

He's listening to the stretch call of a horse race, and he's 
into it.

          TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
     ...at the top of the stretch it's 
     Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack 
     coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, 
     Backtrack closing...

          ROPER
     Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...

The CAMERA GRADUALLY pulls back to reveal that Roper is 
driving his Trans Am across the Bay Bridge. HELICOPTER SHOTS 
give a soaring view of the San Francisco skyline.

          TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
     At the eighth pole it's Cozy Girl by 
     half a length... Backtrack closing...

INT. CAR - DAY

Roper's police radio SQUAWKS.

          DISPATCHER (V.O.)
     One-one-four to Roper.

He picks up the radio.

          ROPER
     Dig in, Cozy Girl...
          (into the radio)
     Roper go.

          DISPATCHER (V.O.)
     One-four, Roper. Code 2.C.P. 4th and 
     Grand.

          TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
     It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy 
     Girl and Backtrack...

          ROPER
     I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.

He tosses the radio down. Punches the accelerator.

          ROPER
     Stay up there, Girl...

          TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
     Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now 
     a head...

EXT. TRANS AM - DAY

Weaving through traffic on the bridge.

          ROPER (V.O.)
     Where's the damn wire?!

          TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
     Here comes the wire... and... 
     Backtrack gets up in the last jump. 
     Cozy girl a very game second.

          ROPER (V.O.)
     SHIT!

The Trans Am streak off toward the city.

EXT. BANK - DOWNTOWN - DAY

A hostage situation. Police barricades. Dozens of squad cars, 
ambulances, spectators, SWAT team. It's a stalemate. Roper's 
Trans Am pulls to a stop at the barricades. He hops out, 
weaves through the spectators and past the barriers.

A FEMALE DETECTIVE, EIKO KIMURA, rushes up to him.

          KIMURA
     Hi, Roper.

          ROPER
     Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?

Kimura points to the diner in the middle of the block. Roper 
heads toward it. As they walk Kimura briefs him...

          KIMURA
     The suspect came in shortly after 
     the bank opened. Botched robbery. A 
     teller hit the silent alarm. He took 
     seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. 
     He's still alive. So far he's asked 
     for...

          ROPER
     ...a car.

          KIMURA
     That's right, and a plane waiting at 
     the airport. If he doesn't...

          ROPER
     ...get 'em, he's going to start 
     shooting hostages in five minutes...

          KIMURA
     That's right.

          ROPER
     What's the suspect's name?

          KIMURA
     Earl.

INT. DINER - DAY

Across from the bank. This is where the "command post" is 
setup. About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff 
are here. Lieutenant SAMUEL BAFFERT is in charge. Roper 
saunters in.

          ROPER
     Hello, guys.

          BAFFERT
     Hello, Roper. Glad you could join 
     us.

Roper walks over to the counter where Baffert is standing.

          ROPER
     Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl?

Baffert hands him a folder. Roper opens it.

          BAFFERT
     This guy is no genius.

Roper scans the profile.

          ROPER
     They're not usually graduate students.

          BAFFERT
     SWAT wants to go in.

          ROPER
     What's the rush? They haven't killed 
     anybody yet this week?

Roper refers to the folder.

          ROPER
     We got a guy who's probably on drugs. 
     He's got a record of 459's and he 
     was busted on possession. But he's 
     never been busted on a major felony. 
     What's his demeanor?

          KIMURA
     Well he's a little fucking agitated -- 
     he ripped the phone out.

          ROPER
     I have to go face to face.

          BAFFERT
     No -- you can't do that.

          ROPER
     You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of 
     them's wounded -- We don't know how 
     bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone 
     out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to 
     the head of a female hostage. If 
     SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna 
     lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go 
     in. Maybe I can see what's going on 
     in there.

          BAFFERT
     I don't know.

          ROPER
     He's never offed anybody. His rap 
     doesn't show any violence.

          BAFFERT
     Not that we know of.

          ROPER
     We don't know how much time we have. 
     If I can get in to talk to him -- 
     maybe we won't lose anyone.

          BAFFERT
     Maybe we can get a throw phone in 
     there.

          KIMURA
     SWAT says it's broken -- The perp in 
     the last situation rendered it 
     inoperable.

          BAFFERT
     What do you mean?

          KIMURA
     He urinated on it and shorted out 
     the circuits.

          ROPER
     We gonna stand here and talk about 
     it or let the guy in there bleed to 
     death.
          (beat... beat)
     Give me a dozen donuts.

Roper pulls out his gun and places it on the counter.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Roper eats the donut as he crosses toward the bank.

EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET - DAY

A team of two SWAT TEAM MEMBERS, FORBES IS A SPOTTER AND 
MCCALL IS A SHARPSHOOTER. KEVIN MCCALL, is the one we're 
interested in. He's 25 years old, handsome, all American. 
He's the best the SWAT team has.

He crouches motionless, staring through the scope of his 
rifle, watching as Roper calmly walks toward the bank.

          FORBES
     What do you think he's got in the 
     bag?

          MCCALL
     Donuts.

          FORBES
     You can't take a guy down with a 
     donut.

INT. BANK - DAY

A tense situation. A wild-eyed, white punk, fuck-up of a 
BANK ROBBER, EARL, is holding a pretty, young TELLER around 
the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple.

The other bank employees are cowering on the floor. A few 
are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half-conscious 
and oozing blood from his side.

Roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward 
Earl, very sociable.

          ROPER
     Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna 
     donut? I ate the glazed but there's 
     a bunch of chocolate and a --

Earl swipes the donuts out of Roper's hand and starts frisking 
Roper for weapons with his free hand. The other hand still 
has the gun poised at the young teller's head.

          ROPER
     I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry 
     a weapon.

Roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller. It seems to 
help. Earl finishes patting Roper down, straightens back up 
and puts his hand around the teller's neck.

          EARL
     Where's the car?

          ROPER
     I need to get something straight 
     first.

Roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on the 
floor.

          ROPER
     Who's the manager?

A balding, middle-aged MAN sheepishly raises his hand.

          MANAGER
     I am.

Roper takes a step toward him.

          ROPER
     When did you start keeping longer 
     hours?

          MANAGER
     Last spring.

          ROPER
     Really! Because I've been thinking 
     of moving to this branch. It would 
     be really convenient for me --

          EARL
     HEY, SHUT UP!

Earl wags his gun against the Teller's ear.

          EARL
     Do you want me to start killing 
     people?!

Roper holds his hand up defensively.

          ROPER
     It's my job to see that no one gets 
     killed, Earl... Including you.

          EARL
     Then where's my FUCKING car!

Earl is pouring sweat. His gun hand is shaking uncontrollably.

          ROPER
     I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to 
     do this the right way.

Roper keeps his eyes locked on Earl. His voice is calm.

          ROPER
     First I need you to point that gun 
     away from --
          (to the teller)
     What's your name?

          TELLER
          (voice trembling)
     Debbie...

          ROPER
     Point the gun away from Debbie.

          EARL
     Debbie's brains are going to be 
     splattered all over the floor if I 
     don't see a car in five minutes!

Roper takes a long look at Earl. The guy is a hair trigger.

          ROPER
     Alright! But let's be clear about 
     one thing. If you kill someone, I 
     can't help you. The SWAT guys will 
     take you out.

Earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. Reflects 
for a moment on the reality of the situation.

          EARL
     What are my chances of getting out 
     of here?

Roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying.

          ROPER
     Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a 
     bank in Daly City...

Roper crouches down, smiles at the blurry-eyed guard.

          ROPER
     How ya doin'?

The guard groans. He's not doing very well. Roper peels back 
the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. Winces.

          ROPER
          (to Earl)
     ...Cops gave him a car, and he lost 
     them on the freeway.

Earl is encouraged by that.

          EARL
     Really?

          ROPER
     Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally 
     your smartest criminals.

Roper looks directly into Earl's eyes.

          ROPER
     He didn't kill anybody, though.

Roper bends over the guard.

          ROPER
     This is gonna hurt.

He grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him 
across the floor. The guard MOANS piteously.

          EARL
     Hey, leave him alone. What are you 
     doing?

Roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door.

          ROPER
     It's part of my negotiator's oath. 
     If there's an injured party and I 
     can help them, I'm duty bound by my 
     oath to do that. You can shoot me if 
     you want, but the next negotiator in 
     here is going to tell you the same 
     thing.

Earl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath. 
He lets Roper drag the guard to the door.

          ROPER
     I'll be right back, Earl. Point that 
     gun away from Debbie.

Earl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head, 
then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple.

EXT. BANK - DAY

Roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on 
the sidewalk. Two SWAT OFFICERS rush up to give aid. One of 
them is Jennings.

          ROPER
          (whispering to Jennings)
     Give me your gun.

(NOTE: The method of disarming Earl is still to be determined) 
Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to 
him. Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband 
under his shirt and vest.

          ROPER
     I haven't had to shoot anyone in 
     three years.

          JENNINGS
     Why not keep the streak alive?

          ROPER
     Because this strung-out junkie is 
     too stupid to get out of this without 
     killing somebody.

INT. BANK - DAY

Earl watches Roper through the window. He can only see Roper's 
back. He's getting very agitated.

          EARL
          (yelling)
     HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT 
     THERE!

The two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper 
calmly walks back into the bank. Stops about five paces from 
Earl.

          ROPER
     As a rule, I need one hostage released 
     as show of good faith.

Roper glances at Debbie. Gun pressed against her head. Tears 
start rolling down her cheeks. She's being tremendously brave.

          ROPER
     Give me Debbie.

Earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her 
head.

          EARL
     Take the old guy.

The other hostages watch this exchange tensely.

          ROPER
     The Old Guy? What kind of show of 
     faith is that? I want Debbie.

          EARL
     Am I gettin' the car?

          ROPER
     You're gettin' the car.

Earl thinks about it, his gun hand twitching. He points at 
two of the female employees cowering against the counter.

          EARL
     Take them.

Roper decides that this is the best he's going to get.

          ROPER
     You two, leave.

The two women don't need any extra encouragement. They jump 
up and rush out the front door.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

McCall and Forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the 
two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops.

          FORBES
     This guy is good.

          MCCALL
     That's what they say.

INT. BANK - DAY

          ROPER
     That was fine, Earl. Now I'm going 
     to get your car.

Roper turns around and walks toward the front door. He stops 
and looks over his shoulder.

          ROPER
     Oh, there's one last thing.

Earl looks like he's right on the edge.

          EARL
     What?!

          ROPER
     You want a convertible or hardtop?

Earl thinks about that for a beat...

          ROPER
     Hardtop.

Roper turns around, starts walking again. He keeps his eyes 
focused on the reflection of Earl in the front window of the 
bank.

          ROPER
          (without turning around)
     Manual or automatic?

          EARL
     Automatic.

          ROPER
     You got it.

In one swift motion, Roper turns, aims and FIRES!...

One SHOT. It tears into Earl's shoulder. One inch from 
Debbie's neck. Earl is blown back against the counter. Debbie 
shrieks at the top of her lungs.

SWAT guys pour in from every entrance. YELLING for everybody 
to "GET DOWN"! Pointing guns. They pounce on Earl.

          EARL
     I give up! I give up!

Roper goes to Debbie, puts his arm around her and gently 
leads her out of the bank.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

McCall and Forbes still have their rifles trained on the 
bank door. Their police radio squawks...

          RADIO
     The situation is secured. Suspect in 
     custody. Repeat. Situation secured.

McCall lowers his rifle as Roper guides Debbie through the 
wave of cops rushing into the bank.

EXT. STREET - SHORT TIME LATER

Roper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when 
he hears the sound of a CAMERA SHUTTER. He turns to see 
VERONICA (RONNIE) TATE holding the camera. She snaps one of 
Roper with Earl in the b.g. being placed in a squad car.

          RONNIE
     There's one for the front page.

Roper puts his hand over his heart as if stricken with love... 
which he in fact is.

          ROPER
     Ronnie, why are you torturing me? I 
     can't live without you.

Ronnie rolls her eyes. She doesn't take Roper all that 
seriously.

          RONNIE
     Don't start.

She slings the camera over her shoulder and starts to walk 
off. Roper dogs her.

          ROPER
     This baseball player you're going 
     out with...
          (shaking his head)
     He's no good for you.

          RONNIE
     Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He 
     makes two million a year, and he 
     worships me.

          ROPER
     I worship you.

          RONNIE
     You worship yourself.

          ROPER
     Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.

          RONNIE
     Greg.

          ROPER
     Did you know he's already got a bad 
     knee? In another 10 years you're 
     going to be pushing him around in a 
     wheelchair.

Ronnie stops. Looks him in the eye.

          RONNIE
     You know what I think? I think you 
     only want me now, because I'm with 
     somebody else.

          ROPER
     Who cares what you think. I want you 
     back and that's all that matters.

Ronnie smiles, but offers no response.

          ROPER
     Let me take you out tomorrow night... 
     Pleeease.

          RONNIE
     I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.

          ROPER
          (frowning)
     This Greg is really getting in my 
     way.

Roper gets down on his knees.

          ROPER
     Please. I'm begging you.

          RONNIE
     Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.

She takes the lense cap off her camera. Roper primps his 
hair to make sure he looks good for the picture... CLICK! 
Suddenly Roper notices that his Trans Am is being towed. He 
rushes over to his car.

          ROPER
     Hey, that's my car.

A REPO MAN stands off to the side watching dispassionately.

          REPO MAN
     Not anymore. Now it belongs to Silver 
     Hills Financial.

Roper sadly watches the tow truck drive off with his beloved 
Trans Am.

INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY - RAINING

Lots of activity. Officers in cubicles; talking on phones; 
typing reports on computers. Most are plain-clothed. Roper 
weaves through the room. Passes by Baffert's desk.

          ROPER
     Hey, Baffert, what's the story for 
     tonight?

Baffert pulls two tickets for the Warriors' game out of his 
pocket.

          BAFFERT
     Floor seats.

          ROPER
     You're my hero.

          BAFFERT
     Dinner's on you.

          ROPER
     Deal.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING

A quiet contrast to the squadroom. This is the executive 
branch of Metro. All the big-wigs are officed here. Roper 
walks down the carpeted hall. No one here except Kevin McCall 
quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office. Roper and 
McCall make brief eye contact. Roper thinks nothing of it. 
He goes into the Captain's office.

INT. CAPTAIN SOLIS' OFFICE - RAINING

CAPTAIN FRANK SOLIS is on the phone. There's a file on the 
desk in front of him. He motions Roper to sit down.

          SOLIS
     He just walked into my office.
          (looks over at Roper)
     The Chief says, "Good work this 
     morning. Congratulations."

Roper smiles as he sits down.

          ROPER
     Tell him to give me a raise.

          SOLIS
          (into the phone)
     He says, "Thank you very much."
          (a beat)
     I'll discuss it with him right now... 
     Good-bye, Chief.

Solis hangs up. Looks across the desk at Roper. A long pause. 
He knows he's got leverage.

          SOLIS
     Roper.

          ROPER
     What?

          SOLIS
     Are you going to make this hard for 
     me?

          ROPER
     Depends. What's up?

          SOLIS
     There's been some concern about you 
     continuing to work without back-up.

          ROPER
     Define concern.

Solis dumps his cards on the table.

          SOLIS
     What if you die and no one can do 
     what you do as well as you do it?

          ROPER
     Your concern is heartwarming.

          SOLIS
     It's been decided that you take on 
     another partner and train him to be 
     able to take over for you.

          ROPER
     Is that what the guy in the Sunday 
     School suit is doing outside?

          SOLIS
     His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro 
     Captain agrees that he's their top 
     sharp-shooter and most likely to 
     succeed.

Roper grabs McCall's folder off the desk.

          ROPER
     Let me see that.

Roper scans it.

          ROPER
     Tested high on his intellectual

INT. HALLWAY - SAME - RAINING

McCall turns around in his chair. He can see Roper and Solis 
through the glass walls of the office, but he can't hear 
their voices.

INT. SOLIS' OFFICE - SAME - RAINING

          ROPER
     "Additional Skills": Biathelete, 
     marathoner, lip-reading, speaks 
     Spanish...

Roper throws the folder back on the desk.

          ROPER
     Great, send him to the Marines. This 
     guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit 
     in two weeks.

          SOLIS
     You let us worry about that.

          ROPER
     Is there going to be an expression 
     of your appreciation?

          SOLIS
          (gloomily)
     What kind of appreciation are we 
     talking about?

          ROPER
     The financial kind. I figure I'm 
     going to be working extra hours. All 
     sorts of overtime... training 
     sessions... Not to mention the extra 
     stress...

          SOLIS
     What do you think would be in order?

          ROPER
     Like ahh... I don't know...
          (boldly)
     Five thousand dollars.

          SOLIS
          (calmly)
     Okay, I think I could swing that.

Uh-oh, Roper thinks maybe he sold short.

          ROPER
          (quickly)
     And a car.

          SOLIS
     Hey, you just got a five thousand 
     dollar raise. Get a car of your own.

          ROPER
     You know you've got nothing but cars 
     down there in impound.

          SOLIS
     Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.

          ROPER
          (firmly)
     The car is part of the deal.

          SOLIS
     What happened to your Trans Am?

Solis gets up and taps the glass, motions for McCall to come 
in.

          ROPER
     Repoed this morning.

          SOLIS
          (relenting)
     I'll provide you with transportation.

          ROPER
     And even if this doesn't work, I 
     want all the money. These SWAT guys 
     don't have the temperament. They 
     don't have the background...

McCall enters the office.

          ROPER
          (instant character 
          change)
     Hey, glad to meet you. I've heard 
     nothing but good things about you...

Roper reaches out. They shake hands.

          MCCALL
     Same here. I've watched you in action. 
     Very impressive.

          ROPER
     You've got a lot of hard work ahead 
     of you if you want to be a negotiator.

          MCCALL
     I'm ready to do it.
          (a beat)
     And I'm going to be here more than 
     two weeks.

Roper's face darkens.

          ROPER
     Don't go reading my lips, man. That's 
     an intrusion. Save that shit for the 
     sniper school. Comprende?

          MCCALL
     Sorry... Habit.

          SOLIS
          (intervening)
     Let's move past this, gentlemen.

Roper smiles.

          ROPER
     We're already past it, aren't we, 
     Kevin?

          MCCALL
     If you say so.

          SOLIS
     Then you'll have to excuse me. I 
     have other work to do.

Roper and McCall head out the door.

          SOLIS
     Roper...

Roper turns back around.

          SOLIS
     About the transportation issue... 
     You check with the impound sergeant.

Roper smiles. Total victory.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING

MOVING with Roper and McCall.

          ROPER
     You ever been in a hostage situation?

          MCCALL
     Only at the very end.

          ROPER
     How do you feel after a shooting.

          MCCALL
          (self-assured)
     Like it had to be done.

They enter the squadroom, wind through the cubicles.

          ROPER
     It rarely has to be done.

          MCCALL
     I've rarely shot anyone.

          ROPER
     SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.

          MCCALL
          (flatly)
     I know.

          ROPER
     Try to remember that.

They arrive at Roper's desk.

          ROPER
     Okay, "Dead Eye", lesson one...

Roper grabs an empty soda bottle from a neighboring desk. He 
takes the cap off a ball point pen and drops it into the 
empty bottle. He places the bottle on his desk.

          ROPER
     Extract that pen cap without touching 
     or moving the bottle.

McCall looks at the bottle quizzically.

          MCCALL
     What's the point of this?

          ROPER
     A little exercise in lateral thinking. 
     The obvious solution isn't always 
     the only solution... See you tomorrow.

Roper grabs his jacket and walks off, leaving McCall to ponder 
the problem. McCall looks over at another cop who has been 
observing. The cop shrugs his shoulders. He hasn't got a 
clue. McCall sits down and thoughtfully peers into the bottle.

INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

Roper and Baffert walking past the row of cars, including 
Solis' cadillac, searching for Roper's "new" transportation... 
Roper is holding the keys in his hand.

          BAFFERT
     Mind if we make a stop on the way? 
     We busted Frank Antonucci on 
     possession. He gave us a lead on 
     that Polk Street jewelry heist.

          ROPER
     "Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your 
     time. He'd tell you his granny was 
     in on the Kennedy assassination if 
     he could dodge a collar.

          BAFFERT
     I still gotta do it. Wasting time is 
     half my job.

          ROPER
     Yeah, okay.

Roper is looking at the numbered parking spaces.

          BAFFERT
     This SWAT guy might be a good idea. 
     He may be able to take a little 
     pressure off you. I worry about you.

          ROPER
     You worried about me, too? The chief's 
     worried about me. Solis is worried 
     about me. Maybe you guys should start 
     some kind of organization.

          BAFFERT
     Speaking of which. I saw you talking 
     to Ronnie this morning. Why can't 
     you get it back together with her. 
     You've gotta be out of your mind not 
     to get with that one.

          ROPER
     It's not me. It's her. She's going 
     out with this baseball player -- 
     Greg Barnett.

          BAFFERT
          (impressed)
     No shit! He's good!

          ROPER
     Fuck him. He swings at anything in 
     the dirt. I could strike him out.

          BAFFERT
     Don't give up on her. You're getting 
     to the age when you ought to be 
     thinking about these things.

Roper bends over like an old man.

          ROPER
     Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up.

They arrive at their destination. A parking space with a 
1957 DODGE PICKUP.

          BAFFERT
     This is it. Space 742.

Roper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief.

          ROPER
     Then he didn't say 742. He must have 
     said 724 or something, because this 
     can't be right.

Baffert unlocks the pickup and offers the keys to Roper who 
is crossing to the truck.

          ROPER
     Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not 
     riding in this shit. I can't roll in 
     no shit like this.

He takes the keys from Baffert who moves around to the 
passengers side. He opens the door.

          BAFFERT
     Where's the stereo?

          ROPER
     Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?

          BAFFERT
     Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.

EXT. MARKET STREET - NIGHT

The pickup in traffic.

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. KORDA'S BUILDING - NIGHT

It's a four story twenties style walk-up. It's evening now. 
The pickup pulls to a stop out front.

INT. PICKUP - NIGHT

Baffert pulls out a slip of paper.

          BAFFERT
     Apartment 306.

          ROPER
     You want me to go up with you?

          BAFFERT
     Nah, It probably won't turn up 
     anything. I'm just gonna talk to 
     him.

          ROPER
     Good. I don't want to be late.

Baffert gets out. Roper grabs his cell phone.

          ROPER
     You want anything on the game?

Baffert turns back around.

          BAFFERT
     What's the line?

          ROPER
     It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.

          BAFFERT
     I'll take half of your action.

Baffert goes into the building. Roper dials his cellular 
phone. Beep! Beep!

DETAIL SHOT

A message on the display reads: RECHARGE BATTERY.

Roper looks around. There's a payphone across the street. He 
gets out of the truck and crosses to it.

INT. BUILDING - NIGHT

Third floor hallway. Nice, middle class place. Well kept up. 
Baffert walks over to room 306. Knocks.

INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT

Jazz is playing. MICHAEL KORDA sits motionless in a chair 
listening to the music. There's a KNOCK. Korda responds as 
if pulled from a trance. He rises and moves to the door.

          KORDA
     Who is it?

          BAFFERT (V.O.)
     It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the 
     San Francisco Police Department.

A slight hesitation from Korda. He glances around the 
apartment. For what reason, we don't know. Maybe to make 
sure there's nothing incriminating around. He opens the door.

          KORDA
     What happened? Is there a problem?

          BAFFERT
     May I come in? I would just like to 
     ask you a couple of questions.

Korda steps aside and lets Baffert enter. Korda closes the 
door. Baffert scans the place. Not bad. He listens to the 
music. A smile grows on his face.

          BAFFERT
     Count Basie?

Korda smiles back. Another jazz aficionada.

          KORDA
     Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What 
     They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 
     1945.

          BAFFERT
     Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.

Korda goes to the stereo, turns it down. Duke Ellington plays 
low.

          BAFFERT
     Where did you find an old recording 
     like that?

          KORDA
     Used record shop down on Turk Street. 
     I was in there looking for some Robert 
     Johnson.
          (searching for the 
          name)
     Memories... Memory Lane or 
     something...

          BAFFERT
     I've got to stop in there... Mr. 
     Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?

          KORDA
     You mean Frank who owns the bakery 
     down the street?

Baffert smiles.

          BAFFERT
     No, this is a different Frank. This 
     is a man who deals in jewelry. Stolen 
     jewelry usually. You wouldn't know 
     anybody like that?

Korda drifts to the other side of the room. Takes a look out 
his front window...

HIS POV

Nobody there. Just the truck.

          KORDA
     I certainly wouldn't.

He says it as if the very idea disturbs him. He turns away 
from the window. Baffert feigns a coughing spell.

          BAFFERT
     Could I please have a little water?

          KORDA
          (the perfect host)
     Of course.

Korda heads toward the kitchen area. Baffert uses this as an 
opportunity to drift around the room. Do a little snooping.

          BAFFERT
     The reason I'm asking you is because 
     we arrested him with some stolen 
     jewelry. It was traced to the robbery 
     of a store down on Polk Street. He 
     said he was fencing it for you.

Baffert notices something in the trash can.

HIS POV

Several glassine envelopes used for raw jewels. They have 
jeweler's markings on them indicating gem weight and grade.

INT. KITCHEN

Korda, pouring the water, notices Baffert's discovery, but 
his face betrays nothing.

          KORDA
          (calmly)
     There's obviously some mistake. I 
     have a cousin who has had run-ins 
     with the law.

Korda re-enters the room with the glass of water.

          KORDA
     Perhaps for his own reasons he 
     entangled me in this... situation.

          BAFFERT
     This cousin of yours... What's his 
     name?

          KORDA
          (forthrightly)
     Clarence Teal.

They look at each other a beat. Korda is still holding the 
water.

          KORDA
     Your cough seems to be better.

A real repressed tension here. Someone's about to get hurt. 
Baffert takes the glass of water.

          BAFFERT
     Thank you.

He takes a sip. Korda watches him like a cobra. Baffert puts 
the glass down on the table.

          BAFFERT
     Well, I'm on my way to the game. I 
     appreciate your cooperation, Mr. 
     Korda.

Korda smiles. Baffert walks to the door. Opens it to leave...

          KORDA
     Lieutenant...

Baffert turns back around.

          KORDA
     Do you believe that story about Robert 
     Johnson...? That he made a deal with 
     the devil at the crossroads?

Baffert muses along with Korda.

          BAFFERT
     Could be.

Baffert moves off down the hall and Korda closes his door.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Baffert gets into the elevator.

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Baffert takes out his cell phone. Dials.

          BAFFERT
          (as the elevator 
          descends)
     Hello, Judge Stone... This is 
     Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a 
     suspect's residence. I'm requesting 
     a telephonic search warrant in 
     connection with an armed robbery at 
     a jewelry store. There's visible 
     evidence on the premises. Glassine 
     envelopes with jeweler's markings 
     were seen in the trash can...

The elevator hits the first floor.

          BAFFERT
     ...I believe a full search of the 
     premises will turn up some stolen 
     property...

The elevator opens.

Korda is standing there with a knife.

Baffert has no time to react...

The knife hand slashes forward... Stabbing the chest and 
slashing across the throat.

EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

Korda calmly exits the building as Roper crosses the street, 
returning from the payphone. Neither of the men take any 
particular notices of each other. A WOMAN carrying her 
groceries enters the building.

Roper gets to the truck. A SCREAM from inside the building.

INT. BUILDING - NIGHT

Baffert is laying in the open elevator, knife wounds to his 
neck and chest. Roper rushes over to him. It doesn't look 
good.

The woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first 
flight of stairs. Frozen. Roper pulls out his gun and rushes 
by her up the stairs.

          ROPER
          (to the woman)
     Get an ambulance!

INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

Roper arrives at the top of the stairs. Korda's door is ajar. 
Duke Ellington can be heard faintly.

INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT

Roper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready... 
No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a 
door. Roper races out.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it 
open. Gun aimed.

INT. APT. 302 - NIGHT

A five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds 
up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he 
leaves.

EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

Roper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk. 
Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that 
Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches.

INT. SOLIS OFFICE - NIGHT - RAIN

Angle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window 
looking out to the rain. Solis is in the b.g. on the phone.

          SOLIS
          (on the phone)
     Yes sir. Every resource will be 
     brought to bear. We will find this 
     guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll 
     tell him.

Solis hangs up the phone.

          SOLIS
     The chief says to tell you how sorry 
     he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a 
     good man.

          ROPER
          (still looking out 
          window)
     He said he was just going up to talk 
     to him. He said...
          (beat; turning to 
          Solis)
     I want to be put on this case.

          SOLIS
     I can't do that.

          ROPER
          (emphatic)
     I want to be put on this case.

          SOLIS
     You know I can't assign you to this. 
     You're much too close to it. You 
     were much too close to Sam. The 
     department will take care of it.

          ROPER
     Who's running it?

          SOLIS
     Roper...

          ROPER
     Who's running it!

          SOLIS
     Kimura and Glass will head the 
     investigation.

Roper turns to leave.

          SOLIS
     Scott. Go home. Get some sleep.

Roper pauses at the door. Then pulls out two basketball 
tickets and lays them on the table in Solis' office. He exits.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. METRO OFFICE AREA - NIGHT

Two detectives. A female named KIMURA and a tall guy named 
GLASS, try to make a getaway as they see Roper coming.

          ROPER
     Hey, hey, hey...

Roper intercepts them.

          ROPER
     Anything on Korda so far?

          KIMURA
     Solis said to keep you clear of this.

Roper responds louder than necessary with a half turn toward 
Solis' hallway.

          ROPER
     I don't give a damn what Solis said.
          (to the detectives)
     If you get a lead, I want to know.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT - RAINING

Roper's pickup drives by.

INT. PICKUP

Thru the windshield. We see Roper as the windshield wipers 
flap back and forth. His face seems dazed and lost.

INT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

Roper knocks. Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard.

          RONNIE (O.S.)
     Just a minute.

Roper makes no effort to pull himself together. The door 
opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise. She's dressed 
casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and 
earrings.

          RONNIE
     Hey.

          ROPER
     Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.

          RONNIE
          (like hell)
     A little late for that, Scottie. 
     He's asleep.
          (smells his breath)
     Jack Daniels?

          ROPER
     I'm not drunk. Yet.

          RONNIE
     Maybe you should be.

          ROPER
     You heard.

She nods, sympathetic, but doesn't leave the doorway.

          RONNIE
     Yeah. I'm sorry.

          ROPER
     Can I come in?

Ronnie opens the door reluctantly.

INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Roper enters. Instantly we see he's at home here. He hangs 
his coat in the closet, puts his keys on the table, notices 
a photograph on the wall. Quite imposing. Very unique style.

          ROPER
     That a new picture?

          RONNIE
     About 4 months old. I'm working in a 
     new style.

Roper gazes at it indifferently. He falls silent. Thoughts 
turned inward. Suddenly, TROY, (the dog), bounds in. He's 
ecstatic to see Roper. He puts his front paws on the couch 
and his head in Roper's lap.

          ROPER
     Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy?
          (to Ronnie)
     He heard my voice.

Roper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his 
presence. His words are light. His tone isn't.

          ROPER
     How's the good dog. I miss you buddy. 
     You miss me?

Ronnie watches them, suddenly showing the sadness she's 
carefully buried.

          ROPER
     He misses me.

She nods. A moment's silence.

          ROPER
     I won't stay long. I had to talk to 
     someone.

          RONNIE
          (a bit surprised at 
          his openness)
     You don't usually talk to anyone 
     when you're hurting.

          ROPER
     It was my fault. I was right 
     downstairs. I should have gone up 
     with him.

          RONNIE
     Scott, You can't save everyone.

          ROPER
     I've proved that, didn't I?

She's not coming closer. She wants to, but she won't do it. 
She seems uneasy, glances towards the door. Roper rises.

          ROPER
     Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.

          RONNIE
          (gentle)
     What do you want from me?

          ROPER
     Something I guess I can't have 
     anymore.

          RONNIE
     Don't try to make me feel guilty. 
     The whole time we were together, you 
     went out of your way to prove you 
     didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for 
     one night, you need me again. I can't 
     do it. I can't be more than your 
     friend. Because I know what will 
     happen. In a few weeks you'll be 
     back on top, and you'll shut me out 
     just as soon as you don't need me 
     again.

          ROPER
          (surprised, hurt)
     You think I didn't need you?

          RONNIE
     If you did, you never showed it.

          ROPER
     Ronnie...

He reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to 
him, but at that moment there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Ronnie 
pulls back, confused and guilty.

          ROPER
     You expecting someone?

Her silence is the answer... A flash of pain from Roper.

          ROPER
     This day just keeps getting better.

Ronnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets.

          RONNIE
          (soft)
     They're on the table where you always 
     leave them.

He grabs the keys as she opens the door. GREG stands outside 
waiting. He's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his 
face.

          GREG
     Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were...

Greg's smile fades as he sees Roper.

          ROPER
     I was just leaving.

Roper strides past Greg who remains in the doorway. Ronnie 
makes brief eye contact with Greg, but then moves past him 
to follow Roper. She calls after him.

          RONNIE
     Scottie... take care of yourself.

Roper doesn't look back. He just goes.

EXT. PIER 26 - EARLY MORNING

A huge warehouse. Sun coming up over the East Bay, CLARENCE 
TEAL rides up on a HARLEY MOTORCYLE, carrying a large cup of 
coffee to go. He enters the warehouse.

INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME

Car and Boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high. Clarence 
shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are 
connected to the end of the warehouse.

INT. WATCHMAN'S QUARTERS - SAME

Built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay. Korda is 
waiting behind the door as Clarence enters. He seizes Clarence 
from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him 
around. Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt.

          KORDA
     If you weren't family I'd kill you.

Clarence is scared. He offers no defense.

          KORDA
     You told Antonucci that shit came 
     from me.

          CLARENCE
     So that we could get the best price. 
     He's got respect for you. He's gonna 
     try to lowball me, Mike.

Korda tosses Clarence down onto the cot.

          KORDA
     You fucking idiot! Why do you think 
     I use you?... To be a walking 
     advertisement.

          CLARENCE
     I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of 
     LaMarra flipping on anyone before. 
     He said he had the cops paid off. 
     Antonucci never flipped on anyone 
     before. He had the cops paid off.

          KORDA
     Not the fucking cop that showed up 
     at my door!

          CLARENCE
     What happened, Mike.

          KORDA
     You don't want to know.

Tears start to come to Clarence's eyes.

          CLARENCE
     I'm sorry, Mike.

Clarence sincerely feels bad. It's kind of touching in a 
twisted way. Korda moves over to the window to keep from 
striking Clarence again. He looks off across the bay.

          KORDA
     God damn it! I still needed to case 
     that fucking store. It's too risky 
     to show my face now.

          CLARENCE
     I got a couple thousand bucks. You 
     could leave town.

          KORDA
     Leave town? They're going to know me 
     in fucking Des Moines now!...
          (a beat)
     They got over ten million in jewels 
     in that place. That's freedom, man. 
     I could go anywhere I want.

Clarence watches Korda warily. Things are beginning to add 
up in his head.

          CLARENCE
     Did you kill him, Mike?

Korda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers 
the question. Clarence is shaken by that. He starts to whimper 
again.

          CLARENCE
     I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry...

We're talking major fear here...

Korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around 
again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against 
his chest.

          KORDA
     It's not your fault you're stupid.

Tears of relief from Clarence.

INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Roper enters the squadroom. His mood is contained. He walks 
to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling.

A couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair, 
reading a book entitled, "Strategies and Counter Measures in 
Hostage Situations". On the desk in front of him is the bottle 
with the pen cap still in it.

          ROPER
          (to Kimura and Glass)
     What do you got on Korda?

          KIMURA
     We ran a search on relatives. He has 
     a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. 
     Smalltime thief. Last known address 
     was on Pine Street. He moved out a 
     month ago. We've got a couple leads 
     on him to check out.

          ROPER
          (rapid fire)
     Did you check out DMV for any vehicles 
     registration?

          KIMURA
     Being faxed over now.

          ROPER
     How about the record room for any 
     incident reports? He might be a 
     victim. We can get medical records. 
     Check with burglary detail and see 
     if anyone else knows him, knows his 
     habits.

          KIMURA
     Roper...

          ROPER
     And what about bars? We can talk to 
     neighbors to see what bars he 
     frequents.

          KIMURA
     Roper, we're into it...

Suddenly Solis appears at their side.

          SOLIS
     We've had this conversation once, 
     Roper. You're not active on this 
     case.

Roper looks at him icily.

          SOLIS
     It's in everyone's best interest.

McCall, Kimura, Glass all watch this confrontation tensely. 
After a beat, Roper gives in. Indicates his compliance. Solis 
heads back to this office.

          ROPER
          (softened)
     You guys are doing good work.

He moves toward the desk. McCall gets up when he sees him 
coming.

          MCCALL
     I'm sorry about your friend. I had a 
     friend in SWAT killed. I know how it 
     can be.

          ROPER
     I appreciate your concern. Let's 
     leave it at that.

McCall respectfully drops it. Roper looks down at the soda 
bottle.

          ROPER
     I don't see much progress here.

McCall holds up a finger. Not so fast. He picks up a pot 
from a nearby "Mr. Coffee" machine. It's filled with water. 
He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle.

CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE

The pen cap floats to the top and McCall plucks it out without 
touching or moving the bottle.

          ROPER
     Very nice... You get an "A". Notice... 
     No force required. No damage.

Just then a SERGEANT calls to Roper across the squadroom.

          SERGEANT
     Roper, domestic disturbance at 472 
     6th Street. Possible hostage 
     situation.

McCall grabs his duffel bag. Roper starts away from the desk, 
then notices the book on "Hostage Strategies". He looks at 
the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the 
trash can. He and McCall head out.

EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY

The pickup is weaving through traffic.

INT. PICKUP - DAY

Start on one of those air freshener evergreen trees hanging 
from the rear view mirror. PULL BACK to show a police bubble 
flashing on the dashboard.

Roper weaving through traffic. McCall is sitting calmly as 
ever.

          ROPER
     So, McCall, how come you ended up in 
     San Francisco?

          MCCALL
     They recruited me. Promised me fast 
     advancement.

          ROPER
     Recruited you from where?

          MCCALL
     National Marksman Competition.

          ROPER
     With your qualifications you must 
     have had a lot of offers. Why here?

          MCCALL
     Furthest point I could find from New 
     York.

          ROPER
     You don't like New York?

          MCCALL
     Spent my whole life there. I just 
     wanted to get out for a while.

          ROPER
     You'd never been out of New York?

          MCCALL
     Been to Toronto. My mother was born 
     there.

          ROPER
     How did you like Toronto?

          MCCALL
     It was okay.

          ROPER
     You're a real excitable sort, aren't 
     you?

          MCCALL
     You caught me on an "up" day.
          (a beat)
     How about you? How did you end up in 
     San Francisco?

          ROPER
     I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the 
     Bay Bridge and here I was.
          (a beat)
     So you're looking for "fast 
     advancement".

          MCCALL
     Is there something wrong with that?

          ROPER
     I'm not sure.

EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY

Several Patrol Cars are parked in front of an unappealing 
apartment building. A crowd has begun to gather. UNIFORMED 
POLICEMEN hold them back. TWO COPS are questioning a man 
wearing only green slacks. No shirt. No shoes. Just the 
slacks. He is very agitated.

The pickup screeches up. Roper and McCall hop out. Roper 
flashes his badge to the OFFICER in charge. (OFFICER #1)

          ROPER
     Roper. Metro Division. Hostage 
     Negotiator. Give me the short version.

          OFFICER #1
     Husband came home. Found that guy 
     and his wife "in flagrante". Now 
     he's holding her at knife point.

          ROPER
     Which apartment?

The Officer points up to the third floor.

          OFFICER #1
     That one with the bars on the windows.

Roper nods. Walks back over to the pickup. Looks up. Eyeballs 
the building.

          ROPER
     How are we gonna get him out of there?

          MCCALL
     We could fill it with water.

Roper throws him a look. McCall walks to the back of the 
pickup, reaches into the cab and digs around in his duffel 
bag.

          ROPER
          (to Officer #1)
     Have you evacuated anyone?

          OFFICER #1
     Only that floor.

          ROPER
     Is the hostage injured?

          OFFICER #1
     Don't know. She keeps screaming to 
     stay out. He keeps screaming to stay 
     out. We decided to stay out.

          ROPER
     Well, there's a good amount of 
     agreement on that.

McCall slams the truck door, sniper rifle in hand.

          MCCALL
     I'll take "highground" until SWAT 
     gets here.
          (surveying the area)
     I can get a good sight-line from 
     that roof across the street.

McCall marches off across the street.

          ROPER
     Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying 
     to limit the force here.

McCall calls back over his shoulder.

          MCCALL
     I know my job.

At that moment, a scream echoes down from the third floor 
window. Roper heads for the front door of the building.

INT. APT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - (ACROSS THE STREET)

McCall bounds up the stairs of the building to the rooftop.

INT. 6TH ST. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

The screams are getting more panicky. Roper comes down the 
hall quickly. The door to the apartment is open. It's been 
that way since the guy in the green slacks fled. Roper hurries 
toward the door.

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

The WIFE is in bra and panties and the HUSBAND is 6'4". He's 
giving her a good beating. It's a studio apartment. Unmade 
bed. Belongings strewn all over. Window open with sun 
streaming in, and a good view of the building across the 
street. We hear ROPER'S VOICE from out in the hall.

          ROPER (V.O.)
     I'm coming in. I'm not armed.

The husband snatches his wife by the hair and holds a knife 
to her throat.

          WIFE
          (shrieking)
     No, Raymond!

          RAYMOND
          (to Roper)
     Stay the fuck out of here!

But Roper steps into the apartment. Sees the wife. Face 
swollen. Knife to her neck. The enraged husband, contemplating 
murder. One inch from committing the act. Roper doesn't bat 
an eye.

          ROPER
     I know how you feel, Ray.

          RAYMOND
     You don't know shit, and I suggest 
     you leave.

He presses the knife against the wife's throat. She winces. 
Her chest heaves.

          ROPER
     I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my 
     negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the 
     room with the hostage, I have to 
     stay.

          RAYMOND
     You don't want to see what I'm going 
     to do to her.

          ROPER
     Let me show you something, Ray.

Roper reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet. He 
extracts a photo.

CLOSEUP PHOTO

Wife. Two kids. A little dog-eared. Nice touch.

ROPER

holds it up so Raymond can see it.

          ROPER
     Same thing happened to me, man. She 
     cheated on me, but I forgave her. 
     You know why?

          RAYMOND
     I ain't interested in your life story.

          ROPER
     Because I was partially to blame. I 
     wasn't around as much as I should 
     have been. I forgot how to love her.

          RAYMOND
     She's the one to blame. Not me.

EXT. ROOF ACROSS THE STREET - ON MCCALL

In prone position. Rifle in hand. Eye to scope.

POV THROUGH SIGHT

of Raymond's open window.

INT. RAYMOND'S APARTMENT

Everyone where we left them. Roper looks at Ray with utter 
sincerity.

          ROPER
     Ray, think about how she looked when 
     you married her. Think about how 
     happy you were. Don't lose that, 
     man. Don't give up everything.

          RAYMOND
     What am I giving up? I'm laid off 
     last year. I'm down to my last 
     unemployment check. I'm out on the 
     streets looking for work and this 
     bitch is banging some asshole in my 
     bed.

And now Ray is crying. Blubbering actually. And he's not 
that coherent.

          RAYMOND
     I'm down at Consolidated and I'm 
     begging. I'm saying I'll take half 
     my pay. Eight years, man. I don't 
     even have to work the loading docks 
     anymore. I'll do maintenance. "We're 
     cutting back. We're streamlining, 
     Ray. West Central's running things 
     now. It's out of our hands" Fuck 
     them! Fuck them! FUCK THEM!
          (deep sigh)
     I'm gonna kill her and then I'm gonna 
     kill myself, 'cause I don't wanna 
     live anymore.

Roper reaches out to him.

          ROPER
     Ray, if you walk out of here with 
     me, I'll get you a job.

          RAYMOND
     Doing what? Cleaning toilets?

          ROPER
     I can't guarantee you what it will 
     be. But I swear on my life, I'll 
     find you work.

          RAYMOND
     And why the fuck would you do that 
     for me?

          ROPER
     Not for you, Ray. For me. A close 
     friend of mine was killed this week. 
     The way I figure it, I stop you from 
     doin' what you said, I'm one up on 
     body count.

          RAYMOND
     Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?

          ROPER
     My name's Scott Roper.

Ray stares blankly at Roper's outstretched hand, the knife 
clutched tightly in his fist... The wife squeezes her eyes 
closed. Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat... 
Then...

          RAYMOND
     I need my coat.

It's on a coat rack in the corner. But to get there he has 
to pass by the window. Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns 
and goes to get his coat.

He crosses in front of the window... Reaches for the coat. 
POP! A bullet slams into his skull. Ray falls to the floor. 
The wife runs out of the room, screaming!

          ROPER
     NOOOO!!

He rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the 
carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat. 
He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A 
couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper 
bolts out of the room... Pounds down the hallway... Pounds 
down the stairs... down another flight...

EXT. APT. BLDG.

McCall comes across the street. Roper sees McCall, cool as 
ever. Rifle slung over his shoulder. Roper steps into his 
path.

          ROPER
     WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

McCall gives no answer. He pushes past Roper and continues 
into the building.

INT. APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

Roper follows, screaming his head off.

          ROPER
     Do you think because the police 
     department issued you a sniper rifle, 
     it makes you God! What the fuck goes 
     on in your head?

McCall, still stone-faced, reaches the apartment. Yellow 
"crime scene" tape is being placed across the doorway. Cops 
are tiptoeing around, surveying evidence. McCall ducks under 
the tape. Roper follows.

INT. APT. - DAY

McCall goes over to Ray's body. Crouches down. Roper comes 
up behind him. McCall picks up the coat covering Ray's arms. 
Clutched in Ray's hand is a gun "Saturday night special" 
variety. McCall looks up at Roper.

          MCCALL
     SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember? 
     I just saved a life. Yours.

Roper doesn't miss a beat.

          ROPER
          (still angry)
     You think I've never had a gun pulled 
     on me?! You think every fucking time 
     someone pulls a gun they use it?!

McCall gets to his feet.

          MCCALL
     Eighty-five percent of domestic 
     disturbances of this nature end in 
     murder/suicide.

          ROPER
          (fiercely)
     Not the ones I'm at.

McCall and Roper glare at each other. Toe to toe. A beat. 
McCall's face softens just perceptibly.

          MCCALL
     Sorry. My mistake.

He walks out of the room. Roper whips the sheet off the bed, 
contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand... Then tosses 
the sheet over Ray's dead body.

INT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT

Roper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked 
"Internal Affairs". Things are quiet. Roper stares at the 
floor. Waiting.

The door opens. McCall comes out, escorted by two internal 
affairs INVESTIGATORS. One of the investigators pats him on 
the back.

          INVESTIGATOR
     Looks like a clean shoot. Go home 
     and get some rest.

McCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear 
back into the office. Roper approaches McCall. He's cooled 
off considerably. Even a tad friendly.

          ROPER
     Come on. Let's go for a drink.

          MCCALL
     I don't really like to drink.

          ROPER
     You have to. It's a tradition.

          MCCALL
     Well, if I have to, I have to.

INT. BILLY GOAT TAVERN - NIGHT

A neighborhood bar. Roper and McCall are playing pool. Half-
finished beers are on a nearby table. McCall is bent over 
the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot. Roper 
studies him.

          ROPER
     You got a girlfriend?

          MCCALL
     Why? You like my ass?

McCall misses the shot.

          ROPER
     Better than your pool game.

Roper lines up his shot.

          ROPER
     You wouldn't want to put a small 
     wager on this, would you?

          MCCALL
     I don't gamble.

Roper smiles. Sinks his shot. Moves around the table.

          MCCALL
     Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.

          ROPER
     You living together?

          MCCALL
     She's back in Jersey... going to 
     graduate school.

          ROPER
     Explain how that works.

          MCCALL
     She's going to come here when she 
     graduates and then we're gonna get 
     married.

          ROPER
     She grow up in Livingtston, too?

          MCCALL
          (as if that were 
          unthinkable)
     No, no, no...
          (a beat)
     She's from Hoboken.

          ROPER
     Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long 
     for companionship with her such a 
     long way away in New Jersey?

          MCCALL
     We see each other every couple of 
     months.

          ROPER
     Every couple of months, huh?

A couple of months sounds like an awful long time to Roper.

          ROPER
     That's a lot of commitment. I admire 
     that.

          MCCALL
     Do you really?

          ROPER
     No. Actually I think it's fucking 
     crazy, I don't know if I could do 
     it.

          MCCALL
     Thanks for clearing that up.
          (a beat)
     I hear your former girlfriend is 
     going out with Greg Barnett.

          ROPER
     Where did you hear that?

          MCCALL
     Around. Barnett's tough competition.

          ROPER
     Yeah, well that's a sore subject, 
     and therefore out of bounds to a 
     young sprout of a hostage negotiator 
     under my tutelage.

A beat and then McCall realizes that this comment is a major 
acknowledgement of acceptance from Roper. Roper misses his 
shot. Picks up his beer glass.

          ROPER
     Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should 
     have been lesson one. Never exchange 
     yourself for a hostage.

          MCCALL
     I think I can handle that one.

          ROPER
     Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.

Roper takes a drink of beer. Nears the bottom of his glass. 
Calls to the BARTENDER.

          ROPER
     Zack, another round.

Roper turns back to McCall.

          ROPER
     My partner gave himself in exchange 
     for a ten year old girl. He got caught 
     in the crossfire. Two dead. My partner 
     and the bad guy...
          (takes the last sip)
     Weird thing is, if he was alive, 
     he'd probably do it again.
          (a beat)
     Some people never learn.

Roper puts down his glass.

          ROPER
     You think you can learn, McCall?

          MCCALL
     I think so.

Roper nods. Maybe he can.

INT. ROOM - DAY

We're looking at a door. It's not clear where we are. McCall 
enters. We only see his face. Determined.

          MCCALL
     I'm Officer McCall, what's going on?

REVERSE ANGLE

It's a training room. It's built to approximate a convenience 
store. Several mannequins are placed around the room to 
represent a hostage situation. The "BAD GUY" has a walkie-
talkie strapped around his neck. Roper's voice CRACKLES out 
of it.

          BAD GUY
     What the fuck do you think is going 
     on, turdhead? I'm about to waste 
     everyone in this place.

McCall hesitates, trying to figure out a response. He seems 
stiff and awkward.

          MCCALL
     H... how can I help you? Tell me 
     what...
          (looks off to his 
          right)
     I feel stupid talking to a dummy.

Roper enters the training room from a side door. He's holding 
the other walkie-talkie.

          ROPER
     What did you think? I'm going to let 
     you practice on real people?

Roper comes up beside him.

          ROPER
     First things is, don't say, "What's 
     going on?" Everybody knows what's 
     going on. I come into this situation, 
     I say,
          (addressing the 
          mannequin)
     "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's 
     good. I'm here to help you."
          (turns back to McCall)
     Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. 
     If you're thinking, talk while you're 
     thinking, or else he's going to think 
     you're plotting. Which you are. If 
     he thinks you're plotting, you're 
     going to make him nervous. You don't 
     want him nervous. Got that?

          MCCALL
     No.

          ROPER
     It'll come. Try again.

INT. TRAINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE ON THE DOOR. McCall comes in. The room has the same 
set-up. McCall takes a look around. Launches immediately 
into...

          MCCALL
     My name's McCall. I'm a hostage 
     negotiator. I'm here to help you.

Roper's voice crackles back at him hostilely.

          ROPER (V.O.)
     How are you going to help me?

McCall's confidence is growing.

          MCCALL
     Tell me what you need.

          ROPER (V.O.)
     I need you to bring me the scumbag 
     who ran off with my wife so I can 
     cut off his nuts.

Now he's stumped.

          MCCALL
          (hesitantly)
     I can't do that.

          ROPER (V.O.)
     Then get out of my face you worthless 
     piece of frogshit.

McCall looks up to his right.

          MCCALL
     Is all the name calling necessary.

Roper re-enters the training area.

          ROPER
     Nah, I just throw that in because I 
     enjoy it.

          MCCALL
          (exasperated)
     So what do I say to this guy?

          ROPER
     You could say something like,
          (addressing the dummy)
     "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. 
     Maybe we can work something out."

          MCCALL
     What? Bring somebody in so he can 
     cut his nuts off?

Roper turns to McCall.

          ROPER
     If you want to be a successful 
     negotiator, you've got to learn to 
     lie.

          MCCALL
     I'm not good at lying.

          ROPER
     Get good at it.

          MCCALL
     It's against my nature.

Roper gives him an amused smile.

          ROPER
     You know the ten commandments?

          MCCALL
     Yes.

          ROPER
     What's the first commandment?

          MCCALL
     Thou shall have no other God before 
     me.

That's not the answer Roper wanted.

          ROPER
     Okay, forget that. What's the main 
     one.

McCall is tired of guessing.

          MCCALL
     You tell me.

          ROPER
     Thou shall not kill... You've killed, 
     right?

          MCCALL
     Yes.

          ROPER
     Why?

          MCCALL
     To save lives.

          ROPER
     So why would you hesitate to lie to 
     save lives?

McCall can't argue with that one. Roper turns and heads back 
to the side door.

          ROPER
     Let's try it again.

INT. TRAINING ROOM - LATER

McCall comes through the door. Hands in the air. The setup 
in the room has been changed a bit. The bad guy is behind 
the counter. Several hostages in various positions on the 
floor.

          MCCALL
     My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.

          ROPER (V.O.)
     Okay, stop.

Roper comes through the side door.

          ROPER
     Close your eyes.

McCall is surprised by the command but closes them. Roper 
turns him away from the hostage scene.

          ROPER
     What did you see?

          MCCALL
          (rapid-fire)
     A dirtbag behind the counter holding 
     a sawed-off. A Berretta nine 
     millimeter in his belt. A female 
     hostage, red dress, on the floor in 
     front of the cereal display. Male 
     hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, 
     three feet to her right. Another 
     male hostage, white pants, green 
     shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the 
     magazine rack. A female dirtbag with 
     a gun under her shirt, sitting against 
     the beer cooler, trying to pass 
     herself off as a hostage, and there's 
     a special on toilet-paper, four for 
     a buck twenty-nine.

McCall opens his eyes. Roper's impressed.

          ROPER
     Very good. You've got good eyes. 
     That's important.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Roper and McCall are sitting in the dark watching a video 
tape. It's grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting 
goods store. A negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a 
ten year old girl hostage. The negotiator holds his hands 
out imploringly... Carefully moves toward the gunman. The 
negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl. The gunman 
grabs the negotiator around the neck, holds the gun to his 
head. The little girl runs out of the picture to safety.

Roper remains dead silent during all this. McCall looks over 
at him. The blue light flickers over Roper's motionless face.

          MCCALL
     Was that your partner?

Roper nods.

          MCCALL
     Why did he do it?

          ROPER
          (quietly)
     Because he knew the little girl had 
     zero chance of survival and his 
     chances would be a little better... 
     We had a plan, but SWAT opened up 
     too early. He got caught in the 
     crossfire.
          (a sad beat)
     Let's move on... Notice this. Always 
     use the eyes to keep the connection. 
     It almost like hypnosis. That's the 
     most important thing. Create a 
     connection. You're always on their 
     side...

McCall watches him for a beat, then turns his attention back 
on the screen.

EXT. GOLDEN GATE RACETRACK - DAY

Beautiful day. Roper and McCall leaning against the rail at 
the walking ring. The horses are being paraded and saddled. 
Roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye. McCall seems 
totally disinterested.

          ROPER
     You know why I like the track?

          MCCALL
     You're a compulsive gambler?

Roper ignores that.

          ROPER
     Because there are a multitude of 
     possibility's. Everything is there 
     to see if you know what to look for. 
     You have to read the conditions, 
     just like in a hostage situation.

Roper points across the ring to a particular horse.

          ROPER
     See the four horse. Dropping in class. 
     No works. Front wraps. Looks like 
     he's broken down. But notice the 
     woman in the sun hat. She's the owner. 
     She wouldn't have come if her horse 
     was broken down. He's live. We use 
     him.

McCall listens indifferently.

          ROPER
     See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He 
     doesn't want to run today. Cross him 
     off... Now the Six looks good. On 
     his toes. Coat shiny. This 
     trainer/jockey combo does well. We 
     can't leave him out.
          (turns to McCall)
     What do you think?

          MCCALL
     I have two words for you... Seek 
     help.

          ROPER
     I have three words for you... Ex-ac-
     ta.

INT. BETTING WINDOWS - DAY

Roper is buying tickets. McCall is with him, watching the 
other bettors, the odds board, all the monitors... Strange 
place. Roper finishes and turns away from the window. Hands 
McCall a ticket.

          ROPER
     I bought you a four-six exacta box. 
     You owe me twenty bucks.

          MCCALL
          (puzzled)
     I do.

EXT. SEATING AREA - DAY

Roper and McCall pass by a gambler.

          GAMBLER
     Hey, Roper.

          ROPER
     How you doin', Marv?

They sit down in a box right up front.

          ROPER
     We need the 4 and 6 to finish to 
     first and second.

          MCCALL
          (no enthusiasm)
     Fine.

Roper uses his binoculars to watch the horses warm up on the 
backstretch.

          MCCALL
     I'm told that newspaper photographer 
     is your former girlfriend.

Roper looks over at him. What's this about?

          ROPER
     Ronnie... Yeah, so.

          MCCALL
     Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?

          ROPER
     So what do you want?... An autograph.

          MCCALL
     I don't know why she'd pick him over 
     you.

Roper throws McCall a skeptical look.

          MCCALL
          (straight-faced)
     I'm just practicing my lying.

          ROPER
     Still needs work.

          MCCALL
          (downcast)
     You're right. I'll never be as good 
     a liar as you.

          TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
     And they're racing!

ON THE TRACK

The horses spring from the gate. (The track announcer's call 
plays through race)

IN THE STANDS

Roper watches intently through the binoculars. McCall sits 
impassively.

          ROPER
     Okay, we're in good shape. We're in 
     good shape.

McCall looks across the track.

          MCCALL
     The 6 horse is last.

          ROPER
     That's okay. That's his style.

          MCCALL
     To run last?

          ROPER
     To run late!

Roper follows the horses into the turn.

          ROPER
     The favorite's fading. I told you he 
     wasn't going to run today... The 
     four horse has got the lead!

McCall sits like a wax figure.

          MCCALL
          (cynically)
     The 6 horse is still last.

          ROPER
     He'll be running at the quarter pole.

ON THE TRACK

The horses head into the stretch. The FOUR is on the lead 
and the SIX is starting to unleash a big run. Passing horses 
with every stride.

          ROPER (V.O.)
     There he goes.

IN THE STANDS

McCall sits forward slightly.

          MCCALL
     They need to run first and second?

          ROPER
     Yeah, first and second.

Roper gets to his feet.

ON THE TRACK

The horses thunder down the stretch. The FOUR horse is in 
front and the SIX is coming on from behind.

IN THE STANDS

Roper is on his feet screaming.

          ROPER
     Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell.

McCall jumps to this feet and joins him.

          MCCALL
     COME ON RUSSELL!...
          (to Roper)
     Who the fuck's Russell?!

          ROPER
     The jockey!

          MCCALL
     COME ON, RUSSELL!

Roper and McCall cheer together.

ON THE TRACK

The FOUR horse crosses the finish line in front. The SIX 
horse is flying... Needs to beat one horse to be second... 
He's running out of room... With one last surge he hits the 
wire and... It's too close to call.

IN THE STANDS

McCall, really excited, turns to Roper.

          MCCALL
     We won!

          ROPER
          (disheartened)
     We lost.

          MCCALL
          (confidently)
     We won.

          ROPER
     How much you wanna bet?

          MCCALL
     You want to bet on whether you won 
     your bet? This is getting sick.

ANGLE ON TOTE BOARD

As the photo finish light goes out and the numbers come on... 
4-6-8. They won.

IN THE STANDS

          ROPER
     Yes!

High fives.

          ROPER
     That's eight hundred bucks.

INT. BET/CASH WINDOW - DAY

Roper and McCall collect their money. Four hundred a piece, 
not bad. McCall pockets his money.

          MCCALL
     How long you been coming here?

          ROPER
     About six years. My partner took me.

          MCCALL
     Is it always like this?

          ROPER
     Occasionally you lose.

Suddenly Roper's BEEPER goes off. He checks it, takes out a 
cellular phone and dials.

          ROPER
          (into the phone)
     Roper here.
          (he listens)
     I'm on my way.

He hangs up and turns to McCall.

          ROPER
     We gotta go.

EXT. JEWELRY STORE - UNION SQUARE - DAY

Marble facade. Tastefully reinforced windows and door. 
Choppers circle overhead. Both ends of the street are sealed 
off. Barricades are up. Spectators and news crews crowd behind 
those. Numerous police circulate. This is a major operation 
in full swing.

INT. TRAVEL AGENCY - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

It's across the street from the jewelry store. Second story. 
The walls are plastered with travel posters. A poster of 
Tahiti is the most prominent. Members of police and SWAT are 
standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on 
a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of 
the store. Solis is at another desk, on the phone. He's 
talking to the suspect.

          SOLIS
     We're working on that, Joe. These 
     things aren't quite that simple.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Roper and McCall push through the barricades and come walking 
down the cordoned-off street. McCall takes a look at the 
jewelry store. Well fortified, foreboding.

          MCCALL
     This does not look good.

Roper looks over there, gives no reaction. They reach Solis' 
convertible Cadillac. It's parked out front of the travel 
agency building.

          ROPER
     See this. Solis has me driving the 
     shit-mobile, and he picked this up 
     straight out of impound for fourteen 
     grand. Probably worth thirty.

          MCCALL
     Police corruption. It's everywhere.

INT. COMMAND POST - DAY

Roper and McCall enter. McCall joins the men who are studying 
the blueprint. Roper stands by Solis and listens, takes note 
of the poster of Tahiti. Looks inviting.

          SOLIS
     This will take time to setup. I'll 
     have to get authorizations.
          (he listens)
     Okay, you relax, and I'll --

Solis pulls the phone away from his ear. Joe has obviously 
hung up.

          ROPER
     What do we got?

          SOLIS
     32 minutes ago the silent alarm went 
     off, then the fire alarm. A unit was 
     a block away, and the suspect got 
     trapped inside.

          ROPER
     Any verification on numbers.

          SOLIS
     We've only seen and talked to one 
     suspect. He calls himself "Joe". 
     There's two jewelers, two salespeople, 
     the manager, a security guard, and 
     an elderly woman. This particular 
     store is where they do a lot of 
     jewelry making and repair. They have 
     anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw 
     stones on any given day, so they 
     sure as shit didn't just wander in. 
     They knew what they were coming for.

          ROPER
     What have you promised them?

          SOLIS
     Just that I'd talk to my superiors.

McCall returns from checking out the blueprints.

          ROPER
     Any good points of entry?

McCall shakes his head.

          MCCALL
     The place is designed to be a vault.

Roper picks up the cellular phone. It dials automatically.

          ROPER
          (into the phone)
     My name's Roper. How are you people 
     doing in there?
          (he listens)
     Solis is off the job now, Joe. I'm 
     the guy authorized to give you 
     whatever you want.
          (listens)
     That's right, but first I need to 
     come down there to talk to you.

INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

We don't see anything but the suspect on the other end of 
the phone. He's wearing a ski mask and gloves. Totally 
unrecognizable to the audience. We will find out soon that 
he is, in fact, Korda. He appears very cool and collected.

          KORDA
     You don't have to come here.

INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY

          ROPER
     Yes, I do. That way there's no 
     misunderstandings. I need to make 
     sure no one's hurt, then we can take 
     care of business.

A long pause... Then a bit sinister.

          KORDA (V.O.)
     Alright, Roper. You want to come... 
     come.

          ROPER
     Good. I won't be armed. We gotta 
     operate on trust here. We're going 
     to wrap this up and have you guys 
     out of here as soon as possible.

Roper clicks off the phone. He already doesn't like the sound 
of this guy.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE - DAY

Roper, bulletproof vest, hands in the air, walks across the 
eerily deserted street straight toward the jewelry store. 
It's quiet now. The choppers have been pulled back.

Roper reaches the sidewalk right in front of the store. Korda 
cracks the door open.

          KORDA
          (warningly)
     Stay there.

Roper stops in his tracks.

          ROPER
     I'm going to put my hands down, okay.

Roper slowly lowers his hands.

INT. COMMAND CENTER

Everybody watching through the window.

EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

Korda takes a half step out the doorway. The gloved hand 
that is visible is not holding a weapon. The other half of 
his body is hidden inside the doorway. He wears jeans, a 
black shirt, and black Nike tennis shoes. He stares fiercely 
from behind the ski mask. There's no sign of fear in him.

          KORDA
     Are you in charge, Roper?

          ROPER
     Yep.

          KORDA
     I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. 
     I want it in perfect condition. I 
     want a uniformed cop to drive it up 
     right here. I want him to leave the 
     engine running and walk to the end 
     of the street. Then we'll come out. 
     I don't want any remote control 
     devices in it. I know all the tricks. 
     If it's not in perfect condition, 
     and I mean if its even low on wiper 
     fluid, I'm going to kill somebody 
     and we're gonna start again.

Korda lets that sink in.

          KORDA
     I want a plane waiting at the airport. 
     I'll tell them where I want to go 
     when I get there.

          ROPER
     Is that all?

          KORDA
     For now that's all.

          ROPER
     You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you 
     to do something for me. Let me take 
     a look around inside. Make sure 
     everybody's okay.

          KORDA
     No. You just do shit for me right 
     now.

Korda's eyes glare from behind the ski mask. He's an ominous 
figure.

          ROPER
     Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think 
     you could give me something to cement 
     the deal... One hostage.

          KORDA
     I'll give you something.

Korda pulls a wadded-up handkerchief out of his pocket and 
tosses it to Roper. Roper unwraps the handkerchief.

DETAIL SHOT

It's a human ear.

          KORDA
     In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger 
     piece. I assume there are no 
     "misunderstanding".

Roper is as serious as we've ever seen him.

          ROPER
     I understand you completely.

Korda disappears back behind the door.

EXT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Roper trudges back in. Things are more active now. Logistical 
officers are making flow charts. Photos of the hostages are 
being posted on a bulletin board. Roper approaches Solis, 
McCall and the SWAT CAPTAIN who are anxiously waiting for 
his report.

          ROPER
          (flatly)
     We're going to have to take this guy 
     out.

That draws a long silence. That's something Roper rarely 
says.

          SOLIS
     Can't we wear him down?

Roper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. Solis 
eyes it with dismay.

          ROPER
     I believe there's at least one 
     fatality in there already. The fire 
     alarm was probably set off by gunfire. 
     I believe he's working alone, both 
     from his conversation and the fact 
     that he wouldn't come out beyond the 
     doorway. He was holding a gun on the 
     hostages while he was talking to me. 
     His demeanor is calm and controlled, 
     that's what really scares me. The 
     other bad news is that he also 
     indicated a familiarity with our 
     techniques.
          (a beat)
     So, do you want to go in or wait for 
     him to come out?

McCall calmly offers his opinion.

          MCCALL
     Let him come out. Too many unknowns 
     in there.

Solis nods. That'll be the plan.

          MCCALL
     When we drive up the car, make sure 
     it's at an angle about three feet 
     from the curb.
          (to SWAT Captain)
     Put our best man "highground", Twenty 
     degree down angle.

The SWAT Captain motions and turns to one of his UNDERLINGS.

          SWAT CAPTAIN
     Have Anderson prep it and notify us 
     when he's on line.

The underling hurries off to take care of it. Solis looks at 
Roper dejectedly.

          SOLIS
     I feel this thing going sideways on 
     us.

Roper tries to buck him up.

          ROPER
     There is some good news. He's wearing 
     a ski mask, so he's protecting his 
     identity and hasn't determined to 
     kill all the hostages...
          (big pause)
     Yet.

INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

The jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is Korda. 
His face is sweaty. Hair matted. ANGLE WIDENS to show five 
very scared hostages: A JEWELER, middle-aged, balding. The 
male MANAGER, good-looking, thirties, three piece suit. TWO 
SALESGIRLS, nicely dressed, late twenties. A FEMALE CUSTOMER, 
gray-haired Hillsborough matron. They are all seated against 
the wall. There are two fatalities lying on the floor. The 
guard and one of the jewelers.

Korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler 
and motions to the dead bodies.

          KORDA
     Drag them behind the counter.

The two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the 
grim task. The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully. The 
older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of 
reality. Her eyes are a bit far away.

Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't 
been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass, 
reaches in and picks out the jewelry. He dumps it in an open 
satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones 
and gold chains. Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to 
her feet. She seems fairly out-of-it. Maybe in shock. She 
starts walking toward the front door frowning with 
dissatisfaction.

          WOMAN CUSTOMER
     I'm not staying here another minute.

          SALESGIRL #1
          (panicky)
     No, Mrs. Dotson.

Korda rushes around the display case.

          KORDA
     Come here, hag.

He grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags 
her away from the door. She shrieks. The manager takes a 
step toward Korda.

          MANAGER
     Leave her alone!

Korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her 
unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager.

          KORDA
     You're a brave one, aren't you?

The manager glares at him. He's about Korda's size. He thinks 
about making a run at him.

          SALESGIRL #2
          (pleading)
     Sit down, Doug.

A long beat... The manager sits back down on the floor with 
the other hostages. Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old 
woman. Korda looks down at her.

          KORDA
     If she's not conscious when it's 
     time to leave, I'll have to kill 
     her.

Korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of 
the gems.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Cops clear spectators out of the way as a green FORD EXPLORER 
RUMBLES through the barricade and heads down the deserted 
street.

INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Roper and McCall at the window, attention fixed on the store. 
The Explorer crawls to a stop in front of the jewelry store. 
Parks at a slight angle. The uniformed police officer gets 
out, leaving the engine running, and walks off back to the 
barricade.

          ROPER
     Okay. Time to give this fucker a 
     call.

Roper picks up the phone, waits. Everybody tensely watching 
the store.

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. BUILDING - SAME

A sniper team watching the store from a third floor window.

INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

Roper holding the phone. It's still ringing.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DIFFERENT BUILDING - SAME

Another sharpshooting team. Poised. Waiting.

EXT. ANOTHER ROOFTOP - SAME

And still another sharpshooter team.

INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

The phone is still ringing.

          ROPER
     This fucker's not answering.

Just then, the front door of the jewelry store swings open. 
A spray of white vapor shoots out the doorway. Korda is 
discharging a fire extinguisher.

          MCCALL
     There's your answer. He's smart.

          ROPER
     He's cutting down the visibility.

          MCCALL
     And doing a very good job of it.

A thick cloud of white hangs over the sidewalk obscuring the 
front of the jewelry store. Roper puts down the phone.

          MCCALL
     Come on. Give us one clean shot.

          SWAT CAPTAIN
          (into his radio)
     All positions, you have the green 
     light.

          MCCALL
     They're out.

Roper grabs a pair of binoculars.

HIS POV

Through the haze, we catch glimpses of the hostages circled 
around the figure in the ski mask. They slowly shuffle toward 
the Explorer.

McCall watches intently.

EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME

A sniper watches through his scope. Finger poised on the 
trigger.

ANGLE THROUGH THE SCOPE

Low visibility through the haze. The figure in the ski mask 
wavers in and out of the crosshairs, shielded momentarily by 
the jeweler, then he flashes back into the crosshairs. The 
sniper tries to lock him in.

INT. COMMAND CENTER - ROPER'S POV - BINOCULARS - SAME

The figure in the ski mask leans slightly and Roper catches 
a glimpse of the hostage right behind him. Roper recognizes 
him instantly.

          ROPER
     It's Korda.

McCall sees him now, too.

          MCCALL
     They switched clothes.

Roper drops the binoculars and grabs his police radio.

          ROPER
          (urgently)
     Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

Too late. A SHOT rings out. The figure in the ski mask goes 
down, hit by the bullet.

          ROPER
     Shit! Where'd that shot come from? 
     Hold your fire!

More SHOTS ring out.

DOWN ON THE STREET

The white vapor cloud swirls. The hostages, spattered with 
blood, scream and scatter. The figure in the ski mask lies 
dead on the sidewalk. Korda, dressed in the manager's three 
piece suit, holding the satchel of jewels in one hand and 
his gun in the other FIRES back at the snipers. He grabs 
salesgirl 1 and drags her into the Explorer.

INT. COMMAND CENTER

Roper sees Korda move toward the car with one of the hostages.

          MCCALL
     He's got the girl.

          ROPER
     Damnit!

As Roper turns into the room he notices a set of keys on 
Solis' desk.

          ROPER
          (grabbing the keys; 
          to Solis)
     Are these yours?

          SOLIS
     Yeah, they are but...

          ROPER
          (to McCall)
     Come on!

As Roper and McCall move toward the door...

          SOLIS
     Roper, what are you going to do? 
     Don't take my...

And Roper and McCall are gone.

          SOLIS
     ...car.

DOWN ON THE STREET

Police come rushing onto the street. Guns drawn. The Explorer 
ROARS off down the block. Roper and McCall burst out of the 
command center building, leap into Solis' Cadillac and tear 
off after the van. McCall is behind the wheel.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. POLICE BARRICADES - DAY

The Explorer comes barreling toward it. Spectators scatter. 
Two squad cars SCREECH up behind the barricades, trying to 
block Korda's escape. The Explorer PLOWS through the metal 
barricades. BASHES the squad cars out of the way. And screams 
off around the corner.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. STREET - DAY

The Explorer careens up an alley and bursts into the congested 
traffic of a side street. HONK-SCREECH! A Toyota swerves to 
miss it and broadsides a parked car. The Explorer fishtails 
off down the street.

INT. VAN - DAY

The salesgirl is terrified. Korda checks the rear view mirror. 
No one on his tail... At first. Then the Cadillac comes 
speeding up behind...

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

Roper and McCall have the Van in sight, about a block ahead. 
Roper picks up the radio.

          MCCALL
     Suspect heading west on Sutter now 
     passing Jones. Can we get an 
     intercept?

A voice comes back.

          VOICE (V.O.)
     R-32-David. We are proceeding south 
     on Hyde. Will intercept.

INT. VAN - DAY

Korda has one eye on the road and the other on the rear view 
mirror. The Cadillac is making up ground.

UP AHEAD

a squad car SCREECHES into the intersection and smokes to a 
stop. Korda jerks the wheel, pulls a SCREAMING right turn 
and heads up the hill.

EXT. STREET - DAY

The Cadillac is only about a hundred feet behind the van... 
Brakes SQUEALING, it swerves around the corner in pursuit.

THE VAN

hits the top of the hill and goes airborne... SLAMS back 
down to the pavement.

INT. VAN - DAY

Korda floors it, and we get a frightening view out the 
windshield as they head straight downhill. The salesgirl is 
beyond petrified.

THE CADILLAC

reaches the top of the hill. Going fast.

INT. CADILLAC

As it rocks forward violently. Front bumper slamming against 
the pavement. McCall sees the van ahead. Hammers the 
accelerator. No fear.

VAN

Korda sees traffic ahead... Intersection jammed. He pulls a 
hard left.

THE VAN

cuts straight across the corner... up on the sidewalk... 
shears a mailbox... a row of newspaper machines fly through 
the air... The van speeds off down a one-way street...

THE CADILLAC

arrives at the intersection a few seconds later... 
Intersection still jammed... People now standing on the corner 
gawking at the damage. The Caddy SCREECHES to a stop. McCall 
HONKS... The people scatter... The Cadillac drives through 
the corner.

THE VAN

Wrong way down a one-way street. Cars coming right at us in 
every angle. Frantic HONKING. Salesgirl SHRIEKS. Tires 
SMOKING... No way to avoid collision... Except Korda pulls a 
left an instant before impact... The van speeds back up the 
hill.

THE CADILIAC

Down the same one way street... Comes up on the head-on 
traffic, now stopped, paralyzed with fear from the near 
collision with Korda...

EXT. STREET - DAY

The Cadillac roars around the corner and heads up the hill.

INT. VAN

Korda, checking the rear view mirror. The Caddy is a short 
distance behind. Attention still focused behind, Korda enters 
an intersection, running a red light... CROSS-TRAFFIC... 
Korda stiffens... Pulls on the wheel

THE STREET

The van swerves... But not quick enough... GRINDING metal... 
SHATTERING glass... The van rolls over another car...

BRIEF CUT - LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

Korda and the salesgirl tossed about as the van does a 
dizzying roll...

THE VAN

...and CRASHES back down to the street upside down. After a 
beat, Korda crawls from the wreckage carrying the satchel of 
jewels. The salesgirl does not emerge. He spots a cable car 
reaching the top of the hill and starting its long descend. 
He heads toward it...

INT. CABLE CAR

As Korda comes toward them from the wreckage, some of the 
passengers view him uneasily.

THE CADILLAC

hits the top of the hill just in time for Rope and McCall to 
see Korda leap onto the moving cable car.

CABLE CAR

other passengers give Korda room. They can sense that he is 
not here merely for the ride. Korda looks out the back...

Roper and McCall haven't lost track of him. The Cadillac is 
making up ground on the cable car.

Korda moves to the back exit, pulls his gun and FIRES off a 
couple of shots at the Caddy.

INT. CADILLAC

A bullet fractures the windshield. McCall swerves.

BACK ON THE CABLE CAR

That makes up the minds of many of the passenger. They leap 
off the cable car.

Korda takes aim on the Caddy again and FIRES!

The brakeman charges down the aisle while Korda has his 
attention focused out the back and tries to shove him off 
the cable car...

Almost works... but Korda is able to hang on by one hand... 
He swings around toward the Brakeman who turns involuntarily 
as he sees the barrel of the gun pointed at him... BANG! 
Korda shoots him in the back.

The brakeman staggers down the aisle and slumps across the 
brake lever, releasing it more.

EXT. UNDER CABLE CAR

The brakes are stressed.

EXT. STREET

Now driverless, the cable car picks up speed... Broadsides a 
car... Pushing it into parked cars...

THE CABLE CAR

Korda and the remaining passengers are rocked around.

THE CABLE CAR

THUNDERS towards us... Filling the FRAME...

A SIDE ANGLE

Shows the cable car leaving the wreckage in its wake.

CADILLAC

It passes the smashed car. McCall looks at the speedometer 
as he paces the cable car. It's going at 45 mph.

          MCCALL
     What the fuck is going on.

          ROPER
     I don't know, but I've got to get on 
     there.

          MCCALL
     You're crazy.

          ROPER
     Pull up alongside.

EXT. INTERSECTION

The cable car barrels through... Plows into two cross-traffic 
cars... Knocks them aside... Keeps picking up speed.

THE CADILLAC

Weaves through the wreckage... Makes up ground on the cable 
car, trying to pull alongside.

THE CABLE CAR

For the moment, Korda is not shooting at the Caddy. His 
attention is now focused downhill as...

KORDA'S POV

The cable car nails another vehicle sending it spinning off 
to the side.

THE CADDY

dodges the spinning car... Jumps up onto the sidewalk... 
Mows down parking meters... Jumps back onto the street.

THE CABLE CAR

Korda leans out the door, takes aim at the Caddy... Another 
jammed intersection up ahead...

INT. CAR OF MAN TRAPPED IN INTERSECTION

He sees the cable car coming in his rear view mirror. He 
bails out...

THE CABLE CAR

SLAMS into the back of the car. Major impact.

THE CABLE CAR

Korda and the passengers are thrown to the floor.

THE REAR-ENDED CAR

Tumbles down the hill... Hits a car coming uphill and rolls 
into a parked car.

THE CADILLAC

Speeds up alongside the cable car. Roper climbs over the 
windshield, onto the hood and leaps onto the cable car.

INT. CABLE CAR

Korda sees him coming. FIRES. Roper dives out the other side 
of the cable car.

CABLE CAR

Roper hanging off the side. He gets his gun out of his 
holster...

Up ahead, a car pulls away from the curb...

Roper swings around to get back into the relative safety of 
the cable car. As he does his gun is raked out of his hand 
by the car which avoids a collision by a millimeter.

CABLE CAR

Korda aims as Roper re-enters...

CABLE CAR

As it CRASHES into the back of a car turning left.

Everyone is thrown toward the front of the car. Korda's gun 
goes flying. Roper dives on top of him. They trade punches. 
McCall is in b.g. with the Caddy pacing the cable car.

INTERSECTION

Pedestrains bolt out of the way as the cable car streaks 
through...

THE CABLE CAR

Roper hammers Korda into unconsciousness. Outside McCall is 
honking and yelling like crazy. Roper looks over... McCall 
points ahead...

ROPER'S POV

The cable car.

ROPER

Leaps to the brake lever. Pulls on it.

ANGLE UNDER THE CABLE CAR

The clamp tries to slow the descent. It whine and smokes... 
Then disintegrates before our eyes.

THE CABLE CAR

Roper feels the lever go slack in his hands. The cable car 
is speeding toward the end of the line... No way to stop 
it... Roper turns and takes a running leap into the Caddy...

INT. CADDY

He lands in the passenger seat. Roper pounds his foot down 
on the accelerator. The Caddy lunges ahead of the cable car... 
McCall can't figure out what he's doing. Roper yanks the 
steering wheel hard right...

EXT. STREET

The Caddy collides with the front of the cable car. Tires 
SCREAM. The steel wheels CLATTER. A cloud of burning rubber 
forms. The cable car grinds forward pushing the Cadillac... 
But it's working. The cable car is slowing.

BOTTOM OF STREET

The crowd now sees the Caddy and cable car bearing down on 
them. General hysteria as they flee.

THE CABLE CAR

Korda regains consciousness. Sees what's going on. He grabs 
the satchel and bails out of the cable car...

STREET

...Onto the hood of a passing taxi. The taxi slams on its 
brakes. Korda rolls off the hood, picks himself up and runs 
into an underground garage.

THE CABLE CAR

Grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line. Roper 
grabs McCall's gun off the seat and leaps out of the Caddy 
to pursue Korda. People approach to ogle the two vehicles in 
astonishment.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in "ready" position. 
He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure. He 
glides up the stairway to the third level. Checks back over 
the rail... No one around... Then a sound from inside the 
garage... Footsteps maybe.

Roper carefully opens the door... Swings in with his gun...

INT. THIRD LEVEL - GARAGE

Lots of cars, but no one in sight. Roper moves quickly to 
the protection of a row of cars... He crouches down. Scans 
beneath the cars... No sign of Korda.

Roper searches between two rows... Comes up beside a van... 
Thinks he hears something stirring inside. Whirls a gun toward 
the window.

A dog lunges at the CAMERA... Snarling... baring teeth... 
Roper moves on.

NEW ANGLE

As a BMW crawls through the parking structure. Roper steps 
into the FOREGROUND, right into its path, gun visible. The 
BMW rolls to a stop. Roper approaches with caution.

Roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30 
year old blonde. Roper takes a check out of the backseat.

          ROPER
     Sorry, go.

INSIDE THE CAR

The woman rolls up the window and hits the gas. She drives 
off.

INT. GARAGE

Roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final 
scan... He has the discouraging feeling that Korda might 
have escaped.

He heads toward the exit... Suddenly a SCREECH of tires... 
Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. He drives 
and FIRES! Bullets shatter the windshield.

The car continues toward Roper. He has to roll out of the 
path of the car. The car swerves past Roper. Tries to make 
it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear 
window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail 
and continues down to the next level. Roper runs after it.

GARAGE - 2ND LEVEL

As the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and 
piles into a parked car.

Korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel 
of jewels. Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck.

Roper moves to him with a face grim as death. He strips the 
satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car 
door. Korda goes to his knees. Roper holds the barrel of his 
gun right up between Korda's eyes.

          ROPER
     Give me one reason why I shouldn't 
     kill you right here.

Korda stares back at Roper defiantly. He knows a cop won't 
kill him in cold blood...

What he doesn't know is that Roper doesn't give a shit about 
those rules at this moment.

          ROPER
     You know Sam Baffert was a friend of 
     mine. He had a wife... and he had a 
     daughter.

Korda stares past the barrel of the gun.

          KORDA
     I don't give a shit about you or 
     your fucking friends.

And that makes Roper even angrier... But he keeps it all 
inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night.

He yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter 
against Korda's forehead. He's on the verge of executing 
this guy.

          KORDA
     You can't kill me like this.

          ROPER
     What if you and me got into a 
     struggle... and my gun went off?

In a flash, Roper points the gun upward and fires off a SHOT!

          ROPER
     Could I kill you then?
          (beat, beat)
     Could I kill you then?

Roper jams the gun back under Korda's chin. A pull of the 
trigger would send a bullet straight up through Korda's skull. 
And now Korda is fully convinced. He squeezes his eyes closed. 
Face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst 
out of his skin.

ANGLE - MCCALL

moving across garage into position.

          MCCALL
     Roper! Put it down!... Put it down 
     man, we got him.
          (beat)
     Come on... Put it down.

Long, long beat. Roper eases up and Korda smiles. Just when 
we feel the scene is over, Roper turns back quickly and kicks 
Korda in the stomach, then grabs Korda by the hair, pulls 
his head back and shoves the gun in his face.

          ROPER
     We do this shit by the book, but you 
     ain't gonna be smiling.

Korda is doubled up coughing, spitting up blood. Roper walks 
away as McCall moves in to put the cuffs on Korda.

INT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT

Roper is sitting in a cubicle doing paperwork. A group of 
reporters and photographers move down the hallway adjoining 
the squadroom. One of them is Ronnie. Through the glass walls, 
she notices Roper sitting alone at the computer. She bids 
good-night to the reporters and comes into the squadroom.

          RONNIE
     You weren't at the press conference.

Roper keeps tapping away at the computer.

          ROPER
     I wanted to get this out of the way.

          RONNIE
     You got a bet on the game tonight?

          ROPER
     As a matter of fact, I do.

She nods knowingly.

          RONNIE
     It's already started.

          ROPER
     I was going to catch the last half 
     on TV.

Ronnie watches him for a moment. He stops typing, looks at 
her and smiles. She suddenly becomes self-conscious. Guess 
it was something she was thinking.

          RONNIE
     Good-night.

She turns abruptly to leave. Roper finds himself rising from 
his chair.

          ROPER
     You having dinner with Mr. Baseball?

She turns back around.

          RONNIE
     Greg is on a road trip. I was just 
     going to make some pasta.

He takes a few steps toward.

          ROPER
     That kind with the garlic and the 
     oil that I like so much?

          RONNIE
     No. The kind from Kraft, with the 
     macaroni and the cheese.

          ROPER
     I've been craving that stuff all 
     week.

          RONNIE
     And it's hard to get.

He looks at her innocently.

          RONNIE
     Just dinner.

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ronnie is making macaroni. Roper helps to prepare a dressing 
to go with the salad. He is mixing oil, vinegar, sugar and 
spices. He lets her have a taste.

          ROPER
     What do you think?

          RONNIE
     Mmm, needs a little something.

          ROPER
     What are you talking about? This is 
     it. This is the stuff right here.
          (beat; he tastes)
     Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.

          RONNIE
     Yeah that's it.

          ROPER
     Why don't you just stick your finger 
     in and stir it up.

          RONNIE
          (laughing)
     Scottie...

There is a long pause as he looks at her.

          ROPER
     What would you say if I quit gambling?

Ronnie stirs the macaroni.

          RONNIE
     I'd say you'd be miserable... It's 
     not the gambling. It's what the 
     gambling got in the way of. The track 
     is where you'd take your troubles 
     instead of sharing them with me...

Ronnie puts the lid on the macaroni. There is a beat before 
she continues.

          RONNIE
     Scottie, remember the day you lost 
     that hostage in union square. You 
     came over that night and we made 
     mad, crazy love. But I didn't even 
     know what happened... 'til I heard 
     it on the news the next morning.

          ROPER
     It's because I wanted to keep you 
     away from that world.

          RONNIE
     It's not that world. It's your world. 
     It's part of who you are.

          ROPER
          (beat)
     Veronica, it's not easy for me... I 
     don't know if I can change overnight. 
     But what I'm telling you is that I 
     want to share everything with you, 
     because I don't ever want to be 
     without you again.

The dog yawns. They laugh. Roper moves closer to her. He 
kisses her and she responds.

INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The lovemaking is over. Roper is gazing at the ceiling, 
thinking. Ronnie is cuddled around him. A comfortable 
moment...

          ROPER
     What about Greg? What are you gonna 
     tell him?

          RONNIE
     It's okay. We broke up.

          ROPER
          (surprised)
     When?

          RONNIE
     Just now.

INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY

Clarence Teal, Korda's cousin sits in front of the plexiglass 
wall. He's edgy, fidgety. Clarence doesn't like to make visits 
to jail.

Korda, wearing prison clothes, is led in by a guard. Korda 
takes a seat at the other side of the plexiglass wall and 
picks up the receiver. Clarence picks up his receiver.

          CLARENCE
     How ya doin', man?

Korda grips the phone, leans forward and stares through the 
wall.

          KORDA
     You gotta do something for me... 
     this fucker, Roper, he's gotta 
     girlfriend. She works at the 
     newspaper. I want you to take care 
     of her.

Clarence is totally unnerved by this request.

          CLARENCE
     Hey, Michael, that's not my thing.

Korda glares at him murderously.

          KORDA
     You gotta do this for me. I'm in 
     here because of you.

          CLARENCE
     Man, what's this about? Ya know, you 
     were robbing a store. It wasn't 
     personal. It was his job.

          KORDA
          (exploding)
     Fuck you! You know what he did to 
     me?!...

Korda starts to draw the attention of the guard. He controls 
himself, lowers his voice. But the viciousness is still there.

          KORDA
     He held a gun to my head and said he 
     should kill me right then... He made 
     me...

He doesn't finish that thought.

          KORDA
     You do this for me Clarence.

Clarence is getting very upset.

          CLARENCE
     Don't make do it, Mike.

          KORDA
     Are you going to turn on me too? Who 
     helped you when you were strung out? 
     Who gave you money? Who bailed you 
     out of jail?

          CLARENCE
     I won't get away with it.

          KORDA
     Nobody knows who you are. Make it 
     look like a robbery.

Clarence holds back tears, because he knows he's going to 
have to do this.

EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A gray San Francisco evening. It starts to rain.

INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

She's cooking some kind of sauce. She has a taste.

EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A subjective POV watching through the window as she moves 
around the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ronnie pours some oil in a pan. The phone RINGS. She crosses 
the kitchen to answer it.

INT. PICKUP - NIGHT

Roper on his cell phone. Paco is on the seat beside him.

          ROPER
     Hi, I'm going to stop at the corner 
     for some wine.

Roper notices the rain, searches for the windshield wiper 
switch.

INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          RONNIE
     How's Paco doing?

INT. PICKUP - NIGHT

          ROPER
     He was going nuts at the park. He 
     met this very attractive poodle. 
     They made plans to meet again next 
     weekend.

Paco sits there panting. Roper pulls the pickup over in front 
of the store.

INT. KITCHEN - STORE

          RONNIE
     Okay, dinner will be ready when you 
     get here.

She hangs up.

EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Through the window we watch her cross back to the stove.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ronnie lifts the lid on the sauce. Stirs. It spatters on her 
blouse. She regards the stain with dismay. Puts the lid back 
on and leaves the kitchen.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ronnie unbuttons her blouse as she moves to the...

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

She takes off the blouse, goes to the closet door... throws 
it open. She looks around. Something's not right. She takes 
a step into the closet and finds what she's looking for -- A 
laundry basket -- tucked away in the corner. She puts the 
soiled blouse in the hamper and takes a fresh one off a 
hanger. She buttons the clean blouse as she walks to...

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Dark. She turns on the light. She goes to the mirrored 
medicine cabinet.

IN THE REFLECTION

Behind her the shower curtain is drawn, fluttering ever so 
slightly. She opens the medicine cabinet. Takes out some 
perfume. Dabs some on her neck. She puts back the bottle and 
closes the cabinet. We fully expect someone to be standing 
right behind her in the reflection... There's no one there. 
She turns off the light as she walks out of the bathroom.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ronnie walks back to the kitchen... Notices something on the 
floor further down the hallway... What is it? She moves 
closer... And now we get to the POV that tells us someone is 
in the house... Watching her through a cracked doorway.

BRIEF CUT

A hand opening a buck knife. Water drips from the fingers.

BACK IN THE HALL

Ronnie bends down. It's a wet spot. Like half a shoeprint. 
She reaches down to touch it...

BUZZZZZ!!!! The oven timer. She hurries back to the kitchen.

INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

She turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the 
oven. She puts it down on the counter and cross to the 
refrigerator. She opens the door and looks inside. The 
refrigerator door obscures half the FRAME... She digs around 
for something... We're sure that when she closes the door, 
he's going to be behind it... She takes out a head of lettuce 
and... Closes the door... Still no one there.

She turns... Clarence is standing there. Dripping wet. Ronnie 
shrieks... The knife flashes forward... She grabs the lid 
from the sauce pan and CLANG... Fends off the blade. She 
bolts for the hallway. Clarence grabs her by the blouse... 
RIP! She pulls away.

IN THE HALLWAY

She races down the hall. Clarence lunges into FRAME. She 
goes down... He goes down... the knife goes skidding down 
the hallway... Ronnie scrambles to get it... Clarence has 
her by the ankle... She claws for the knife... Just out of 
reach.

EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Roper's pickup pulls up in front. He gets out. Paco jumps 
out behind him. It's raining harder. They hurry up the walkway 
toward the house. Suddenly Roper realizes he forgot the wine. 
He goes back to the truck. Paco pads after him.

Roper opens the driver's side door, reaches in and grabs the 
wine. He closes the door, starts away, but pauses to check 
himself in the window.

Suddenly, a floodlight comes crashing through Ronnie's front 
bay windows. It SPARKS and FLASHES. Still plugged in, it 
bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house. 
FLICKERING and FLASHING.

Roper rushes toward the house... Crashes through the front 
door... Up the stairway... Paco bounds after him... Roper 
hits her front door running... Wham! He bounces off. He 
shoulders it again... The door doesn't give... He pulls out 
his gun... BAM! BAM! Shoots off the lock.

INT. RONNIE'S APT. - NIGHT

A QUICK SHOT of Clarence's hand grabbing the knife.

INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Roper kicks open the door. Charges in.

INT. RONNIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Ronnie is laying on the floor, gasping for air. Choke marks 
around her throat. Roper rushes to her side. Paco is on his 
heels.

          ROPER
     You okay?!

She nods. Points out the back way.

          ROPER
          (to Paco)
     Stay.

The dog obediently stays with Ronnie. Roper dashes out the 
back.

EXT. BACK OF RONNIE'S - NIGHT

Raining more heavily now. Roper bursts out onto the back 
porch. Sees Clarence leaping off the last rung of the fire 
escape to the alley. Roper flies down the fire escape... 
Vaults the last flight and races after Clarence.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Clarence sprints down the block... Through the intersection... 
HONK! SCREECH! A car barely misses him. It does a one-eighty 
on the rain-slick pavement. Clarence disappears into the 
shadows. Roper arrives a beat later... Streaks through the 
intersection... Into the shadows.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT

This one is steep. Clarence huffs and puffs as he labors. He 
shoots into a doorway. Tries the door. Locked. He looks back. 
Roper is coming. Relentless. He rushes across the steep 
street. Almost slips on the reflective asphalt. Roper spots 
him crossing and picks up the pace. He can see that Clarence 
is faltering.

NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL

Clarence staggers into an alleyway...

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

Narrow, dark and dripping with rain. Roper arrives at the 
mouth of the alley. Gun ready, he moves cautiously, eyes 
adjusting to the darkness. The PATTER of rain off the 
rooftops. His FOOTSTEPS. No other sound.

He reaches the end of the alley... A brick wall. No way out. 
Or so it would seem. However, Clarence is nowhere in sight. 
Roper turns back. Brick walls tower on both sides, rising 
into darkness. Roper checks a steel door. Locked. He checks 
another one on the opposite side of the alley. Also locked. 
Where did Clarence go? He moves back toward the misting light 
of the street... Slowly...

The FAINT RATTLE of a fire escape... And Clarence leaps down 
out of the shadow. Slashing with the knife. He catches Roper 
across the arm.

Rips through his clothes right down to the skin. Roper's gun 
CLATTERS under a parked car and into the street. Clarence 
has first jump. He scrambles into the street, around the car 
and grabs the gun...

Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence 
down before he can aim. They roll into the middle of the 
street. Both have a death grip on the weapon. Clarence fights 
like a trapped animal. Thrashing desperately. Roper pins him 
on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers.

WIDER SHOT

Headlights radiate over the crest of the hill. Coming quickly. 
Roper sees this. He rolls out of the way, abandoning the 
battle for the gun. Clarence struggles to his knees. Turns 
the weapon on Roper... A speeding cab lunges over the top of 
the hill. Clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights. 
Tires squeal. Brakes lock. Clarence is transfixed... WHAM! 
He's launched through the air like a ragdoll... His body 
lands limply 30 feet down the street. The CABBY gets out of 
his vehicle.

          CABBY
     Jesus Christ. What was he doing?!

Roper walks down the hill to the body. The cabby follows.

          CABBY
     There was no way I could miss him.

Roper ignores the cabby. He looks down at Clarence's body, 
contemplating something.

          CABBY
     This isn't my fault.

          ROPER
     Shut the fuck up!

The cabby immediately clams up.

          ROPER
     Get on your radio and get the police 
     here.

Roper stares at Clarence's body, steel-eyed.

INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY

Korda is led in again. An expression of surprise registers 
on his face when he sees who's waiting for him.

KORDA'S POV

Roper is sitting stoically behind the plexiglass wall.

KORDA

Dons a smug expression and takes a seat. He picks up his 
receiver as Roper picks up his.

          ROPER
     If you try again to hurt me or anyone 
     I know, I'm going to have you killed.

Korda feigns total innocence.

          KORDA
     What in the world are you talking 
     about, Mr. Roper?

Roper takes out a photograph and holds it up against the 
glass.

          ROPER
     Here's a picture of your cousin 
     Clarence. That gentleman standing 
     over him is the coroner.

Korda's face tightens. He drops the innocent act. His 
countenance is now a study in hate.

          KORDA
     I used to have an apartment, a car, 
     jewelry. I had a fucking eight 
     thousand dollar watch. Now look what 
     I have.

He motions around.

          KORDA
     You're threatening me? You think I 
     give a fuck? You think you can scare 
     me off?
          (a laugh)
     Why don't you come in here and kick 
     my ass? Get some of your guard friends 
     in here to help. I'd like that.

Roper glares at him mounting rage.

          KORDA
          (smirking)
     He really shook you up, didn't he?... 
     I've got ten years worth of appeals 
     to figure out how to fuck with you. 
     Who knows? Maybe some scumbag lawyer 
     will get me out on a technicality.

Roper sits there, suddenly feeling powerless.

          KORDA
     You came here to threaten me? That's 
     a laugh. Maybe you should BEG me... 
     Go ahead. Get down on your knees.

Roper leaps from his chair and smashes the receiver against 
the plexiglass wall.

          ROPER
     You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill 
     you!

The guard rushes over and restrains Roper. Wrestles him away 
from the glass wall. Roper pushes him off and gathers himself. 
He gives Korda one last stare. Korda sits there smirking 
back at him... Roper turns his back and walks out.

INT. ROPER'S OFFICE - DAY

McCall is practicing his negotiating techniques in a mirror.

          MCCALL
     I'm here to help you.

Not quite right. He adjusts his stance. This time puts a 
little hand movement into it.

          MCCALL
     I'm here to help you. Talk to me.

He's still not satisfied.

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. ROPER'S OFFICE - DAY

Captain Solis pokes his head in the door, he's been looking 
for McCall.

          SOLIS
     We got a situation at the V.A. 
     Hospital. The responding officer has 
     requested a negotiator.

          MCCALL
     Where's Roper?

          SOLIS
     He's on his way. Get over there.

EXT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL ROOFTOP - DAY

A VETERAN wearing green fatigue is dangling another WHEELCHAIR 
BOUND VET over the edge. Fourteen floors up. The two front 
wheels are literally hanging out there in space.

          VET #1
          (rambling incoherently)
     I can't fight this technology. They 
     have microprocessors made in totally 
     sterile environments. I've seen those 
     places. Everyone is dressed in white. 
     It's like paper clothing, man. They're 
     not even human.

Vet 2 is struggling to stay in the chair and not be tipped 
into the street 150 feet below. He is, needless to say, very 
panicky.

          VET #2
     Dave, don't do this, bro. Pull me 
     in. We'll do a few laps in the park 
     and figure out some other way.

But he's not getting through to his friend.

          VET #1
     I can't help this, man. Do you have 
     any idea what those microchips look 
     like? How small they are when they 
     put them in your brain?

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

Leading to the roof. A COUPLE OF COPS and MEMBERS OF THE 
HOSPITAL STAFF peek out at the vet as he continues to rant 
and rave. McCall arrives at the top of the stairs. OFFICER 
#4 sure looks happy to see him. McCall takes a peek out onto 
the roof. He isn't happy about what he sees.

          OFFICER #4
     When we got here, he was already 
     doing his balancing act. I was talking 
     to him, but it made him more agitated 
     so I backed off.

          MCCALL
     Why is he up there?

          OFFICER #4
     Something about a microchip in his 
     brain.

          MCCALL
     Who is he?

A NURSE answers him.

          NURSE HERRIN
     David Adler. He likes to be called 
     Dave. The other guy is Walter 
     Sinclair.

We hear the urgent cry of the vet in the wheelchair.

          VOICE (V.O.)
     Somebody help me out here. Somebody 
     stop him.

The nurse turns to McCall.

          NURSE HERRIN
     What are you waiting for?

          MCCALL
     Another negotiator is on his way.

          NURSE HERRIN
     We can't wait for another negotiator. 
     You have to do something.

          MCCALL
     What about the doctors?

          NURSE HERRIN
     He hates all the doctors. He says 
     they're in on the conspiracy.

          VET #1 (O.S.)
     Where is everybody? He's going to 
     kill me!

McCall takes a deep breath and steps out onto the roof.

EXT. ROOF - DAY

McCall moves slowly across the tar paper roof. Clouds overhead 
threaten rain. Vet 1 turns to him suddenly, wobbling the 
wheelchair. Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over. McCall's 
heart jumps into his mouth.

          DAVE
     Get the fuck out of here!

McCall is tense and stiff. He stammers.

          MCCALL
     I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help 
     you, D... Dave.

          DAVE
     You can't help me, man.

So much for McCall's opener. Now what?

          WALTER
     He's high on something, man. Give 
     him some thorazine or something.

Dave ignores Walter.

          DAVE
     No one can help me. They're 
     controlling my mind.

McCall moves a couple steps closer.

          MCCALL
     Who's controlling your mind?

          DAVE
     Whoa!... The government. They control 
     everybody's mind. You're too fucking 
     stupid to know that?

McCall fumbles for the right response.

          MCCALL
     This has nothing to do with Walter.

          DAVE
     They want Walter dead!

EXT. STREET BELOW - DAY

Cops keep spectators back from the building. Fire trucks and 
rescue vehicles are on the scene. Everybody looking straight 
up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over 
the side of the building.

EXT. ROOF - DAY

Walter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat, 
eyes closed, praying.

          MCCALL
     Dave, look at me.

Dave obliges. He looks at McCall with eyes that have lost 
the battle for sanity. McCall is momentarily frozen by those 
eyes. Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead.

          MCCALL
     Tell me what's wrong.

          DAVE
     Particles, man. I feel them all the 
     time. I feel them in my arms and 
     legs man, that's how they punish me.

          MCCALL
     How can I help you with the particles?

          DAVE
     It's not just the particles man, 
     it's the whole fucking machine, this 
     is how they get assassins to operate. 
     It's been this way since the cuban 
     missile crisis.

Dave starts to look over into the street, he tips Walter 
forward, Walter shrieks in mortal fear. White knuckles the 
armrests of his wheelchair and then:

          MCCALL
          (blurting out)
     They have less power over you if you 
     look into my eyes.

          DAVE
     Huh?

McCall even surprises himself with that one. It was a sheer 
act of desperation. He holds his breath and waits to see 
what the effect is. Dave turns back around.

          DAVE
     Huh?

EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

Roper's truck comes speeding down the street, lurches to a 
halt. He leaps out and speaks to a FIREMAN.

          ROPER
     Whata ya got?

          FIREMAN
     Some nuts dangling a guy over the 
     edge in a wheelchair.

          ROPER
     Can you get a net out here?

          FIREMAN
     Negative. It's 14 floors up. No nets 
     gonna hold a fall from that high up.

EXT. ROOF - DAY

McCall nods slowly. Sweat pouring off him.

          MCCALL
     We've been onto them for a long time.

A glimmer from Dave. Maybe McCall is a kindred spirit.

          MCCALL
     Let me show you something.

Now he's got Dave's interest. McCall slowly takes out his 
beeper.

          MCCALL
     See this. I'm jamming them, Dave. 
     I'm jamming their frequency so they 
     can't control your mind anymore. 
     Don't you feel that? You don't have 
     to do what they say.

Dave listens to his head.

          WALTER
     He's jamming them, Dave. Pull me 
     back in.

          MCCALL
     You see, the particles are gone, 
     they can't punish you anymore.

Dave tries to feel for particles. Tears form in Dave's eyes.

          DAVE
     Tell my dad.

          MCCALL
     Tell him what, what do you want me 
     to tell him?

          DAVE
     Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.

          MCCALL
     I'll tell him. Where does he live. 
     We'll get him on the phone right 
     now.

Dave is suddenly lost in thought again. His expression turns 
to a frown:

          DAVE
     I hate fucking Springfield.

          MCCALL
     Is that where you're family lives?

Then with sudden swiftness.

          DAVE
     I still hear them, man. You can't 
     jam them. They've got the technology, 
     man. They've got the satellites, 
     Jack. They keep shooting beams off 
     those satellites. What power do I 
     have?

Dave pushes the wheelchair forward. McCall LUNGES for the 
wheelchair but doesn't make it. Walter SCREAMS as he falls.

          MCCALL
     NOOOO!

WALTER AND HIS WHEELCHAIR

freefall down toward earth in SLOW MOTION. The wheelchair 
turns end over end. People SCREAM as Walter IMPACTS with the 
pavement. The wheelchair CRASHES down nearby.

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. ROOF - DAY

McCall looks over the edge at Walter's twisted body below. 
Then he grabs Dave and wrestles him down, cuffing his hands 
behind his back. The Cops and Medical Staff Members rush out 
to restrain.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

The crowd is dispersing. Roper is talking with some of the 
other cops. McCall storms out of the Vet Hospital and down 
the stairs. Roper moves toward him.

          ROPER
     McCall!

No response. McCall gets into his ND Sedan car and fires it 
up.

          ROPER
     McCall!

Roper races over and manages to jump in just as the car 
screeches away from the curb.

BAY BRIDGE - DAY

McCall doesn't even seem to have registered that Roper is in 
the car with him. He drives. Stone-faced. Roper studies him 
for a beat.

          ROPER
     Where are we going?

INT. CAR - DAY

Moving POV thru windshield of car, we see a freeway sign 
that says "Golden Gate Racetrack."

EXT. RACETRACK

Establish grand stands.

INT. BETTING AREA - DAY

McCall pounds over to the betting window. Roper leans up 
against the window beside him. Watches.

          MCCALL
     Give me a twenty dollar four-six 
     exacta.

          TELLER
     The six is scratched.

This throws McCall for a beat.

          MCCALL
     Then give me a fucking four-seven 
     exacta.

The teller punches out the ticket. McCall takes the ticket 
and pounds over to box seat area. Roper follows a couple of 
steps behind, giving him some space.

EXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY

McCall sits down in the same box as the last time. Roper 
sits down next to him.

EXT. TRACK - DAY

The horses go into the gate.

EXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY

McCall watches intently as the horses spring from the gate. 
(The track announcer's call plays over the scene.)

          MCCALL
     Come on four horse! Come on Seven 
     horse!

Roper isn't watching the horse. He's watching McCall. Watching 
him redirect all his pent up emotion. Understanding exactly 
how he feels.

McCall is screaming his head off.

          MCCALL
     Come on four-seven... Come on... 
     Come on... Come on...

The horses cross the wire. The four and seven finish mid-
pack. McCall hangs his head in despair. He didn't give a 
shit about the race. He looks inconsolable.

          ROPER
     It might have happened no matter who 
     was up there.

          MCCALL
     Bullshit! Would it have happened to 
     you?

          ROPER
     Maybe... There's one thing you have 
     to remember... You don't create the 
     situations. You can only try to save 
     people from them.

          MCCALL
     I thought I could do it. I was so 
     damn sure of myself. But I didn't 
     know what to say. The words wouldn't 
     come. My mouth turned to mush. You 
     make it look so easy, Roper. But it 
     is not. It's not easy.
          (beat)
     It's a different job than looking 
     through the rifle scope.

          ROPER
     That it is.

A long silent beat.

          MCCALL
     How many have you lost?

          ROPER
     I look at it as how many I've saved. 
     That's the way you've got to look at 
     it.

          MCCALL
     And what about the ones you don't 
     save?

          ROPER
     You live with it... and they haunt 
     you. It doesn't leave.

          MCCALL
     And what if you can't live with it?

          ROPER
     You've got to decide that for 
     yourself.

McCall squeezes his eyes closed. He can still see that vet 
falling to his death. Roper can see McCall's pain.

          ROPER
     I've lost three. One of them was my 
     partner. I think about them every 
     time I go into a situation.
          (a beat)
     There's a million people in this 
     city with all kinds of twisted shit 
     going on in their heads, and the 
     bitch of this job is that we expect 
     to go out every day and do the 
     impossible -- to somehow control all 
     this craziness... and we can't.
          (a beat)
     Nobody's faulting you for this, 
     McCall. My advice is you let yourself 
     off the hook.

McCall hears him but is still undecided.

          MCCALL
     I don't know... I don't know...

Roper gets up, stands over McCall, puts a hand on his 
shoulder.

          ROPER
     Let's get out of here.

McCall slowly gets up and they walk out.

INT. JAIL - DAY

It's a small interview room. Korda sits opposite bail bondsman 
JOHN HAWKINS (white, grizzled, forty).

          HAWKINS
     What the fuck... You bring me all 
     the way over here to tell me you've 
     got no collateral! What do I look 
     like to you -- Santa Claus? I'm a 
     bail bondsman!

          KORDA
     No, no, see what I'm sayin' is, I've 
     got the --

          HAWKINS
     Pick up a fucking phone for chrissake! 
     You think I got time for this crap?

          KORDA
     Hey, hey, I got shit on the outside. 
     I got somebody cashing it in for me 
     and --

Hawkins gets up and goes to the door.

          HAWKINS
     Gimme a fuckin' break.

          KORDA
     Alright, alright, look, man, look, 
     just leave me your card. I can get 
     it to you by tomorrow night.

Hawkins looks at him skeptically for a beat. Then pulls out 
his BUSINESS CARD and hands it to him. He walks out the door 
as we HOLD on Korda -- pocketing the card.

EXT. POSTRIO - NIGHT

Establishing shot.

INT. POSTRIO - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of a glass of wine being poured. PULL BACK to reveal 
Roper and Ronnie all dressed up for a special evening. The 
waiter hovers as Roper tastes the wine.

          ROPER
          (snootily)
     It has a nice "nose".

          WAITER
     The special this evening is braised 
     sweetbreads with a white truffle 
     sauce on cracked bulgar.

Roper looks at him a long beat.

          ROPER
     That's my favorite.
          (smiles)
     Why don't you give us a minute.

The waiter retreats. Roper looks across the table at Ronnie 
as she sips her wine.

          ROPER
     You like this place?

          RONNIE
     It's very nice.

          ROPER
     I guess you realize that there's 
     something special that I want to 
     talk to you about.

She didn't realize that. Now she's getting nervous.

          RONNIE
     There is?

          ROPER
     For the last week things have been 
     going pretty well between us. I think 
     we've been doing a good job getting 
     intimate and all that stuff...

Now she's really worried.

          RONNIE
     Yeah?

          ROPER
     ...Let me just show you.

Roper reaches into his coat pocket.

          RONNIE
     Scottie, we should think this over 
     before we...

He pulls out two airline tickets.

          ROPER
     Tahiti.

Ronnie is immensely relieved.

          RONNIE
     Ohhh... A vacation... Yeah that sounds 
     like a great idea.

Roper notices her relief and for the first time realizes 
what she was thinking.

          ROPER
     Oh you thought I was going to ask 
     you...

Ronnie averts her eyes, a bit embarrassed.

          ROPER
     Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to 
     Tahiti first and see if that works 
     out...

Roper picks up his menu and peruses it.

          ROPER
     I assume you're having your usual -- 
     the "air dried venison".

INT. HALLWAY JAIL - DAY CLOSE ON

The wheels of a laundry cart, moving slowly down the hall. A 
white metal door slides open, and the cart passes through.

INT. PROPERTY ROOM JAIL - CONTINUOUS

As the cart rolls into the room TILT UP to see

KORDA

pushing the cart. He stops. A GUARD (guard #3) stands with 
his back to Korda. He's on the phone.

          KORDA
     Got another load.

          JAIL GUARD #3
     Rack 'em up.
          (into the phone)
     Look, man, if it doesn't make it 
     down here by five it's not my problem.

As the guard continues, Korda hangs several garment bags, 
zipped and tagged, onto an ELECTRIC TROLLEY -- similar to 
the kind used by dry-cleaners to move clothing.

          KORDA
     All done.

Korda pushes a button and the trolley STARTS TO MOVE. The 
guard, still on the phone, buzzes open the door.

ON THE GUARDS BACK

We hear Korda wheeling the cart out the door.

CLOSE ANGLE

on the door sliding shut.

ON THE GUARDS BACK - CLOSE

Hold a beat. PANNING SLOWLY around the room to FIND -- suit 
bag's moving on the trolley. BOOM DOWN to FIND Korda's feet 
just as they lift off the ground and disappear behind the 
bags.

ANGLE ON KORDA

hanging onto the trolley as it moves along the wall and then 
down through an opening in the floor and into...

INT. BASEMENT JAIL - CONTINUOUS

as it loops around a large room, carrying him toward the 
back wall. The metal ridges of the trolley CUT into his 
fingers, drawing blood. Then he drops down, and quietly 
rummages through other bags of clothing. He tries on a pair 
of pants but they come up to his ankles. He looks like he's 
about to go wading. As he rips them off and reaches for 
another pair...

                                   CUT TO:

INT. LONG HALLWAY JAIL - LATER

Korda appears around a corner, dressed in street clothes, 
holding a CLIPBOARD -- moving steadily toward camera.

KORDA'S POV - DOWN THE HALLWAY

A female civilian EMPLOYEE heading in his direction. As they 
pass he nods and she nods back. Then Korda passes through a 
door at the end of the hallway and into...

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. CELL BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

The door closes behind him and locks with the loud SNAP of 
metal.

Slowly, with deliberate steps, he moves down the corridor 
toward the door at the other end, past the first GUARD (guard 
#3) -- enclosed in bullet proof glass.

TRACKING - KORDA'S FEET

step by step. The voices of prisoners, muffled behind thick 
glass.

CLOSE ON KORDA'S FACE

trying to stay cool, his heart pounding. Then...

          A VOICE (O.S.)
     Hey!

Korda FREEZES, then slowly turns to FIND... A prison GUARD 
(#1) moving toward him.

THE GUARD POV - MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO KORDA

          KORDA
     ...Yeah?

The guard then stops in front of him and holds up his hand.

          JAIL GUARD #1
     You dropped your card.

Korda takes THE CARD given to him by the bail bondsman.

          JAIL GUARD #1
     You guys are the scum of the earth.

          KORDA
     Just tryin' to make a living.

Korda turns and walks out the door into...

INT. SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

It's the final step before getting out of the building. A 
small room with another GUARD (Latino; guard #2) behind glass, 
and several TV monitors. A BLACK WOMAN (forty-five) is arguing 
with a LATINO GUARD.

          JAIL GUARD #2
     I don't know what to tell you, mam, 
     your brother ain't here. Try San 
     Bruno.

          WOMAN
     I just came from San Bruno -- they 
     sent me here!

          JAIL GUARD #2
     I'm sorry. Then I don't know where 
     he is.

Korda, fidgeting behind the woman impatiently, holds up his 
card...

          KORDA
     Listen, can I just sign outta here?

          WOMAN
     What do you mean, you don't know 
     where he is?! You can't just lose 
     somebody!

          JAIL GUARD #2
          (to Korda)
     Who are you again?

          KORDA
     Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta 
     be over at county in fifteen minutes, 
     alright?

          JAIL GUARD #2
     Johnny who?

          WOMAN
          (to Korda)
     Can you believe these people?

          KORDA
     It's the criminal justice system. 
     What can I tell ya? It's a mess.

The guard shoves the sheet under the glass.

          JAIL GUARD #2
     Alright, alright, just sign.

Korda signs the sheet. The guard pushes a button. The metal 
lock SNAPS, and the door POPS open. Korda takes his card and 
sticks it in the woman's coat pocket.

          KORDA
     If you find him, gimme a call.

And Korda walks out.

EXT. JAIL SALLY PORT - CONTINUOUS

It's a small parking area, with security gates on either 
end, and a ceiling of heavy steel wire open to the sky. There 
are three or four CARS parked against the wall. Korda checks 
inside the first car, looking for keys and finds none. Then 
the second, and the third until...

          A VOICE (O.S.)
     Hey!

Korda turns sharply to find the LATINO GUARD (guard #2), 
holding a clipboard, walking quickly toward him.

          JAIL GUARD #2
     Hold on a second here.

          KORDA
     Is there a problem?

The guard walks up to him. They're standing between the cars.

          JAIL GUARD #2
     You signed out twice.

          KORDA
     I what?

          JAIL GUARD #2
     Look, why don't you just come on 
     back inside for a second.

          KORDA
     Wait a minute, lemme see that.

As the guard shows him the sign-in sheet, Korda removes the 
PEN from his own clipboard.

          KORDA
     Well, that's funny, I wonder how 
     that happened.

In a flash, Korda PLUNGES the pen DEEP into the guard's 
throat. The BLOOD jumps out of his throat, onto the window 
of the car as the guard, gagging in stunned silence, slumps 
to ground. He then falls backward between the two cars, 
drowning in his own blood.

INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Empty. New front door. Unpainted. Frame splintered from when 
Roper shot it open. We hold a beat... HEAR ROPER & RONNIE 
coming up the stairs. Laughing. The door opens. They enter.

          ROPER
     How come in those foreign movies the 
     young girl is always with some fat, 
     old guy.

          RONNIE
     In Europe women find older men very 
     sexy.

Roper closes the door.

          ROPER
     When I get old and fat, I'm moving 
     to Europe.

Ronnie suddenly remembers something.

          RONNIE
     I forgot to leave food for Paco. 
     He's probably starving.

She walks back toward the kitchen. Roper takes a seat on the 
couch. Flips on the TV. Rubs the back of his neck.

          ROPER
     Damn, my eyes are tired from reading 
     that movie.

FOLLOWING RONNIE

She moves down the hall to the kitchen.

          RONNIE
          (doggie voice)
     I'm sorry, Paco. I forgot --

But Paco isn't lying on his pillow like she expected. Curious.

          RONNIE
     Paco?

She turns around walks back down the hall... Where could he 
be?... She walks into the bedroom.

          RONNIE
     Paco?

He's not in here either... She walks back into the hallway. 
Frowns.

SUDDEN CUT

A figure leaps out of the bathroom doorway!... Big scare. 
It's Paco. He nearly knocked her over. He stands on his hind 
legs, paws on her shoulders. Breathing in her face.

          RONNIE
     Paco, have you been eating my face 
     soap, again?

RACK FOCUS

Roper standing at the other end of the hallway. Tense as a 
wire. Gun at his side. One look at his demeanor tells Ronnie 
something is very wrong.

          RONNIE
          (very concerned)
     What is it, Scottie?

Roper untenses. Puts away his gun.

          ROPER
     Korda escaped.

          RONNIE
     And you think he'll...

Her voice trails off. He can see she's worried now, too.

          ROPER
     Hey, I'm on edge a little. Let's 
     relax. I'm sure he's just going to 
     try to get out of town. Anyway we 
     leave tomorrow.

He puts his arms around her waist.

          ROPER
     Why don't we do some of that European 
     movie stuff.

She puts her arms around his shoulders.

          RONNIE
     I don't think you're old and fat 
     enough for me.

          ROPER
     Use your imagination.

EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ANGLE looking up at her window... The light goes out.

EXT. RONNIE'S DOORSTEP - DAY

A suitcase THUMPS to the ground. Looks like somebody packed 
for a six month trip around the world.

ANGLE WIDENS

McCall grimaces as he lugs the bag toward the truck.

          MCCALL
     You sure you packed everything? Maybe 
     you forgot your bowling ball.

Ronnie stands on the doorstep.

          RONNIE
     I sent that ahead, wise guy.

Paco is on the sidewalk exploring from tree to tree. Roper 
calls to Ronnie from the stairway.

          ROPER (V.O.)
     Why don't you come back up with me, 
     Ronnie.

          RONNIE
     I think I'll stand out here in the 
     sun.

INT. STAIRWAY - DAY

Roper is still very edgy.

          ROPER
     It's better if you stay inside.

She climbs up the stairs toward him.

          RONNIE
     You've got to calm down --

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - SAME

Roper reaches the top of the stairs.

          ROPER
     Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go. 
     Time to get movin'.

INT. RONNIE'S APT. - SAME

Roper moves into the room, listening. There's no response.

          ROPER
          (continuing)
     Ronnie?

She doesn't answer. He calls out again, moving through the 
living room.

          ROPER
          (continuing)
     Ronnie, where are you? Time to go.

No answer, the room is very quiet. Roper eases his PISTOL 
out from under his shirt, moving more urgently now, checking 
out the bathroom, bedroom...

          ROPER
          (continuing)
     Ronnie.

Then he HEARS Paco, WHINING. He moves around the entrance to 
the kitchen. The back door is open, Paco standing in the 
doorway. Roper rushes forward, quickly looking outside, the 
alley way empty. He senses a presence behind him, spinning... 
McCall standing in the doorway to the kitchen.

Roper's lowers the weapon...

          ROPER
          (continuing)
     She's gone.

McCall sees on the kitchen table, a folded piece of GLASSINE 
PAPER, just like the one Korda gave Roper at the jewelry 
store.

          MCCALL
          (nodding)
     Scott...

Roper sees it, approaching, barely able to unfold the edges, 
a momentary tremble in his hand.

          ROPER
     That son of a bitch. If he...

We PUSH IN as his fingers open the paper... revealing inside 
a MICRO CASSETTE TAPE.

          ROPER
          (continuing; to himself)
     He's fucking with you, Scott, be 
     cool... keep your head.

                                   CUT TO:

CLOSE ON a TAPE RECORDER, Korda's VOICE heard over the 
speaker.

          KORDA (V.O.)
          (filtered)
     I got your lady, Roper.
          (laughs)

Roper and McCall are listening closely to the tape.

          KORDA (V.O.)
          (continuing)
     You got something that belongs to 
     me, and I want it back.
          (beat)
     Twelve-fifteen, Mare Island, North 
     Entrance off Dixon. Building twenty-
     eight, by the dry docks.
          (beat)
     I so much as smell another cop, I'll 
     be sending you parts of this bitch 
     for a month.

Roper punches off the tape.

          ROPER
     He's gonna kill her no matter what. 
     If I take him these jewels he's gonna 
     kill me and her.

          MCCALL
     So what do you want to do?

          ROPER
     That's a chance I gotta take.

          MCCALL
     Then we better get moving... But 
     there's no way we can get the jewels 
     out of evidence.

Roper stares at him, the wheels beginning to turn...

INT. POLICE PROPERTY/EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

Roper is standing at the counter to the steel-caged property 
room. On the other side is FRANK, the property sergeant on 
duty. The two men speak in hushed, urgent tones...

          FRANK
     Scott, we go back a long way but you 
     can't expect me to do this!

          ROPER
     Frank, this guy is a psychopath and 
     he's got Ronnie. It's the only way 
     I'm going to get close to him.

          FRANK
     Then go to the Lieutenant or the 
     D.A. with it, for Christsakes. You're 
     asking me to put my fucking job on 
     the line!

          ROPER
     They'll never approve it, you know 
     that. Besides, I involve the 
     department and she's dead. I got one 
     chance with this guy, Frank, alone.
          (beat)
     He killed Sam and he'll kill her.

Frank just stares at him, compassion and anger tearing at 
him.

          ROPER
          (continuing)
     What if it were Mary?
          (beat)
     You'd break every fucking rule in 
     the book... wouldn't you?

Frank continues to stare at him, a long beat.

          FRANK
     I hope to God I never have to make 
     that decision...

He pushes back from the counter.

          FRANK
          (continuing)
     ...and this conversation never 
     happened. I never saw you today. Now 
     I gotta go take a leak.

He turns and walks away. Roper looks down, SEEING that the 
drawer beneath Frank's counter has been left slightly open.

Roper reaches over, easing it further open -- inside a set 
of KEYS. He looks around, then takes the keys.

          ROPER
     I owe you one, Frank.

He walks down the hallway.

INT. ROPER'S PICKUP - DAY

CLOSE ON the SATCHEL Korda used in the robbery.

WIDEN TO REVEAL Roper and McCall, Roper at the wheel, McCall 
reading a folded MAP featuring MARE ISLAND.

          MCCALL
     Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, 
     cranes, high buildings... he'll be 
     in place where he can see everything.
          (to Roper)
     How are we going to get me in there?

          ROPER
     Good question.

Roper thinks a moment, then turns, looking out the back of 
the pickup, in the bed a loose CANVAS TARPAULIN. He and McCall 
study the tarp a beat, then turn, looking at each other...

EXT. MARE ISLAND - DAY

WIDE VIEW reveals the immensity of the abandoned facility. 
At one end near the chain link fence, Roper's pickup 
approaches the gate.

EXT. MARE ISLAND - NORTH GATE - DAY

Roper cautiously drives toward the gate -- the CHAIN securing 
the gate has been cut. Roper swings open the gate.

As he drives past we see that the bed of the truck has been 
loosely covered with a TARP.

Roper drives on, winding through the maze of roadways, huge 
buildings and equipment dwarfing the truc PRODUCTION NOTE: 
The idea is to take us into the facility to sell that it's 
abandoned, immense, eerie in it's scale -- a ghost town. We 
end up wherever we want for the next scene.

INT. ROPER'S PICKUP - DAY

As he rounds a corner, approaching the dry dock area, huge 
CRANES and mothballed SHIPS in the b.g. He parks near a 
building, a weathered SIGN reading: BLD 28. Roper shuts off 
the engine, leaving the keys in the ignition. Taking the 
satchel he opens the door.

EXT. DRY DOCK AREA - DAY

Roper steps out, eyes scanning the buildings, the cranes... 
Korda could be anywhere up there, watching.

INT. BUILDING - UPPER LEVEL - DAY

KORDA'S POV through the filthy windows, Roper far below, 
standing beside his pickup.

EXT. ROPER - DAY

As he moves away from the truck, holding the satchel.

          ROPER
     Korda!

In response he HEARS Korda's VOICE, eerie, almost a whisper, 
coming from everywhere and nowhere as if emanating from the 
ground and the buildings all at once.

          KORDA (O.S.)
          (filtered)
     Nice of you to make it, Roper. Take 
     your jacket off, put it on the hood.

Roper complies, his eyes searching the buildings, where is 
his voice coming from?

          KORDA (O.S.)
          (continuing)
     Now, over to the chains, to your 
     left.

Roper SEES a chained off section nearby. Roper takes a few 
steps when Korda's voice stops him...

          KORDA (O.S.)
          (continuing)
     But first, let's have a look under 
     the tarp. Pull it back.

A momentary anxious look from Roper, then he walks to the 
bed of the truck, pausing a moment, gripping the cover before 
whipping it back, revealing... Ronnie's LUGGAGE.

                                   CUT TO:

LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK

McCall supported under the frame by a makeshift HARNESS around 
his waist and legs.

          KORDA (O.S.)
     All right, move it.

McCall watches as Roper heads away, then releases the harness, 
lowering himself to the ground. Quickly he moves the SMOKING 
LEATHER GLOVES he was wearing, burned by contact with the 
hot exhaust pipe.

ROPER

Reaches the the chained area, REVEALING an empty DRY DOCK, 
easily one hundred feet deep and five hundred long.

At the bottom of the dry dock is a PORTABLE RADIO, the 
acoustics of natural amphitheater so intense you could hear 
a whisper -- the source of Korda's voice.

          KORDA (O.S.)
          (continuing)
     Throw in and your piece.

Roper tosses his PISTOL into the dry dock.

          KORDA (O.S.)
     And your back up.

Roper removes the PISTOL from his ankle HOLSTER, tossing it. 
Korda's VOICE cuts the eerie silence.

          KORDA (O.S.)
          (continuing)
     Walk under the cranes and down the 
     alleyway. At the end, turn right. 
     Building thirty-six.

The RADIO CLICKS OFF.

Roper walks towards the megalith CRANES, passing under them, 
then heads down the alleyway created by the tall buildings.

EXT. ROPER'S TRUCK - DAY LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK

McCall, his RIFLE CASE on his chest, watches as Roper turns 
the corner and heads down the alley way.

OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

McCall rolls out, scrambling for the cover of the building. 
Slinging the case over his shoulder he finds a LADDER leading 
up the side of the building, beginning to climb.

EXT. ROPER - DAY

Walking down the alley way, nearing the end.

EXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY

McCall moving along the edge, looking down. He spots Roper, 
moving fast to keep him in sight.

He comes to the edge of the building, having to walk across 
a narrow RAMP to get to the next building.

He looks down, Roper turning the corner, McCall moves on, 
removing the RIFLE from its case as he goes.

EXT. ROPER - DAY

Leaves the alleyway, a complex of hanger-like buildings 
revealed. To his far right is a building, a SIGN reading: 
BLD 36. He clutches the satchel, heading towards it.

EXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY

McCall negotiating another precarious crossing between 
buildings. He spots Roper, eyes quickly searching the roof 
tops and buildings for the sniper's position. He sees it, 
across the way, a location covering the buildings where Roper 
is now walking. He heads out.

EXT. ROPER - DAY

Walking towards building 36, passing by a towering, glass 
fronted building on his right, his eyes are searching the 
roof tops of the buildings around him.

          ROPER
          (to himself)
     Where the hell are you, McCall?

As Roper passes a set of partially open ROLLING DOORS to the 
glass-fronted building, he's startled by Korda's VOICE from 
within:

          KORDA (O.S.)
     Right there, Roper.

Roper's eyes go to building 36, still fifty yards away.

          ROPER
     Shit.

Roper stops, slowly turning towards the doors.

          KORDA (O.S.)
     Come on in, there's someone just 
     dying to see you.

Roper hesitates. He turns a bit in profile, eyes searching.

          ROPER
          (loudly)
     Where are you?

EXT. HIGH VANTAGE POINT - DAY

POV TELESCOPIC SIGHT: Focusing on Roper, his lips moving... 
McCall, heaving for breath, has just dropped down into 
position, providing a view of Roper and the inside of the 
glass fronted building.

          MCCALL
     Right here, Scott.

He touches the LASER SIGHTING attachment to his scope, a red 
beam activated...

ROPER - DAY

From inside the building Korda's VOICE:

          KORDA (O.S.)
     Get your ass in here, Roper.

Just as Roper starts to move he SEES the red laser DOT on 
the back of his hand -- McCall is up there, right behind 
him. Roper moves inside.

MCCALL - DAY

Lying prone inside the operator's booth, steadies his RIFLE, 
looking through the scope.

TELESCOPIC POV: He can see Roper enter, his field of vision 
limited inside the building where the light penetrates, the 
room cast in HARD SHADOWS.

He MOVES to the windows, all either painted white or so 
obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes 
and shadows inside. He MOVES BACK to the opening, Roper now 
just inside.

          MCCALL
     Stay cool, real easy...

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

Cavernous and dark, a jungle of huge MACHINES, LATHES and 
EQUIPMENT once used in the design of nuclear submarines.

Roper moves a few feet inside, remaining in the light and 
keeping his face in three-quarter profile to McCall's 
position.

          ROPER
     Where is she, Korda? I want to see 
     her.

From the darkness beyond...

          KORDA
     Walk to the table.

Roper walks to a steel SHOP TABLE.

          KORDA (O.S.)
          (continuing)
     Open your shirt.

          ROPER
     I'm not wearing a wire. This is just 
     between you and me.

          KORDA (O.S.)
     Shut the fuck up and do what I say!

Roper puts down the satchel, unbuttoning his shirt, holding 
it open.

          ROPER
     Satisfied?

          KORDA (O.S.)
     Open the bag, dump everything on the 
     table.

Roper opens the bag, the JEWELRY and the dozens of GLASSINE 
ENVELOPES spill out onto the table. He lays the satchel on 
its side, the bottom facing Roper. Taped to the bottom is a 
short barreled .45 AUTOMATIC.

          ROPER
     It's all there.

          KORDA (O.S.)
     Spread it out.

Roper spreads the pile out across the top of the table.

          ROPER
     Only the jewels, Korda, you've got 
     my word.

A long beat...

          KORDA (O.S.)
     Show me something.

Without looking Roper reaches to the pile of GLASSINE 
ENVELOPES...

CLOSE ON ROPER'S HAND

Palmed in his hand, the ENVELOPE containing Ronnie's diamond.

Roper, without looking, 'digs' into the pile, holding up the 
GLASSINE ENVELOPE between his fingers, still holding the 
palmed envelope. He starts to toss the envelope in his 
fingers...

          KORDA (O.S.)
          (continuing)
     Not that one.

Roper hesitates, then drops the envelope, his hand moving 
over the pile...

          ROPER
          (continuing)
     Right there, the one in front... 
     yeah, that one. Toss it.

Roper reaches for the envelope.

CLOSE ON ROPER'S HAND

As he flips the palmed envelope into his fingers with the 
skill of a card shark, exchanging it for the one Korda 
indicated. He tosses it across the room...

From the shadows Korda's hand reaches out, picking it up. A 
long beat.

          KORDA (O.S.)
          (continuing)
     I'm impressed. I didn't think you 
     could do it. What did you have to 
     do, steal them?

          ROPER
     Yeah.

          KORDA (O.S.)
          (wry)
     That's not going to look too good on 
     your service record.

          ROPER
     I'll worry about that. Let's get on 
     with it.

Korda LAUGHS as he slowly emerges from the darkness.

          KORDA
     My sentiments exactly.

EXT. MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV - DAY

On the floor he SEES a shadow cast - Korda. He moves to the 
windows... inside the vague, blurred OUTLINE of a man. His 
scope goes back to the satchel and the .45 taped to the 
bottom.

          MCCALL
     Wait for the right moment, Scott...

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

Korda moves closer to the light, tossing an ATHLETIC BAG to 
Roper, in his hand an AUTOMATIC PISTOL.

          KORDA
     Fill it up. Just in case there's a 
     homing device in the other one.

Roper slides the jewels into the second bag, eyeing the .45 
on the bottom of the satchel.

          KORDA
          (continuing)
     Now bring it over here.

Roper hesitates, but all he can do at this point is play for 
time, he moves forward...

EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY TELESCOPIC SCOPE

Watching Roper as he moves away from the satchel and the 
gun.

          MCCALL
     Oh, shit...

He moves the SCOPE ahead of Roper, SEEING Korda's shadow 
cast on the floor, still unable to see him.

          MCCALL
          (continuing)
     All right, Scott, bring him out.

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

Roper growing closer to Korda's position.

          KORDA
     That's far enough. Bag on the floor.

Roper hangs onto the bag -- there's 'four million in jewels' 
in there -- all he has to bargain with.

          ROPER
     I've kept my end. Ronnie first.

Korda reacts in mock surprise.

          KORDA
     Oh, shit, in all the excitement I 
     almost forgot. She right here...

A LIGHT SWITCH is thrown, a bank of lights behind him coming 
ON, illuminating a massive FLAT BED CIRCULAR LATHE. Roper's 
eyes in horror go to...

RONNIE

Tied to the lathe bed spread eagle. Some distance from her 
body a CUTTING DEVICE is positioned over the lathe bed.

Roper looks into Ronnie's terrified eyes.

          ROPER
     Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you 
     out of this.

He turns back, Korda grinning at him.

          KORDA
     No shit, this I gotta see...

Korda swings into position a CONTROL BOX, the buttons held 
down with TAPE.

Korda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to TURN, 
very slowly, the cutting device activated... if the table 
keeps turning, Ronnie's body will soon be under the blade.

(PRODUCTION NOTE: Lathe will be cutting into a section of 
steel plate, demonstrating what will happen to Ronnie.

Korda presses the STOP BUTTON, the lathe stopping. He releases 
his finger again, the lathe turning. He stops it.

We can see that Korda is immensely proud of his 'creation', 
his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at 
this point.

          KORDA
          (continuing)
     Fuckin' cool, huh? I rewired the 
     switch. You see, you have to keep 
     your finger on the button or the 
     little lady gets cut...

He releases the button, the lathe turning towards the cutting 
device. He stops it again, holding the button.

          KORDA
          (continuing; grins)
     Right in half.

He eases towards Roper, extending his arm on the control 
box, holding the button down.

EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

Through the SCOPE, he can see Korda as he steps into view.

The CROSSHAIRS settle on Korda's upper forehead.

          MCCALL
     Hold it right there...

His finger tightens on the trigger...

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

Korda holds the control box towards Roper.

          KORDA
     But then, that's not my problem.

He releases the button and the box, the lathe turning, Korda 
grinning at Roper...

EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

The RED DOT centered on Korda's forehead...

          MCCALL (O.S.)
     Light's out, fucker...

And then Roper's HEAD fills the scope, the red dot GLOWING 
on the back of his head.

In shock, McCall releases his finger...

          MCCALL
     Jesus!

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

Roper moving to the control box, pressing the stop button, 
stopping the lathe...

          KORDA
     You see, it's out of my hands.

Roper looks at the box, Ronnie's life literally in his 
hands...

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

Through the SCOPE, Roper's head blocking the shot to Korda.

          MCCALL
     Roper, move...

EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

But Korda bends down, picking up the BAG, stepping back away 
from Roper, clearly out of McCall's line of fire.

          KORDA
     Well, hate to run but I've got a 
     plane to catch. You take good care 
     of the little lady, hear?

As Korda walks down the corridor of the huge machine shop, 
we now SEE a CAR parked near the end facing us. Korda suddenly 
stops, turning, gesturing to the car.

          KORDA
          (continuing)
     How careless of me. You see, there's 
     only one way out of here, and you're 
     standing right in the way.
          (grins)
     You could move, but then...

He shakes his head at Roper.

          KORDA
          (continuing)
     Sure hate to be in your shoes.

He turns, walking quickly towards his car, TALKING, LAUGHING, 
to himself.

Roper looks to the car, then back at the SATCHEL where the 
.45 is still taped to the bottom. But Roper can't move, unable 
to change his position more than a foot or two. He looks 
around him, no way to stop the lathe if he releases the 
button.

EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

He can see Roper holding the box, but nothing else.

          MCCALL
     What the hell's going on?

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

Now Korda reaches his car, hopping inside, STARTING it up. 
In desperation Roper looks back at the satchel, then turns, 
calling out...

          ROPER
     McCall, stop him, stop the car!

Korda REVVING the engine...

EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

McCall reading Roper's lips...

          MCCALL
     What car?

He swings the SCOPE up but the back of the machine shop is 
blocked by his vantage point.

Then he HEARS the faint SQUEALING of tires. He lowers his 
scope, holding, waiting...

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

Korda at the end of the long building, beginning to 
accelerate.

ROPER

Turns toward McCall's position...

          ROPER
     McCall!

The CAR now screaming down the long corridor...

EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

McCall still can't see the car...

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

The car now closing in on Roper, but Roper holds his ground...

          ROPER
     McCall, shoot the son of a bitch!

INT. KORDA'S CAR - DAY

Korda bearing down on Roper.

          KORDA
     Bye, bye, cop...

ROPER

Holding his position, eyes widening in fear...

EXT. MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV - DAY

The CAR comes into view, the CROSSHAIRS on the windshield... 
but the glare off the window is obscuring any shot of Korda. 
McCall takes aim and FIRES...

INT. KORDA'S CAR - DAY

The bullet punches through the window, catching Korda's left 
shoulder, BLOOD flying. Korda whips the wheel in shock...

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY KORDA'S CAR

Spinning out of control, hitting a table piled with MACHINE 
PARTS, sending them flying...

But the car is now swapping ends, still flying right towards 
Roper, who can't move...; who won't move.

The car flies past him, the SIDE MIRROR catching Roper's 
shirt, tearing it, a flash of BLOOD from his arm...

The car then collides with a series of PIPES crossing the 
floor, STEAM erupting in every direction as the car then 
slams into several PROPANE BOTTLES stacked near the benches, 
a series of EXPLOSIONS ripping through the building. . .

ROPER

Thrown to the floor by the explosions, releasing the button, 
as...

THE CAR

Hits the GLASSED-IN ROLLING DOORS.

EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

The CAR explodes from the building, GLASS FLYING, the car 
rolling, flipping over, coming to a rest on its wheels, 
driver's side away from McCall's position.

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY ROPER

On the floor, recovering. He catches a quick glimpse of the 
bottom section of the lathe, a GEARBOX, the gears turning...

THE LATHE

Turning, the cutting blade inching towards Ronnie...

ROPER

Staggers to his feet, grabbing the control box, pressing the 
button... nothing happens, the lathe still turning, SPARKS 
coming out of the box, it's SHORTING... Only a few more 
seconds...

Desperately his eyes search the floor, SEEING a HUGE WRENCH. 
He grabs the wrench, jamming it between the GEARS in the 
gearbox, the gears shuddering violently, threatening to crush 
the wrench...

Roper runs to Ronnie's side, frantically pulling at her bonds, 
the cutting blade now paused an inch away from her...

THE GEARBOX

Hammering and clanking, the wrench can't last a heartbeat 
longer...

ROPER

Pulls the last of the restraints away...

THE GEARBOX

Just as the massive gears crush the wrench, the table 
turning...

THE LATHE

The blade passing directly over Ronnie's position as Roper 
hauls her away, holding her in his arms.

EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV OF CAR

Korda is slumped over the wheel. He looks dead. McCall slings 
his rifle over his shoulder and moves towards a DRAIN PIPE 
attached to the side of the building.

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

Roper holding Ronnie, easing her away from the still turning 
lathe.

          RONNIE
     Scottie, Scottie...

          ROPER
     It's all over, babe, it's all over.

EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

McCall slides to the ground via the drain pipe, but...

KORDA'S CAR

Korda is not quite dead...

The door eases open, Korda rolling to the ground, bag in one 
hand, AUTOMATIC in the other. He looks up, SEEING McCall.

He OPENS FIRE, McCall hitting the deck and taking cover as 
BULLETS hit the wall around him.

McCall whips out his REVOLVER, RETURNING FIRE, a GUN BATTLE 
ensuing.

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY ROPER

HEARING the shots outside, hauls Ronnie out of the way, 
keeping her low to the ground.

          ROPER
     Stay here, don't move.

          RONNIE
     Scottie...

          ROPER
     Do it!

He pushes her towards the cover of some machines, then 
crouching low to the floor, recovers the .45 from the bottom 
of the satchel. He heads out towards the other side of the 
cavernous, machine-choked building.

EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL

FIRES a round at Korda, then trying to close in on the car, 
runs from his cover into the opening...

KORDA

Leaps up and FIRES, McCall taking a slug in his leg, knocking 
him to the ground. The SLIDE to Korda's AUTOMATIC has kicked 
open, out of bullets. He drops the gun, picks up the BAG and 
runs alongside the machine shop.

ROPER

Exits the machine shop, SEEING McCall on the ground, Korda 
nowhere in sight. Combat-style Roper runs to McCall, dropping 
to his side.

          ROPER
     McCall, you all right?

          MCCALL
          (in pain)
     I'm okay. Korda... went down the 
     side of the building...

          ROPER
     Stay put.

Roper sprints towards the building, racing alongside it, 
catching a glimpse of Korda just as he disappears around the 
other end. Roper charges on...

EXT. MACHINE SHOP - REAR - DAY

Korda runs past the building, still clutching the BAG. He 
runs past another building, heading towards the dry dock 
area and Roper's pickup. A moment later Roper emerges from 
the machine shop just in time to see Korda round the corner 
of the next building.

KORDA

Clearing the building sees Roper's PICKUP. He runs to it, 
jumping inside, finding the KEYS in the ignition. He starts 
the truck, pulling out, just as Roper runs into view.

ROPER

With the truck accelerating towards him he raises and FIRES, 
two bullet holes in the front WINDSHIELD, missing Korda, the 
truck still speeding towards him. Roper's gun jams. Roper 
leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he 
grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper 
blades for support, his WEAPON flying from his hand.

KORDA

Speeds around the buildings and down the alleyways, whipping 
from side to side, trying to shake Roper off, Roper hanging 
on for dear life.

          ROPER
          (shouting)
     Give it up, Korda, you got away with 
     nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit! 
     It's all fake!

Korda can't help but look at the OPEN BAG beside him.

          ROPER
          (continuing)
     Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it! 
     It's all shit! A hundred dollars 
     worth of glass!

Korda reaches in, grabbing a handful of the COSTUME JEWELRY. 
He can't believe it, it's all fake!

          KORDA
     You fuck!!!

Korda goes crazy, slamming the truck into the side of a 
building, trying to throw Roper, but Roper hangs on.

Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right, 
SPARKS flying, then smashes into BOXES, CRATES, anything he 
can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put, 
clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to 
avoid the obstacles.

Then Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES, WOOD FRAMING, 
PALLETS, TRASH, stacked at the side of a building. He hammers 
the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the 
pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through 
the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with 
his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the 
cab...

ROPER

In the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame 
of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls 
over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck 
along with BOXES, LUMBER, and TRASH.

KORDA

Clears his eyes, looking up, Roper is gone! He LAUGHS 
hysterically... he knocked him off!

ROPER IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK

Leaning out the passenger's side SEES they are approaching 
the dry dock area.

In the bed of the truck, along with the BOXES, SUITCASES and 
other objects, he sees several long 2x4's. Grabbing a BOARD 
he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift 
movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the 
2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel, 
past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR PEDAL, 
pinning it to the floor.

As Roper releases the board it WEDGES inside the door frame, 
locking the wheel and the accelerator, the engine SCREAMING 
wide open. Korda reacts in panic...

Roper clings to the cab, looking over the top, the DRY DOCK 
looming towards them. He prepares to jump...

KORDA

Suddenly SEES the approaching dry dock. He jams on the brakes, 
but it's not enough, the truck racing towards the edge...

IN SLOW MOTION THE TRUCK

Vaults over the edge of the dry dock as Roper runs down the 
bed, leaping off the tail gate, arms windmilling as he goes 
airborne...

The truck plummets towards the bottom...

ROPER

Lands in a huge pile of CARGO NETS and CARDBOARD BOXES, piled 
near the edge of the dry dock...

KORDA

SCREAMS in wide-eyed terror as...

THE TRUCK

Hits the bottom of the dock, EXPLODING into flames.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TAHITI - DAY

Roper and Ronnie lay on a gorgeous white sand beach, drinking 
from coconuts with umbrellas in them.

          RONNIE
     I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti 
     is magnificent, Scottie.

          ROPER
     Yeah, I could get used to this 
     Paradise shit.

Roper hails a waitress, serving the hotel guests.

          ROPER
          (to waitress)
     I'll have another Pena Colada. And 
     this time could you shave the ice, 
     please.

          WAITRESS
     Oui, Monsieur. Right away.

Roper stretches back into his chaise lounge, adjusting his 
Ray Bans. A purring cat without a care in the world.

          RONNIE
     Scottie?

          ROPER
     Hmm?

          RONNIE
     I've been thinking.

TWO GORGEOUS FRENCH GIRLS unstring their bikinis, flopping 
topless on the beach in front of them.

          ROPER
     Hmm?

          RONNIE
     Things have been going pretty well 
     between us, haven't they?

          ROPER
          (sensing something's up)
     Yeah.

          RONNIE
     You've changed you know. I don't 
     think there's anything you can't do 
     once you put your mind to it.

Uh-oh. He removes his shades to get a better look at the 
curve ball.

          RONNIE
     I was just thinking...
          (here it comes)
     There's something special I want to 
     talk to you about.
          (he's listening)
     I think it's time we went to a whole 
     other phase in our relationship.
          (pointedly)
     A deeper level.

          ROPER
          (no longer relaxed, 
          sitting up)
     A deeper level?

          RONNIE
     That's right. We've got to bare it 
     all. Here and now. 'Cause I think 
     I'm finally ready to go for it...

          ROPER
          (cutting her off at 
          the pass)
     Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold 
     on. I know it's beautiful here. The 
     sun, the sand, the sea and all that 
     nature shit can really get to you. 
     But we've got to keep our perspective 
     here. This place isn't real. This 
     isn't reality.

          RONNIE
     Scott...

          ROPER
     I mean I said this trip should be a 
     'roadtest'.

          RONNIE
     ...the hell are you talking about?

          ROPER
     I'm talking about... What are you 
     talking about?

          RONNIE
     I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping 
     down on this beach and gettin' you 
     know... 'naked in Tahiti'.

          ROPER
     You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'
          (off her look)
     Shit, I thought you were talkin' 
     bout, you know... the "M" word.

          RONNIE
     You thought I was talking about 
     getting married?!

She laughs her amazing laugh.

          RONNIE
     I'm talking about taking our clothes 
     off, silly. You said you would.

AD LIBS dialogue below as CAMERA CRANES BACK and we ROLL 
CREDITS over...

          ROPER
     You crazy? With all those people 
     around?

          RONNIE
     Know what you are?! You're a prude, 
     Roper.

          ROPER
     The hell I am!

          RONNIE
          (amused)
     Prude.

          ROPER
     First you want me to put on one of 
     those skinny ass bathing suits -- 
     tongs or thongs or whatever you call 
     them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped 
     around a piece of dental floss... No 
     way.

Over her laughter we...

                                        FADE OUT:
THE END
