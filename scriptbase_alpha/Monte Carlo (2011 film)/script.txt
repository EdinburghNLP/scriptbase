          ALICE (V.0.)
          Think of the future, and events
          that will have already happened.

          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

          ALICE PERRY (30s), her innate and amiable authority eclipsed
          only by a self-consciousness about her hair, afraid perhaps
          that she hasn't lived up to the promise of its red color,
          chalks "Futur Anterieur" in precise cursive at the board.

                         ALICE
          "By tomorrow, we will have flown to
          France."
          She turns to face her TENTH GRADE FRENCH CLASS.
          Though Alice's make up, earrings and practical flats are
          simple, there is an inherent elegance to their combination
          that hints at a more complex, if uncharted, interior.

                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           Who can give me an example? Paul?
           NOTE: Throughout, all blocks of italicized dialogue should be

                         
          read as in FRENCH with ENGLISH subtitles.

                         PAUL
          "I will have completed the assigned
          translation by the end of
          vacation."

                         ALICE
          C'est bon! Amber?

                         AMBER
          I will have failed French again by
          the end of the year.
          Alice pauses, regarding Amber with a pained sympathy.

                         ALICE
          En francais si'l vows plait?

          EMMA LINDGARD (late 20's) rapidly scribbles a complex 
          calculus formula at the board while all of her TWELFTH GRADE
          MALE STUDENTS avidly admire her shape in a tight, stylish
          skirt and heels. She turns suddenly, smiling brightly.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Okay! Kyle?
          KYLE snaps his eyes up to Emma's face, tries to cover.

                         KYLE
          Um... I guess I'm a little lost.
          If optimists see a glass as half full, Emma's is in a
          constant state of cheerful, blonde overflow, even when a
          level of wilfulness is required.

                         EMMA
          Try to follow along. I really want
          you guys to get this! David?
          DAVID gazes back dumbly, stuck in an erotic fog.

          TWO GIRLS ( 17) laugh conspiratorially, dredging woven pot
          holders through an egg mixture and dropping them into a
          sputtering pan, as the rest of the CLASS makes French toast.
          The girls sneak looks at MEG KELLY (30's) who tears recipes
          from a Gourmet magazine at her desk at the front of the room.
          Dark hair pulled into a pony tail, face unadorned by makeup,
          Meg's natural sexiness is muted by an air of indifference.
          She glances up when the pan erupts in flames and the girls
          leap back with a shriek, shakes her head.
          The girls attempt to knock the pan from the burner with the
          handle of a broom when a pot lid bangs down, instantly
          snuffing the flames.
          They shrink back as Meg waves the lid, clearing the smoke.

                         MEG
          Do me a favor, and let's just try
          to get to vacation.

          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          Alice, a heavy bag slung over her shoulder, and her boyfriend
          RICHARD (30's, scruffily handsome in sweats and a coach's
          jersey), carrying three binders and a bag of baseball bats,
          exit the school among a crush of students.
          Together, they cross a lawn dotted with patches of late snow,
          to the parking lot, stopping at Alice's weathered Volvo where
          Richard hands over the binders with a kiss.

                         RICHARD
          Got practice until five thirty,
          then I'll be by.

                         ALICE
          I'll see you then. Thanks.
          They kiss again and Richard takes off for the athletic
          fields, passing Meg as she comes from the school, waves.

                          RICHARD
          Hey, Meg! Bon voyage!
          Alice offers a binder to Meg as she arrives at Alice's car.

                         ALICE
          I finished our travel binders!
          Meg takes the binder, looks it over.

                         MEG
          Remind me again why we're taking
          phonebooks to France?
          Alice gives her a look.

          I love my binder. I do.

          You know, for the first time in a
          long time, I feel just as lucky as 
          any of these kids. They may have
          their whole lives ahead of them but
          we've got a week in Paris.

                         ALICE
          Oh, that's right. I keep
          forgetting your life is completely

          table where a game of solitaire is laid next to a microwaved
          Lean Cuisine dinner.
          She turns up the volume with the remote and gathers the
          cards, shuffling.
          Eyes glued to Princess Diana on television, Emma suddenly
          shoots her hands three feet wide, rifling the cards in
          perfect vertical formation like a seasoned cardsharp.

          EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Alice opens the door, kissing Richard who holds up a suitcase
          in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other.

                         RICHARD
          Special delivery.

          INT. ALICE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Alice zips the suitcase shut and raises her arms in victory
          as Richard pours the Champagne into two glasses.

                         ALICE
          That's it! I am good to go!

           Richard brings a glass to Alice, nuzzles her ear.

                         RICHARD
          I'm proud of you, you know.
          Alice takes her glass and presses Richard down onto the bed,
          climbing on top of him.

                         ALICE
          Like Christmas when I was a kid.
          There's no way I'm going to be able
          to sleep tonight--

                         RICHARD
          Good for me.
          They kiss.

                         ALICE
          I mean, how long have I been
          talking about this?

                         RICHARD
          Mmm... You were reading Colette.
          In the teacher's lounge. First
          time we met. Long time.
          Alice pauses as this lands somewhere deep inside.

                         RICHARD (CONT'D)
          This is just the beginning.

                         ALICE

                         (BRIGHTENING)
          It feels like it.
          They clink glasses and Richard watches Alice tip her glass
          back then stop mid-sip to peer down at the delicate diamond
          ring sitting at the bottom of her glass.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)

                         (STUNNED)
          Oh. Richard... It's so... It's
          beautiful...
          Richard takes her glass and fishes out the ring.

                         RICHARD
          Let's try it on.

                         ALICE

                         ALICE
          But, I'm leaving. I'm--. I'm
          getting on a plane in the morning.

          Wait. You're serious. Are you
          serious? You're serious.

                         ALICE
          Let's do this when I get back. In
          a week.

                         RICHARD
          Can you hear yourself?

                         ALICE
          Honey, listen, it's just the
          timing. I wasn't planning on this 

                         TONIGHT--

                         RICHARD
          Whoa. I planned tonight. Tonight
          was my plan--

                         ALICE
          And it's great. This is great.
          You're great. But, Richard, I feel
          like I just need to do this one
          thing first. Then I can do the
          next. Then I can do this.
          (off his silence)
          Can you understand? There's a
          world I haven't even seen yet...
          Alice, hopeful, searches Richard's inscrutable expression a
          beat, then he turns away and gets up, ring in hand.

                         RICHARD
          I thought we'd be seeing it
          together.
          (pockets the ring)
          Have a great trip, Alice.
          He heads for the door.

          Maybe I'll see you in a week.
          Alice listens to his footfalls and the slam of the front
          door, then falls back on the bed, striking her head on the
          open suitcase, wincing.

          Ladies and Gentleman, we are about

          INT. AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT - DAY

          Meg sleeps in an aisle seat of the dim coach cabin where all
          the window shades have been drawn down, Emma dozing beside
          her, a game of cards laid out on her tray table.

                         
          Alice brings her seat to the upright position as instructed
          and sits, hyper-alert, looking at her closed window shade.
          A beat.
          She reaches out and raises the shade a tentative crack,
          flooding their row with light.
          She glances furtively around the cabin, then inches the shade
          higher, drawing in a sharp breath at what she sees.
          She flings the shade up.
          ALL OF PARIS is laid out below her; a magical nautilus-like
          wheel with the Eiffel Tower as its central axle.
          Her breath steams the window as she drinks it all in.
          She turns, eyes full, to Meg who cranes across Emma to share
          in the view and squeeze Alice's arm with a smile.

                         EMMA

          Bien venue.
          Alice looks up from her imprinted passport, smiles hugely.

                         ALICE
          Merci .

          EXT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

          Alice emerges with Meg and Emma, each struggling with their
          luggage, onto the thronged arrivals deck.

                         EMMA
          There it is! Esprit de Corps!
          Alice looks to where Emma points, seeing a small sky-blue
          flag at the end of a long staff held by MADAME VALERY (40s,
          pinched) their harried tour guide in a suit of the same blue.

                         ALICE
          Excuse me, are you Madame Valery?

                         0

          The battered Esprits de Corps Tours bus careens through the

          Alice, squashed beside Meg on the over-crowded bus, whips her
          head up from her guidebook.

          MADAME VALERY (CONT'D)
          Was the Arc de Triomphe.

           Alice and Meg turn to Emma across the aisle, who hooks a
          thumb at CARL and DEEDEE (late 60's, both stout) beside her.

          bouncing roughly on its shocks at the museum's entrance.

           INT. LOUVRE - DAY

          Alice, Meg and Emma race past gallery after gallery, trying
          to keep Madame Valery's little blue flag in sight as it flies
          over the crowd in the distance.
          Alice whipsaws her head at everything they're missing, making
          notes in her guidebook on the fly.

                         ALICE
          Try to remember that! We'll double
          back for the Chagalls!

          INT. LOUVRE - DAY

          Madame Valery leads the charge up the right wing of the Daru
          staircase, past the statue of Winged Victory.
          Alice stops Meg and Emma in front of the statue, while Carl
          and Deedee try to catch their breath on the landing.

          Emma elbows her way out of a crush of raised cameras and
          cellphones to Alice and Meg who strain at the rear of the

          digital image of the Mona Lisa, squeezed in with Alice and
          the rest of their tour at too few tables.

          Meg raises a glass of wine.

                         MEG
          To jet lag.
          Emma and Alice raise their glasses to toast as WAITERS plunk
          down identical plates of steak frites before them.

          They clink glasses and Alice is suddenly jostled, just as
          she's about to sip, by Carl as he turns from the table behind
          her, spilling her wine.

          If you're not using it.
          As Emma passes the bottle of catsup, Meg offers Alice her
          napkin, and waiters sweep their plates away, replacing them
          with creme brulees.

                         ALICE
          Pardon, Madame, but...
          Madam Valery slowly raises her eyes from Alice's hand.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, but--

                         MEG
          Are you apologizing?

                         ALICE
          They've taken our dinners away--
          Madame Valery taps her watch and then her clipboard.

                         MADAME VALERY
          There were stragglers at the.
          museum. Now, I am behind schedule.

           EXT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Esprit de Corps tour members disembark from their bus in
          front of a comically narrow and vertical Baroque hotel with
          its name in feeble buzzing neon: Le Petit Sommeil.

                         ALICE (PRE-LAP)
          Look! Look at this picture and
          tell me what's different!

          INT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          The women lower the travel brochure and its photograph of a
          tidy well-appointed suite, to regard the actual one in which
          they stand; dingy, impossibly small, crowded by an armoire
          that nearly meets the low sloping ceiling, with two spindly
          twin beds and a military-style cot.

                         EMMA
          Toujour le suck-ez vous.

                         ALICE
          I researched at least a million

                         TOURS--

                          MEG
          Well. This is the one we could
          afford.
          A beat as they consider the room and their lot in life.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          It's only five nights--

                         EMMA
          Five nights? Here?!

                         MEG
          And, Alice, you said yourself,
          we'll hardly ever be in our room.

                         (SELLING IT)
          It'll be like camping. At Eagle
          River. It'll be fun!
          Emma opens what is essentially a closet with a toilet.

                         EMMA
          Here's your outhouse, Meg. Go
          nuts.
          Alice joins Emma at the bathroom door.

          Me? I'm going to try to hold it.

                         MEG
          Okay, Emma. Let's just unpack--
          she turns for the luggage, nearly falling over at the weight
          of Emma's suitcase as she reaches to lift it.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          Holy--! Alice, help--
          Alice climbs onto one of the beds to help Meg lift.

                         ALICE
          Emma, what have you got in here?

                         EMMA
          Just the stuff you put on my list--
          (off her look)
          And a couple options.
          The bag slips from Meg's grasp, crashing onto the foot of the
          bed which collapses, catapulting Alice onto the cot which
          flips up over her, knocking Emma into the tiny bathroom.

                         

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Hey! Come on, guys!

          INT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Alice gazes out a window that opens onto a narrow alley and
          the ugly backsides of buildings, as Meg and Emma sleep
          fitfully behind her.
          She looks down at the cellphone in her hands, scrolling
          through her speed dial to stop at: 1. Richard.
          She hesitates with her thumb over the "call" button.
          She turns back to the miserable view, considering for a beat,
          then folds her phone away as she blinks back tears.

          EXT. PONT DES ARTS BRIDGE - DAY

          Madame Valery leads a diminished flock, bobbing her staff
          with its blue flag, in a forced march across the span of the
          ornate pedestrian bridge toward the waiting tour bus.

           MADAME VALERY
          The Pont des Arts has it's name for
          the vast number of art students
          that come here to paint this famous
          city view...
          Meg and Emma, the worse for wear, trail Madame Valery at a
          distance with Alice who now leads her own handful of tour
          members, Carl and Deedee among them.

                         ALICE
          It's called the Pont des Arts
          because the Louvre was formally
          known as the Palais des Arts...
          Madame Valery stops ahead, turning back to take in Alice and
          her cluster of appreciative followers.

                         MADAME VALERY
          People! We must keep together!

          EXT. NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL -- DAY

          Alice's group circles an inscribed stone medallion with a
          star-shaped brass inset on the pavement outside Notre Dame.

                         

                         DEEDEE
          "Point zero. Dez roots dee France."

                         ALICE
          It's from right here that all the
          highway miles in all of France are
          measured. They also say that if
          you stand on this exact spot, you
          are be destined to return to France
          in the future.

                         MEG
          Oh, I'm in! Come on. Everyone!
          Together, they all step forward, arms entwined, laughing.

                         EMMA
          I want a picture! Of all of us!
          Alice looks up as Emma breaks away, to see Madam Valery
          leading her dwindling group from the great church.
          Madame Valery sends her charges to the bus, then heads
          straight for Alice as Emma tries to enlist a JAPANESE COUPLE
          to take a group photo with her camera.

          Madame Valery sizes Alice up and taps her staff as the group
          forms around them, joined by the Japanese couple.

                         MADAME VALERY
          This flag? I do not carry it for
          my pleasure.

          We were just on our way inside--

          Well, now you may head to the bus.

                         ALICE

          Meg and Emma exchange looks as Alice plants herself with
          folded arms and steely resolve before Madame Valery.

                         MADAME VALERY
          Perhaps, if Madame is not satisfied
          with my tour she could conduct her
          own.

          Alice's eyes narrow in regarding Madame Valery and all fall

          Madame Valery, nonplussed, reaches out to reclaim her flag,

          They shake water from their arms and hair, pluck at their

          We're going to do one thing right
          in Paris. I don't care how much it
          costs.
          They turn for the dining room, passing the front desk where
          CORDELIA WINTHROP SCOTT (dressed similarly to Emma, though at
          ten times the cost) unleashes her ire on the CONCIERGE.

                         CORDELIA
          And, just how do you propose I am
          to travel tomorrow, then?

                         CONCIERGE
          I am sorry, but, there is nothing--
          A MANAGER enters from the back.

                         MANAGER
          Mademoiselle Scott, I have checked
          and there is no sign of a package--

          This is not English we are

          Emma swings through the door into the black marble bathroom,
          grabbing a towel to swipe at her wet hair.
          She stops abruptly, examines the towel.

                         EMMA
          These are cloth!
          She takes the towel into one of the stalls, closing the door
          behind her just as Cordelia strides in, stops at the counter.

          Cordelia's cellphone RINGS! and she pulls it from her purse.

          You would not believe these people.
          So rude!
          She takes her phone into the stall next to Emma's and closes
          the door just as Alice and Meg enter.

          CORDELIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          And they wonder why none of us do

          Alice and Meg look at one another in the mirror, overhearing
          Cordelia, as they pick up towels to dry off.

          I don't know. Some auction. One
          of those foundations--. But, have
          I heard from them? No. And they

          Reykjavik? Would I need a coat?
          A toilet flushes and Cordelia opens her stall door, heads for
          the counter, oblivious to Alice and Meg who freeze with their
          towels, blinking at her uncanny resemblance to Emma.

          Do you know if there's an evening
          flight--?
          Alice and Meg turn to each other, then to Cordelia's
          reflection in the glass, their mouths hanging open.

                         

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)
          Ooh, I think I can just make it.
          No. I won't even check out here.

          being a good girl and taken the

          Cordelia stops when her eyes snag on Alice and Meg.

          Let me call you when I get to the
          airport. It may take awhile...
          She gives Alice and Meg a devastating look up and down.

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)
          It appears to be raining outside.
          Quite hard.
          She picks up her purse and exits without looking back just as
          Emma opens her stall door and joins Alice and Meg, who gape
          at her with towels in their hands.

          Well, she sounded awful. And kind

          Alice, Meg and Emma, punchy and a little drunk, enjoy wine
          from enormous glasses as they finish their meals.

                         ALICE
          (draining her glass)
          She should be ashamed. Can you
          imagine having a room here and then
          not staying in it?
          An ANXIOUS WAITER races in, refilling Alice's glass.

                         (PERFECT MIMIC)

          eating it!

                         
          The waiter retreats, joining FIVE others standing at
          discreet, fearful attention, all careful not to look at Emma
          whom they've clearly mistaken her for Cordelia.

                         MEG
          We should just take it. Her room.

                         EMMA
          And her trip to Monte Carlo!

                         MEG

                         
          Oh, shiii--

          We'll be right down. Merci.
          She hangs up.

          We were only joking! We didn't

          Alice, Meg and Emma attempt to conceal themselves behind
          Cordelia's tower of cases as it's wheeled from the elevator
          by two PORTERS.

           The women scurry for the exit past the desk manager.

          The three women increase their pace, but the manager catches
          up to them with an express envelope.

                         MANAGER
          Mademoiselle Scott, this came for
          you this morning. The package you
          were seeking?
          Emma merely blinks at the offered envelope.

                         MEG
          Take it. Just take it.

          As they emerge, the manager and doormen hustle Alice, Emma
          and Meg towards a waiting car and driver, as paparazzi call
          and shoot from across the boulevard.

                         ALICE
          Thank you so much but I think we'll

          Alice and Meg look out the back window at the manager who
          waves them farewell, the doorman shooing photographers.

                         MEG
          They really do think she's her...
          RIP! Alice and Meg spin to Emma as she spills the envelope 's

          Trip's paid for, whether that girl

          The steward helps the women from the plane, where another

          Their escort opens a door ahead of them to a roof deck, wind

          They emerge onto the deck, Emma squealing and grabbing Alice

          Alice, Meg and Emma delight as the helicopter banks along the

          A craggy ridge falls away and all of MONTE CARLO unfolds in

          in jeans and a sportscoat but with a warm bohemian air, comes
          down the steps, an oversized envelope tucked under his arm.

          Meg hangs her head.

                         EMMA
          Reykjavik! That takes some nerve!
          They're counting on her for a
          charity auction and she doesn't
          even show up!

                         ALICE
          Only she did.
          Emma reaches for a gigantic wrapped fruit basket.

                         EMMA
          She did?

                         MEG
          Do not touch that!

                         ALICE
          You, Emma. If you're Cordelia.
          They've seen you. You're here.

                         EMMA
          Well, I can't go to that thing
          tonight.

                         (A BEAT)
          I don't have anything to wear.
          The phone RINGS! and Emma snatches it up before Alice can.

                         (PERFECT BRITISH)

          Alice gestures for Emma not to say anything, to hang up.

          My luggage is here.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY

          Alice and Meg stand in front of the tower of Louis Vuitton
          trunks and cases while Emma idly thumbs the combination lock
          of a steel briefcase in her lap.

                         ALICE
          Okay. But, just for tonight. And,
          that's it.
          CLICK! Alice and Meg look to Emma, holding the now open
          briefcase, eyes wide.

                         EMMA
          Lucky guess?

                         0
          A necklace of diamonds and enormous yellow stones sparkles
          like a constellation from within the case's velvet lining.

                         ALICE

                         (CLOSING IT)
          No jewelry.
          Emma nods.

          INT. LES CASINO DES MONTE CARLO - NIGHT

          The gaming hall's towering ornate doors are opened by TWO
          DOORMEN for Alice, Emma and Meg to make their big entrance in
          Cordelia's couture chiffon, silk and organza.
          Heads held high, backs straight, they strike a remarkable
          tableaux as they pause in unison at the top of the room's
          raised landing to survey the swirl of roulette wheels and the
           tony European jet set.

          At first glance they look spectacular, but under closer 
          scrutiny one can read Meg's composed discomfort in wearing a
          dress that is too tight, nearly spilling her breasts, and the
          self-consciousness Alice endures in a dress made daringly
          short by her height.
          But, this is because we know them; to all other eyes they not
          only belong here, they own the room.
          They glance at one another, eyebrows up: "We're here!"

                         EMMA
          Don't you feel like we've won
          something already?
          Jean-Pierre comes to greet them with PRINCE DOMENICO DA
          SILVANO (30's, movie-star handsome), both in tuxedos,
          offering a hand to escort Emma down the few steps.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Mademoiselle Scott, you made it!
          Emma withholds her natural smile, placing just the tips of
          her fingers in Jean-Pierre's palm with exaggerated hauteur.

                         EMMA
          Enchante. 
          Jean-Pierre assists Meg and Alice, Meg clutching the top of
          her dress, Alice anxiously keeping the skirt of hers in place
          with a hand as she steps down.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And Mademoiselle Margaret Kelly and
          Mademoiselle Alice Perry--

                         (FOR ALICE)
          I am very glad you were able to
          come this evening.
          Alice nods, blushes and tries to cover.

                         JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)
          May I present His Highness, Prince
          Domenico Da Silvano?
          Prince Da Silvano bows from the waist.

          I shall certainly try.
          Domenico escorts Emma out onto the casino floor as Jean-
          Pierre touches Alice's elbow.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Shall we?
          Alice and Meg allow Jean-Pierre to lead them, following Emma
          as GAMBLERS break from their games to track these three
          elegant women gliding smoothly through the room.

                         MEG
          (aside to Alice)
          I may as well be topless.

                         ALICE
          Please. I'm mooning everyone
          behind us.

          A DEALER unseals a new deck of cards as Domenico pulls out a
          chair for Emma at the room's enormous game table.

                         EMMA
          Oh, but, I really wasn't planning
          on playing this evening. I so much
          prefer to watch--
          Emma looks to Alice and Meg for help as Jean-Pierre leads
          them to the far side of a low railing to view the game.

                         DOMENICO

                         (A WINK)
          This I do not believe about you.
          He turns to the eight other PLAYERS (of various ages and
          genders, but all rich) clustered at the room's small bar.

                         DOMENICO (CONT'D)
          Ladies and gentlemen? Shall we
          begin?
          The other players make obligatory introductions and take up
          positions at the table as Jean-Pierre offers Alice and Meg
          tall upholstered stools to sit.

          Alice moves to sit, but then remembers her skirt, looks to 
          Meg who is unable to even raise a leg in her tight dress.

                         ALICE

                         (TO JEAN-PIERRE)
          Easier to see if we stand.
          Jean-Pierre hands them both a glass of Champagne.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          And why aren't you playing?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Ah. I play behind the scenes.
          Like Robin Hood, I take from those
          who have more than enough, for
          those who have nothing but need.

                         (LAUGHS)
          Also, I do not play because I have
          no money of my own.
          Alice smiles, charmed by his candor, but then stops.

                         ALICE
          They're playing for money?
          (turns to Meg, flat)

                         IS
          They're playing for money.
          Together they turn to see Emma happily arranging the cards
          she is dealt in her hands.

                         DOMENICO
          Cordelia, why don't you do us the
          honor of setting this evening's
          stakes?
          Emma glances over to Alice and Meg who look back at her,
          ashen, and turns to the players who smile expectantly.

                         EMMA
          Oh. Um. Okay...
          She takes her handbag into her lap, opens it, looks.

          laughing and Emma smiles, laughing too, but shoots a
          desperate look to Alice and Meg.

          Domenico casts a glossy chip into the pot.

          Mademoiselle Scott starts us at ten
          thousand a hand.
          Alice and Meg freeze, their champagne glasses sliding from
          their hands, while Emma's eyes grow as large as all the
          zeroes on Domenico's chip.

          cards with Domenico across from her at the tensed table.
          Meg downs a glass of Champagne in one gulp, snagging the back
          of the WAITER's jacket, hauling him back for a refill.
          The waiter turns to Alice, who pats at her face with a damp
          napkin, struggling to breathe.

          as she grasps Meg's pouring hand, spilling Champagne, drawing
          Jean-Pierre's attention.

          Alice and Meg turn helplessly to the game table.

                         DOMENICO
          Ladies first.

                         EMMA
          After you. Please.
          Domenico can hardly contain his gloating as he reveals his
          three aces.

                         DOMENICO
          I am very sorry, Cordelia.
          A beat, then Emma shrugs.

                         EMMA
          Well. It is just a game after all.
          She turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt: A
          royal flush in the suit of hearts, ace high.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          I do hope there are no hard
          feelings.
          The other players cheer as Domenico's smile crashes.
          Emma shrieks with delight, turning to Alice and Meg who grab
          each other, barely keeping themselves from pitching over,
          glasses spilling, as the other players applaud.
          Emma rakes in the Everest of multi-colored chips with both
          arms, laughing as she's congratulated.

                         DOWAGER
          You must play often, Miss Scott.

                         EMMA
          Oh, a little, online. But, this is
          so much more fun!

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Domenico and Jean-Pierre, each toting buckets of chips,
          escort Alice, Emma and Meg to the elevator, all giddy.

                         DOMENICO
          Not even a last drink in the bar?

          It's been such a splendid evening,
          I am reluctant to press my luck any
          further.

                         MEG
          Yeah. Good call, Cordelia.
          DING! The elevator arrives and the doors open as Domenico
          leans in towards Emma.

                         DOMENICO
          Then you must promise to dance with
          me at my party tomorrow.
          Emma evades Domenico by stepping onto the elevator.

                         EMMA
          Oh, Delmonico--

                         DOMENICO
          "Domenico."

                         EMMA
          I would not miss it for the world.

                         
          Meg collects the buckets from Domenico and steps on.

                         MEG
          Great meeting you, your Highness.
          Good times. Really.
          Jean-Pierre places his buckets in Alice's hands, a certain
          frisson to the simple exchange.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Tomorrow night?

                         EMMA
          Wait!
          Before Alice can respond to Jean-Pierre, Emma takes one of
          the buckets from Alice and hands it back to him.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          You must keep this one. For your
          foundation.

          But, your family has already been

          The doors start to close.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Good night, then.

                         DOMENICO
          And, welcome to Monte Carlo.
          The doors close, leaving Jean-Pierre and Domenico to gaze
          fondly where the three women had just been.
          They both sigh and turn for the bar, when they hear shrieking
          from the elevator as it rises above them.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          Alice, Meg and Emma jump up and down, screaming like girls at
          a slumber party, chips flying everywhere.

                         MONTAGE:

          EXT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY


                         
          Alice, Meg and Emma burst through the salon doors into the
          street, their hair color richer, eyes brighter, a new
          lightness to their step; vivid, brilliantly polished versions
          of their essential selves.
          Heads turn as they set out together.

          INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

          The wings of a brass-framed three-way mirror spin and spread
          in a swirling kaleidoscope of shifting reflections:
          Alice, Meg and Emma work their way through an increasingly
          spectacular and audacious series of combinations, dresses and
          gowns, modeling for each other as they are tended to by
          SHOPGIRLS and SEAMSTRESSES...
          --Alice twirls in a navy dress with white polka dots.
          --Meg slaps her own ass with a laugh, admiring herself from
          the back in a pair of pencil thin sexy black jeans.
          --Emma glows in a pale lavender strapless satin gown.

           INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

          Alice, Meg and Emma watch as a number of their dresses are
          boxed and a CASHIER writes them up.

                         SHOP GIRL
          Would you like these put on your
          account, Mademoiselle Scott?

                         ALICE
          No. Thank you, we'll be paying

                         CASH--

                         EMMA
          But, it would be darling if you
          could have them sent round our
          hotel.

                         MEG
          Wait. You know what, on second
          thought, I'm not getting these--
          She pulls the pair of jeans from her pile of clothes.

                         EMMA
          But, they looked amazing on you!

          You wear them here! Anywhere!
          Alice, you tell her--
          Alice opens her mouth, but stops herself as the three wander
          the crowded market stalls heaped with fountains of flowers in
          every color, breads, fresh produce, trinkets and souvenirs.

                         ALICE
          No. I'm not going to tell you what
          to do.

                         MEG
          Thank you. It's silly, anyway.
          They're just jeans. I want to find
          something for the kids--

          Emma leaps to one of the stalls, seizing a profusion of 
          plastic jeweled tiaras displayed alongside photographs of
          Princess Grace. She places a tiara on her head, modeling.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)

          Alice holds up a pair of pink satin toe shoes, swinging them
          from their ribbon laces.

          INT. SHOE REPAIR SHOP - DAY

          A SHOP OWNER (60's) slips a pair of freshly polished men's
          shoes into a paper bag, placing them on the counter in front
          of Richard, who pulls out his wallet.

                         RICHARD

                         (REMEMBERING)
          Oh. And the suitcase.
          The shop owner retrieves Alice's mended suitcase from a
          nearby shelf, a tag on the zipper.

          RICHARD (CONT'D) 
          How much do I owe you for that?

          EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

          Richard exits the shoe repair carrying Alice'.s repaired
          suitcase, headed for his car.

                         GLENN
          Hey, Richard!
          Richard glances up to see Glenn crossing the parking lot with
          Seamus and Finn, pushing a cart piled high with groceries.

                         CUT TO:
          Richard finishes helping Glenn and the kids transfer grocery
          bags to the open trunk of Glenn's squad car.

          Meg and I've had this bet going:
          She thought it would be on Alice's
          next birthday, but I knew it was

          sportscoat, pauses in collecting leeks when he spots Meg on
          the other side of the open stall.
          He watches as she surveys the rich array of fresh produce,
          lifting a tomato to her nose, inhaling with a private smile.
          Meg bites into the tomato, spurting juice onto her cheek and
          down her front.
          She looks up as she attempts to wipe the juice away, stopping
          when she catches Bernard smiling with amusement.
          Meg rolls her eyes with self-deprecation and moves on along
          the line of stalls.
          Bernard pays for his purchase and follows, finding Meg at
          another stall where a FRENCHWOMAN tries to communicate how to
          prepare the fish they both admire.
          Meg nods, not entirely understanding, but getting enough of
          it to gesture responses.
          The woman grabs some newspaper, wrapping the fish, and
          thrusts it towards Meg with a smile.

          The woman is confused, vaguely insulted.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          I don't have a kitchen. No place
          to cook.

          She is only a visitor. Without a
          kitchen. But, it is a beautiful
          fish. Maybe next time.
          Meg turns to find Bernard beside her.

                         BERNARD (CONT'D)
          I have explained.
          Meg hesitates uncertainly before this friendly stranger.

          Well, thank you...

          Bernard falling into step with her.

                         BERNARD
          You are American.
          Meg glances at Bernard and away, uncomfortable, but curious,
          drawn by his warmth and the familiar greetings he exchanges
          with various vendors as they walk.

                         MEG
          From Wisconsin. Yes.
          Bernard reaches a handkerchief from his jacket for Meg.

                         BERNARD
          You cook in Wisconsin?
          Meg uses the handkerchief to blot the remaining tomato juice.

          Ah, langoustines. Many ways to

          I'd go for a saute, being a
          Midwestern gal.

          So, you cook.
          Bernard dips his head modestly.

          Meg shakes his hand and returns the handkerchief.

          Meg. Kelly. Thank you again for

          And, how long are you in Monte
          Carlo, Meg?
          Meg's brow furrows slightly and she turns to head back.

                         MEG
          I need to find my--. . My friends
          are around here somewhere...

          I will help you find them. We can

                         MEG
          Yeah. But, I'm gonna walk myself.
          Thanks, though.
          She slips into the moving crowd, leaving Bernard to watch as
          she meets Alice and Emma further up the street.
          He holds a beat, then turns when called to by a vendor.

          INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Glenn paces as Richard holds the phone at his desk, the
          Esprit de Corps Tours website on his computer's screen.

                         RICHARD
          It's been two days and it didn't
          occur to you to call anyone?

           EXT. PALAIS DE CHAILLOT - DAY

          Madame Valery, cellphone to her ear, leads'the few remaining
          members of her flock down the wide steps, across the Seine
          from the Eiffel tower.

                         MADAME VALERY
          She refused to follow my
          instructions. She sabotaged my
          tour. Ruined it for everyone!

                         RICHARD
          Wait. Alice did? Alice Perry?

                         MADAME VALERY
          She took my flag!

          But, if their luggage is still
          there, then they're missing--

          Are you the police in France?

          The police? Monsieur. Nothing
          could keep her from seeing Paris
          her way. Believe me. She was very
          determined.

          You are the husband, yes?
          Richard hesitates, looks to Glenn.

          Yes. I am the husband.

          INT. VILLA DA SILVANO - NIGHT

          A cascade of yellow and gold balloons washes over Alice as
          she dances with Meg and Emma to a Euro-trance-pop beat at the
          center of the crowded dance floor.
          Emma screams with delight in a new dress and plastic tiara,
          batting balloons as Domenico who spins her away.
          Alice watches with heightened vigilance as Emma dances with
          her prince and blows a kiss to Alice and Meg.

                         MEG
          Alice, she's fine...

                         (MARVELING)
          Look where we are! Can you even
          remember the last time we danced
          like this? It's gotta be-Martha
          Lapland's wedding--

                         MEG
          (stops dancing, laughs)
          The gay bar?

                         ALICE
          (shrugs, matter of fact)
          They've got the best music.

                         MEG
          I am so butting in on that.
          Alice laughs and spins, crashing directly into Jean-Pierre.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And I was looking for you!
          From the edge of the dance floor, NIKOLAI LUDOVIC (late 30s),
          squat, bald, completely nondescript but for his white tie and
          tails, watches Emma ardently.
          He stops a waiter, taking his tray of Champagne flutes.

                         
          Emma spins to find Nikolai at her elbow, grinning, holding up
          this offering, and she takes him for a waiter.

                         EMMA
          Ooh! Thank you! I'm so thirsty!
          Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile,
          watching with bright eyes as Emma drinks.
          She lowers her glass and her full attention snags on Nikolai,
          really registering his presence now as she searches his warm,
          gentle eyes.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          It's a wonderful party, isn't it?
          Nikolai nods and offers her another glass of Champagne.
          Alice, dancing with Jean-Pierre, subtly repositions herself
          in order to keep an eye on Emma.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Cordelia, she can take care of
          herself, yes?

          What? Oh, yeah, of course...
          Meg dances by herself, having a great time, taking in the
          room, the music and the people, when a handsome MAN begins to
          match her moves, insinuates himself.
          She smiles but shakes her head as she moves away, turning her
          back to evade him.
          Another gorgeous MAN sidles up to Meg, joining her solo
          dance, wiggling his eyebrows invitingly.

                         MEG
          No, thanks.
          She moves off only to be met by GIORGIO (40's, sexy, Euro-
          suave) who smoothly steps in.

                         MEG (CONT'D)

          Emma slips away from dancing with Domenico, moving to Nikolai
          who remains with his tray at the ready,.brightening at her
          approach, lifting a glass.

                         EMMA
          Don't you need to, like, circulate?

                         NIKOLAI
          Ya znal, chto naydu tebya.
          Emma blushes as though showered in compliments.

          Emma turns, still smiling, to find PENELOPE PENROSE (late
          20s, British), frail and bird-like, but attempting to hold a
          warrior's stance with her shoulders thrown back.

          She dodges away from Jean-Pierre, hooking Meg's arm in
          passing, yanking her away from Giorgio as she heads for Emma.

          Third year at Le Rosey! You threw

          Monte Carlo. It's like Hong Kong.
          People merely come and go. People
          like me. Well, and then, people
           like yourself.

          Alice nods to a WAITER who arrives to refill her Champagne 
          glass, pouring as Jean-Pierre speaks.

                         ALICE
          People like me?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          People with money. This is why I
          come. I help assuage their guilt
          when I remind them that there are
          children in this world who do not
          have clean water to drink, while
          they drink Champagne.

                         ALICE
          And that works?
          Jean-Pierre blinks, then bursts out laughing.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          I take myself far too seriously.

                         ALICE
          No. I'm sorry, I didn't mean--.
          I've seen the pictures of the
          schools. The work you do is

                         

                         ADMIRABLE--

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And I'm afraid I talk about it
          because I myself am not that
          interesting...
          (a hand on her arm)
          I'd rather know about you.

                         ALICE

                         (TRAPPED)
          Oh. Well. You know. I...do what
          I can, here and there. A little
          volunteer work...
          She turns to her Champagne, rolling her eyes at herself.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          Oh, brother.
          Meg sits further down the length of all the tables laid end
          to end, beside Giorgio, who has pulled his chair close,
          draping an arm casually across the back of hers.

                         MEG
          Okay, wait. You're a man, right?

                          MEG (CONT'D)
          Yeah, I know: I'm funny. But, see
          if you can answer something for me.
          Ten years you're married, to the
          girl you dated in high school. I'm
          talking the girl you lost your
          virginity to, the one who gave you
          two great kids that you're just
          crazy about. Then one morning,
          what? You wake up, and out of the
          blue, it's like, "Oh, hey, honey, I
          think I'm in love with this other
          woman..."

                         (PAUSES)
          His patrol partner.
          A beat as Giorgio shakes his head sadly.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          I thought I was his partner.
          Giorgio takes Meg hand, more in comfort than come on.

                         GIORGIO
           You heart feels betrayed.

                         MEG
          (telling a secret)
          I feel like I failed.

                         GIORGIO
          I tell you this: A man...he will
          always love the mother of his
          children.
          Meg blinks, taking this in.

                         GIORGIO (CONT'D)
          Now you must kiss someone else.

                         MEG

                         (LAUGHS)
          Oh, I see--

                         GIORGIO
          To break the spell. You must!
          Then you will be free.
          A plate of beautifully arranged langoustine is placed on the
          table in front of Meg.

          Madame Kelly.
          He heads toward for the kitchen before she can say anything.
          Emma pours sloppy glasses of Champagne for her companions as
          though playing a game of tag, spilling wine.

                         EMMA
          And you're my friend...and you're
          my friend. . .and you're my--
          She turns with the bottle to find Nikolai who has
          materialized beside her on the long banquette.

          Oh, hey! You were at the party!
          Do you work here, too?
          Nikolai cheerfully shakes his head, holds up her purse.

                         

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Oh! Did I forget that? Wow, what

          Emma sets the bottle down to concentrate on Nikolai.

          You're not from here, are you?

                         (OVER-ENUNCIATING)

          Alice and Jean-Pierre walk along, side by side, their hands
          nearly touching, among the rest of the restaurant party.
          Alice looks up, taking in the bowl of pre-dawn sky, and
          glances over at Jean-Pierre who watches her.

          Ahead, Emma breaks away from Penelope and Domenico, leaving
          the two to walk on together as she comes back toward Alice.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Where's Meg?
          Alice looks around and sees Giorgio walking alone among the
          strolling party guests.

          Bernard takes a tray of dishes from his FATHER (70's,
          striking resemblance) who enters from the dining room.

                         BERNARD
          Papa, sit down. Rest.

          INT. BISTRO - PRE-DAWN

           Bernard enters with the tray, stopping when he sees Meg
          examining a menu by the front door of the empty bistro.

                         MEG

                         (SLY SMILE)
          You do cook.
          Bernard shrugs, smiling as he comes forward.

          You enjoyed your meal?

                         MEG
          Adding the fresh orange; nice.
          Bernards nods, accepting the compliment.

          We were--. We're going to watch

          Alice turns to Meg and Emma, sharing this moment so far
          beyond anything they could have dreamed.

          We'd be getting up now.

          She runs for the sprays of water, pulling Alice and Meg, and
          the paparazzi meet them, flashing away.
          Leaning against the fountain's balustrade, Emma gestures for

          Her feet zip out from beneath her and she sails backwards

          with her as the camera's flash.

          Richard steps from the hotel with a MANAGER (50's) who
          pantomimes that he recognizes Alice from the snapshot Richard
          shows him, but has no idea where she could be.
          Richard pulls out a map to point at a random spot and the
          manager gestures up the street, down the street, shrugging:

          Alice, amid a crowd of tourists, only half watches the
          changing of the guards outside the palace gates.
          She snaps herself out of her distraction with a shake of her
          head and turns to the marked pages in her guide book.

          Richard stands with his map beneath the arch where all roads
          come together in a spinning roundabout of bleating car horns.
          He looks down the length of the Champs Elysees, overwhelmed.
          The Japanese couple from Notre Dame approach Richard to ask
          directions and he shrugs helplessly, pressing the map on

          trash can on the corner, striking out unaided down a narrow
          twisting street hung with vines and flowers.

          intersection of two narrow alleys in the fading twilight.

          forehead, lost in a maze of dilapidated walled courtyards and
          apartment blocks; home to the city's service workers.

          He watches them stop, kiss, then continue on their way.
          A WAITER returns with Richard's change on a plate and Richard

          around which ALGERIAN MEN lounge in plastic lawn chairs.

          As Alice sips from a bottle of beer, a soccer ball bounces
          off the curb and rolls to a stop beside her.

          Emma drifts away to the ship's rail where she turns to 
          survey the party, smiling wistfully at Penelope and Domenico
          locked in intimate conversation.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
          Cordelia! There she is! Cordelia!
          The trio of paparazzi putter alongside in a small boat,
          peppering the yacht with their camera flashes.
          Emma looks out at them, without her usual animation.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
          Smile, Cordelia! Please, smile!
          Emma waves, but can't seem to manage that smile.

          Ty v poryadke?
          Emma turns to find Nikolai standing beside her in white tie,
          a piece of cake extended in one hand, a fork in the other.
          Emma's eyes light up as if a switch has been thrown and the
          flash of a camera records her huge, dazzling smile.

                         EMMA

          He bows slightly, offering the cake.

          You work here too? You never get a
          night off...

          he's got actual clients. And
          that's Finn, the prima ballerina.
          She'll be six in June--
          Emile examines photographs of Seamus and Charlotte from Meg's
          wallet while she refills their glasses at the kitchen table
          and Bernard works at the stove.

                         EMILE

          scared of anything--

                         (LAUGHS)
          Not a chicken. He says, she looks
          like a rascal.

          No idea where she gets that...
          Meg lifts her glass with a sly smile as Bernard brings plates
          of food to the table.

          Alice sails down the makeshift soccer field as one of the
          kids passes the ball to her, chased by the others.
          She dodges and kicks the ball through the goal to score.
          Her "team" jumps and cheers, as do a collection of spectators
          who have gathered to watch this tall red headed woman in a
          summer dress racing around the dusty lot with a band of kids.

          Yeah. No. No way.
          Bernard straddles a beat up moped, motor running, as Meg
          shakes her head emphatically.

                         BERNARD
          I can not take you, if you will not
          get on.

                         MEG
          What do you want me to tell you?
          I'm not getting on that thing.
          Bernard fixes her with a level look, which Meg mimics.

                         BERNARD

          Meg hangs on to Bernard as they zip along the beachfront
          drive and turns her face to the wind with a smile.
          She surrenders to the ride, the sheer fun of it, laughing.

          allowed here!

          And this is Henri, the worst
          egotist, my mentor.
          The two men embrace, merrily kissing each other on both
          cheeks, then Henri pulls Meg under his arm.

                         HENRI

          INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT - MOVING

          Jean-Pierre drives an open silver sports car full of PARTY
          GOERS down the twisting streets, when he sees the commotion
          and crowd around the dirt lot.
          Then he spots Alice running-around.

          EXT. MONTE CARLO - DIRT LOT - NIGHT

          Alice sticks like glue to a kid with the ball, maneuvers in,
          steals the ball, and doubles back in the opposite direction,
          racing up the field as the crowd laughs and claps.
          She passes the ball to kid who drives it to the goal, scores.
          Alice looks up from the game at the tapping of a car horn to
          see Jean-Pierre honking in celebration as he leans against
          the car with his GUESTS, enjoying the game.
          Alice stops to wave, and takes the ball full in the face.

          from the car as worried kids and spectators form a circle
          around Alice's prone body.
          The little dog licks Alice's face and she opens her eyes.
          She leaps up as Jean-Pierre crosses the lot.

                         ALICE
          I'm up! I'm up! Let's go!
          She sets off down the field with the kids.

          EXT. YACHT - PRE-DAWN

          Empty and half-filled glasses, bottles litter every surface
          along with plates, ashtrays, crumpled napkins.
          Emma sits on the lower landing deck, legs in the water, shoes
          in her hand, looking out at the lights.
          Nikolai moves his legs in the gentle current beside her,
          tuxedo trousers rolled, while he concentrates on working a
          napkin into intricate folds.
          Emma turns to look back at the silent boat.

                         

                         EMMA
          It doesn't seem fair. Leaving you
          to clean up all alone.

          I'll help. But, you've really got
          to talk to your boss.

          I know how that can feel.
          Nikolai holds up the napkin he's transformed into a crown
          adorned with flowers and the wire cages from Champagne corks.
          Emma looks at him, her face soft and vulnerable, open, as
          Nikolai places the makeshift crown on her head with care.

          Meg tries to follow the discussions and familiar teasing of
          the chefs as they pass plates, goading her to taste.
          She looks over at Bernard, who smiles as he holds his hands
          up at the scene, his boisterous friends, the food; as though

                         
          to say "this is good, enjoy."
          Meg relaxes her shoulders and gives in to the spirit of the
          table, spears a bite of food and lifts her glass to Bernard.

                         CUT TO:
          Meg and another chef, locked in a chopping duel, plow though
          onions at a blinding pace, their knives flashing, creating an
          escalating staccato on their cutting boards.
          Meg sweeps her onion from her board to a pan, and slams her
          knife down in victory as all the chefs erupt with applause.
          Henri seizes Meg's hand, raising her arm in the air, and
          presents her with a bottle of wine.
          Meg turns to Bernard, beaming, thrilled, utterly happy, as
          the other chefs clap her on the back, shake her hand.

          jacket over her shoulders.

          ALICE (V.O.)
          Well, Africa, then. How often do
          you get to go?
          He leads her around the maze of skylights to the front of the
          building that faces the sea and the lightening sky.

          JEAN-PIERRE (V.0.)
          Not enough. Mostly I am on planes.

          parties make people generous.

          Alice's smile flickers with a vague disappointment as she
          leans against the hotel's crown beside Jean-Pierre. 

                         ALICE
          That seems a shame...

          It is just a small town, in a vast,
          open space. Maybe in the middle of
          America. There are people there
          like yourself, who are kind. And

          Alice turns to Jean-Pierre as he takes a strand of her hair
          in his fingers, and they hold a beat, looking at one another.

          Nikolai shrugs himself out of his formal shirt to stand
          before Emma in nothing but starfish printed boxer shorts.
          He lifts his hands: This is me. Here I am.
          Emma hesitates, then lets her gown fall around her, bare
          except for her panties, the necklace, and her napkin crown.
          Nikolai pushes himself off the side of the boat at a run,
          hiking up his legs into a cannonball. SPLASH!
          He surfaces and turns back to the boat just as Emma dives in
          with a SPLASH!
          She swims to Nikolai, pushing him under in a child's game,
          and he pops up, spitting water like a fountain.
          They laughs and Emma loops her arms around him.
          A beat as they sober.

          necklace nestled among its satin folds.

          hall with Jean-Pierre close beside her, neither speaking.
          She turns to him when they reach the door of her suite.
          A long beat stretches, full of every possibility.

          But--. Jean-Pierre...
          (a near confession)
          You don't know me.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          This is why I ask. I would like to
          know you, Alice. Very much.
          Alice regards him a beat, then slowly pulls his jacket from
          her shoulders.

                         ALICE
          Before this, I'd never even been to
          France.
          Jean-Pierre blinks and Alice laughs, as much at herself.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          It's true. Just kept putting it
          off. Always managed to find an
          excuse. But, really, it was that I
          was afraid. That it couldn't ever
          live up to the France I'd imagined.
          And if it did... Then I'd never be
          able to go home.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And, now?
          Alice gently places Jean-Pierre's jacket in his hands and
          steps near to kiss him on the lips.

                         ALICE
          But, thank you.
          She turns and opens the door with her key as Jean-Pierre
          smiles ruefully.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          For everything.
          Alice steps into her room and closes the door.

          Richard exits the plane, walking down a mobile stairway onto
          the tarmac, carrying Alice's repaired suitcase.

           INT. NICE AIRPORT - DAY

          Richard stands at the information counter, conferring with an
          ATTENDANT in his broken French.

                         RICHARD
          Excusez-moi...I'm looking for the
          train. To Monte Carlo.
          Behind him, Cordelia strides through a set of doors to stop
          directly at Richard's back as she searches the terminal and
          hisses into her cellphone.

                         CORDELIA
          Yes, Daddy, I'm here. No, I do not
          see a driver. Yes, I am looking!
          The attendant points over Richard's shoulder to an exit.
          Richard begins to turn in Cordelia's direction, but the
          attendant corrects him, pointing the other way.

                         RICHARD
          Merci.
           He picks up Alice's suitcase and heads off just as a
          UNIFORMED DRIVER approaches Cordelia.

                         DRIVER
          Mademoiselle Scott?

                         CORDELIA
          Where have you been?
          The driver leads her away, neither she nor Richard having
          taken note of the nearby newsstand and its display of today's
          front page: Emma on the yacht wearing Cordelia's necklace.

          EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - DAY

          Meg zooms the moped around the fountain a last loop, Bernard
          on the back, before jerking to a stop in front of the hotel.
          Bernard steadies the moped as Meg climbs off.

                         ME G
          Well, this is me. Back to the old
          Grimaldi suite.

                         BERNARD

                         (WITH REGRET)
           I have to open the restaurant.

          A beat as they face each other, neither knowing how to end 
          the evening, how to say goodbye.

                         MEG
          Thank your father for me?

                         BERNARD
          I will, Meg.

                         MEG
          Thank you.
          Meg hugs him briefly, awkwardly, then turns for the steps.

                         BERNARD
          Goodbye, Meg.
          Meg stops, holds a beat with her back to Bernard.
          Then she turns and marches to him with purpose, seizing his
          face in both her hands and kisses him passionately.
          She releases Bernard, who staggers against the moped,
          catching himself just before going over, as she turns again
          for the steps, an enormous smile on her face.

          Alice sits on the edge of the bed with the hotel phone, idly
          looking out at the sparkling bay and anchored boats.

                         ALICE
          (leaving a message)
          Well, I wish you were there. Or
          here. I wish you were here,
          Richard. I do... Because I keep
          thinking, no matter what I see, I'm
          only seeing half of it. Because
          we're not seeing it together...
          Meg lets herself in the front door and heads for the bedroom,
          stopping when she overhears Alice on the phone.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Richard. I hope you'll
          be there when I get home...
          Because that's all I want.
          Alice hangs up the phone, so lost in thought she doesn't see
          Meg standing at the door.

          That I hadn't already been to
          France. It was like this wave, all
          the years, and chances I'd had but
          didn't take, they just crashed down
          on me: And I hadn't seen anything
          but the end of Lake Avenue. The
          only clear thought in my head was,
          "this guy is so wonderful, how can
          he marry half a person?"

          a choice. But, he wasn't. He
          wasn't doing that at all. It was

          loved me just for who I was.

          Alice opens the door for Emma who stands up from retrieving
          the morning paper just outside the door.

          suite to tear open on the fruit basket, pluck out an apple,
          and drape herself across a chaise.

          EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - DAY 

          Cordelia steps to the railing, completely unaware of Alice,
          precariously perched atop the adjacent balcony's railing,
          back pressed against the face of the hotel.

                         CORDELIA

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Stavros is supposed to be here,
          isn't he? I don't see his boat!
          Alice carefully turns to Meg and Emma who look back her with
          desperate faces from the balcony on the far side of Cordelia,
          where they balance with their shopping bags.

          BELLBOY (O.S.)
          Mademoiselle?

                         CORDELIA

          The bellboy stands expectantly by the front door.

                         CORDELIA
          Yes?
          He nods, not quite with his hand out, but waiting.

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)
          If you're done, you may go.
          The bellboy turns but hesitates in catching a quick glimpse
          of Alice, fleet as a gazelle, as she passes the open doors on
          the balcony behind Cordelia.

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)
          I said, you can go.
          He bows a retreat, backing out the door.

          EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - DAY

          Alice climbs across to the next balcony where Meg tries the
          handles of another set of French doors.

          Shopping bags swing up over the edge of the roof, landing in
          profusion, followed by three sets of gripping hands.
          Alice, Meg and Emma haul each other over the hotel's crown,
          the view of the ocean and the yachts in the bay behind them.

          EXT. MOTOR BOAT - AT SEA - DAY

          A BOAT DRIVER in uniform passes a captain's hat to Nikolai,
          who places it on his head as they speed towards the marina.

          Meg turns to get a gauge on the distant yacht as she and
          Alice labor with the oars of a fisherman's dinghy.

          Richard steps off the train, with today's paper wedged under
          the arm that carries Alice's suitcase.

          The dinghy strikes the side of the yacht and the three women

          Richard drops down to help Alice as she struggles up, dizzily
          finding her feet to stand.

          Honey, are you alright--?

          She hugs Richard tightly.

          Oh, thank god!
          Cordelia opens the door to Nikolai, who holds out the room
          key and flower with a smile as her brows come together.

          OFFICERS and their CAPTAIN into the lobby.

          No. No. It is robbery. But,
          Mademoiselle Scott said it wasn't.
          Jean-Pierre, checking lists at the ballroom's entrance, notes
          the commotion and Cordelia's name, joins the group.

          Oh, no! This is going to be so
          embarrassing. Please tell me you
          didn't run all the way over here
          just for me.

          Yes, but, Jean-Pierre, would you be
          a dear and help me? I can't seem
          to manage the clasp.
          Jean-Pierre senses something amiss, but steps to assist Emma.

          Nikolai leaps up.

          Alice winces as she sees Richard approaching, at the same
          time Nikolai rushes to Emma.

          Is there something I need to know?

          INT. NICE AIRPORT - JETWAY - DAY

          Meg walks down the jetway in her skinny jeans, a bounce in 
          her step, shopping bags in one hand, the bottle of wine
          gripped in the other, as though headed for a party.
          Behind her, Alice carries her shopping bags and Richard totes
          Alice's suitcase.

          ALICE (V.0.)
          "I used to wander aimlessly,/
          Wanton my goal, grievous my
          plight./Your dear hands led me,
          guided me."
          Alice encircles Richard's waist as they walk, and he slings
          an arm around her shoulder, kisses her hair.

          EXT. ZAMBIA, AFRICA - DAY

          Under a beating sun, Emma, dressed in immaculate white linen,
          holds hands with Nikolai as a MOB OF LAUGHING CHILDREN and
          their TEACHERS greet them outside a new Marchand Foundation
          schoolhouse.

          "Over the far horizon, night/
          Glowed with the pallid hope of
          dawn./Your eyes' glance was my
          morning light."
          A YOUNG GIRL presents a length of brightly woven fabric,
          draping it over Emma's shoulders as Emma picks the girl up
          and the other children lead Emma and Nikolai inside.

          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

          A bulletin board in Meg's classroom is covered in African
          fabric, photographs and letters, all under a banner that
          reads: Food Drive for Our Sister School - Zambia.
          The two students who had cooked their pot holders sort canned
          goods beneath the board, while Meg cooks, surrounded by the
          rest of her CLASS.

          ALICE (V.0.)
          "No sound - save his own tread
          upon/The ground - to ease the
          wanderer's heart./Your voice
          encouraged me: 'go on!"'

                         0
          A STUDENT carefully scoops spices with a measuring spoon,
          holding it out for Meg to add to her pan.
          She ignores the spoon, instead reaching to pinch some spice
          with her fingers and encourages the student who follows her
          example.

          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

          Alice moves freely around the center of the circle of desks
          her STUDENTS have formed, reciting by memory.

                         ALICE
          "Yes, my heart - dark, cowed, set
          apart,/Alone - bewailed its dire
          distress./Sweet love, with its all-
          conquering art."
          The entire classroom hangs on her every word.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          "Joined us as one in joyousness."
          A beat as she and her class float on the last phrase of Paul
          Verlaine's poem.

          Mademoiselle Perry, what was it
          really like?
          Alice refocuses to smile at Amber and survey all the faces of
          her students for a beat.

                         ALICE
          Everyone should go. At least once
          in their life.
