 1. A dusty deserted street - saloon, livery stable, sunset.
 Only there is something unsettling about it all. The colors
 are too muted and the angles not quite in perspective. Pulling
slowly back eventually reveals the edges of a narrow wooden
picture frame ...

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1930
Drifting away from the painting and slowly across a room.
Across Venetian blinds, open, letting in moonlight, across
intricate handmade wooden models, dime novels and comic books,
across the arm of a metronome gently slapping back and forth,
and settling finally on a small hand writing slowly and
deliberately, over and over, in synchronization, it seems, to
the rhythm of the metronome, the word, " L E O N A R D . "

2.   INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING - 1930
The pendulum of a clock. An adult hand placing a bowl of
cereal on a table. Leonard, ten or eleven, waits a moment for
the adult to leave, grasps his spoon, and manipulates it from
bowl to mouth in time with the soft regular rhythm of the
clock.

3.   EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - MORNING - 1930                      3.
Schoolbooks slung over their shoulders, Leonard and another boy
his age, a classmate, move along a street.
All around them are "visual rhythms" - lines in the sidewalk,
the even placement of trees, the sunlight breaking through the
branches above them - and somewhere unseen, the rhythmic
pounding of an elevator train.
As they climb a fence, a pocket watch, Leonard's, falls to the
ground.

                                                                  4.
4.   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - 1930
An adult hand chalking the words of a poem on a blackboard.
Children at desks dutifully transcribing the lesson.
All but one. Leonard. Whose hands are trembling slightly and
whose paper is blank. There is a noticeable lack of rhythms.
A cold silence. The broken watch rests on his desk.
The boy from the train, glancing at Leonard, begins gently
tapping the end of his pen against his desk. Leonard, "guided"
by the cadence of his friend's tapping, begins to write.

(o   The teacher's hand at the blackboard hesitates. Distracted by     4.
     the rhythmic noise, he traces it to the offender and silences
     him with a look.
                            \      '
     Without the rhythm, and without, apparently, inner natural
     rhythms to replace it, Leonard's hand begins dragging the pen
     across the paper, forming vague scrawl, each word less defined
     than the last, until they begin melding together into what
     resembles nothing so much as a child's rendering of ocean
     waves.
     The teacher resumes chalking on the board. The boy from the
     train begins tapping his pen again, and, "guided" again by the
     rhythm, Leonard is able to give definition to the "ocean
     waves," to form recognizable letters.and words.
     The teacher hesitates again and glares at the boy making the
     irritating noise. The boy stops tapping and Leonard's writing
     again becomes formless.

                                                                       5.
     5. INT. CLASSROOM.- LATER - DAY - 1930
     The finished poem on the blackboard. The sounds of children at
     play on the schoolyard. The teacher, alone in the classroom,

o    at his desk grading the penmanship lesson.
     He circles offending errors on the last page of the last
     composition book. He scribbles a grade opposite the student's
     name in a grade book. He notices the absence of a grade in
     Leonard's column.                         .
     Leonard's desk. The teacher locates the missing composition
     book buried under textbooks. He takes it back to his own desk,
     opens it, and stares curiously at the last lesson, the poem, or
     rather Leonard's illegible representation of it.
     He considers earlier lessons in the book. He begins to see in
     the script a pattern of deterioration. He reaches the last
     entry again and stares at the few recognizable words drowning
     In "the waves."

                                                                       6
     6.   INT. LEONARD'S BEDROOM - DAY - 1930 - WINTER
     The painting on the wall. The intricate wooden models and dime
     novels. The Venetian blinds, closed, shutting out sunlight.
     Voices, barely audible, from somewhere else in the house:
                          BOY'S VOICE
                When can I see him?
                          WOMAN'S VOICE
                When he's well.

6.C0NT.              BOY'S VOICE                              6.CONT,
           When will he be well?
After a moment --
                     WOMAN'S VOICE
           I don't know.
-- and the sound of a door closing.
A small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds
revealing the snow-patched street below. Leonard's friend,
crossing it, glances back . . . then disappears around a corner.
And the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down,
extinguishing the single ray of light.

                                             FADE TO BLACK


6A.   EXT. BAINBRIDGE -HOSPITAL - THE. BRONX - DAY - 1970 .        6A
Tight on the face of a man (SAYER), late thirties, glasses,
staring up at the face of a building, imposing in its
institutional dullness.

6B.    INT. LOBBY - BAINBRIDGE - DAY                               6B.
A dim, sleepy cavern of a lobby. No one but a switchboard
operator thumbing through a magazine. Echoing footsteps reach
her station and she glances up and at the man from outside.
                                   i
                     OPERATOR
           Yes?

7.    INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY
He seems uncomfortable. Perhaps it's the suit. Or the place.
Or the situation. Or the hard straight-backed chair he's in.
When he does finally speak, it's with great sincerity --
                     SAYER
           When you say people ... you mean
           living people,                 .
Behind an old oak desk, the hospital's Director glances over
to its Chief of Medicine, Dr. Kaufman, with a look that seems
to wonder, As opposed to what?
                     DIRECTOR
           Living people, yes.   Patients.

                                   REV.12/15/89 (GREEN)        Pg.4

 7.C0NT.                                                    7.
  There's some mistake. And Sayer's chair begins to feel more *
uncomfortable. He tries to clear up the confusion -
                                                                      *
                      SAYER

          lab.
                     DIRECTOR
          Neurology lab?
He doesn't laugh at Sayer, just at the thought of it.
                    DIRECTOR
          We have an x-ray room.
Sayer tries to share the Director's amusement with a good- *
natured smile, but doesn't really understand it. Kaufman seems *
to have less time for this, and in plain English, unadorned -  *
                    KAUFMAN
         - The-position-ds-Staff-^Neurologist.            .
Sayer looks like a man who's just learned that everything he *
knows about the world is wrong.         f
                     DIRECTOR
                (pause)
          A doctor ... doctor.
The Director refers to stapled sheets of paper in his hands,
Sayer's resume.
                     DIRECTOR
          The Camel Institute. Tell me                                *
          about that, anything with patients                          *
          there? Or . . .                                             *

                (burying it)
          Earthworms.
The Director isn't sure he heard right.
                    DIRECTOR
          Sorry?                               ,

          It was an immense project. "
          I was trying to extract a decigram
          of myelin from four tons of
          earthworms.

     7.C0NT.              DIRECTOR                                          7.
                      (pause)
                Really.
                         SAYER
               I was on it for five years.
               I was the only one who really
               believed in it. The rest of them
               said it couldn't be done.                         t

                           KAUFMAN
               It can't.
                         SAYER
               Well, I know that now.       I proved
               it.
    The director offers a slow tentative nod before consulting the
    resume again.
                         DIRECTOR
               Maybe before. At Saint Thomas.
                    (Sayer is already
                     shaking his head no)
               All research. Earth - ?
                          SAYER
               Pigs brains . . . they·re quite
               similar to human brains.
                         DIRECTOR
                    (hopefully)
               Are they?
                           SAYER
               Oh, yes . . . three years.
    As the Director retreats back to the resume, hoping against
    hope of finding in it something germane, Sayer glances away to
    a window. He wishes he were outside it. He has no business
    being here. He should leave.
                         SAYER
               Excuse me, I made a mistake coming
               here. Clearly you're looking for
               someone with more of a clinical
               background.
    He stands up to leave. Kaufman stands to see him out.      But the       *
    director keeps searching the resume.

           I've taken enough of your time.
           You must have a hundred applicants
           more suitable.
                     KAUFMAN
           Thanks anyway.
                     DIRECTOR
           Back in medical school ...
Kaufman shoots the Director a look that says, No, we're not
that desperate.
                      DIRECTOR
           I mean, you couldn't have
           graduated without some clinical
           experience. .
Sayer hesitates. And eventually manages sort of a shrug and a
n od .,            v'

                     DIRECTOR
           Well, there we are, doctor.
Kaufman can't believe it, but is sent back a look that says,
We have no choice. The Director gets up out of his chair, and,
smiling broadly, extends his hand to Sayer. Which unsettles
Sayer. Which in turn unsettles the Director.
                     DIRECTOR
                (not far from                 v
                 begging)
           You do want the job, don't you?
Sayer isn't so sure.   He thinks about it long and hard . . .

8.   INT. CORRIDOR   - BAINBRIDGE - DAY                                8.
Moving along a corridor crowded "with patients, some ambulatory,
some in wheelchairs, "living people" living with profound
neurological disease.
                     ANTHONY O.S.
           Spent much time in chronic
           hospitals, doctor?
A patient approaches, and, passing Sayer and the orderly who's
escorting him (ANTHONY), offers -
                     FEMALE PATIENT 1
           Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello . . .

           You'd remember.
                     SAYER
           I guess not.
As they pass an old patient in a wheelchair -
                      ANTHONY
           Hey, how you doing?
                 (calling to someone
                  down the hall)
           Dr. Sullivan.
Staying on the old patient, he eventually manages, too late -
                     OLD PATIENT

Down the hall in an alcove, Dr. Sullivan glances up long
sufferingly from-a.patient~with'.an .Ouij a-board who !.s mumbling,          *
complaining, unintelligibly. Anthony and Sayer arrrive.
                     ANTHONY
           Dr. Sullivan, this is Dr. Sayer;
                     ' ': : '                      '   -'.
 There's a kind a "deadness" in Sullivan's eyes and voice; he's
been here too long.
                     SULLIVAN
          Not the neurologist, that'd be
           asking too much. You're not the
           neurologist.
                     SAYER
           I think I am.
Sayer extends his hand. Instead of shaking it -
                     SULLIVAN
           Well, come on, Anthony, get him a
           coat for Christ's sake.
- Sullivan thrusts his clipboard into Sayer's hand.

          They're just pencils, pens.
He tries to prove it to her by removing one of them from the
pocket of his white coat. Screaming louder at the sight of it,
she tries to protect her face with her hands like a boxer being
beaten senseless.

11.   INT. DAYROOM (B) - DAY                                  11.
A man in his sixties confronts Sayer with an announcement in a
loud commanding voice -
                       MALE PATIENT 1

           Kinasbridae, New York. I came

12.   INT. DAYROOM (C) - DAY                                     12.
Stepping around a wheelchair, Sayer finds in it an elderly
woman, nicely dressed, her hair done-up, a ribbon in it.
Glancing at the chart in his hand -
                     SAYER
           Mrs. Cohen?
                     MRS. COHEN
           He·s here?
She smiles, glances around. Sayer hesitates, uncertain who she
means.
                      SAYER
           I 'm here.
                 (pause)
           To examine you.
                      MRS. COHEN
           Oh, no, I ' m leaving today. My
           son's coming to take me home.

(6   Confused, Sayer tries to find a discharge form among the papers
     on the clipboard. Unsuccessful, he excuses himself from her
     and crosses the room to a nurse.
                           SAYER
                 Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen's son.
                 He's coming today?
                           NURSE 1
                 I wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't
                 for twenty years.
     The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen,
     trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his
     discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the
     ribbon from her hair.

     Silence. Institutional beige walls. Glass cabinets, locked,
     containing medical instruments. A metal examination table with
     leather straps.
     Sayer alone at one of three old desks in the large room, still
     unsettled from the experience with Mrs. Cohen. Eventually, he
     gets up, crosses to a window and tries to open it.
     It's jammed shut, painted shut perhaps, but finally gives way,
     sliding up. He lets the air from outside wash over his face as
     he stares out absently at children on an elementary school
     playground beyond a debris-strewn field.
                           MISS COSTELLO O.S.
                      (a matter of fact)
                 It gets easier.
     Sayer turns to the voice, to Miss Costello, the hospital's head
     nurse, a veteran of this place, a woman who has seen it all.
     She's standing in the doorway.
                           MISS COSTELLO
                 You don't think it will, but it
                 does.
     A moment and she A urns and leaves.

inner bands of a 78 . . .                                .*       .
Cold eggs and toast and prescription medicine on a kitchenette
table. A puddle of coffee on the floor. Ceramic shards, a
broken cup. .
An old woman on her knees, eyes closed, arms tangled in an
aluminum walker, limp and stiff at once somehow, like the limbs
of a discarded marionette. Beyond her, beyond a threshold, a
shuttered living room. Furniture from another era and the
clutter of a lifetime.
A shadowy figure in a wicker wheelchair near the Victrola.
Another old woman, with spindly limbs, profoundly afflicted and
preposterously still. The back of her head is flat and bald,
the result of lying supine upon it for much of several decades.
On her passive face rest round wire-rim glasses. Insane or
retarded and unaware of the dead woman, she mumbles, just
barely audibly, a melody.

16.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM/OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY
Distant music of children's laughter. Perhaps real, emanating
from outside; perhaps imagined, remembered, playing in a remote
region of the woman's damaged mind. Arrested of all movement,
she stares, transfixed, at the blades of a fan.
                      SAYER'S VOICE
           Do you know where you are?
                 (nothing back)

           here?
                 (nothing back)
           Do you know what has happened?
If she does, she gives no indication. No word or gesture. No
change of expression on her mask of a face. She is elsewhere
(or nowhere), cut adrift by her illness, living in a private
world (or hell).
                    SAYER'S VOICE
          Can you hear me?
Sayer, wearing a white lab coat, tries to read her eyes.
Behind thick lenses, uncleaned for weeks or months, the eyes
are inscrutable.                                         .   ··

Sayer reaches to her face and carefully pulls the glasses from
it. He cleans them with a flap of his lab coat -- they are
loose, bent out of shape*-- and gently slides the temples back
over her ears.
He turns away from her and types at a manual Underwood. The
form in the machine, at the top, reads -- BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL /
ADMISSIONS / CONSULTATION REQUEST / NEUROLOGY. Sayer types in
a lower section headed -- FINDINGS / DIAGNOSIS.
He turns back in his chair to find the woman doubled-over in
her wheelchair, one arm very close to the floor, the hand
clutching the glasses. She is not moving, but she has moved.
That, or she is dead.
Sayer rights her, takes the glasses from her hand and slips
them back onto her face. He studies her for a moment, and for
that moment remains as still, as entranced, as her.
He takes the glasses from her face again and sets them on the
floor. He waits. She doesn't retrieve them. He picks them up
and holds them out to her. She doesn't move to take them. He
lets go of them and she lunges forward, catching them the
instant before they hit the floor. Sayer just stares.
                       SAYER«S VOICE

Dr. Kaufman, the hospital's Chief of Medicine, notices a number
of patients lined up in their wheelchairs as he passes them on
his way into Sayer's examination room -
                        SAYER'S VOICE
            She was found by neighbors with                               *
            her sister, several days after the ,
            sister had died . . .

17.    INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                       17.
The same room as before. The same woman. All that has changed
is the light. It's late afternoon.
                      SAYER (CONT'D)
           According to the neighbors,                                    *
           she's never set foot outside her                               *
           apartment, has no other living                                 *
           relatives, and has always been the                             *
           way she is now - without any                                   *
           comprehension or response.                                     *

Kaufman tries to feign interest. He glances to the others         1
Sayer has summoned to the room -- two other doctors, Tyler and
Sullivan, and Miss Costello.
                       SAYER
          And yet . . .
Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at
her. Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it.
And stays there, stiff, still.
Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufman's face is that
of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card
tricks. Dismissing the phenomenon --·
                       DR. KAUFMAN
          A reflex.
                    SAYER
          If she batted it away I might call
          that a reflex. She doesn't bat it
          away, she catches it.
                    DR. KAUFMAN
 -        It's still a reflex.
         ..·.    :        · ·' .· " .'
                     SAYER
          I'm sorry, if you were right I'd
          agree with you.
Kaufman, understandably, takes some offense at the comment.
Sayer, however, is unaware that he has caused any.
                     SAYER
          It's as if . . . having lost all
          will of her own on which to act,
          she borrows the will of the ball.
Awkward silence.    Eventually--
                     DR. TYLER
          The "will of the ball?"
                       .
Sayer nods. Kaufman and the other doctors concur with glances
that the theory and theorist are absurd.
                       DR. SULLIVAN
          Excuse me.
Sullivan has better things to do and leaves the room.   So does
Tyler. Kaufman and Miss Costello remain.

                                 DR. KAUFMAN                                 .       I
                            (hopefully)
                      You're trying to make a good
                      impression. That's it, isn't it?
                      You're still settling in.
           Sayer isn't sure if he should agree or not.   He does neither.
                                DR. KAUFMAN
                      Miss Costello, you'll see that Dr.
                      Saver's patients waiting out there
                      are rescheduled for tomorrow?
                                  MISS COSTELLO
                      Yes, sir.
                                 DR. KAUFMAN
                      Good night.
           Sayer watches Kaufman leave. So does Miss Costello. Lucy,
           looking less like a woman than a Diane Arbus photograph of one,
           doesn't.

                      Five.
           Just as he's depressing the accelerator, someone raps on his
           window. He slams on the brakes. Miss Costello's face appears
           at the window. Recovering, Sayer rolls it down.
                                SAYER
                     What'd I forget?
                               MISS COSTELLO
                     I just wanted to say to you I
                     preferred your explanation.
    ()   It's unclear whether he knows what she's referring to.

                         MISS COSTELLO
               And that I'll look after things
               for you until you've "settled in."
               Good night, doctor.
    She leaves. He stares blankly out after her, then at his
    dashboard. To it eventually, quietly --
                            SAYER
               Thank you . . .
    He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away
    toward her car. To the reflection --
                          SAYER
               Thank you very much.

    Sayer at a table eating dinner alone. He should've brought
    along something to read. He glances at the little "Catch of

    in at an eel in a fish tank, which seems to be peering back out
    at him.

Sayer nods in agreement though he is not altogether as certain
of tne claim. They are in a ward crowded with many patients
who are mad, obviously and irretrievably so.
                     SAYER
           What did the voice say?
                     SIDNEY
           "Mr. Titch, get your coat and hat,
           go up to the roof and jump off."

23.CONT,                       (continuity only)
Sidney turns to a patient, an elderly woman in a wheelchair
beside him. Her state resembles that of Lucy's, that is, she
appears to have no awareness of Sidney, Sayer, or anything else
in her environment. It is only now, in fact, as Sidney spoons
soup into her mouth, careful not to spill any, that Sayer
notices her.

      He glances around. Sees an orderly reading a newspaper.
(P\   Borrows a section, returns with it, slides it under the pen and
       waits. The man doesn't write. Doesn't move.
      Sayer takes the pen back, returns it to his coat pocket,
      hesitates, pulls it out again, holds it out . . . and lets it go.
      The man, lightning quick, catches it.

      25.   INT. ANOT HE R DAYRO OM ( B) - L ATE R - DAY                           2 5.

      Another man rigid as stone (FRANK). This one peering up at a
      television set with a horizontal hold problem.
      Sayer drags a chair over, stands       on it, adjusts the set,
      corrects it, gets a picture . . .      but the man's "attention"
      slowly drifts away. Sayer "read       justs" it, gets the jumping
      horizontal lines again, and the       man's vacant eyes return.

      26.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY                                . 26.
      Another dayroom crowded with patients, one of which stands
      before a table, absolutely motionless, on thin bird-like legs.
      It is Lucy, the one who caught/the tennis ball. The movement
      of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness.
       Sayer considers her from all      angles as    one considers an
       abstract art piece that baff     les but in   trigues. Unlike the
      others, she's on her feet. A      nd unlike    the others, she seems,
      to Sayer, to have been headed      somewhere    before turning to stone
      again.

      He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain
      across the room. And that it's the table, like a barrier, that
      has arrested her progress. He moves the table.
      In what appears to be slow motion, she takes a tiny step. And
      another. And another before encountering and being "blocked"
      by an empty wheelchair. She stops.
      Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her
      path. She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the
      fountain before mysteriously stopping again.
      Sayer studies the puzzle ... there are no longer any barriers
      in her way, but she's not moving. Defeated, he goes to the
      fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her.
      Across the room, a man in a wheelchair, another "ghost"
      (LEONARD), stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive.
      "At" Sayer.

                    BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL / ADMISSIONS
                           STATE OF NEW YORK
    A typed date / AUGUST 2, 1929. The admitting physician's name.
    The patient's name. And age / 15. An identification number
    and ward assignment number.
    As Sayer pulls the folder and closes the drawer of one of
    several filing cabinets lining the walls of a claustrophobic
    room, Miss Costello slides open another, locates a particular
    folder in it and in the folder another admitting form -- The
    date / MAY 7, 1932. Names and numbers.
    Another drawer. Sayer pulling another folder. Another
    admission form ~ Date / DECEMBER 12, 1930. Age of the patient
    / 22.

                                                                      28

    The files spread out on a table. Sayer and Miss Costello
    leafing through them.                    .
                                             .
    Sayer considers one's original admission forms. He scans
    bodies of text and finds a diagnosis -- ATYPICAL SCHIZOPHRENIA.
    He sets it aside and picks up another.
                         MISS COSTELLO
               "Atypical Hysteria," this one.
    Sayer nods to himself and keeps reading his. He eventually
    finds in its text -- ATYPICAL RABIES. He flips to the end of
    the file. "No change since last examination" it reads. He
    turns the page. "No change, no therapy recommended." He turns
    the page, the last entry. "No change." The date, "11/9/44."
                         SAYER
              There must be more recent files we
              missed somehow. "Part Twos" to
              their medical histories.

                      One would think that after a point
                      enough atypical somethings would
                      amount to a typical something.
                      But a typical "what?"
            Miss Costello, no doubt, has less of an idea than Sayer what
            the "what" could be.
                                 MISS COSTELLO
        ,            Doctor . . . would you like      to g e t a

                       only I've made other plans . . .
            She nods quickly.    She seems, strangely, relieved.

                    OLD DOCTOR                .
          I believe you when you say some
          still live. But I can assure you
          they're medically irrelevant. As
          they were thirty years ago when I
          fought to get my work published.
He smiles at a thought, at once wistful and bitter.
                    OLD DOCTOR
          That's the problem with a unique
          disease. Once it no longer rages,
          I'm telling you, it becomes very
          unfashionable.         .
He buries his face into his mask, manages to get some deep
breaths into his lungs and shakes his head at Sayer.

                    OLD DOCTOR
          How many have you found there?
                    SAYER
          Five. So far. I think there may
          be more.
The old doctor nods. He has the torn look of someone reminded
of an unfaithful lover just when he'd managed to forget about
her. He wants and doesn't want to know how they're doing.
Finally --
                    OLD DOCTOR
          How are they?
                   SAYER
         As you described them. As they
         were back then. As "insubstantial
         as ghosts." Only I guess most of
         them were children then.
                     OLD DOCTOR
          Yes.   Children who fell asleep.

    Boxes of ancient history have been dragged out of storage, the
    emphysema-plagued doctor's post-encephalitic research, files

               Most died during the acute stage
               of the illness, during a sleep so
               deep they couldn't be roused. A
               sleep that in most cases lasted
               several months.
    The doctors, in the dark, watch forty year old footage
    projected onto a screen by a pre-World War II Bell & Howell -
    a motionless man in a chair, his head thrust back, mouth gaping
    open, arms suspended out from an emaciated torso as if from
    invisible strings.
                        OLD DOCTOR
              Those who survived, who awoke,
              seemed fine, as though nothing had
              happened. Years went by - five,
              ten, fifteen - before anyone
              suspected they were not well. .
              They were not.
    A doctor, this doctor decades younger, appears beside the
    subject on the screen and lowers the man's arms.
                        OLD DOCTOR
              I began to see them in the early
              1930's - old people brought in by
              their children, young people
              brought in by their parents - all
              of them complaining they weren't
              "themselves" anymore. They'd
              grown distant, aloof, anti-social,
              they daydreamed at the dinner
              table. I referred them to
              psychiatrists.
    The man on the screen disappears and is replaced by a seal-
    shaped woman in whom a hundred strange diseases seem to reside.
    They conspire against her, torment and harass her, force her to
    perform incessant and meaningless actions with her hands, to
    paw her chin, to flutter, to adjust glasses that aren't there.

    possess it any more than Sayer does. Long silence before:

41.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY
Sayer has assembled them all, the fourteen or fifteen he has
decided are post-encephalitics, and wanders among them like a
naturalist in a garden of stone.
He lifts an arm of one particularly remote male patient.   It
remains suspended, doll-like.
He tries to follow the trajectory of another's gaze.   It leads
 only to blank space.
He considers another who appears "deeply involved" in some
minute and curious activity with his twisted hands, a kind of
tearing, shredding motion.

Across the room, paying no attention to Sayer, are Sidney and
Lolly. He's gently brushing her hair.
Sayer manages a pen into the hand of another woman and she
"draws" a kind a kind of circular shape that spirals in on
itself until it reaches a "vanishing point" in the center.

The results of standard perception tests scotch-taped to a wall

Sayer and Miss Costello, like visitors to a museum, consider
each for a moment before moving onto the next.
Printed in the left column of each are a circle, square,
triangle and daisy. In the right are the post-encephalitics'
failed "attempts" to copy them.

                                              REV. 10/13/83   p.26
Sayer keeps coming back to one in particular. Unlike the
others which, if you use your imagination, vaguely correspond
somewhat positionally to the pre-printed shapes, this one bears
no resemblance. This patient has instead scrawled over the
shapes, seemingly violently.
Miss Costello joins Sayer and ponders it along with him.
Eventually, as if to excuse it and its maker--
                     MISS COSTELLO
           It's different.
                      SAYER
           Quite.   It's quite bad.
Sayer keeps studying it.
                    SAYER
               (more to himself)
          Did he fail to understand? Or was
          he unwilling to fail?
He isn't really asking her to answer, which is fine with her
since she doubts equally both hypotheses.
                    SAYER
          Could he be saying, "I can't draw
          a triangle, don't make me"?
               (before she can
                respond:)
          Could it be willfully bad?
She doesn't say it but it's clear she thinks Sayer is reading
far too much into the "badness" of the patient's scrawl. To
himself -
                    SAYER

He leans closer to see the typed name . . .

for the Western painting that's missing, nothing has changed in
it in thirty years.

He slowly got worse. He'd be
talking, suddenly he'd come to a
stop. After a few seconds he'd
finish what he was saying like
nothing happened, but these
standstills got longer. Sometimes
he'd call to me and I'd come in
and find him at his desk in a
trance. An hour, two hours. Then
he'd be okay again.

           "What do you want, Leonard?"
She pictures the moment in her mind, and waits, it seems, for
the young Leonard to speak, to tell her what it is he wants.
Finally she lowers her arm and shrugs.

           he'd disappeared. I took him to

A monkey flipping switches on a panel built into a laboratory
room, searching for a sequence.
In an observation booth, years of collected data - charts and
graphs, EEG's and notes.

There, Dr. Mann, a contemporary of Sayer's, stares at Sayer      Ay
curiously. Eventually he manages --
                    MANN
          When you say you're working with
          people, you don't mean living
          people.                               (


                    SAYER
          Living people, yes. Patients.
Mann just stares. He's a scientist, they both are, and the
idea of Sayer working with living people, rather than expired
ones laid out on the pathology table, is inconceivable to him.
                    MANN
               (fearing the answer)
          Where?
                     SAYER
          It's in The Bronx. It's a poor
          private chronic hospital called
          M ou nt --
                    MANN
               (appalled)
           Oh, Malcolm, Malcolm, come back,
           come on. You're a benchman,
          you're no clinician, why would you
          lower yourself?
Sayer hasn't an answer for him.           »·
                    SAYER
          How's Hank?
                    MANN
          How's Hank? He's great, he's
          brilliant, look at him.
Sayer glances away to Hank the monkey, watches him. Mann
studies Sayer, chagrined and incredulous.
                    MANN
          A physician? You?
He slaps him angrily across the shoulders with some papers.
The monkey completes a complex sequence which opens a chamber
revealing an electric train. The animal jumps and hoots with
wild glee. Sayer reaches out and presses the button on the
stop watch dangling from Mann's neck.
                     SAYER
           Subtract two seconds off his
          time.

Rats in cages, wired up, manipulating elaborate series of
ladders and pulleys, traversing catwalks, or ratwalks, leading
to glucose rewards.
While Mann, with something less than great enthusiasm,
considers an EEG Sayer has brought, his monkey drags toys over
to Sayer and tries to engage him in play. One of the toys is
an Ouija Board.
                      MANN
                (to, Sayer)
          Don't look at me like that. It's
          for his alphabet lessons.
                (to the monkey)
          We're busy, Hank, go play
          solitaire.
The monkey obediently goes off in search of a deck of cards.
Gesturing at patterns on the EEG --
                    MANN
           Asleep. First stage normal.
           Second a little dull. Normal

He shrugs, lays out a second EEG, and gestures at patterns on
it --
                     MANN
          Awake. Slightly erratic. No more
          so than a lot of people walking
          the streets of New York.
                (shrugs again)
          I give up, what's wrong with him?
                      SAYER
          You have them backwards. This is
          him awake . . .
                (points to one EEG;
                 then the other)
          This is him asleep.

Mann thinks Sayer is kidding. He isn't.
                    MANN
          This is him awake? This is him
          asleep?
Sayer nods. Mann tries, without success, to make some sort of
sense out of that.

                    MANN
          What are you saying? When he's
          awake, what, he's dreaming?
                     SAYER
          When there's any brain activity at
          all, which is infrequent, yes.
          Dreaming or hallucinating.
                      MANN
          And when he's asleep . . . ?
                     SAYER
          When he's asleep he manages to
          create a kind of reality. What we
          might call reality.
                     MANN
          That's what you think these say?
                     SAYER
          1 don't know.
Mann studies the "waking" EEC     He points to its one and only
large electrical peak.                     ;

                    MANN
          What's this peak? Strobe?
                    SAYER
          No. This is the strobe.
Sayer indicates a flat section of the pattern where there is
scribbled in pencil a small "s."
                       SAYER
          This . . .
  ,               (the large peak,
                   marked with an "L")                /
          . . . is me saying his name to him.
Mann stares rather dumbly at Sayer. Then at Hank the monkey on
the floor dealing solitaire.

49. INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY                                  49
Tight on Leonard. Something blurs past him but his eyes don't
follow it. Pulling back, the object blurs by again from the
other direction.
Tight on Sayer. The thing blurs past his face. His eyes don't
follow it either. Pulling back, it blurs again.

                                               REV. 10.13/89 p.33
A circle of patients in wheelchairs. The post-encephalitics
reunited. "Waking" just long enough to catch and release the
object, a small beach ball.
Leonard and Sayer, on opposite sides of the circle, ignoring
the ball and the other patients. He's reached a dead end,
Sayer, right where he began, his only "accomplishment,"
this, ball-catching patients.

50.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY                                   50.
Sayer alone in the examination room, tired, at its window
staring blankly out.
His perspective: The empty lot below littered with abandoned
couches, refrigerators, rusting automobile carcasses.
And beyond the lot, the elementary school playground. Laughing
children on swings and slides. Jumping rope. Batting tether
balls. Playing hopscotch.
Moving slowly in on one of the hopscotch games. On a girl
tossing a bean bag into a square. Jumping over it and into the
next square. Turning and jumping back. Balancing on one foot.
Retrieving the bean bag and tossing it down again. Into the
next square of the tile pattern chalked on the asphalt.

51.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY                                  51.
From above, patients in wheelchairs dot the black and white
checkerboard linoleum-tile floor like chess pieces. The
pattern is regular to a point but then breaks up -- is
interrupted by an area of solid white, where a wall once stood
-- before being restored. It forms a kind of narrow "sea," the
white area, on either side of which lies "land."

At floor level Sayer and Miss Costello, on their hands and
knees, are "blacking in" the missing tiles with shoe polish,
"bridging" the gap between the two checkerboards. The retarded
patients around them ignore them. The ward nurses pretend to. '
Completing the pattern Sayer glances across the room to
Leonard. He seems to be "watching." His mother, nearby, idly
thumbing through a magazine as she brings Leonard up to date on
neighborhood news, isn't.
                                     ·t,   .

Sayer crosses to Lucy. Lifts her gently out of her chair.
Points her in the direction of the drinking fountain.
She begins to move. To step slowly over each tile. She
reaches the "bridge" and hesitates. Then crosses it.

                                                REV. 10/13/89   p.34
Sayer doesn't know whether to applaud or cry. He does neither,
burying his emotions behind a professional mask instead, and
watches as Lucy, "delivered" to the other side, free now, lets
the regularity of the pattern guide her toward the fountain.
She nears it. She is almost there. Then she is. there. But
doesn't drink. Doesn't stop. She continues past it . . .
To a window, the window bevond the drinking fountain which
Sayer hadn't noticed before, had no reason to notice, had no
need to notice, with a broken pane allowing a view to the
outside.
She stares out at the traffic below, in hopes no doubt of
figuring out where she is.
And Sayer's eyes, behind which exhilaration and horror rise up,
shift from her to Miss Costello, and then to Leonard, in whose
mask of a face Sayer thinks he sees a faint glimmer.
These people are alive inside.

                                                                       52
52.   INT. DAYROOM (B) - DAY
A soap opera on a portable black and white TV in a narrow
passageway of a nurses' station. Beyond.it, beyond a glass
partition, a crowded idle dayroom.
Miss Costello crosses into and out of view and reappears
moments later next to the TV. She switches it off and turns to
face the three RNs who were watching it. In their defense --
                                            V
                     NURSE
           The patients have all been given
           their morning medication.
                     MISS COSTELLO
           Good. Dr. Sayer was hoping you'd
           have some free time.
She hands a book to the nurse who spoke (MARGARET), a first
edition worn /rom many readings. Margaret glances from it to
the other nurses and back to Miss Costello.

53.   INT. DAYROOM (B) - LATER - DAY                                   53
The nurse holds the book like it's something quite foreign to
her. She finds the beginning of the first chapter, clears her
throat, and reads --
                       MARGARET
           "Call me . . . Ish-ma-el . . .

She glances up at her audience: three blank-faced post-          ,55
encephalitics. Miss Costello, who is nearby, nods to her to
continue. She clears her throat again, and, feeling like a
fool, reads --
                       MARGARET
           "Some years ago, never mind how
           long precisely, having little or
           no money in my purse, and nothing
           particular to interest me on
           shore, I thought I would sail
           about a little and see the watery
           part of the world . . . "
Miss Costello leaves.

                                                                     54
54.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
Leonard's head locked on his shoulders at an improbable angle
that forces his entranced gaze upward to a point well above
Sayer.
                     SAYER
           Can you hear me, Leonard? I want
           to hear you speak your name. :

 Sayer waits . . . but Leonard remains mute.

classical collection.

An.old box-style phonograph. The kind whose top is also a

An orderly, Fernando, dusts it off, rigs it, takes the record
Miss Costello holds out to him, gets it spinning, and sets the
needle down.

imperceptibly.                         -.

unmanageable penny arcade cranes.

The moment Fernando takes the record off, Rose stops eating,
stops moving. The orderly puts on Mozart and waits. Neither
patient moves.

           Leonard?

68.   INT. LEONARD'S WARD - LATER - NIGHT                               68.
In a far corner of the darkened ward, in a pool of lamp light,
two silhouetted figures. Sayer and Leonard. Sleeping patients
all around them.
Sayer carefully, awkwardly, places   his hand on Leonard's.
After a moment, the contact brings   the useless appendage "to
life." As it slowly turns over and   grasps the doctor's hand, a
glimmer of life seems to appear in   Leonard's eyes as well.
Sayer, unfamiliar, it seems, with the feeling the contact
produces in him, nonetheless places his other hand on Leonard's
other. Soon it too turns and holds onto Sayer's.
The doctor draws both of Leonard's hands toward him and sets
them down on the pointer of an Ouija Board.
                     SAYER
           I'll begin moving the pointer
           toward the "L." For "Leonard."
           Once I feel you beginning to move
           it, I'll stop and you'll take .
           over. Do you understand?
 Leonard, of course, cannot say whether he does or not. The
look on his face is "thoughtful." The look on Sayer's, hopeful
and foolish.
                       SAYER
           I'm beginning . . .
The pointer begins to slowly move past stars and moons.
Judging from Sayer's expression he begins to feel Leonard's
movement of it and, presumably, stops his own.
                      SAYER
          Yes, good . . .
The pointer moves across the letters, but passes the "L"
without stopping. It stops on the "R."
                    SAYER
          No. No, I didn't make myself
          clear. My fault. I . . .     .
The pointer begins moving again, "interrupting" Sayer.      It
passes the "L" again, reaches the "I" and stops.
                                                                       ..
                      SAYER                                      '    ".,
           No. No, I . . .                                  .     .

                                                REV. 10/13/89   p.40
 But the pointer is moving again.      It stops on the "L."
                      SAYER
            Yes. Yes. That's what I meant. .
            "L." Good. Now the "E."
 It begins moving again. But not to the "E." To the nK," where
 it hesitates briefly before moving again.
                        SAYER
                   (realizing, to
                    himself)
            . . . you're spelling something
            el e . . .
              s
Keeping one hand on the moving pointer, Sayer fumbles a pen
from his shirt pocket and scribbles on his lab coat what
Leonard has and is continuing to "write":
            RILKESPA

69.    INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT
Sayer alone in the examining room, standing over his desk.           The
lab coat is on it. And on it is scrawled:
             RILKESPANTHERILKE
He has to study it only a moment before he sees the meaning of
it; he quickly scratches out the last four letters,and adds a
slash between the "S" and the "P," so that it reads:

titled: LEVADOPA     IN THE TREATMENT OF PARKINSONISM. Below it:

There's excitement (and jealousy) in the air.

An anatomical skeleton dangling from a metal stand.
                     NEUROCHEMIST
           There's an ordinary medicine with
           which we are all familiar. An
           everyday medicine of stubbed toes
           and bunions and boils.

          And then there is another kind.
          A medicine that holds out to the
          afflicted the promise of restored
          life.
He glances to a point above his listeners, and an overhead
projector splashes a diagram of molecular structure (and the
silhouette of a raised hand) onto a screen. The neurochemist
traces the shadow to its maker in the audience.
                     SAYER
           Thank you. Yes. Yes, I'm very
           much interested in your work with
           this drug. I'm curious if . . .

          After I'm through, Dr. Sayer.      If
          you wouldn't mind.
Sayer glances around the auditorium. Everyone's looking at
him. He grasps the offending hand and holds it in his lap with
the other.

75.   INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - LATER - AFTERNOON                  75,
Refreshments on tables. Sayer, uncomfortable in his suit,
wandering around the crowded room with a glass of wine. He
approaches its hub of activity, the neurochemist surrounded by
several impressed colleagues, but can't manage to get close
enough to speak with him.

76.   INT. MEN'S ROOM, AUDITORIUM - LATER - AFTERNOON             7
The neurochemist walks in and crosses to the urinals. A moment
later, he hears the door opening, and footsteps, and then
nothing, until --
                       SAYER O.S.
           Do you   think it's possible that
           simple   Parkinsonian tremor taken
           to its   furthest extreme could
           appear   as no tremor at all?
When no one answers, the chemist glances over his shoulder.
Sayer is there, quite alone, looking at him.
                     NEUROCHEMIST
           Are you speaking to me?
Sayer is. And really wants to know the answer. The chemist
zips up and moves to the sinks to wash his hands.
                    SAYER
          If jail the compulsions in the
          Parkinson's patient were somehow

          tics, the head bobbing, the
          quickening speech -
               (he's become a mass       »
                of tics and
                accelerated speech)
          - might they not cave in on
          themselves and, in effect, turn
          the person into stone?
He comes to a abrupt stop, his eyes transfixed like a post-
encephalitic's, staring. The chemist slowly dries his hands
with a paper towel.
                    NEUROCHEMIST
          Dr. Sayer, yes?
               (Sayer nods)
          I'm a chemist, doctor. I leave it
          to you guys to do the damage.
He drops the paper towel into the trash and leaves

He hands over the papers - xeroxed articles from medical
journals and newspapers which Sayer gave him to read - and
keeps going, Sayer straggling a few steps back.
                     SAYER
           With all due respect, I think it's

           With all due "respect," it's
           rather way too soon. Let the
           chemists do the damage.
The gap between them widens as Sayer slows. He expected this
sort of reaction from Kaufman, but had hoped for another.
Kaufman disappears into the building.

77A. INT. KAUFMAN'S OFFICE - LATER - MORNING                       77A

Kaufman, on the phone, glances to Sayer long-sufferingly, lets
him wait while he finishes with his call, and eventually sets
down the receiver.

           Sayer doesn't elaborate, but his tone is resolute. And it has
           the intended effect on Kaufman, causing him to consider the
           possibility that Sayer could, somehow, know it as a fact.

           change, or reminiscence, long ago, long buried, of things he
           once believed or wanted to believe.

                People with ordinary Parkinson's
                Disease sometimes complain that
                they've "lost their grace . . . "
                      (he picks up a cup
                       with a shaking hand)
                They have to think about the
                things we just do . . .
                      (with great "trouble"
                       he sets it down)
                It has to do with a chemical in
                the midbrain, or rather the lack
                of it, called dopamine. L-Dopa
                replenishes this dopamine, making
                it possible for these patients
                to move more naturally.
    He picks up the cup again, gracefully, and sets it down.
                          MRS. LOWE
                Leonard has Parkinson's Disease?

     the while staring at the consent form.

                Let's say a hundred.
     Ray shrugs; it's okay with him. He knifes at the powder,
     removing all but 100 milligrams.

                     medicine in it which is why it may
                     taste more bitter than usual.
          Sayer glances to Mrs. Lowe. It's as if they've rehearsed it
          all. She holds the glass to her son's lips and gradually
          drains the liquid down his throat.
          Nothing immediately happens, of course, but they all, with the
          exception of Leonard, look as if they expect it to. Mrs. Lowe
          hands the empty glass back to Sayer.

Another empty milk glass. Leonard, stoic, or     so it seems, in
his wheelchair. His mother and Sayer and Miss     Costello waiting
for a movement, a change of expression, a sign    of any kind that
something is happening inside him. But there's   nothing . . .

Sayer asleep in the wheelchair. He stirs. Wakes. And takes a
moment to remind himself where he is. And why. His eyes
narrow, uncomprehending.
Leonard's bed is empty.

                                                                   9

A claw of a hand dragging a crayon across a sheet of paper.
Tight on Sayer, framed in a doorway, as still and silent and
entranced as a post-encephalitic.
His perspective of the dayroom -- deserted except for a figure,
a patient, Leonard, hunched over the table.
As Sayer crosses toward him, Leonard's head slowly rises.
Sayer sits opposite him and they consider each other in silence
for several moments.
Leonard struggles to speak, to form words. They come out in a
halting cadence, flat, without inflection, and are only barely .
recognizable as words:                   .
                     LEONARD
           It's quiet.

                     SAYER
          No.   You're awake.
Though he nods, it's unclear whether Leonard realizes how
significant that is. Sayer gestures at the piece of paper
beneath Leonard's hands.
                        SAYER
          May I?
Sayer draws the paper across the table. It's covered with what
seems imponderable hieroglyphic-like scrawl. But there is
order in the chaos. Letters. Leonard's name.
                        LEONARD
          Me.

Alone in the room, Leonard moves slowly around it, feeling
things: the smoothness of the cabinet glass/ the warmth thrown
by a desk lamp, water from the cooler splashing onto his hand.
                       SAYER O.S.
            Leonard?
Leonard turns to Sayer's voice with an expression of child-like       ,
wonder on his face.
                      SAYER
            Your mother is here.
She appears in the doorway of the room. She's done her hair,
her face, she's put on a nice dress, yet she remains unprepared
for this reunion. She can do nothing but stare at her "infant
son" who is now, "suddenly," a man.
As he slowly crosses toward her, she is struck by the fact she
must look u£ in order to meet his eyes. He reaches her.
Reaches out to her. And she embraces him.

            pleasure to meet you.
Leonard, standing, reaches for her hand and struggles to
pronounce her name correctly. Fighting to keep from crying in
front of him, Miss Costello glances to Sayer and Mrs. Lowe.

                                                                    93.

    the "music orderly." They shake hands.

    A tray of truly awful cafeteria food. The group, minus Sayer
    and Miss Costello, watches Leonard dip a fork into some mush-
    like concoction and manipulate it, with difficulty, to and into
    his mouth. He seems amazed by its flavor.
                         LEONARD
               It's delicious.
                         FERNANDO
               I wouldn't go that far, Len.
    Sayer and Miss Costello, at another table, glance over to the
    others who are all laughing. Sayer smiles.
                         MISS COSTELLO
               I don't think I could deal with
               losing 3D years of my life. I

Sayer's smile fades. The possibility that Leonard might not
have realized the extent of the passage of time had not, until
 this moment, occurred to him. He stares blankly at Miss
 Costello.
                     MISS COSTELLO
           He does realize it, doesn't he?
Sayer nods uncertainly.
                       SAYER
           He must.

Sayer demonstrates a clapping motion. Leonard repeats it more
slowly but with decent motor control.


                       SAYER
           Splendid.
Sayer makes a note. They are alone in the examination room
which, like most of the hospital, has little in it to indicate
that it is not the 1930's.

Leonard walks slowly across the room past the perception tests
and notes and Polaroids cluttering the wall. Coming back, he
pauses. He's looking at a picture of himself taped there.
Sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel
his features. He stares at the photograph of himself, trying
to comprehend that which cannot be comprehended.
He's not younjg anymore.

      just that way. He excuses himself, leaving Leonard with his

                 Do you know if Leonard's awake?

      She smiles and points toward the adjoining examination room.

      101.   INT. THE EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING                                              101.
      Showered and shaved and groomed and bright-eyed, Leonard sits
      listening to his own heartbeat with Sayer's stethoscope.
      Coming in --
                    i      SAYER
                 Good morning.
                          LEONARD
                Good morning.     .
      His speech is still rather flat, halting.,
                           SAYER
                 Been waiting for me long?
                              LEONARD
                Yes.

                                                      REV. 10/13/89 p.55

      Sayer smiles.    He hands Leonard the books.   History books. An
      almanac.
                           SAYER
                Some things have happened while
                you've been away. I thought you'd
                be interested.
      Leonard opens one carefully, reverently, and begins reading
      from it to himself.
                           SAYER
                 You don't have to read them now,
                 Leonard. They're yours. At your
                 leisure.
      Leonard closes the book but holds onto it and the others like
      they're gold.
                          LEONARD
                I used to read quite a lot.
                                                                  .

                Yes, I know.      .
                           LEONARD
                Thank you for these.
            i                       .
      Sayer nods that he's welcome.
                           SAYER
                Have you thought about what you'd
                like to do today?
                           LEONARD
                Everything.
                           SAYER
                      (smiles)
                I'm not sure I can arrange that.
                            LEONARD
                Try.
      Sayer smiles again. For a man who just yesterday learned he
      has been cheated out of the greater"- part of his life, Leonard
      seems to have recovered extraordinarily.
                          SAYER

          I'd like to go outside.

101A. EXT. BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL - DAY                              101A
Sayer and Leonard emerge from the hospital and move under trees
along a path toward the parking lot. At a point, the doctor
realizes his patient is no longer at his side; he's several
steps back, feeling the sunshine on his skin.

      Though it is only a Toyota, its dashboard, to Leonard,
      resembles something out of Jules Verne. He allows Sayer to
      buckle his seatbelt for him and watches with fascination as
      Sayer performs the "complex" preparatory sequence necessary,
      apparently, to make the car go.
      The car pulls away. Above, framed in a second story window of
      one of the buildings, stands a lone figure looking out --
      Leonard's mother.

      Tight on the radio. Sayer switches it on. To Leonard's
      amazement, classical music fills the interior

      and CONTINUES OVER:

      104.   EXT. THE BRONX - MOVING SHOTS - MORNING                     104
      Billboards advertising color televisions and electric shavers.
      Buses which have grown over the decades to a behemoth scale.
      "Ultra-modern" housing projects and gas stations.
      "Futuristic" cars.
      Leonard cannot imagine a more enthralling re-introduction to
      the world and stares at it all with wonder. Everywhere he
      looks there is something "extraordinary."
                           LEONARD
                 What a wonderful place The Bronx
                 has become.
      The music CONTINUES OVER:

      Leonard puts his face close to it to appreciate its fragrance.
      He touches its petals gently, explores them, and is quietly
      astonished by the tactile sensation.
      Sayer watches. He, too, can appreciate wonders of the real
      world, especially those of a botanical nature, but not with, the
      purity or intensity Leonard can.
      Pulling back reveals them in the middle of a vast garden of
      countless thousands of roses.

106.   INT. SAYER'S CAR - MOVING - DAY                            106
Leonard turns the radio dial from the classical station to
another playing a very different kind of music, and listens to
it bemused but intrigued. It's John Lennon singing "A DAY IN
THE LIFE"
and it CONTINUES OVER:

107.   EXT. PARK - THE BRONX - LATER - DAY                        107
Children playing flag-football on an expanse of grass. Dogs
running around, nannies with prams, lovers.
A disk, a frisbee, falls at Leonard's feet. He retrieves it
but has no idea what it is or what to do with it. Sayer
demonstrates the wrist action with an invisible one. Leonard
doesn't get it. Sayer takes it from him and flings it
pathetically not halfway back to its owners.
The music CONTINUES OVER:

108.   EXT. STREET CORNER JOINT - THE BRONX - LATER - DAY        108.
Leonard watches with interest a Carvel ice cream machine. He
and Sayer are handed cones and Leonard's attention moves to a
girl wearing an unbelievably short skirt.
Her boyfriend stares at Leonard. Sayer tries to pull his
charge's attention elsewhere. Leonard, finally, glances away,
up, to a sound overhead.
The music CONTINUES OVER:

                                                                  109

A 747 roaring down a runway. At the edge of it, it lifts off
and thunders over Sayer and Leonard and the parked Toyota.
Exhilerated, Leonard waves.

    Tea bags steeping in a pot on a cluttered kitchen counter.
    Sayer, exhausted from the day, hunts in vain through packing
    boxes on the floor for crackers, cookies, something he can
    offer his guest.
    He keeps glancing in at Leonard, who's wandering around the
    dining room, navigating around packing boxes, to browse at the
    spines of books. Noticing Sayer watching -
                          LEONARD
               You just moved here.
                         SAYER
               Yeah. Well, five years ago.                                 ,
    Sayer shrugs, disappears into the kitchen a moment . . . before            ;
    peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now: a small             i
    framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn
    expression posed in front of a curtain; the boat obviously a
    photography studio prop.

                          SAYER
               I probably was.
    Sayer disappears into the kitchen again. And a moment later
                                                                               .

    over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are
    neatly arranged.                   ·

    As Leonard considers each pair of glasses ...
                          SAYER
               Those are my normal interior
               glasses. And spare pair. Those,
               I wear outside. Two pairs, in
               case I los.e one. Those, those are
               my daytime reading glasses. And
               spare. Those are for close work.
               For fine print. Those are my
               nighttime reading glasses -

    Leonard's examining the frames of this last pair closely.
                         SAYER
               That's heavy-gauge metal so when I
               fall asleep and roll over on them
               I don't wreck them. They're
               indestructible.
    Leonard returns the indestructible ones to their proper place
    and considers them all together.
                         SAYER
               As long as I pretty much know
               ahead of time what I'll be looking '
               at, it works out, I don't have to
               carry all five pairs around.
                         LEONARD
               What if you just want to go for a
               walk?
                          SAYER
                     (pause)
               Walks are a problem. Walks are
               the hardest thing. You just never
               know.
    He's absolutely serious, like a man plagued for years by an
    imponderable dilemma. He retreats back into his kitchen before
    reappearing again with the pot of tea, two mismatched cups and
    some saltine% on a tray.
                         SAYER

           I can date my interest in science

           sent off to boarding school - a
           place perhaps not quite as
           Dickensian as I remember it - when
           I happened to come across the
           periodic table of elements.
                 (smiles at the
                  thought)
           I memorized it. Which I admit was
           a rather precocious thing for a
           seven year old to do. And I
           remember feeling . . . not so much a
           sense of accomplishment . . . as
           comfort. The halogens were what
           they were. The alkali metals were
           what they were. Each element had
           its place, and nothing could                                    *
           change that. They were secure, no                               *

 understanding. Sayer nods too, feeling, perhaps, a little             *
 exposed.

clock somewhere. Then, very matter of factly -

           I'm not terribly good with people.
           I like them. I wish I could say I
           had more than a rudimentary
           understanding of them.

           Maybe if they were less
           unpredictable . . .

               To put them all on the dosage Mr.
               Lowe is on . . . about twenty
               thousand dollars.
     Kaufman stares at Sayer aghast. He knew L-Dopa was expensive,
     but not that expensive. He manages to recover somewhat.
                         KAUFMAN
               That would be for how long?
                         SAYER
               About a month.
                          KAUFMAN
               A month?
     Sayer nods. Kaufman glances away.   Stares blankly at faces at
     other tables. Back to Sayer.
                          KAUFMAN
               I can't go before the board with
               that. I could . . .


     He laughs to himself at the futility of it.
                         SAYER
               I was thinking of speaking to the
               patrons.
                         KAUFMAN
               The few patrons this hospital has
               give what they can.
                         SAYER
               Well, we'd have to convince them
               to give more than they*re
               accustomed to giving.

     He hadn't intended as impudent a tone as that which came out.
     More calmly ~
                           SAYER
                Perhaps if they saw Mr. Lowe.
     . .;. ·· -; '     ..'·' ' : '. :..;. .,.-, '    ·'    "'    · ·' ·:
                           KAUFMAN
                I think you overestimate the
               effect Mr. Lowe has on people.
               We're talking about money here.
     Kaufman sips at his coffee and slowly becomes aware   of the
     silence around them. No one is talking. He glances    up as Miss
     Costello walks by setting something on the table in   front of
     him. She leaves the cafeteria without a word.

CD   Kaufman glances down. She has left a Bainbridge payroll check )\cz>
     made out in her name. Kaufman turns it over. She has endorsed
     it back to Bainbridge Hospital.
     Fernando walks by and    out, leaving his salary check on the
     table. Then Ray, the    pharmacist, leaving his. Then the nurse
     who reluctantly read    "Moby Dick" to the patients. Then a
     cafeteria worker. A     secretary. A clerk. A janitor.
     The cafeteria is soon empty, except for Sayer and Kaufman.
     Long silence.

     8mm film of Leonard before L-Dopa -- a wide shot of him
     absolutely motionless in his wheelchair.
                            SAYER O.S.
                There was extreme rigidity of the
                axial musculature . . . only vague
                available motion in the neck . . .
                no voluntary movement in the
                limbs . . .
     A tight shot of Leonard's entranced face appears on the screen.
                          SAYER O.S.
                Perhaps most striking was the
                profound facial masking -- which
                we now know should not have been
                confused with apathy.         *
     Tight on Sayer, the light from the projector flickering on his
     face.
                         SAYER
               Virtually aphonic, Mr. Lowe could
               articulate no words, but rather
               only, with considerable effort, an
               occasional noise, a kind of,
               "h .. . "
                A                                      ·
     In the darkness sit Kaufman, the rest of the Board of
     Directors, some elderly patrons of the hospital, and, near
     Sayer, Miss Costello. She hands him a scribbled note.
     "Less scientific" it reads.

                     SAYER
          Isolated circumstances -- the
          mention of his name, notes of
          particular pieces of music, the
          touch of another human being --
          managed on occasion to briefly
          summon him, but these awakenings
          were rare and transient, lasting
          only a moment or two.
Sayer glances to Miss Costello.   She nods, "Good, that's
better."
                      SAYER
          The rest of the time he remained
          in a profoundly eventless place ~
          deprived of all sense of history
          and happening and self --
          encysted, cocooned, enveloped in
          this metaphorical if not
          physiological equivalent of sleep
          . . . or death.
Tight on the screen, on Leonard, as he was. Looking more like
a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one.
                    SAYER
          This was his condition when first
          seen by me in a remote bay of this
          hospital. And the quality of his
          life for the last 30 years.
The "before picture" of Leonard on the screen is replaced with
the "after" -- his eyes alert, his hands exploring a desk
microphone. He glances up and off at something.
                      LEONARD (FILM)
          Now?
                    SAYER'S VOICE
          Whenever you're ready.
                     LEONARD (FILM)
          My name is Leonard Lowe. It has
          been explained to me that I have
          been away for . . . quite some
          time . . .
He seems to withdraw, to wrestle with the thought, to try to
somehow come to terms with it, to somehow resolve it. He nods
as he finds within himself some source of strength and looks
directly at the camera.
                      LEONARD (FILM)
          I'm back.

117.   INT. BOARD ROOM, LATER - NIGHT                            117
The lights are on, the screen rolled up, the board members and
patrons visibly moved, almost shaken, and silent.
Eventually one of the patrons, an old woman, reaches into her
purse for her checkbook and a pen. Another patron, an elderly
man, pulls a checkbook and pen from an inside jacket pocket.
Another already has hers out in front of her ...
Sayer and Miss Costello exchange a glance. The room is
absolutely silent, except for the muted scratch of pens on
paper.

                                                                 118.
118.   INT. THE PHARMACY - DAY
The raw L-Dopa powder, 20,000 dollars worth, has arrived. It
sits on a pharmacy counter in large clear bags. Sayer and Ray
peer between racks of medicine at two teenage girls and two
very old men chatting in a corner of the pharmacy.
                     RAY
           They're volunteers from the   :
           neighborhood.

Several empty medicine paper-cups. The "garden of stone,"
reassembled. Sayer knows better than to sit and wait, that
nothing is going to immediately happen, but he sits and waits
anyway. As does Miss Costello. As does Leonard and his
mother.

121.   INT. STAFF ROOM - NIGHT               .                   121
Sayer asleep on a couch that's too short for him. Miss
Costello asleep on another.

           Dr. Sayer?
Sayer wakes to find a night nurse standing over him.
                     SAYER
           What is it?

                                                                            ry

They move along a silent corridor that seems to stretch out
forever -- the doctor, the two nurses -- carrying themselves
professionally, with sobriety and restraint. But as they near
the ward, as they're joined by others, other nurses, orderlies,
their steps and hearts quicken. They break into a trot.

                                                                           122.
122.     INT. LEONARD'S WARD - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
They appear at the threshold, Sayer, Miss Costello, the night
nurse, the others, and peer into the darkened room:
In the quiet, in the shadows, in the moonlight filtering in
through the windows, the post-encephalitics are emerging from
their "cocoons," rising from the "dead" like Lazarus from the
earth, reborn.
Moving slowly past the beds: A figure rediscovering the
feeling of her skin; another, the sound of his breath; another,'
the beating of her heart.
A figure still asleep . . . wakes. And for the first time in
nearly half a century sees herself in the world.
Tight on Sayer, on the look of awe on his face as he stares at
the scene going on in the darkened ward. His glance finds
Leonard who is sitting up in his bed, smiling.

123.     INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY                                      123,
Tight on Lucy's face, deep in thought, lost in thought. After
several moments of silence, she speaks -
.,:, ·     . :... .        ,.LUCY    V    .   .·       *   .-..        .
             . . . I just had the strapgest
            dream . . .
A cacophony   of off-screen voices - from a radio, the
television,   and the awakened post-encephalitics themselves -
rises up as   another woman, Miriam, moves past Lucy's face. We
follow her,   as does a nurse with a blood pressure guage on
wheels.                                    ,

Miriam and the nurse trailing after her pass in front of a man *
with no English (Josef) trying to explain something to a couple
of orderlies. One to the other -   .
                      ORDERLY 1

Anthony turns away with the tray he just brought in - broth,
jello and juice - and carries it away, passing the "card
playing nurse," Margaret.

Having settled on Margaret: she smiles, glances to "her"
patient, Rose, who, staring at her reflection in a hand mirror,
tugs at her grey hair.

Sidney bursts into the room out of breath and scans the faces
of the awakened post-encephalitics and staff. He spots Sayer,
seated with a woman, her back to him and the door. She slowly
turns to look over her shoulder and, seeing Sidney, smiles.
                      LOLLY
            Hi, Sidney.
There's a kind of hush. Conversations, activities cease.
Everyone is looking at Sidney. Not knowing what else to say,
he manages a hesitant --
                           SIDNEY
            Hi.        i
He smiles and crosses toward her, but by the time he reaches
her the smile has disappeared. Something troubling has

Leonard, moving along the corridor with Saver's camera and
tripod (or looking for something to read at the magazine table)
slows and listens:

He moves toward the voice, traces it to a crafts area, where a
young woman is reading from the sports page to an older man
tied to his wheelchair.
Though it's doubtful the man is even aware of her presence, she
reads to him as if her were, and in the process, draws Leonard
into the sound of her words until there are no sounds but her
words:

           ridicule after seven destitute

hospital rising back up, as Sidney, wild with excitement, bangs
through the far doors of the corridor. He sprints past the
crafts area, past Leonard, runs the entire length of the
corridor, and -

Sidney bursts into the room out of breath and scans the faces
of the awakened post-encephalitics and staff. He spots Sayer,
seated with a woman, her back to him and the door. She slowly
turns to look over her shoulder and, seeing Sidney, smiles.
                     LOLLY
           Hi, Sidney.
There's a kind of hush. Conversations, activities cease.
Everyone is looking at Sidney. Not knowing what else to say,
he manages a hesitant --

       He smiles and crosses toward her, but by the time he reaches
       her the smile has disappeared. Something troubling has
       occurred to him. He looks to Sayer and whispers --

       Sidney and Lolly emerge from the dayroom, followed by the other
       post-encephalitics. They're all wearing suits and dresses and
       walk with purpose past wheelchair-bound patients with
       "uninteresting" diseases.
       As they wait for the elevator, Leonard wanders slightly down
       the corridor to see if the girl is there again reading in the
       crafts area. The chair she was in is empty.

       The elevator door slides open revealing them. Paula, inside,
       hesitates: the sight is almost surreal. >As they crowd in, she
       wedges out, and down the hall, Leonard watching after her.

       They're going on a field trip. As they're escorted onto an
       idling hospital bus, Leonard, outside it, tries to reason with
       his mother:

                    I'm your mother.
        Inside the bus, Miriam, anxious to leave, leans over the driver
        to honk the horn. Leonard kisses his mother on the cheek and
        turns away.
                             MRS. LOWE
                  Wait a minute.

        He's parted it, apparently, on the "wrong" side. She pulls a
        comb from her purse, recombs it "correctly," straightens his
        jacket lapels and steps back.                          '

        The public bus, behind her, coming down the street. As she
        hurries to the corner, Sayer climbs down off the hospital bus.

        He waves to his mother. Sayer stares at him.

        He waves again to his mother; she's boarding the public bus.
        Sayer does as he's told, waves too. Impatient, Miriam honks
        the horn again.

As the public bus pulls away, Leonard pats Sayer on the
shoulder.
                     LEONARD
           I'll see you later, have a good
           time.
He climbs the hospital steps and disappears inside, Sayer
staring after him. Miriam honks the horn again, and he climbs
aboard. The doors hiss shut and driver turns to him.

           Where to?
Sayer suddenly realizes he has no idea "where to." He glances
over his shoulder at the expectant faces of the patients, all
dressed up with nowhere to go. It's up to him . . .
His face brightens; he's thought of a good place.

        Sayer glances away, sees Miss Costello coming.      She looks a
        little irritated. As she arrives -

                   Miss Costello, I think Anthony
                   thinks they're bored.
        He says it like, Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous?

                   They are.
        Sayer, taken aback, glances back to Anthony, whose look says,
        There you go.

        On the dancefloor, the post-encephalitics dance with one
        another amidst "normal" middle-aged and older couples, all
        having a great time.
        At the bar, Sayer tries to get the attention of a young
        bartender busy mixing drinks. Watching, it slowly dawns on
        Rose that something is "wrong" here. More to herself -

                watch the action on the dance floor. Gesturing to Rose, Miss

           Sayer sitting alone.

                       Not that I know of. I kind of
                       doubt it.
           Rose gets up and crosses toward Sayer. Seeing her coming, he
           smiles ... but the smile slowly begins to fade as she sings to
           him:

           Singing as she does it, she pulls him out of his chair.
           Embarrassed, he resists, but she finally gets on the dance
           floor. Never more mortified in his life (it seems as if
           everyone is watching) he "dances . . . "

chaperons.
Passing the examination room, Sayer hears faint typing, and
slows.

typewriter in a pool of lamplight. Glancing over to the door,
the figure is revealed to be Leonard.

    Frank glances blankly at Anthony and another orderly, who are
    hanging out nearby with Bert, passing around a Road & Track
    magazine.
                          FRANK

                I feel old and I feel swindled,
                that's how I feel.
    Anthony glances at the others with a why-did-I-ask kind of
    look. Frank wanders away.

                 He is old.
    So is Bert, though he doesn't feel it. As far as he's
    concerned, he's still twenty years old. He glances back at the
    magazine.

            He never talked about girls
            before. He certainly never had
            anything to d£ with them.
She casts around trying to come to terms with it.

            It's a bit ridiculous all this
            girl business, don't you think? A
            grown man like him?
She looks to Sayer for confirmation.        Sayer manages a nod.
                      MRS. LOWE
            You know what he said? I should
            take a vacation. I should go away

             I can't leave him alone in this
             place. He'd die without me.
Sayer "agrees" with a sympathetic nod, but suspects it is she
who would die if she left. She resumes pacing, and mutters to
herself the bitter-tasting word:

Sayer in bed, asleep with a book on his chest and his
indestructible reading glasses on his face. The phone rings.
He groans and gropes for it, puts the receiver to his ear.

             I think it's important. I think
             it's important some things were

                   have happened to me. Things I've
                   cone to understand. Things.

        Sayer is gradually coining to. He glances at his clock. It's
        like three o'clock in the morning.
                             SAYER

                   Is it?
        Sayer nods to himself that it is. That fact and that Leonard
        has apparently felt compelled to call him to discuss "things"
        concerns him.                          :

        the receiver back on its cradle.

        Dressed haphazardly, hair messed up, eyes still a little
        unfocussed, Sayer resembles more a patient than doctor. Clean
        and alert, Leonard appears rather more "doctor-like."

           spaciousness of life, the gift of
           life. This is what they've
           forgotten. This is what they need
           to remember. This is what we'll
           tell them.
Leonard waits for a reaction to his idea, his "Gospel According
to L-Dopa" lecture tour. Sayer can manage only an uncertain
nod.

                            LEONARD
                 I am?
                       (Kaufman's shrug says
                        "of course")
                 Alone?
     Now there's a pause. And Leonard's hand makes a gesture to his *
     face, to his brow. He ignores it (or is unaware of it).        *
                           KAUFMAN
                 What difference does that make?
                            LEONARD
                       (pause)
                 I think you know.
                           KAUFMAN
                 I don't know. Tell me.
                            LEONARD
                       (right back)
                 It makes all the difference.
     He brushes at his brow again. Sayer studies him, or rather the
     tic itself as it repeats.
                           LEONARD          -                            *

                 Mr. Lowe? I wonder . . . are you
                 at all aware of the unconscious
                 hostility you're exhibiting
                 towards us right now?                                   *
     Kaufman glances over to the psychiatrist, weary. The look on *
     Leonard's face is complete innocence; and his tone completely *
     without innuendo -
                           LEONARD
                 How could I be aware of something
                 that's unconscious?              *
     Sayer smiles to himself. So does Kaufman. The psychiatrist *
     doesn't.                                                  **

                 people, I ' d look at things. I' d
                 decide whether I wanted to go this

                 straight. I ' d do the things you
                 do everyday and take for granted.
     Long silence. Then:
                           KAUFMAN
                 I'll tell you what, we'll take it
                 under consideration. We'll let
                 you know.

     Leonard at a table. Waiting. Sayer appears. Sits.
                            LEONARD
                 Yeah, I was aware of it.     ·
                       (the tic)
                 I was nervous. It's nothing.
                 What'd they say?
                           SAYER
                 They said it's a dangerous place
                 out there. They said they can't
                 be held responsible for what might
                 happen to you out there. They
                 said no.
     Leonard nods, sips his coffee, seems to take the decision in
     stride.
                           LEONARD
                 And what did you say?
                           SAYER
                 They don't have to listen to me.
                           LEONARD
                 Did you agree with them?

                       SAYER
                  (pause)
           Yes.
Leonard nods again, philosophically it seems.
                       SAYER
           I ' m not sure we're out of the
           woods yet, Leonard. I'm not sure
           this is nothing.
                  (the tic)
           I have to be sure you're well.
           There'll be time enough -
Leonard gets up out of his chair --
                       LEONARD
           Bye.
-- and turns to leave.
                     SAYER
           Leonard ...
Leonard ignores him and walks out --      :


                                                                  161

Leonard striding down a corridor.    Sayer hurrying* after him.
                     SAYER
           Where are you going?
                     LEONARD
           For a walk.
                        SAYER
           Leonard . . .
Leonard ignores him.
                        SAYER
           Leonard . . .
Leonard disappears around a corner. Sayer veers off to a
hospital phone and picks it up. Into it -
                      SAYER
           This is Dr. Sayer . . .

162.   INT. CORRIDORS / LOBBY - DAY                                  162.
Faces of patients in wheelchairs blur as Leonard runs past
them. In another corridor faces blur as orderlies rush past
them. In another corridor faces blur as Sayer runs.
Leonard reaches the lobby just ahead of the orderlies. They
try to be gentle with him but when he fights to free himself it
it gets out of control. Sayer appears.
                     SAYER
           Let go of him.
The orderlies don't know what to do. They're just trying to
restrain Leonard but he's making it almost impossible.
                      SAYER
           Leonard, stop fighting.
He keeps fighting. He can see the outside through the glass
doors, so close, so far.
                      SAYER
           Let ao of him.                                      .
They pull him back, away from the doors, into the corridor
                         -w
behind them.         .

Tight on Sayer, staring at the floor, despondent.

           I don't understand it, he was
           never any trouble before.
Kaufman, too, is there, and Miss Costello. Kaufman watches            *
Sayer.
                     MRS. LOWE
          He was quiet: and polite and
          respectful. He never demanded
          anything. He was never
          disobedient.
                    SAYER
          He was catatonic, Mrs. Lowe.
He seems to say it more for Kaufman's benefit; regardless, she
doesn't care for his tone.

          I'm speaking of when he was a boy.

       Coming up a flight of stairs, 1930's music can be heard.          ,,
       Reaching a caged landing the orderly escorting Sayer unlocks*
       door, leads him along a short corridor to another door and
       unlocks that one.

  *    165.   INT. WARD 5 DAYROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY                          165
       An old black and white musical blaring from a television bolted
       to the ceiling. Young male patients, subdued with Thorazine,
       vacantly staring at it.                   >
       Sayer comes in, finds Leonard in one of the chairs, and kneels
       to gain some confidentiality. Leonard cranes slightly to see
       around him, to see the television.
                               SAYER
                    This is a mistake. It's wrong
                    and it's cruel and it should never
                    have happened like this - but you
                    have to understand - nothing quite
                    like this has happened before, no
                    one knows what to do . . . Leonard,
                    please don't ignore me.
       Leonard condescends a look to him. A moment and Sayer smiles
       at a thought:                        ,
                              SAYER
                    I wish you could just walk out
                    like that. I wish it were that
                    simple.

 Sayer's smile fades. Leonard glances back to the set. Tight
  on the screen: Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers dancing.

166.   EXT. BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL - NIGHT *
Light glows in only a few of the windows.
In one, on the third floor, the examination room, a figure in        .*
silhouette (Sayer), stares out.
In another, on the fifth floor, a second figure in silhouette
(Leonard), behind bars, slowly paces.

The blaring TV again. Suddenly the picture goes dark.
Leonard, who turned it off, climbs down off a chair and faces
the "somnambulant" men who were "watching."
Moving along their chairs he considers each much as Sayer
considered the post-encephalitic "garden of stone." Reaching
 one stretched out across three chairs, asleep, Leonard

 gently nudges him.                                         .

trays of untouched food on a cart. Kaufman steps in and the
door slides shut. Descending:
                     ORDERLY
          I guess they're not hungry.
Kaufman nods distractedly, not really listening. The orderly
begins whistling a tune to himself. Kaufman glances over long-
sufferingly, quieting him. The door slides open, and the young
man wheels the cart past Kaufman. Finally:                     ~

       Leonard paces before the entire Ward 5 population, gathered
       like the blind and the sick under a revivalist's tent.

172.   INT.' KAUFMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sayer and Kaufman alone in the room, arguing -
                     SAYER
           - He's lived for thirty years
           without the ability to release his
           anger -
                     KAUFMAN
           - So have the others -
                     SAYER
           I happen to think his behavior's                      .
           more natural than theirs -
                     KAUFMAN              t
           Really - and his tics and
           paranoia? They're more natural - ;
                      SAYER
           He's in that place.
                     KAUFMAN
           Oh, is that it -
                     SAYER
           We wake him up, then lock him up,                 »
           that's not "paranoia," that's a
           fact.
                     KAUFMAN
           I've got 20 psychotics up there,
           "doctor," refusing to eat. They
           have no idea whv they're refusing
           to eat. How long should I let
           that go (on) -
                      SAYER
           He knows why, hs. wants out.

                 Hell, so do I.
     Kaufman suddenly looks weary, as if all his years in this place
     have finally, at this moment, caught up with him. Eventually,
     calmly, evenly -
                            KAUFMAN
                 Mr. Lowe is not the Messiah of
                 Ward 5, he's a man in trouble. He
                 wasn't "resurrected," he was
                 administered a drug - by. you -
                 that's fallen somewhat short of
                 its "miraculous" reputation -
                            SAYER      .
                 The others are fine, they show no
                 signs of -
                           KAUFMAN
                 He's been OQ it longer!
     Sayer has no rejoinder. A silence before:
                           KAUFMAN              .
                  I sympathize with him. I've
                  tried to accommodate him. But                       .
                  I will not let him endanger the
                 health of other patients.
     He's resolute; it feels like a threat, or ultimatum. Trying t
     remain calm, Sayer changes tacks -
                           SAYER
                 I'll talk to him, I'll      explain t he
                 problem. He'll listen       to (m e) -
                      (Kaufman has to
                       laugh)
                 Without the drug, he's    dead.
     Th e sta teme nt do esn 't hav e qui te the p owe r Saye r may h av
     hoped. At least not on Kaufman. His eyes seem to go dead . .
     and then the slightest, slightest shrug.

     Sayer enters the dayroom and is immediately intercepted by
     three young male patients.
                            SAYER
                  Excuse me.

173/174CONT.                        (continuity only)       173/174.
The patients stand their ground forming a kind of human barrier
which Sayer cannot get past.
                       SAYER
          Excuse me.
                    WARD 5 PATIENT
          We can't allow it.
Leonard, across the room, pacing slowly, glances over.
                    LEONARD
          He's all right.
Leonard's "bodyguards" step aside. Sayer crosses to Leonard
and is greeted in a tone precisely that of master to servant,
very courteous yet unmistalcably condescending:
                    LEONARD
          How are you today?
                    SAYER
          I'm all right, how are you?
                    LEONARD
          Never better.
A strange gesture, a tic, appears and repeats.
                    SAYER
          And these gentlemen?
                                         »

               wish I didn't need them.
                       SAYER

                   (no answer)
             Who?
    Leonard glances at Sayer with a slight knowing smile.
                                                                       '.

                       LEONARD
             That's the thing, isn't it, you
             never know who. Someone I least
             expect, I expect. Look at
             history.
                       SAYER
             Every patient in this ward thinks
             there's a plot against him,
             Leonard.
                        LEONARD
             Yeah, well they're mistaken,
             they're crazy.

    The smile that appears this time on Leonard's face is as insane
    as anything Sayer's ever seen. He hesitates. Then:
                       SAYER
             Something's wrong.
                        LEONARD
             Hey, buddy.                                     .

             Hey, I appreciate you coming to
             see me, I have some things to do.
Leonard abruptly extends his hand; it's a little twisted.              *
Sayer doesn't so much shake the hand as hold onto it.
                       SAYER
           Look at yourself, Leonard.

Leonard tries to pull his hand away, but Sayer's grasp is               *
stronger.

                 (erupting)
           Look at vou.
Leonard yanks his hand free of Sayer's, and, in a torrent:
                      LEONARD            *
           Disease took mjs out of the
           world, I fought to come back, I
           failed for 30 years but at least I
           fought, look at you.
But Sayer is looking at him, moving back and forth against the
bars on a window, panther-like. He retaliates:
                      SAYER
           The medicine can be taken away.                               .'
           That can be done. You. can wake up                             "
           in the morning and it won't be
           there.
The remarks seem to have no effect on Leonard. He seems not to '
have heard them. But as Sayer takes a step closer, Leonard, *
without warning, lunges.                                        *
Sayer stumbles back and his glasses fall to the floor. He . '
scrambles to his feet, leaving them, and backs away from     *

Leonard's bodyguards who are slowly coming toward.him.
Orderlies get the cage unlocked and hustle Sayer out. As it *
slams shut again, he glances back in at Leonard, and hardly *
                                                       ,    *
recognizes him.

And reaching and settling on a bed that's empty.
The opera music CONTINUES OVER:

The record spinning. And Sayer at his desk, just sitting, his
"close work" glasses resting on a page of Ernst Heckle.

            Test pattern on the television. Leonard, in a chair, blankly
            staring. His eyes are drawn to something glimmering on the
            floor across the room. Saver's shattered glasses.

            The shards of the lenses layed out on a table.
            Leonard picks one up, and, turning it over to consider it, sees
             that it has already cut his finger.
             He doesn't set it down.

            A metallic dang interrupts the music and echoes into silence.
            Footsteps. Sayer appears, and slowly climbs up through the
            caged stairwell. He reaches a landing' and unlocks a door.

Sayer has called together the ward staff, the other patients,
Kaufman and Ray.
                      SAYER
          He's aware of his appearance.
          He's less concerned with it than
          he is with the effect it may have
           on the rest of us.                                       .
He waits for the patients to acknowledge they understand. They
nod.
                    SAYER
          We'll be working with his dosage.
          He's aware of this, too, and says
          he's prepared for it. He wants us.
          to be prepared for it.
                      ANTHONY             :

          Hey, Len.                                             .
The patients glance away to the threshold of the room. Miss
Costello and Mrs. Lowe are escorting Leonard slowly in.
Anthony comes over, shakes his hand.     ,
                    ANTHONY
          Welcome back.
                      LEONARD
          Thanks.
The others come over, shake his hand and pat him on the back,             *
but all a little too gently, too concerned, like he might
break. Leonard manages a smile.
                     LEONARD
          I' m all right.
The others nod quickly in agreement. And the room falls into               *
silence.
                   LEONARD                       .
         Only it's too quiet in here.

     It's like    a cocktail party - everybody dressed up, some
     singing,    some milling around talking. Leonard tries to enjoy
     it, too,    struggling to contain,, to hide from the others, the
     tics that    are trying to "come out."

Leonard sits. He seems fine. Suddenly his hand jerks up and
catches the tennis ball Sayer has thrown.

            Good.
The ball, without warning, comes back. Sayer lunges at it, but
misses. It hits his wrist and rolls across the floor.

            Well, I wasn't ready, was I.
 Leonard smiles. Sayer smiles. They're both so relieved, they
 can hardly believe it. It seems they're out of the woods, that
they've found the "middle ground."
Tight on Leonard's pharmaceutical chart on the desk. Sayer's
hand comes in and boldly underlines the, dosage - 575 MGS.

wears when he's seeing Paula. He looks well, he feels good,

She watches him try to get the tie on by himself, and casts
around, feeling, perhaps, without a purpose. Eventually, more
to herself than to him:

    Drifting across Leonard's dosage schedules, minute milligram
    changes leading to vanishing point of health, across the scale,-
    with nothing on it, and reaching, finally, Sayer, alone in the
    room, surrounded by racks of medicine and no solution.
                                                                              They

    consider each other for a long moment before:
                           MRS. LOWE
                When my son was born healthy,
                I never asked why. Why was I sp
                lucky, what did I do to deserve
                this perfect child, this
                perfect life? -
    Silence. Her face toughens.
                          MRS. LOWE
                But when he got sick, you can bet
                I asked why. I demanded to know
                why. Why was this happening?
    Silence. Then with an almost philosophical shrug:
                         MRS. LOWE
               There was nothing I could do
               about it. There was no one I
               could go to and say, "Stop this,
               please stop this, can't you see
               my son is in pain?"
                         SAYER

Leonard, alone at a table with a book. He glances up as Sayer
sits opposite him, then down again at the book.
                      LEONARD
           I can't read anymore. The words

He turns back to the beginning, tries      again, his eyes moving
too quickly across the lines, "ahead"      of the words. His hands
and head begin shaking out of control      and it' s' all he can do to
close the book.
                     LEONARD

        It's over and Leonard knows it. And though he won't admit it,
        so does Sayer. Leonard barely gets the words out -»-

        Standing before a mirror above a sink, Leonard struggles to
        part his hair straight. He's wearing his best clothes, those
        he wears when he's seeing Paula, but they seem to drape
        awkwardly.

     knows he cannot, that it would be ludicrous. Instead:

     sort of holding her and begins to slowly dance with him.

        Light moves across the screen. Someone has entered. Miss
        Costello. She exchanges a long glance with Sayer before they
        both look back to the screen.

        realized he was "alive.n Finally --

        One tear snakes down Saver's cheek. The film cuts to silent
        footage of Leonard, soon after his awakening, combing his hair
        and delighting in the fact that he cjan comb it.
        Quietly, without looking at Miss Costello --
                            SAYER

                  It's kind to give life only to
                  take it away?
        There is self-loathing in his voice. On the screen, Leonard's
        trying to operate an electric shaver that seems alive.
                             MISS COSTELLO
                  It's given and taken away from
                  all of us.
        On screen, Leonard buttons buttons on his shirt and glances up
        smiling, proud. Tight on sayer in the dark room, the projector
        light flickering behind him. More to himself --
                            SAYER
                  Why doesn't that comfort me?

                (pause)
          And because he's your friend.
On screen, Leonard is beckoning to someone unseen. No one
appears but he keeps beckoning. Finally Sayer, embarrassed and
camera shy, appears. Though there is no sound, it is clear he
asks, "What?" Leonard turns the doctor so that he is facing
the camera, and points. Sayer again asks, "What?" "There,"
Leonard says. "Where?" Sayer demands. Finally, Sayer
looks directly, curiously, into the camera.

To the arm of the metronome slapping back and forth.
And a twisted hand, a pen grasped awkwardly in it, writing
excruciatingly slowly, and just barely legibly:

         His voice is flat, inflectionless. His eyes, with little life
         behind them, staring at the falling snow. He's in a
         wheelchair.
                                SAYER O.S.
                   Yes.
                             LEONARD
                   Am I speaking?
                                SAYER O.S.
                   Yes.
         Leonard's eyes drift to a chair, his mother's chair, the one
         she has used for thirty years. It's empty.
                             SAYER O.S.
                   Your mother is well. She's home.
                   She visits you on Sundays.
         Leonard slowly nods.    Somehow he knows that.
                             LEONARD                :
f ~^               She's living her own life.

                   She's trying to.
         Leonard's eyes drift again, across to silent ghost-like figures
         in wheelchairs, the post-encephalitics, all of them, "asleep"
         again.
                             SAYER O.S.
                   They fought, as you did, with
                   great courage. They were strong.
         Leonard looks down at his hands and feels one with the other.
         He looks back at the "sleeping" patients, not comprehending why
         they cannot do the same.
                             LEONARD
                   I'm stronger?
         Sayer is finally revealed seated beside him. He doesn't
         answer. Leonard's hands slowly reach to his face and feel its
         features.
                             LEONARD
    ,x             I'm here, aren't I?

&

    His glance finds the tray beside Sayer, the paper medicine cup
     and empty juice cup on it. He must be back on the medication
     again. He looks back to Sayer, who's looking toward the
    window, to the falling snow. Eventually -
                         SAYER
               Do you think you can walk?

    203.   INT. CORRIDOR - DAY                                          203
    A doctor in a lab coat, one Sayer long ago imparted his "will
    of the ball" theory to, emerges from a ward.
                            FERNANDO O.S.
               Dr. Tyler?
    The doctor turns.    Fernando is walking toward him.
                         FERNANDO
               You got a minute?
                         DR. TYLER
                    (not really)
               What is it?
Fernando arrives, leans against the corridor wall, and sort of
mumbles --·
                          FERNANDO
               You know that woman in Ward 7 . . .
               Grace, uh ... what's her last name
               ... Grace ...
                          DR. TYLER
                    (annoyed)
               Does it matter, Fernando?
Sayer and Leonard walk slowly past, behind Tyler.          Fernando's
eyes briefly meet Sayer's.
                           FERNANDO
               . . . no . . . I guess not . . .

            204 CONT.
            Sayer and Leonard approach. Margaret has positioned herself,
            like Anthony, against the wall, and, pointing out something on
            a clipboard to Dr. Sullivan, glances up briefly as Sayer and
    T~^\

           Sayer and Leonard approaching the lobby. As they enter, the
           switchboard operator glances up, notices them, and glances back
           down without a word.
           They approach the front doors.      They are almost there.   From
           behind them, loudly --
                                 MISS COSTELLO O.S.
                       Dr. Kaufman?

                       Dr. Sayer?
           Sayer and Leonard stop just short of the doors. They glance
           back and see- Kaufman -and,v-several* steps .behind..him, looking
           distraught, Miss Costello. She has failed.
                                    SAYER
                       Yes?
           The two doctors stare at one another for several moments.
           Clearly Kaufman knows what is happening. Clearly Sayer knows
           he knows. Eventually --
                                 KAUFMAN               ,
                       Put a coat on him for Christ's

           He turns around, walks past Miss Costello and down the corridor-
           from which he came. Miss Costello relaxes, turns around and
           walks away down the corridor.
           Sayer and Leonard turn and walk outside.

           Though Rolando is not playing, cannot play, the piano, he can
           hear it, distant, like an echo, as a nurse wheels him toward
           the windows. Other nurses and orderlies are wheeling Rose,
           Frank, Bert, and Lucy and the others there. Sidney is wheeling
           Lolly.
           They all "peer" out. They all "see" down below, standing
           across the street, Sayer and Leonard.

                                         REV.12/15/89 (GREEN)       Pg.115

     207.   EXT. BAINBRIDGE - SAME TIME - DAY

CO   Sayer drapes his coat around Leonard. Neither speaks.
     Neither quite knows what to say. Eventually, Sayer holds out a
     hand for Leonard to shake. Leonard stares at it for a long
     moment, then awkwardly embraces Sayer.

     208.   INT. DAYROOM - SAME TIME - DAY                              208
     The others "watch" Sayer cross back to the hospital. They
     "watch" Leonard staring after him. He glances down the street,
     Leonard, glances down the street the other way. He seems
     uncertain which way to go . . .
     He walks away.

     209.   INT. SUBWAY - EVENING                                       209
     Rhythmic pounding.   Metal wheels over metal tracks.
     Leonard feels things.inside his coat pockets. He,pulls from
     one several capsules of L-Dopa in a clear plastic bag; and from
     the other, a wad of money wrapped in paper on which is typed
     his name and "Bainbridge Hospital, Bronx." He stuffs it
     all back into his pocket and glances up. :
      The train is crowded. Everyone seems to be hiding behind a
     newspaper or the veil of a glazed look; everyone but Leonard
     and the eleven year old boy seated next to him with his mother.
     They're taking everything in, Leonard and1 the boy - the rumbl
     of the train, the overhead lights flashing off and on again,
     the mounting excitement they both feel.
     The boy glances up at Leonard, and, like a secret -
                          BOY ON TRAIN
                     (a whisper)

     Underground tunnels. People climbing stairs. Leonard climbing
     with them. Under exposed pipes and ducts. Along passageways.
     Through an exit turnstile. Up more stairs. And finally -

        Leonard, emerging from down below, reaches the street. People
        jostle past him but he doesn't move. He stares in wonder at
        what lies before him . . . lights, skyscrapers, Christmas
        decorations, taxis, noise, people . . . life.

        211A.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT                211A.
        An oppressive silence. The oppressive institutional room.
        Sayer, alone in it, at his desk in the corner.
                              MISS COSTELLO O.S.
                    Good night.
        Sayer glances up, sees Miss Costello in the doorway to the
        corridor.
                              SAYER
                    Good night.

        things on the desk. Looks for something more to do. Clearly
        there's nothing more to do.
        He gets up. Wanders slowly around the room. Past the medical
         instruments in the glass cases, the tripod and projector, along
         tne waii covered with taped and tacked data, notes, Polaroids.
        Buried in it he sees Leonard's original perception test, and
        alongside it, the first Polaroid of him . . .
        Sayer abruptly moves to the window, yanks at it, but it's
        jammed shut again. Below he can see Miss Costello crossing
        toward her car. He fights with the window, finally frees it,
        slides it open and yells out loudly -
                               SAYER
                    Eleanor.
        She turns to the voice. He turns from the window.
        Tight on the glasses left on his desk.

        211B.   EXT. PARKING LOT, BAINBRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT    211B.
        He hurries out of the building and across the lot. Winded, he
        reaches her.

        A mechanical dog crosses Leonard's path wagging its tail.
        Unlike everyone else, he stops to admire it. He's enchanted by
        it. He smiles at the peddler and the "litter of pups" moving
        around his feet.

213.   INT/EXT. TAXI/STREETS - NIGHT                               213.
In the back of a taxi, Leonard stares out the window,
mesmerized by all he sees. The driver glances back in the rear
view mirror.
                      HECTOR
            How 'bout those Jets?
Leonard glances at the rear view mirror and finds in it the
driver's eyes.
                       LEONARD
            I like them.
Leonard glances out the window, a little puzzled, to the sky,
to see if there's one flying overhead.
                       HECTOR
            Broadway Joe.
The driver glances back to see what Leonard thinks of that.              *
Leonard nods uncertainly.
                         LEONARD
            Yeah.
As they rattle along, Leonard peers back but the window at
things going by, and absently pets the mechanical dog in his
lap. Eventually -
                      HECTOR
            You·re not from here.
                      LEONARD
            I am. I was born here.     But.I've
            been away a long time.
                         HECTOR
            Where?
                         LEONARD
            The Bronx.
Hector has to laugh, but it's cut short by the blare of his *

218.   INT/EXT. TAXI/STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT                     218.
The meter clicks over and into double digits.    The taxi is
parked across the street from a diner.
                     HECTOR
           I don't mind sitting here if you
           don't, but to what end are we
           sitting here?
Leonard watches a waitress in the diner, Paula, chatting with
some young customers. His hand moves to and onto the car door
handle, but then hesitates opening it. Paula is getting her
coat and leaving with her friends. They have ice skates.

                                                                   219.
219.   EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - NIGHT
Prometheus stealing fire from heaven, dwarfed by the Christmas
tree that towers over him. Figures glide past the statue.
Skaters on the ice rink.
It's magical.- At *least« as-seen, through .Leonard's eyes. From
the promenade he watches the skaters gliding gracefully over
the ice. Hector appears at his side.
                      HECTOR                 :
           I ' m sorry to bother you, Len, I
           just thought you should know this
           is adding up, you know?
Without taking his eyes from the skaters below, Leonard digs
into his coat pocket and hands Hector a clump of money,
hundreds of dollars. Embarrassed -
                     HECTOR
           I didn't mean that, just -
                      LEONARD
           I don't need it, you keep it.
Hector puts the money back in Leonard's coat. Leonard finds
Paula among the skaters, isolates her from them, and watches
her glide around the rink. A fine mist of snow is falling,
veiling her.
                    HECTOR
          Beautiful, isn't it.
                    LEONARD
          Unforgettable.

 ^       A blur of faces, of people on the promenade, from Paula's
/'"~J~      perspective. Though it is impossible, she thinks for a moment
Wj       she sees Leonard's among them. She arcs and glances back up
           again, but the man who resembled Leonard is gone.

           The cab rattling down another street.
                                LEONARD
                      You have children, Hector?
           Hector takes a photograph from his chauffeur's permit plate and
           hands it back. A boy, five, healthy and happy.
                                 LEONARD
                      He's lovely.
                                HECTOR
                      I thank God for him every day.
                      Every single day.
           Leonard begins to weep softly. Once Hector notices, he slows
           the car, pulls to the curb, and studies Leonard in the rear
           view mirror. Has this man lost a child? The taxi engine
          idles.                                     :

           The cab, empty, parked in front of an apartment building in a
           working class neighborhood.

           222.   INT. HECTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                             222
           The mechanical dog on a bathroom sink. Leonard staring at his
           reflection in a mirror. And at his hands. It's happening.
           He's falling apart.
          HALLWAY. Leonard at a bedroom door. Peering in at Hector's
          sleeping son. He steps quietly into the room and places the
          mechanical dog on the pillow beside the boy's head.
          THE LIVING ROOM. A small Christmas tree. Hector and his wife
          sitting on cheap furniture with cups of egg nog. Leonard
          emerges from the hallway.

                          (having trouble with
                            the words)
                     I want to th-ank you. You've been

Hector and his wife are both thinking the same thing:      this
man's not well and they shouldn't let him go.
                    HECTOR
          Leave? You're our guest, we got
          dinner coming. We're having
          something to eat.
His wife agrees with a couple of words in Spanish as she gets              *
up and crosses toward the kitchen.    .
                     HECTOR
          Stay with us.
                     LEONARD
          I can't.
And he can't explain why. He takes the crumpled wad of money               *
(and paper) from his coat pocket and tries to give it to Hector
again.
                     HECTOR
          Hey -
                     LEONARD
          It has no value to me, believe    ;
          me.
                    HECTOR
          I don't want it.
                    LEONARD
          It's for your son. It's for him.
Hector doesn't take it but doesn't say anything more about it
when Leonard sets it down on the coffee table.
                    HECTOR
          At least let me give you a lift
          wherever you're going.
                     LEONARD
          No, I think I ' d like to walk.       .
                (to Hector's wife)
          Thank you.
She nods, Your welcome, from the doorway of the kitchen.
Leonard offers his hand to Hector to shake.
                    HECTOR
          What's wrong with you, Len?

            This is good, what you've got
            here.
                       HECTOR
            I know that.
Leonard smiles; the man does know it, and appreciates it.
                       LEONARD
            Bye.

223.    EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT                                 223.
Descending from a fire escape strung with a single strand
of Christmas lights . . . down to the street below, to Leonard,
moving along the sidewalk, noticing:
A young couple, bundled up, hurrying down the stairs of a
basement apartment, fumbling with keys;
A Christmas tree too large for the doorway of an another
apartment across the street, being tugged at by someone inside,
unseen. >
Leonard smiles. His gait and tics, and especially the smile,
make him look insane. He passes a shop window with very simple
ornamentation as the proprietor inside switches out the lights,
and continues on, and into the darkness of the street ahead.

224.    EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT                    -               224.
Black water. The river. The drone of engines and syncopated
rhythms of wheels of unseen cars.
Leonard, at the river's edge, stares into the water. His hand
comes out of his pocket holding the bag of L-Dopa capsules, and
he lets it fall in. It floats for a moment before a force from
below, like a hand, pulls it under.

224A.   EXT. EAST RIVER - DAWN                                    224A.
Leonard on a bench. Behind him, across an empty field, bums
huddled over a barrel fire warming their hands.
                       SAYER O.S.
            Leonard?
Sayer's face appears against a pastel dawn sky. Leonard
 glances up at him. Behind them, in the distance, Hector stands
 outside his parked cab. Sayer sits. Long silence . . .

                     What for?
        He smiles crookedly, then looks out across the water again.
                                LEONARD
                     Isn't that something . . .
        Sayer looks out. The morning colors are mirroring off the
        water like paint on glass. They both watch. The colors are
        deepening right before their eyes. Long, long silence
        before . . .
                               LEONARD
                     Can you take me home?
        Sayer helps him up. And as they move slowly toward the waiting
        taxi. Hector opens the rear door. The only sound is the hiss
        of tires, the -rhythm of wheels, .until -

                     When I was a boy I felt myself
                     being carried away by illness like
                     a swimmer sucked out by the tide.
        Drifting slowly out across the water and the Brooklyn Bridge
        stretching out across it.

                     dreamed of. I went to a place and
                      felt hope and fear and hatred and
                      love, I glimpsed life . . .

        Drifting slowly across the faces of patients reading in
        Leonard's library, and settling finally tight on him, "asleep."

        Spines of books on shelves lining the walls. And Paula's face,
        considering the titles.

           She pulls one of the books down at random and crosses the     ,
           library with Sayer, passing patients - including the woman with

           He's in a wheelchair, behind an oak desk on which rests, among
           other things, the Ouija board. His eyes open but do not appear
           to comprehend the doctor's presence or his surroundings. His
           expression is absolutely "expressionless."

           Leonard remains still. "Asleep." And there's a long silence
           broken only by the sound of pages being turned. And then, from
           Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop" --
