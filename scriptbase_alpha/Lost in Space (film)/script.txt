CHAPTER 1: Earth 2058
---------------------
FADE IN ON:

EXT.-SPACE

PULL BACK slowly as MARS fills THE FRAME, a sphere of red desert and
fast rushing crimson clouds.

A triangular CARGO SHIP descends from the dark of space.

          PILOT (OVER)

     Mars mining base, this is Grissom One,
     Request final descent vector.

REVERSE ANGLE

EXT.-MARS

A row of giant red mountains and beneath, on the planet's surface, the
spires of A MINING BASE. Illuminated landing crosshairs alight a
landing pad, beckoning the ship.

          CONTROLLER (OVER)

     Roger, Grissom One, this is Mars
     Mining, You are cleared to land. Hope
     you got some Partagas in that rust
     bucket, Sal.

EXT.-EDGE OF SPACE

THE CARGO SHIP changes attitude, landing thrusters FIRING as the vessel
begins to penetrate the atmosphere.

          PILOT

     I brought you the most amazing...

Amazing, what, we'll never know. The CARGO SHIP begins to EXPLODE, the
bubble bridge BLOWING out into space in a ball of fire.

EXT.- MARS

LOW ANGLE from the planet's surface-. Two shapes BLAST through FRAME,
BUBBLE FIGHTERS, single pilot, transparent globes, racing up towards
the sudden star of the cargo ship at impossible speed.

INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER

POV of the burning Cargo Ship, coming towards us incredibly fast.
Speed, trajectory and tactical readouts flash.

EXT.-CARGO SHIP

The pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull.

WIDER

Two sinister ATTACK SHIPS, their lasers locked onto the Cargo Ship,
FIRE away as they BLAST overhead. The nuclear core of the Cargo Ship
overloads, the craft finally EXPLODING in a storm of fire.

A BUBBLE FIGHTER ROARS through the hurling world of flame. PUSH IN.

INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER

A lone FIGURE stands in a gyroscopic harness, working a heads-up
holographic display, command controls spinning 360 degrees with the
pilot's Comas the fighter SCREAMS after the fleeing raider.

The harness spins, the pilot coming clearly into view. Handsome,
intense, reckless eyes. MAJOR DON WEST.

          WEST

     Sino-Jordanian Raiders. They're
     claiming the cargo ship violated
     their air-space.

INT.-SECOND BUBBLE FIGHTER

Another pilot (JEB WALKER) commands an identical craft, ROCKETING
towards the assault craft just below West's.

          JEB

     This cold war's heating up. Where did
     they come from?

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

          WEST

     Hell. And we're going to send them
     back screaming.

West activates his targeting computer.

          WEST

     Last one to kill a bad guy buys the
     beer.

TARGETING DISPLAY-CLOSE. The fleeing Attack Ship jogs in and out of the
crosshairs on West's holographic array. West fires.

EXT.-SPACE

The Attack Ship SHOOTS straight up, dodging West's laser BLASTS.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West closes on the fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack Ship,
lasers FIRING in the b.g., visible through the transparent surface of
the bubble glass under West's feet.

          WEST

     What's that sound? must be the fat lady
     warming up.

EXT.-SPACE

The fleeing Attack Ship loops in mid-space, reversing direction,
heading straight towards West's Bubble Fighter. A game of chicken.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West doesn't flinch. Bears down, FIRING madly, the two space ships
heading straight for each other.

          WEST

     That's right. Come on, come on, you wanna
     play, I wanna play.

EXT.-SPACE

The two ships are ROCKETING towards each other, locked in collision
vectors, lasers FIRING wildly.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

          WEST

     I can hear her. Oh, yes, oh yes. She's
     gonna sing.

TARGETING:DISPLAY-CLOSE. The Attack Ship flashes, captured in the
targeting hatchmarks. The display expands into a tactical grid.

          COMPUTER

     Target lock.

EXT.-SPACE

Imminent collision.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

The hull of the Attack Ship fills his bubble glass.

          WEST

     The lights are dimming. The curtain's
     coming down. Sing you fat, old bag,
     sing!

West hits the firing stud.

EXT.-DEEP SPACE

West's pulse lasers converge on the Attack Ship barely meters ahead,
the ROARING craft EXPLODING directly before him.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

(OVER) WEST SCREAMS as he shoots through the sudden conflagration of
flame and debris, everywhere and then gone, giving way to the blackness
of space and the starfield beyond.

          WEST

     Show's over.

Below, the second Attack Ship ROARS past, lasers FIRING, locked in a
pinwheel battle with Jeb's Bubble Fighter.

EXT.-SPACE

JEB'S BUBBLE FIGHTER banks, avoiding the high energy volley. Almost. A
laser BURST grazes his Bubble Fighter, the surface of his craft
sparking, suddenly scored with flames.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

The Attack ship is right behind him.

          JEB

     Weapons are off line. Jettisoning main
     drive core.

EXT.-SPACE

The thruster core of Jeb's Bubble Fighter BLOWS off in a bolus of
flame, soaring back into the pursuit craft. The Raider EXPLODES.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

Controls are sparking. Displays flicker. (OVER) An ALARM sounds.

          COMPUTER

     Warning. Failure in redundant drive systems.

JEB-POV. The surface of Mars is rushing up fast.


          COMPUTER

     Impact on in 90 seconds.

          JEB

     Mars Control. . .

EXT.-SPACE

Jeb's ship is barreling toward the planet.

          JEB (OVER)

     . . .this is Ranger One.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

          JEB (ON RADIO)

     ...Engines will not respond. Require
     assistance. Repeat...

          BASE (ON RADIO)

     Ranger One this is Grissom Base.
     Rescue craft have been dispatched.

EXT.- MARS MINING COLONY

Three small rescue craft race skyward.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

          COMPUTER

     Impact in 60 seconds.

Mars fills the view screen.

INT.-WEST'S CRAFT

The rescue craft are speeding toward Jeb's fighter below.

          WEST

     Grissom, this is Eagle One. Those Pugs
     Will never reach him in time.

          BASE (ON RADIO)

     Eagle one clear this frequency and
     return to base.

DON takes a beat. Then he spins his chair towards Mars, begins working
the controls.

          WEST

     This is Eagle One. I'm going after
     him.

          BASE (OVER)

     Negative Eagle one, your craft is not
     equipped

West hits his thrusters.

EXT.-SPACE

West's craft dives toward Jeb's ship and Mars below.

INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER

Mars is coming up fast.

          COMPUTER

     Impact in 30 seconds.

          WEST (OVER)

     Jeb, do you have navigational
     thrusters?

          JEB

     Don?

          WEST (OVER)

     It's a yes or no question.

Mars fills the windscreen. Jeb checks his status display.

          JEB

     Marginal. But in the green.

          COMPUTER

     Impact in 15 seconds.

          WEST (OVER)

     Head towards the canals.

          JEB

     What are you doing?

          WEST (OVER)

     Saving your ass. Read towards the
     canals. Now!

The canal streaked face of the Mars is all Jeb can see. He grabs his
throttle, engages his navigational thrusters and pulls.

EXT.-JEB'S SHIP

A tiny directional thruster FIRES, angling Jeb's craft so that it
scrapes the surface of Mars and dives into a giant canal, rocky walls
rushing up fast.

INT.-WEST'S SHIP

West is accelerating toward Jeb.

          BASE (OVER)

     Major West, your ship is not equipped
     for rescue. You are not authorized to
     jeopardize this asset. That is
     a direct order. Acknowledge!

West slams a switch, deactivating his radio.

          WEST

     Never liked that station, anyway.

He BLASTS into the canal, walls rushing up on either side of him.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

Jeb's tiny craft is plunging toward the rocky crater floor below.

Overhead West's fighter appears, under full thrusters, roaring towards
the crater floor faster and at a sharper angle.

INT.-3EB'S FIGHTER

The canal floor is rushing up fast.

          COMPUTER

     Impact in five seconds.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

Don is blasting toward the canal floor, almost as if trying to beat
Jeb's ship to a fiery impact below.

          COMPUTER

     Warning. Proximity alert.

          WEST

     Jeb, I'm going to give you a little
     kiss. Don't take it the wrong way.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

West angles his ship directly under Jeb.

INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER

The expanding surface of Mars, visible beneath his feet, is suddenly
obscured by Don's fighter, swooping under his ship.

          JEB

     Don, abort. Abort.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

Jeb's fighter is visible overhead.

West going up. Don angles the throttle.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

Don's ship, sandwiched between the surface of Mars and Jeb's fighter,
angles up and, like a cue ball hitting it's target, Knocks Jeb's ship
spinning toward the safety of space beyond. West's ship actually
scrapes the surface of the planet, sending up a plume of Martian dust.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

          JEB (OVER)

     Does this mean we're going steady?

West pulls his throttle all the way back.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

West shoots up and out towards the dark of space.

          WEST (OVER)

     You weren't getting out of buying
     those beers that easy.

The rescue craft converge on Jeb's ship as Don heads for base.

                              CUT TO:

     extensively trained to take a ten year
     journey across the galaxy in the
     world's most advanced spacecraft,
     The Jupiter.

INSERT CORPORATE LOGO.-A Coke bottle hurling towards the stars.

           V0

     This mission sponsored by the US Army
     and the Coca-Cola corporation.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

WILL ROBINSON (10) hides in a small space, watching the commercial on a
jury-rigged, palm-sized computer. He mimics the Naylrator.

           WILL

     Coke. Saving the world for our
     children.

     (a beat)

     Give me a hi-test break.

WILL-POV. Spying through the open slats of his biding place into...

INT:-LIVING ROOM-AFTERNOON

Basic twenty first century modern. MAUREEN ROBINSON stands, talking
with a PRINCIPAL who in less than happy.

           PRINCIPAL

     He hacked our main power grid to run
     his experiment. The school was in
     chaos. We didn't even have lights.

The room lights suddenly dim. The Principal flickers, revealed as a
holograph, her head now sitting on Schwartzenegger body.

Maureen LAUGHS, then realizes the Principal has no idea her image is
being distorted. Maureen begins moving about the room, surreptitiously
glancing behind couches, into cabinets.

           PRINCIPAL (OVER)

     This is no laughing matter, Mrs.
     Robinson. Will is terribly gifted. His
     little time machines, though pure
     fancy, are the products of a truly
     brilliant mind.

The Principal's body has become Twiggy's. Now that of an ape. Maureen
pulls open a closet. Will sits inside. Grins.

           WILL

     The changing shape of education.

           MAUREEN

     No more monkey business.

Will shrugs, adjusts his deck. The Principal returns to normal.

           PRINCIPAL

     The boy is starved for attention. Was
     there no way his father could have
     attended the science fair?

EXT.-HOUSTON - DAY

Probably Austin and Dallas too. Texas has become a giant urban sprawl
spreading into Mexico and beyond. Immense industrial air purifiers hang
in a dark, wet sky.

EXT.-HOUSTON SPACE COMMAND-ESTABLISHING

A giant dome topped pedestal towers ever the skyline.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-MISSION CONTROL-DAY

A MAN stands before a large viewscreen facing the throng of PRESS.

He's a little uncomfortable with all the media attention. This is
PROFESSOR JOHN ROBINSON.

           JOHN

     Once we have landed on Alpha Prime our
     on board robot will begin construction
     of a hypergate.

ON SCREEN a hi-tech orbital gate is highlighted and expanded.

           JOHN

     By then, technicians here on Earth
     will have completed a companion
     hypergate in our planet's orbit.

ON SCREEN an image of an orbital gate now under construction.

           JOHN

     Once both gates are complete, ships
     will be able to pass instantaneously
     between them. The Jupiter can bring
     the Dimondium back to Earth without
     the ten year delay of a return trip.

           REPORTER

     Why can't you just use the Jupiter's
     hyperengine to zap straight to Alpha
     Prime?

           JOHN

     As you know, hyperspace exists beneath
     normal space. If you try to enter
     hyperspace without a gate

ON SCREEN a graphic spaceship appears randomly in the corner of a
turning schematic of the galaxy.

           JOHN

     Your exit vector is random. There's no
     telling where you'd come out.

           REPORTER

     Professor, how is Captain Daniels
     recovering from the flu? Will we still
     be able to pilot the mission?

John glances to the doorway where a uniformed GENERAL stands.

           GENERAL

     Ladies and Gentlemen, you came to get
     a look at the Jupiter One. Don't you
     think you've waited long enough?

John hits a button and the room darkens. A giant monitor reveals...

INT.-LAUNCH DOME

A giant saucer sits connected to its launch pad by loading belts,
steaming fuel tubes and spindled gantries.

           REPORTER (OVER)

     Professor, how does your family feel
     about leaving the Earth behind....

           JOHN (OVER)

     They couldn't be more excited.

CHAPTER 3: Goodbye!
-------------------


EXT.-ROBINSON HOUSE-ESTABLISHING

A suburban colonial, the launch dome towering in the distance.

          PENNY (OVER)

     This whole mission sucks!

INT.-ROBINSON HOME HALLWAY-SUNSET

PENNY ROBINSON (14) furious, turns, looks downstairs at Maureen.

          PENNY

     I Don't want to stay home for dinner.
     I want to see my friends for the last
     time.

She takes a beat, blinking away the tears. Lifts her wrist and turns on
a video camera watch. She begins down the hall.

VIDEO-POV. Penny's face in the monitor screen.

          PENNY

     ... On the eve before she is torn from
     her friends, kidnapped, hurled into
     deep space against her will, what
     thoughts fill the mind of the young
     Space Captive....

INT.-WILL'S ROOM-SUNSET

Penny enters a strewn, boy' a world. Will is trying to select items to
place in a single packing canister marked: PERSONAL CARGO.

          WILL

     Will there be boys on Alpha Centuri?
     What will I wear?

          PENNY

     When we wake up in ten years the video
     journals of Penny Robinson, Space
     Captive, will be devoured by millions.
     I will be world famous. You on the
     other hand, will have been totally
     forgotten.

Penny shows the camera her arm, covered by strings of ribbons.

          PENNY

     The Space Captive has decided to wear
     ribbons of support for fellow
     sufferers as she is dragged into deep
     space, green for the ecological
     issues, white for human rights

          WILL

     You'd probably gag if I described the
     secondary infections loss of
     circulation can cause.

Penny seems about to speak, instead just smiles, goes to his bed and
pulls off the sheets, begins knotting them together.

          WILL

     What are you grinning at?

          PENNY

     I just found an upside to this
     mission. The thought of jettisoning
     your body into deep space.

Penny knots the sheets into a rope, ties it to the bed-post. Will lifts
several palm-sized gold-plated stars. Each reads: 1st prize.

          WILL

     Dad says Don't bring them. Like
     anything I do matters to him.

          PENNY

     He never showed, huh?

          WILL

     Maybe if I had actually broken the
     time barrier he would have paid
     attention.

          PENNY

     Don't let him get to you, kiddo. He
     just gets busy with work is all.

Penny tosses the rope out the window, prepares to climb.

          WILL

     So, that's a no to family dinner?

          PENNY

     Let's see, do I spend my last night on
     Earth watching Mom and Dad pretend not
     to be fighting again or get in ten
     years of making-out at the mall ...
     you do the math.

          WILL

     Mom's gonna go thermal.

          PENNY

     What's she gonna do. Ground me?

CHAPTER 4: Major West
---------------------


INT.-SPACE COMMAND-CORRIDOR

John and the General walk the metal passageway.

          JOHN

     We're lucky they didn't press on
     Daniels, condition.

          GENERAL

     I figured a chance to look at the ship
     would keep the dogs at bay.

          JOHN

     Ben, I'm worried about jamming in a
     replacement pilot at the last second.
     My family' a on this mission. I need
     someone who's more than just spit and
     polish.

          GENERAL

     I've got your man. He just doesn't
     know it yet.

The General palms an access panel. A door hisses open to reveal...

INT.-SPACE COMMAND- CONFERENCE ROOM-CONTINUOUS

A figure stands staring silently out the window. Don West. He offers a
salute. By his eyes, West is clearly agitated.

          GENERAL

     At ease, Major.

          WEST

     Sir, why was I pulled off active duty?
     I salvaged my craft and Jeb's. I'll
     fight a court martial, General.

          GENERAL

     Do you know Professor Robinson?

          WEST

     By reputation only.

     (to John)

     Your father's battle strategies were
     required reading at the Academy.

          GENERAL

     How much do you know about the Jupiter
     Mission, Major?

          WEST

     The Jupiter is fully automated. The
     pilot flies the ship out of the solar
     system and lands on Alpha Prime. It's
     a baby sitting job, sir.

          GENERAL

     Major, you are aware Earth's resources
     are severely limited.

          WEST

     Every schoolchild knows our recycling
     technologies will save the
     environment. Sending a family across
     the galaxy is a publicity stunt to
     sell soda to people of all ages.

          GENERAL

     What I am about to tell you is
     classified. Every schoolchild
     has been lied to. The recycling
     technologies have failed. In
     less than two decades Earth will be
     unable to support human life.

          GENERAL

     We spun the ad campaign to give the
     mission a friendly face, keep people
     from panicking in the streets. We
     partnered with Coke because the 900
     billion this mission cost would have
     bankrupted the government. The
     SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth
     as well as we do. They hope to reach
     Alpha Prime first - And if they do,
     I guarantee you, they will not share
     the Dimondium with Western Demons like
     us. our crops will wither. We will be
     left to die.

          WEST

     ...Captain Daniels doesn't have the
     flu, does he sir?

          GENERAL

     Daniels was murdered in his apartment
     last night. The flu story is a cover
     we fed the press.

          WEST

     Dan was a good pilot. A good man.

          GENERAL

     Your rescue stunt over Mars was
     foolhardy. Explain yourself, Major.

          WEST

     I had a friend in trouble.

          GENERAL

     You endangered a one billion dollar
     spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order
     because of a friend?

          WEST

     Yes sir. And I'd do it again. Sir.

          JOHN

     He'll do.

     (stepping forward)

          GENERAL

     Congratulations Major, you're the new
     pilot of the Jupiter mission.

CHAPTER 5: Dr. Smith
--------------------


EXT.-DESERT-DAY

Sun beats hard on a MAN who stands on a windswept sand dune, talking to
a smartly dressed BUSINESSMAN.

          MAN

     Perhaps a brief jaunt down memory
     lane is required. I was contracted
     to provide Daniels, apartment code.
     My work is done.

          BUSINESSMAN

     They found a replacement pilot, the
     mission is going ahead on schedule.

          MAN

     How tragic. For you.

          BUSINESSMAN

     We require more direct intervention.

          MAN

     I see. Well, that will cost you. And,
     I'm afraid my price has just become
     ... astronomical.

(OVER) a KNOCK. The man reaches forward and presses a button. The
businessman, the desert disappear, only holographs.

Room lights.

Lights come up to reveal...

INT.-MISSION CONTROL-MEDICAL LABS

The man turns, revealing a face as clever an his eyes are evil. This is
DR. ZACHARY SMITH. He walks to the door, palms a panel, and the portal
hiss open. A TECHNICIAN ENTERS.

          TECHNICIAN

     Control hasn't received the results
     of your final pre-flight exams,
     Doctor Smith.

The Doctor moves to a circular overhead light board around which are
displayed the faces of the crew of the Jupiter craft. Removes the
micro-files, hands them to the technician.

          SMITH

     The Robinsons are checked out at one
     hundred percent. They are in perfect
     condition and ready to fly.

He smiles, so sweet you can barely see the malevolence behind it.

          SMITH

     Wish them good luck for me.

CHAPTER 6: Welcome Aboard!
--------------------------


INT.-SPACE COMMAND-WALKING

Three small figures walk through a gantry towards the ship.

          GENERAL (OVER)

     The mission protocols are simple.
     Professor Robinson is in command
     unless you encounter a military
     emergency. In that case, Major West,
     you will assume command.

The figures have come to the saucer entry-port.

          JOHN (OVER)

     Welcome aboard, Major.

INT.-JUPITER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Don, John, and the General ENTER. Don's eyes widen.

West looks like somebody sprung for the full extras package on this
baby.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hi-tech heaven. Two pilots, chairs face a giant windscreen. Don walks
to the consoles that stretch toward the back walls.

          JOHN

     Some of this technology might be new
     to you. I'll be happy to explain.

          WEST

     (off the com)

     Cold fusion drive

     (off the size consoles)

     Rambler-Krey Life Sciences stations.

Don strides to a pedestal in the center of the bridge. Flicks a switch
and a holographic Jupiter craft appears on the launch pad.

          WEST

     Holographic navigational interface.

Don points to a row of man-sized glass cylinders on the back wall.

          WEST

     Cryosleep array. Fully monitored.

He approaches the blast doors that lead off the back of the bridge.

          WEST

     Sick bay, remote Ops, engineering and
     living quarters are below decks.
     Hyperengine should be in here.

Don hits a wall panel which opens to reveal an immense ENGINE ROOM.

          JOHN

     If you have to baby sit, it's not
     such a bad nursery, wouldn't you
     agree, Major?

Just then the ELEVATOR rises from the lower decks. On its circular
platform stands a DOCTOR in a lab coat. She walks to the General.

          DOCTOR

     The cryosleep systems are running at
     ninety five percent.

          GENERAL

     Doctor Smith approved the specs-

          DOCTOR

     Doctor Smith is base physician. I am
     responsible once this ship is in
     flight. These tubes have to keep the
     crew in suspended animation for ten
     years. They will be perfect or this
     ship will not launch. Is that clear?

          GENERAL

     Absolutely, Doctor.

          JOHN

     Judy, I'd like you to meet Major
     West. He's taking Mike's place.

          DOCTOR

     He's heavier than Mike. We'll have to
     re-calibrate.

          WEST

     I'd be more than happy to discuss my
     dimensions perhaps over dinner?

          DOCTOR

     West - I've read about you. Something
     of a war hero, aren't you?

          WEST

     (preening )

     Well, yes, actually.

          DOCTOR

     Those who can't think, fight.

     (a freezing smile)

     Well, nice to have met you.

She heads toward the readouts. West turns to John.

          WEST

     That's one cold fish I'd love to
     thaw.

          JUDY

     (turning)

     I'm not going to make it home for
     dinner, Dad.

West turns to John. Dad?

          WEST

     It's going to be a long flight.

EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT

Lights burn in the windows.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME-DINING ROOM-NIGHT

John ENTERS to find the remains of an elegant dinner on the table,
candles never lit, food never eaten.

John crosses to a small scale model sitting on the table. Around it
hangs another gold plated 1st prize star. He smiles.

          MAUREEN (OVER)

     He won first prize again. He
     practically brought down his entire
     school. But he won first prize.

Maureen descends the steps in a bathrobe. Joins John.

          JOHN

     A non-working prototype for his time
     machine. Sharp stuff for a midget.

Maureen is silent.

          JOHN

     I'm sorry about dinner. I had to work
     late. The new pilot-.

          MAUREEN

     What you had to do was prioritize
     your family over the mission

          JOHN

     Maureen. This mission is about our
     family. So we can stay together

          MAUREEN

     The perfect nuclear family. The most
     stable social unit, ideally suited
     for the isolation of a long journey
     into space. It's all just PR, John.
     You're never home. Judy is
     becoming a ghost just like you. Penny
     can't see past her own navel and Will
     has to black out-his school, just to
     get his father's attention. The
     perfect nuclear family in ruin.

John stares at his wife. Then he reaches forward, touches her hair.

          JOHN

     I know, Maureen. I'm scared too.

A beat. Then she moves to him. And he holds her close.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME-WILL'S ROOM-NIGHT

John stands in the yellow wedge of hall light. He touches something
hanging around his own neck. A pair of metal dog tags.

WIDER

Will lies in his bed, eyes closed. Asleep. A beat. John turns, heading
out into the hall.

EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT

The bedroom lights go out, a normal home against the backdrop of the
launch dome towering in the distance.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-LAUNCH DOME-NIGHT

The Jupiter one stands amidst loading gantries, final supplies rolling
into the
ship on automated conveyer belts and lifts.

CHAPTER 7: Primary Directives
-----------------------------


PAN DOWN

TWO TECHNICIANS stand checking off supplies on a lightpad.

          LOADING TECHNICIAN

     Anything else?

          LOADING TECHNICIAN #2

     I'm showing a late shipment from
     Mission Medical. Smith's
     authorization. Here it is now.

HOLD on a canister that reads: BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS: Do Not Open, as it
passes on the loading belt. FOLLOW THE DRUM as it winds along the
conveyer, up a gantry towards the Jupiter One. PUSH IN...

INT. -CARGO DRUM

Smith sits crouched inside, cleaning his nails.

INT.-JUPITER ONE-LOWER DECKS

A giant robot stands attached to its service bay. Still. Silent.

A SERVICE DRAWER slides open and a shadowy infiltrator emerges, his
face visible in the dim service light. Smith.

Smith approaches the docked Robot, places a small keypad device on the
Robot's dormant CPU panel. Smith activates the device.

          SMITH

     You'll forgive me if I forgo the
     kiss, my sleeping behemoth.

Smith hits a switch on the panel and the Robot's system indicators
light into life. Smith types several keys on the keypad.

          SMITH

     But the time has come to awake.

          ROBOT

     Robot is on-line. Reviewing primary
     directives. One, preserve the
     Robinson Family. Two, Maintain ship
     systems. Three

          SMITH

     Spare me the chatter.

Smith taps the keypad. The Robot is silenced. Smith types again.

          SMITH

     What noble charges my steely
     centurion. Sadly I fear you have far
     more dire deeds in store for you.

Smith completes his re-programming. Hits a switch.

          ROBOT

     Robot is on-line. Reviewing primary
     directives. Two hours into mission
     destroy Robinson family. Destroy all
     systems.

Smith smiles. Removes the re-programming module.

          SMITH

     Now that's more like it. Farewell my
     tin-plated pal. Give my regards to
     oblivion.

Smith climbs into a chute marked WASTE DISPOSAL.

INT.-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE

Smith begins crawling down the chute. His tiny reprogramming module
BEEPS. Smith activates a tiny, built in com-link.

From the mic, the familiar visage of the Businessman is projected into
the crawlspace over Smith's face.

          SMITH

     I told you never to call me here.

          BUSINESSMAN

     I see you have completed your mission
     on schedule Good work, Doctor. And
     goodbye.

The Businessman smiles. SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled.

Suddenly the tiny module in his hand OVERLOADS, the flesh on his palm
smoking as Smith is engulfed in an electrical charge. He goes out, his
body perfectly still.

CHAPTER 8: Launch!
------------------


EXT.-SPACE COMMAND-MORNING

The giant dome shines in the early sun.

INT-JUPITER ONE  John and Maureen face will and Penny who stand now in
their freezing tubes. All  wear silver flight suits. Maureen moves
Penny's hair from in front of her face.

          PENNY

     Don't, mom. Vogue says this will be
     the style in ten years.

          WILL

     Will she wake up less annoying?

          PENNY

     Does he have to wake up at all?

          MAUREEN

     Alright you two, enough.

Maureen kisses her children. John moves to will who reaches to shake at
the same moment John tries to hug him. A beat. Then John tries to a
shake as Will goes for the hug. A total miss. Will backs into his tube.

          MAUREEN

     You get a C in paternal expression,
     Professor. But an A for effort.

John kisses his wife, already in her tube.

          MAUREEN

     You always get an A in that.

          JUDY

     Don't let me shatter this unbridled
     display of affection, but we are
     running behind.

          JOHN

     (entering his tube)

     Major, she's all yours.

          WEST

     I'll try to give you a smooth ride.

Judy walks the row, checking their bio-monitors. Enters her tube.

          JUDY

     Mission control this is Dr. Robinson.
     We are in the green.

          MISSION CONTROL (OVER)

     Roger, Doctor, you are go to initiate
     cryostasis.

Don walks to Judy's tube.

          WEST

     One question, Doctor. in there room
     in these tubes for two?

          JUDY

     Barely enough for you and your ego,
     Major. Drive carefully.

         (touches her com-link)

     initializing cryostasis tubes.

The tubes rotate closed around the Robinsons. Suddenly each crew member
is surrounded by a shimmering blue glow, brightening like a star and
then subsiding. All stand fixed in suspended animation.

Don stares at the family a beat. He goes to the main console. Straps
himself in.

          WEST

     Mission Control, this is Jupiter One.
     The Robinsons are asleep. We are
     ready to fly.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-MISSION CONTROL

Welcome to the future. Banks of monitors manned by gum-chewing, pink
haired technicians. A giant monitor shows the Jupiter on the launch
pad. The CONTROLLER (NOAH FREEMAN) pulls in to his console.

          NOAH

     Jupiter Two this is Mission Control.
     You are at T-minus two minutes and
     counting. We're opening the dome.

West reaches for a glowing panel.

          WEST

     We're outta here.

EXT. JUPITER ONE

The atomic power source fires a focused BLAST, shooting the Jupiter
through cloud and sky towards the black edge of space.

INT:-MISSION CONTROL

The main screen shows a graphic of the Jupiter's trajectory as the ship
arcs toward the outer edge of the atmosphere.

          NOAH

     Jupiter One, you are clear Earth's
     atmosphere.

A CHEER goes up in the control room.

EXT.-JUPITER ONE

The giant saucer shell EXPLODES, revealing the inner ship, the
glittering high tech shape of the JUPITER TWO.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Don watches as the Earth recedes into a blue marble, flickering orbital
billboards growing distant. Smiles at the familiar sight.

          WEST

     Jupiter One booster disengaged.
     Proceeding towards Mercury.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

Nuclear diodes at the ship's base spin into life, glowing with atomic
fire, the ship now heading towards Mercury and beyond.

The Robot stands dormant in his service bay. HOLD on the closed service
drawer in the b.g. PUSH IN.

INT.-SERVICE DRAWER

Smith lies still, unconscious in the dark compartment.

INT-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE

Mercury hangs like a red moon in the front viewscreen.

Don presses a button and two giant blast shields close over the Jupiter
Two's main viewscreen.

          WEST

     Houston, diverting all spacecraft
     controls to the main computer.

     Eight years of flight training.

He walks to the center of the bridge and activates the navigational
holograph, images forming in mid-air over the pedestal.

HOLOGRAPH- CLOSE. The Jupiter Two is visible, backed by the planets of
our solar system.

          WEST

     Navigational holographics on line.

     (off mic)

past mercury, around the Sun in a slingshot and into space beyond.

          WEST

     Course confirmed for slingshot exit
     of the solar system.

     (off mic)

CHAPTER 9: Destroy!
-------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE-LATER

Smith lies still. He starts from a nightmare into...-a nightmare

INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS

Smith scrambles out of the chute, stares at his hand, the impression of
the overloaded communicator seared into his palm.

He spins around disoriented. Stumbles to a closed view screen and hits
a stud. The blast shield opens. Space.

SMITH-CLOSE. Shock. No words.

THE ROBOT-CLOSE. In his docking bay. Suddenly the automaton powers up,
lights activating as his CPU comes on line.

          SMITH

     No.

Smith turns, slaps the burned out programming module on the Robot.

          SMITH

     Disable program.

No response. The Robot continues to power up.

Smith engage interface. Initiate system shut-down.

          ROBOT

     Robot is on line. Implementing prime
     command directives.

The Robot disengages from the service bay, begins rolling forward.

          ROBOT

     Robinson family, destroy.

          SMITH

     No. Cease. Desist.

The Robot rolls towards the bridge.

          ROBOT

     All operating Systems, destroy.

Smith grabs a wrench from a tool bracket, leaps for the Robot. The
Robot swings once, sending Smith flying into a flaring console.

          ROBOT

     Jupiter Two, destroy.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL-NIGHT

Dark. A single Techie (ANNIE) mans the watch, playing holo-games with a
stylus over her desk. SCREENS flicker into life.

          ANNIE

     What the-?

     (into a mic)

     Somebody wake up the chief.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE

Still. The bridge doors open and the ambient lights come on.

The Robot rolls onto the bridge, faces the cryosleep array. He extends
his arms, an electrical charge arcing between his claws.

          ROBOT

     Robinson Family, destroy.

He fires, a blast of electricity hitting the cryosleep controls. (OVER)
ALARMS sound as the tubes begin to descend, electricity sparking across
the sleeping Robinsons.

          SMITH (OVER)

     Mechanical moron. You'll kill us all.

Smith, wrench in hand, rushes the Robot, is again hurled across the
room. The Robot turns towards the navigational computer.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

Fully lit. All the monitors are manned by sleepy Techies. Noah ENTERS,
taking a coffee from Annie without breaking stride. , ALARMS flash
everywhere.

          NOAH

     This mission's over. Wake them up.

The Techies begins working the controls.

          ANNIE

     No response, sir. I'm sorry.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The Robot is facing the navigational holograph in the center of the
bridge. The electricity arcs between his claws once again.

          ROBOT

     Operating systems, Destroy.

Smith is slumped against the bulkhead. He shakes off his fall in time
to see the Robot fire at the navigational array, the holograph
disappearing in the flames of the exploding pedestal.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship begins to veer off course, falling towards the sun.

INT.JUPITER TWO

The Robot is rolling toward the com.

THE FREEZING TUBES are quickly being engulfed in flames. Smith stumbles
toward their control station. Begins typing madly.

          SMITH

     Wake up, damn you. I can't stop this
     infernal contraption on my own.

He SMASHES a glass panel that reads EMERGENCY DEACTIVATE. The figures
inside the lowering tubes glow. All except Judy.

The Robot is before the Com, electricity arcing between his claws.

          SMITH

     (off the tubes)

     Hurry up. Hurry up.

The Robot FIRES at the main Com, controls EXPLODING everywhere. The
freezing tubes begin to open, the Robot spinning to face them.

John blinks to life first. Emerges, ducking a BLAST of electrical
energy from the Robot, hitting the deck and rolling.

          JOHN

     Maureen. The children.

Maureen grabs Will and Penny, pulls them down just as the Robot blows
away their tubes.

John pulls a laser pistol from a wall mount.

          JOHN

     Disengage safety.

          GUN

     Voiceprint confirmed.

The Robot spins towards John, FIRES an electrical charge - John dodges
at the last instant, the grazing blast burning his silvery suit,
singeing his side, sending into the wall, his gun flying.

          WILL

     Dad!

Will ducks under his mother's arm, scrambles across the bridge.

          MAUREEN

     Will, wait.

The Robot FIRES at the scrambling boy but misses, Will disappearing
down the gunny hatch leading to the lower decks.

DON leaps from his tube atop the Robot's back, trying to grab the
Robot's power source. The mechanical monster electrifies his shell,
sending the Major flying.

The Robot turns to Penny and Maureen. Extends his arms toward them.

Electricity arcing between his claws. The two are done for. Maureen
puts her hand over Penny's eyes.

          MAUREEN

     Look away, baby.

The Robot is about to fire. Suddenly the Robot freezes, his claws
deactivate, his power lights go to stand-by and he stands immobile.

WIDER. Will stands in the b.g., his tiny hacking deck in his hands.

          WILL

     Robot. Return to your docking bay and
     power down.

          ROBOT

     Command accepted.

The Robot turns and begins heading for the elevator. All watch in
amazement. Will grins, a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes.

          WILL

     If the family won't come to the
     science fair, bring the science fair
     to the family.

An EXPLOSION rocks the ship.

          PENNY (OVER)

     Mom, look, it's Doctor Smith.

Penny stands over Smith who lays crumpled in the corner. Maureen grabs
an emergency medi-kit from a wall clamp, tosses it to Penny.

          MAUREEN

     Pulse, respiration and bleeding-

          PENNY

     Basic triage, lock down and
     stabilize. I know the drill.

John is standing, helps Don to his feet.

          WEST

     NEXT picnic, no robots.

Don moves fast to the helm. The main view screen is still closed,
covered by giant metal blast shields.

          WEST

     Communications links are down.

Maureen is at the life sciences console.

          MAUREEN

     Life support is at ten percent.
     Trying to bring secondary systems on

VIDEO MONITOR-POV. Penny is bandaging Smith's head, her bravado barely
masking her fathoml4ss terror.

          PENNY

     Explosions rock the ship. Danger is
     everywhere, 'Yet the Space Captive is
     fearless as she...

A console FLARES. Penny fights back tears, terrified.

     I want to go home now.

Don is at the navigational system.

          WEST

     Rerouting power from the secondary
     couplings. Try it again.

          MAUREEN

     Finding a power tap....

Suddenly the lights go on, the air compressors begin to Hiss.

          MAUREEN

     Life support is back on line.

          WEST

     I can't get the blast shields open.
     We're flying blind.

Penny in working ever Smith, bandaging his head. She runs stimulator
under his nose. Smith begins to stir, COUGHING.

          PENNY

     I've got life signs.

     (wincing)

     Boy, somebody could use a breath
     mint.

West turns, spots Smith for the first time.

          WEST

     (to John)

     Try the emergency back-ups.

Don moves to the fallen figure, lifts him up against the bulkhead.

          WEST

     Smith, what the hell-

          SMITH

     I was making a last minute check ...
     someone hit me from behind.

Don almost buys it. Then he notices Smith's hand, grabs it.

BURN-CLOSE. The reprogramming module's distinctive, foreign signature
seared into his flesh.

          WEST

     Sino-Jordanian technology. You're a
     Goddamned spy.

     (realizing)

     You did this.

Don slams him against the bulkhead, begins dragging him towards the
airlock. The pilot hits a switch. The inner hatch opens.

          SMITH

     Stop. What are you doing?

          WEST

     Dropping some extra weight.

          MAUREEN (OVER)

     Help, somebody. Please.

REVERSE ANGLE

Maureen stands at Judy's freezing tube. The young doctor's cryofield is
sparking on and off.

          MAUREEN

     The thawing engine in broken. can't
     get her out. She's dying.

Smith uses the distraction to palm-slam Don in the chin, knocking him
backwards. Don staggers, goes again for Smith.

          SMITH

     Touch me and the girl dies.

Don freezes in his tracks.

          SMITH

     Your mission physician is indisposed.
     I can save her life. But only if you
     spare mine.

          WEST

     I Don't deal with dead men.

          SMITH

     Kill me, I kill the girl. How much is
     your revenge worth, Major? I will, of
     course, need your word as an officer
     that you will let me live.

Don's decision is lighting fast.

          WEST

     Help her.

          JOHN

     I've got a com signal.

Suddenly the radio SQUAWKS into life.

          RADIO

     ...Is Mission Control. Do you read?
     Jupiter Two this is

          JOHN

     Emergency power's on line. I think I
     can get these blast shields open.

VIEWSCREEN CLOSE. The blast shields part to reveal a giant fiery orb in
their path. They are heading directly for the sun.

          WEST

     Uh-oh.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

Noah stands over the Com. The room is a madhouse.

          NOAH

     Give me a telemetry projection.

Noah looks up at the main monitor. The graphic of the Jupiter Two is
heading towards the graphic of the sun.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

John and Don stand over the Com.

          NOAH (OVER)

     You're way off course. We show you in
     the sun's gravitational pull.

          WEST

     How long do we have?

          NOAH (OVER)

     We count seven minutes before your
     outer hull begins to melt.

DON straps himself into the pilot's chair.

          WEST

     I'm going to try for the Mercury
     Mines.

SMITH stands at the freezing tube, Penny and Maureen assisting him.

          SMITH

     I will need Dr. Robinson's portable
     gurney. I believe it is stored in-

          PENNY

     I'm on it.

Penny races off. Smith begins working the controls to Judy's freezing
tube.

          MAUREEN

     We trusted you.

     (sinking in)

     You tried to kill us all.

          SMITH

     Existence offers us nothing if not
     the opportunity for an endless series
     of betrayals.

     (off her stunned expression)

     There's a world behind the world,
     Professor Robinson. Lie once, cheat
     twice and everything becomes clear.
     Do not mistake my deception for a
     character flaw. It is philosophical
     choice, a profound understanding of
     the universe. It is a way of life.

          MAUREEN

     You're a monster.

          SMITH

     Perhaps. But I am also the only one
     who can save your daughter's life.

Penny reappears, a case in hand. She presses a button and the case
unfolds into a hovering, gyroscopicaly-leveled gurney.

          MAUREEN

     Where's Will?

          PENNY

     He's futzing with that Robot.

          SMITH

     Alright, Penny dear, I need you to
     short the power on my command.

          PENNY

     Does he have to call me dear?

          SMITH

     Professor, if you will assist me in
     lowering the body.

Smith hands Penny a wrench.

          SMITH

     Penny, dear. Now.

Maureen nods. Penny SLAMS the wrench into the power circuit. The
freezing field FLARES and deactivates, the tube swinging open.

LIFESIGN MONITOR-CLOSE. Flatline.

          MAUREEN

     She's dying.

Smith and Maureen lower her onto the gurney.

          SMITH

     Sickbay. Move.

Penny, Maureen and Smith rush the gurney out the blast doors towards
Sickbay just as the ship tilts madly.

AT THE HELM

WINDSCREEN-CLOSE. The sun is growing ever larger.

          WEST

     Unable to re-route to Mercury. The
     sun's pull is too strong.

     (a beat)

     Noah, I need options.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

          NOAH

     Major West we are unable to provide
     contingencies.

     (a beat)

     I'm sorry, Don.

ON SCREEN-THE JUPITER TWO is heading towards the sun.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-SICKBAY

Penny, Smith and Maureen have transferred Judy onto a hi-tech scanning-
bed. A hovering holographic schematic of Judy's physiognomy appears
over her, descends onto her body.

          SMITH

No cardio-pulmonary or respiratory functions.

          MAUREEN

     Body temp at 68 Fahrenheit.

          SMITH

     Get her flight suit off.

Penny unzips the silver material as Smith works the console,
highlighting her holographic heart.

          SMITH

     Clear.

The holographic image of her heart beats once, then is still.

          SMITH

     Again. Clear.

The lights flicker on the bio-console, the holograph winks out.

          SMITH

     Power's down.

          MAUREEN

     We're losing her.

CHAPTER 10: Initiate Hyperdrive
-------------------------------


INT. -JUPITER TWO

DON and John man the Com. The sun is a raging fireball dead ahead.

          JOHN

     I've re-routed all secondary systems
     to the main drive.

          WEST

     She won't budge. Shortest baby sitting
     mission I've ever done.

          JOHN

     My family's not going die in space.

          WEST

     I'm open to suggestions.

          COMPUTER

     Outer hull breach in 30 seconds.

INT.-SICKBAY

Smith begins pumping Judy's chest by hand.

          SMITH

     Come on, child. Fight. Put a little
     heart in it.

Smith steps back, begins precise, staccato blows to Judy's chest.

          SMITH

     The life.. .

     (hit )

     I save ...

     (hit)

     may be

     (hit)

     my own.

Smith stops, presses his ear to her chest - Takes her pulse. Smiles.

          MAUREEN

     Judy? Baby?

A beat. Then Judy opens her eyes, manages a weak smile.

          JUDY

     You should try to look less worried.
     It has a tendency to spook the
     patients.

          MAUREEN

     (to Smith)

     Thank you.

Smith holds her gaze, his eyes almost snake-like.

          SMITH

     You are a good woman, Maureen. Any man
     could see that. I hope I have proven
     the well-being of your family is of
     great importance to me. Perhaps, if
     you convinced your husband to trust
     me...

Maureen stares at him. A beat. She pulls a laser from the wall. Points
it at his forehead.

          MAUREEN

     Stabilize her, Smith. Because you only
     breathe as long as she does.

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE

The ship is shaking in the mighty pull of the sun. Don is struggling to
keep the ship stable.

          COMPUTER

     Heat seal breach in 20 seconds.

          JOHN

     There's got to be some way to get
     through this.

DON stares at him.

          WEST

     That's it.

          JOHN

     What's it?

          WEST

     We can't get away from the sun. So we
     have to go through it.
     The hyperdrive -

          JOHN

     Engage the hyperdrive without a gate,
     we could be thrown anywhere in the
     galaxy

          WEST

     Anywhere but here.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

          ANNIE

     We're getting resident radiation
     distortions from the space craft. She
     must be breaking up.

          NOAH

     Let me see those numbers, Annie.

The Techie hands him a sheet. Noah looks for a beat.

          NOAH

     Son of a bitch. He's powering up the
     hyperdrive.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The saucer is elongating slightly, changing its shape as it prepares to
enter hyperspace.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

BRIDGE

Will scrambles onto the bridge, heads towards John who is working the
main control panel.

          WEST

     Hyperengines coming on line.

          COMPUTER

     Warning. Heat shield breach.

The sun covers the entire windscreen, a furious landscape of flame.

          JOHN

     Hyperdrive at 100 percent. Major, you
     have the Com.

          WEST

     Zero to 20 million miles a second in
     under a minute. Let's see what this
     baby can do.

John takes Will's hand as West engages the hyperdrive.

West, John and Will, are hurled backwards from the sudden acceleration,
sticking to the walls and ceiling respectively.

INT.-SICKBAY

Maureen and Penny watch as Smith swaddles Judy in thermal blanket.
Suddenly, Maureen, Penny, and Smith fly against the walls. Judy is held
in place by the gurney straps.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

The graphic of the space craft is beginning to flicker as it merges
with the graphic of the sun.

          ANNIE

     We can't keep a fix on her, sir. She's
     starting to disappear.

Noah stares at the screen.

          NOAH

     Godspeed.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two flies into the mighty ball of the sun. And just as it
reaches the tallest of the gaseous mountains, the ship becomes
translucent, falling through the orb, elongating and then vanishing in
a sudden star of hyperspace.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

THE WINDSCREEN. The sky breaks apart giving way to a starfield.

EXT.-DEEP SPACE

Quiet. Empty. Suddenly space distorts and, in a sudden flash, a ship
appears, hurling into the darkness. The Jupiter Two.

The Jupiter Two comes to rest at the edge of an alien, twin starred
solar system, near a giant crimson planet.

CHAPTER 11: Lost in Space
-------------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-INFIRMARY

Maureen kneels before Penny and Will, making sure they're okay. Smith
stands silently in the b.g. Judy's gurney is empty. John ENTERS, his
face wrought with fatherly concern.

          JOHN

     Is everyone okay?

          MAUREEN

     All in one piece. Although Major West
     has the most puzzling definition of a
     smooth ride.

          JOHN

     Judy? Where's Judy?

Just then Judy emerges through a door, zipping up her flight suit.

          JUDY

     Boy either I cut down on the coffee
     or sew in a flap. It's hell getting
     in and out of this thing.

          JOHN

     Are you-

          JUDY

     Vitals are normal. Pulse and
     respiration seem to be-

          JOHN

     Baby, are you okay?

          JUDY

     I'm fine Daddy really.

John holds her close, spared a father's worst fear.

          SMITH

     Will every disaster be an excuse for
     familial sentiment? Please tell me
     now so I may gather up a liberal
     supply of space sickness bags.

Don turns towards Smith. Maureen steps between them.

          MAUREEN

     What happened, John? Where are we?

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE

Don in at the navigational holograph, patching sparking wires. The rest
of the crew emerge onto the bridge.

          WEST

     You had me worried, Doc. Nice to see
     you thawed.

          JUDY

     Smart maneuver with the hyper-drive.

          WEST

     A fighter who thinks, what do you
     know? You're just in time for the
     show.

Don makes a connection. The pedestal powers up, a holograph of the
Jupiter Two appearing over its surface.

          WEST

     Computer, map our current location.

HOLOGRAPHIC PEDESTAL-CLOSE. The area around the Jupiter Two is now
filled with a holographic representation of the alien solar system.

          JOHN

     See anything familiar?

Don just shakes his head.

          COMPUTER

     Searching for recognizable
     constellations.

     (a beat)

     Unable to locate.

          JOHN

     This computer has star maps of the
     entire known galaxy.

          PENNY

     We're lost, aren't we?

Judy wraps her arm around her sister.

          WEST

     What the hell is that?

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The nearest planet is starting to glow. Suddenly a
distortion field begins to emanate from the alien world. The edges of
space seem to sear away, leaving a glowing portal.

          JOHN

     Any effect on the ship?

          WEST

     No.

VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. All the planets and constellations beyond the portal
appear to be in different places.

          JOHN

     (off the navigational hologram)

     All the planets have moved.

          WEST

     And where did that come from?

CHAPTER 12: The Proteus
-----------------------


EXT.-SPACE

Breaking the inner edge of the portal, a long silver space needle
catches the light from the dual suns.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The crew man their stations. Only Will is absent as they the ship
maneuver around the portal.

VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. As they, move behind the portal it seems to
disappear, showing only the blackness of space. No ship beyond.

          WEST

     It's gone.

          JOHN

     No. Go back in front of it.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

As the ship moves back in front of the portal, the hole in space is
visible again, the giant probe ship revealed once more within...

          JOHN

     It's a hole in space. A doorway.

          WEST

     A doorway to where?

          JOHN

     If we want to reach that ship, we're
     going to have to find out.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two flies through the pulsing hole in space.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The giant, silver ship looms in the windscreen.

          MAUREEN

     No apparent effects on the ship.

          WEST

     I'm hailing on all frequencies. No
     response.

          JOHN

     There are some markings on the
     starboard side. Can you throw some
     light on her?

          WEST

     Don't know if the exterior spots are
     working.- There we go.

THE WINDSCREEN-CLOSE. Powerful spotlights hit the ship.

WEST AND JOHN-CLOSE. And really surprised.

          WEST

     If this in all a dream, why can't
     there be more girls?

THE SPACESHIP-CLOSE. Essentially a needle covered with metal scallops.
On its hull, under the legend PROTEUS, an American flag.

          WEST

     I've never seen a design like this.
     what are those scales on her hull?

          JOHN

     How could Earth launch a ship this
     massive and neither of us know about
     it? ... It just doesn't make sense.

          WEST

     These scanners are damaged, I'm
     getting inconsistent life signs but
     they may be sensor ghosts.

          JOHN

     Maybe her computer's still up. I'm
     trying standard remote access codes.

ON SCREEN-A docking ring on the giant ship comes to life, giant floods
coming to life, the docking aperture rotating open.

          WEST

     What do you know?

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two heads towards the giant ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

          JOHN

     Can you give me some light on the
     secondary docking ring?

A smaller docking ring is illuminated on the viewscreen.

          WEST

     What do you make of that?

Attached to the starboard docking ring is another, smaller craft. Its
snaking anthropomorphic lines are not of human design.

          MAUREEN

     Boys, I think we're having a close
     encounter.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter moves into the docking ring of the giant ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) a giant THUD as the Jupiter Two docks with the probe.

          ROBOT (OVER)

     Crush.

REVERSE ANGLE. The Robot in rolling in through the doorway, arms waving
wildly before him.

          ROBOT

     Crush! Kill! Destroy!

Don and John are up fast. But the Robot just rolls to a stop. Will
steps from behind the automaton, his hacker's deck in his hand.

He pulls a tiny mic from his deck. Lifts it to his lips.

          WILL

     Crush. Kill. Destroy.

          ROBOT

     Crush! Kill! Destroy!

Will points to several jury-rigged modifications.

          WILL

     I hacked into his CPU, bypassed his
     main operating system and accessed
     his sub-routines. He's basically
     running on remote control.

All stare at him. Penny finally speaks.

          PENNY

     Show off.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-CREW QUARTERS-LATER

Penny stands guard, a rifle in her hand, talking into her recorder.

          PENNY

     And so the Space Captive finds
     herself helping the Robinsons by
     guarding the traitor. And she finds-

Penny's VOICE trails off. Stares out the porthole. Endless space.

          PENNY

     She finds that out here, in the dark
     and cold, she's scared, and she's
     kind of glad they're all together.

Just then Don approaches, a silver bundle under his arm.

          PENNY

     Identify yourself, soldier.

          WEST

     West, Major, United Space Force,
     requesting permission to see the
     prisoner.

Penny steps aside.

          PENNY

     Proceed Major West.

Don smiles, winks at her, going through the door.

          PENNY

     Ouch. Could he be cuter? I don't
     think so.

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

Actually a med-lab. Smith turns to face Don an he ENTERS.

          SMITH

     These quarters are totally
     unacceptable. I demand-

Don tosses his bundle on the seat. A silver flight suit.

          WEST

     We're going to check out the probe
     ship. Maybe we can figure out how
     they got here. And how to get home.

          SMITH

     Ta-ta. Have a wonderful trip.

          WEST

     You're coming with us.

          SMITH

     Out of the question. I'm a doctor not
     a space explorer. You and-

But Don is in his face in a heartbeat.

          WEST

     What you are is a murderous saboteur
     and I am not leaving you on this ship
     so you can do more harm than you've
     already caused.

          SMITH

     I absolutely refuse-

          WEST

     (closer)

     Give me an excuse to kill you.
     Please.

Smith stares at him a beat. Then he smiles, looks to the flight suit.

          SMITH

     Silver always was my color.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS

Will stands in front of the Robot, polishing a blast mark clean.

          WILL

     When boarding a mysterious
     spacecraft, it always pays to look
     your best.

John enters, removes a gun from the weapons locker.

          JOHN

     Deactivate safety.

          GUN

     Voiceprint confirmed. Rifle is
     active.

GUN-CLOSE. A small light goes from red to green.

          JOHN

     You did a good job up there son. You
     saved us all.

          WILL

     Thanks.

An awkward silence hangs between them.

          JOHN

     I know I haven't around much these
     days.That we haven't had time to-

          WEST (OVER)

     Professor, we're ready.

John looks at his boy Will in silent.

          JOHN

     Will, you're the most important thing
     in the world to me. I hope one day
     you'll be able to see that.

With that, John walks out. Will stares after him. Faces the Robot.

          WILL

     Take care of my dad, okay Robot?

Will works his remote, sending the Robot towards the bridge.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

A long dark corridor. Slowly the ambient lights come up. A door opens
to reveal Smith, John, Don, Judy and the Robot, stepping out of the
docking chamber, the airlock closing in the b.g.

          JUDY

     The air is stale. Old.

          SMITH

     That's the smell of ghosts.

Don walks to a computer panel set into the wall. Begins typing.

          WEST

     I'm interfacing with the on board
     computer... Odd.

          JOHN

     Not working?

          WEST

     No, it's just, I don't know, too
     fast. Most of the systems are down.

The Robot rolls deeper into the alien ship. The others follow. More
lights flicker into life, illuminating the long corridor ahead.

          JUDY

     Motion sensors are still working.

          WEST (OVER)

     What do you make of this?

Smith, John and Judy join Don at one of the bulkhead walls.

          JOHN

     Some kind of hieroglyphics.

WALL-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphics are scrawled on the hull wall.
The sketches tell a story.

HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The alien craft docks with the giant ship.

SECOND HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE-A trio of inhuman bipedal stick figures enter
the giant ship.

THIRD HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The shape of a sun or a disc, from which juts
many legs. This final hieroglyph is circled in a clotted red substance.
Don touches the stain.

CHAPTER 13: Exploration
-----------------------


          JUDY

     If I didn't know better I'd say this
     is blood.

          SMITH

     I know an omen when I see one. I
     suggest a hasty retreat.

          WEST

     Just imagine we're retreating in the
     opposite direction. Now, move it.

Don shoves Smith forward with the butt of his laser rifle, the group
heading deeper into the quiet ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will watches through the Robot's POV, toggling to move the automaton
forward. A readout marked AUDIO flashes. Will turns up a volume
control. (OVER) the sound of a slow, steady DRIP.

          WILL

     Dad, do you....

INT.-PROBE SHIP

          ROBOT

     ... Hear something?

The Robot turns, begins heading further down the corridor. (OVER) now
DRIPPING can be heard by all.

          SMITH

     Like the drip, drip, drip of blood..

          WEST

     You really need to shut up.

          JOHN

     (pointing)

     Here.

THE CEILING shows a jagged hole, covered with some kind of viscous
membrane, leading to the dark of a service tunnel above. The membrane
DRIPS steadily onto the floor below.

          JUDY

     That material appears biological.

          SMITH

     Nothing good will come of this.

          WEST

     What makes you such an expert?

          SMITH

     Trust me, Major. Evil knows evil.

          JOHN

     Let's find the bridge. Maybe we can
     get some answers.

They head off. HOLD on the dripping membrane.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen is at the main sensor console working an instrument panel.

Penny is hanging upside down in a harness overhead, using a laser
welder on a giant mass of exposed ceiling circuitry.

          PENNY

     Try it now, Mom.

Maureen throws a switch. The panel lights up, then goes dead.

          PENNY

     Damn.

INT.-SHIP-WALKING

The boarding party stand at the end of the corridor. Don presses a wall
panel. The giant doors hiss open to REVEAL...

INT.-MAIN BRIDGE

Immense. Empty. And battle torn. Sections of the controls have been
blown away. Blast scoring mars the walls.

          JUDY

     What the hell happened in here?

          WEST

     Some kind of fire fight. Look at this
     technology. I've seen some of this
     before. On the drawing boards.

Smith has moved off slightly, wandered over to a STORAGE ALCOVE.
Within, a row of docked Robots, larger and sleeker then ours.

John and Don are powering up the Com, console lights coming on.

          JOHN

     Can you bring up the Captain's log?

          WEST

     The data has degraded. I'm going try
     and gather any fragments I can. There
     isn't much, but ... here we go.

MAIN SCREEN-CLOSE. Fills with snow. Then a figure can be seen. It's
Jab. But his hair is grey.

          WEST

     Jeb.

          JEB

     The hyperspace tracker seems to be
     functioning...

     (static)

     No sign of the Jupiter Two...

          JEB

     (static)

     Have exceeded our mission timetable
     by two...

     (static)

     I'm not willing to give up. Don would
     keep looking for me.

          WEST

     That's it. The rest of the data is
     totally corrupted.

IN THE ALCOVE, Smith frees a power pack from one of the robots. Slips
it into the sleeve cuff of his field suit.

          WEST

     This doesn't make sense. How could
     they launch a rescue mission for us
     when we've only been lost a day?

Judy stands by the life sciences panel.

          JUDY

     I've got something here.

A turning holograph appears over the console panel. A degraded image of
a trembling, viscous pouch. Tiny shapes move within.

          JUDY

     They brought it up from the planet's
     surface. It's seems to be some sort
     of egg sack.

Don notices Smith's standing in the storage alcove.

          WEST

     Smith, step away from there.

          SMITH

     Happy to oblige, Major. Although I
     don't think it's me you should be
     worrying about. But rather this.

In the corner of the ceiling, another membrane covered hole.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is at his station, watching Don and John via the Robot's POV.

          WILL

     I'm detecting motion. Behind you...

INT.-PROBE SHIP BRIDGE

A towering SHADOW shoots past the open doorway.

          JOHN

     After it. Move.

     (to the Robot)

     Bring Smith.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIDOR

Don races down the corridor. The walls are matted with flowering
plants. Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor.

THE SCURRYING SHAPE, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from
behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery.

Don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to a
door. A plaque reads HYDROPONICS LAB. He races inside.

INT.-HYDROPONICS LAB

A jungle. John and Judy arrive behind Don.

          WEST

     This explains where all the plants
     came from.

          JUDY

     Growth like this would take decades.

The Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw.

          SMITH

     Unhand me, you mechanical moron.

Don's eyes fix behind Smith's head.

          WEST

     Don't move.

          SMITH

     I am sick of your terrorism. If you
     are going to kill me, be done with
     it. Otherwise I will insist you treat
     me with the respect and-

          WEST

     (like steel)

     I said don't move.

Smith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's
head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he
pulls from its hiding place a small creature.

About the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf
color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales
of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is watching through the Robot's eyes.

          WILL

     Neat.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN

West stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more
friendly blue. Judy approaches.

          JUDY

     Well, who do we have here?

As the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like,
trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast.

          WEST

     Easy there, little buddy. No one's
     going to hurt you.

          SMITH

     How do you know it won't hurt us?

Don has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small
beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds.

          JUDY

     Looks like you've made a friend. You
     have a good bedside manner, Major.

          WEST

     I'm going to let that one go.

          SMITH

     How charming. Doctor Dolittle of
     outer space.

          JUDY

     Where do you think it came from?

          JOHN

     It's possible this is one of the
     creatures represented in the
     hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It
     must have been their ship attached to
     the other docking ring.

The beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there,
burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH.

          WEST

     It looks like a child.

          SMITH

     If so, my dear Major, what do you
     suppose happened to its parents?

          JOHN

     Let's get back to the bridge.

As they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the
background. Ominous. Unseen.

CHAPTER 14: Giant Spiders!
--------------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO

Penny is still hanging overhead.

          PENNY

     I think I've got it.

The sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status lights
going green. Maureen stares at the monitor.

          MAUREEN

     That's strange.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with
ambient heat. Penny lands beside her.

          PENNY

     Those scales are giving off heat.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE

John is at the Com.

          JOHN

     I've tapped into the internal sensor
     array. Besides us, this ship is
     totally deserted.

          SMITH

     A ghost ship.

Don is sitting with the tiny creature. He pulls a ration pack from his
pocket. Turns it over in his hand.

          WEST

     And the flavor of the day is ...
     banana/beef. Who thinks up these
     combinations?

The creature stares at him intently as he tears open the foil lip,
sucks a bit LOUDLY. Judy can't help but smile at him.

          WEST

     MM. Good.

          SMITH

     Major West, I highly recommend you
     never breed. That by the way is my
     medical opinion.

Don glares at him, hands the tiny creature the pouch. The creature
looks at it, emits a small BLIP, takes a tentative suck. Its eyes widen
in delight as it begins to suck the ration pack.

          WEST

     Little thing was hungry.

          SMITH

     Good Lord, who will - spare us the
     tyranny of the sentimental?

(OVER) a distant, high pitched WHINE.

          PENNY

     Do you hear something?

Suddenly the creature begins to SCREAM, leaping on Smith's back,
clinging to his neck for dear life.

          SMITH

     Get this infernal creature off me.

The WHINE is growing louder. it seems to be coming from above.

THE CEILING-CLOSE. There, in the corner, the membrane covering the hole
seems to be trembling.

          WEST

     This can't be good.

          SMITH

     You have a remarkably keen sense
     of the obvious.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen stands with Penny at the main sensor station.

          MAUREEN

     John, get the hell out of there.

ON SCREEN. The silver disks on the hull of the probe ship are beginning
to move, rising to stand now on spindraled legs.

EXT.-PROBE SHIP

Heads and legs emerging, the disks reveal themselves to be armor plated
spiders. The monsters find viscous holes in the outer hull and push
through, vanishing into the probe ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) a THUD. The Jupiter Two shakes, as if struck.

          MAUREEN

     Give me an external view.

Penny works the console.

ON SCREEN. Spiders are leaping from the probe onto the Jupiter Two.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE

The lizard monkey's SCREAMING has reached new heights of hysteria. A
shape begins to push through the viscous bole in the ceiling.

What bursts in is a monster out of nightmare. Nearly half the size of a
human, shiny metallic body from which wet, spider-like limbs extend. A
fang covered vAw opens below ravenous, green eyes.

Don draws his laser and FIRES, but the blast only reflects off the
metallic surface of its torso, forcing the creature to retract its
limbs and eyes, hiding within its protective shell.

          JOHN

     Evacuate. Now!

The team races for the door as several more spiders drop through the
hole in the ceiling, landing in the bridge and scampering fast towards
our fleeing heros.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-TUNNELS

The boarding party race down the corridor. The spiders are bounding
after them, using walls, floor, and ceiling with equal facility.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is madly working his keyboard, controlling the fleeing Robot.

          WILL

     This joy stick is too slow. Activate
     holographic interface.

A holographic robot appears on the bridge. Will steps inside, the image
now moving with his body. He spins, facing backwards, firing.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

The Robot is holding up the rear, its torso swiveled backwards so it
can retreat and FIRE simultaneously.

The Robot's plasma BLASTS have more effect than-the lasers, blowing the
spiders into tiny pieces of inhuman flesh and metal.

But more monsters are pouring through the holes in the corridor
ceiling, some giving chasing, others swarming injured comrades.

Judy watches as several spiders devour their fallen brethren.

          JUDY

     They eat their wounded.

Our heroes race to a nexus, corridors leading off in all directions.
Spiders are dropping from the ceiling around them.

          JOHN

     Which way?

INT. -JUPITER TWO

WILL-POV. A graphic map flashes within the holograph.

          WILL

     Turn left.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIdOR

          ROBOT

     Now right.

The spiders are swarming, closing fast.

          JOHN

     Got to seal the bulkhead.

          WEST

     The door control is at the other and
     of the corridor.

          JUDY

     The fire sensor.

Judy pulls her gun, FIRES, hitting a ceiling sensor at the end of the
corridor. Blast doors SLAM, sealing out most of the spiders.

DON-CLOSE. Impressed.

BLAST DOORS-CLOSE. Metal teeth begin tearing through the steel.

Our group has made it to the door to the docking bay. They rush in, the
Robot coming through the open doorway last and holding there.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

Don activates the airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening.

The Robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay, FIRING at the
spiders as they come down the hall, blowing them away. More pour
through the now rending blast doors. There are just too many, rolling
towards them now like a single, shifting mass of death.

          SMITH

     Open, damn you.

          WEST

     It's cycling a vacuum check. There is
     no way to speed up the protocols.

          SMITH

     Fools. I warned you not to come
     aboard this cursed craft. You've
     killed us. You've killed us all.

Judy throws him, hard, into the wall.

          JUDY

     Shut up.

          WEST

     Now that's a bedside manner.

The first spiders reach the Robot, leaping onto its metal bull.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen and Penny are at the Com, powering up the engines. Will is
within the holograph, fighting off the spiders.

          WILL

     Charge.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

The Robot's shell electrifies, the spiders recoiling.

The airlock has opened enough for our heroes to duck inside.

          JOHN

     Will, get the Robot in here.

The Robot stands in the open portal, covered by spiders, their fangs
shredding his hull, his electrical charge beginning to SHORT.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is throwing off the monsters, Extending the Robot's antenna spikes
and scanner dishes to skewer spiders that are squeezing by.

          WILL

     I can't move him without letting the
     spiders into the ship.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

          JOHN

     Leave him behind.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

          WILL

     I'm sorry, Robot.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-DOCKING BAY

A spider pushes past the Robot, head slipping around his metallic body,
bent on reaching the airlock and the crew within.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-AIRLOCK

          JOHN

     Seal it. Now!

Don hits a switch just as a spider breaks free, rushing towards the
dropping airlock door. Smith recoils from the swiping talon.

SMITH'S BACK-CLOSE. A tiny rand and beneath, a razor thin incision.

THE DOOR drops, the spider's arm, still twitching, severed inside the
airlock.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The inner airlock door Opens. The crew tumble in.

          JOHN

     Get us out of here.

Don is already powering up the ship's engines as Smith tries separating
himself from the tiny lizard monkey.

          SMITH

     Get this cloying gargoyle off of me.

He throws the beast hard across the bridge. The creature hits the wall,
SCREECHING, begins racing across consoles.

John has strapped in beside Don.

          JOHN

     Get me an external view.

A MONITOR shows the hull of the Jupiter Two. More spiders are leaping
onto the ship, attaching themselves to the hull.

          JOHN

     Prepare to disengage.

THE LIZARD MONKEY skitters up the back of Penny's chair, over her head,
getting tangled in her hair before jumping into her lap.

          PENNY

     Get it off me. Get it off.

Penny in frantically wiping the hair from her face. The tiny creature
on her lap begins a perfect imitation of Penny.

Don releases the docking ring, glances at the Monitor. The hull of the
ship is now entirely covered with spiders.

          WEST

     Initiating separation.

LIZARD MONKEY'S EYES widen in terror as the ship SHAKES, burying its
head in Penny's chest. A beat. Then Penny hugs the tiny beast.

          PENNY

     It's okay. Everything's going to be
     alright.

But she sounds anything but sure.

          WEST

     We're clear. Everybody hang on.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The Jupiter Two's engines BLOW, peeling into the endless night.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) ALARMS sound.

          JUDY

     I think those things were using the
     probe ship as a way to trap food.

          WEST

     That I s probably what happened to
     the monkey's parents. We were going
     to be desert.

          MAUREEN

     But what happened to the crew?

          JOHN

     Nothing good.

          WEST

     We're not out of the woods yet.

ON SCREEN. The hull of the Jupiter Two is covered with the giant
spiders, their teeth cutting through the outer hull.

          WEST

     Let's see how these monsters like a
     hundred thousand volts.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The hull glows with electricity. The spiders fly off into space, their
limbs and heads retracting.

          WEST

     And the crowd goes wild.

          SMITH

     Recall your nightmares from
     childhood, Major. Monsters are rarely
     so easily dissuaded.

(OVER) a THUNK. Then another. A third.

ON SCREEN-The spiders shoot webs from their bellies, attaching to the
Jupiter, land on the hull again, re-extending their limbs, starting to
burrow once more.

          WEST

     Persistent bastards.

          JOHN

     Can you hit them again?

          WEST

     Every time I electrify the hull, I'm
     draining our systems. Once or twice
     more and we're going to be dead in
     space.

          SMITH

     A fate I fear may be inevitable one
     way or another.

Maureen emerges from the airlock holding the spider's severed limb in
metal tongs. Carries it to her life sciences analyzer.

          JOHN

     That's the same expression you had
     when my mother came to stay with us.

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A graphic of the severed spider leg. A small
line begins to extrapolate to the rest of the figure. Musculature and
flesh are drawn in on the screen.

          MAUREEN

     DNA extrapolation - coming up.
     Silicone based. Admantium shell and
     lack of respiratory system suggest an
     ability to live in deep space. Tiny
     front brain implies communal
     relationships. More like bees.

VIEWS CREEN -CLOSE. More and more spider are spiraling from the probe
ship, all heading toward the Jupiter Two.

          WEST

     There are thousands of those things

Maureen is working the COMPUTER.

          MAUREEN

     They may be attracted to heat and
     light.

Don begins typing.

          WEST

     With the right command codes, I can
     light up the probe ship from here.

MONITOR-CLOSE. More spiders are hitting the bull.

          WEST

     Damn. No response.

          JOHN

     Command codes are sequenced. Try the next series.

          WEST

     But they won't work until the next
     fleet of ships are built. That's at
     least two years away.

          JOHN

     Just do it.

Don begins entering command codes.

The mighty probe ship begins to power up, engines glowing red as they
begin their initial BURN.

          WEST

     How did you know?

          JOHN

     Think about it, Don. The ships's
     advanced technology. Your friend
     looking old. What if that ship is
     from our future?

          COMPUTER

     Warning. Outer hull has been
     compromised.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Spiders are eating through the outer hull.

          MAUREEN

     It's not working.

          JOHN

     Can you get the fusion drive on line?

EXT.-SPACE

THE PROBE SHIP'S fusion drives FIRE. A few of the spiders divert back
toward the probe ship. But most still head for the Jupiter.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

          WEST

     Let's turn up the heat.

Don engages the THRUSTERS, grabs the throttle.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two banks toward the probe ship, heading directly for the
wake of the fusion drives.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

          COMPUTER (OVER)

     Warning. Inner hull breach in twenty
     seconds.

          JOHN

     Give them a little encouragement.

          WEST

     Electrifying outer hull ... now.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The outer bull flashes with electricity, the spiders jumping off. Don
pilots the craft directly through the wake of the fusion drive.

The spiders jump off, begin attaching themselves to the nacelles of the
giant probe ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

ON SCREEN the giant spiral of spiders in now heading back towards the
giant probe ship.

          JOHN

     Get us out of here. Fast.

Don looks at John a beat, then he begins working the controls.

          JOHN

     What are you doing?

          WEST

     Never leave an enemy stronghold
     intact. One of your father's first
     rules of engagement.

Don hits a button. On the remote control console a readout begins to
flash. The message is simple: FUSION DRIVE-OVERLOAD.

          JOHN

     Don, stop. That's a direct order. We
     might need to salvage-

          WEST

     This is a military emergency. That
     means I'm in command.

          JOHN

     Don, no. I'm ordering you-

          WEST

     I hate spiders.

Don hits a button. The panel light flashes: OVERLOAD.

          WEST

     Hang on, it I a gonna be a bumpy
     ride.

Don angles the ship away, punching the thrusters as the probe ship's
engines begins to glow.

EXT.-SPACE

The probe ship's nuclear core overloads. The engines begin to glow,
venting plasma and then EXPLODE like a nascent star.

THE BLAST WAVE spreads across space, vaporizing the spiders.

THE BLAST WAVE hits the Jupiter Two.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is buffeted by the shock wave.

          WEST

     I can't hold her.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is knocked into the atmosphere of the giant planet below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Don is struggling to keep control.

          WEST

     We're going down.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is hurling toward the planet's cloud obscured surface.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The windscreen is filled with a RUSHING BLIZZARD.

          WEST

     Can't get the stabilizers on line.

          JOHN

     Pull up. Pull up.

          WEST

     Really? No kidding? Thanks.

WINDSCREEN- CLOSE. The storm clouds suddenly PART TO REVEAL ... A GIANT
SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN RANGE.

Don banks the controls.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship tilts on its side, passing between two snowy peaks, still
plunging towards the planet's wintry surface below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

          WEST

     I'm reading a clearing ahead. I'm
     going to try and make it.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE

The Jupiter Two BLOWS over a carpet of snowy treetops, the canopy of
leaves bursting into flames from the friction of the hull.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The surface is coming up fast.

          WEST

     Got to slow us down.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE

The Jupiter Two hits the surf ace of the water and skips, once twice,
three times across the alien sea.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

          WEST

     Brace for impact!

The ship SMASHES into a crater miles long, PLOWING through rock and
vegetation, finally coming to rest near one of the crater walls.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Still. Automatic fire systems spray gas everywhere. only the dimmest
emergency lights cast any glow.

          JOHN

     Everybody, by the numbers.

Maureen straightens, rubs her neck.

          MAUREEN

     Life Sciences, still breathing.

          JUDY

     Mission medical, I'm alive.

          WILL

     Me too. Robotics, I mean.

          PENNY

     Video Mechanics, okay.

          SMITH

     I'm alive, Major West's poor excuse
     for piloting skills not withstanding.

          WEST

     Let's take a look.

Don hits a switch, the windshield de-icing, becoming clear.

          PENNY

     I don't think we're in Kansas
     anymore.

REVERSE ANGLE

Before them lies the crater, snow covered floor spreading out towards a
distant horizon stained red by two hanging crimson suns.

CHAPTER 15: Follow Orders!
--------------------------


EXT. -ALIEN LANDSCAPE-NIGHT

The moonless sky is filled with an utterly alien starfield. The Jupiter
Two sits near the wall of the crater, its tiny lights fighting the
otherworldly darkness.

          JOHN (OVER)

     You violated a direct order.

INT.-ENGINE ROOM

Cavernous. John and Don stand by the giant drive engines. Don is
holding a cylinder containing a mixture of power chips, some glowing
with radioactive fire, others dull and charred as coal.

          WEST

     About half the core material is
     burned out. We'll never generate
     enough power to break orbit.

          JOHN

     I told you not to blow that ship's
     reactors and you did it anyway.

          WEST

     Come on, Professor, give it a rest. I
     was technically still in command.

          JOHN

     Don't hand me that. I'm commander of
     this mission.

          WEST

     Look, no offense, but you're an
     egghead with an honorary rank. No one
     ever intended you to handle combat
     situations. You're spouting some
     nonsense about- time travel while
     those spiders posed a continuing
     threat. I made a judgement call and
     if I have to I'll make it again.
     Hell, you of all people should
     understand that. If your father were
     here-

          JOHN

     My father is not here. My father is
     dead, killed in one of his combat
     missions you so admire. My family is
     on this ship And you're going to
     follow my orders. Whether you agree
     with them or not. Is that clear,
     Major?

Don's face is right up in John's.

          WEST

     Save the speeches. I like you. But
     the fate of the Earth is at stake
     here. I'm going to do whatever I
     think it takes to ensure the success
     of this mission. With or without your
     help. Is that clear, Professor?

The two are too close to do anything but kiss or fight. Kissing seems
less than likely.

          MAUREEN (OVER)

     Am I interrupting something?

WIDER. Maureen stands in the doorway.

          MAUREEN

     No. Really. I think you two should go
     ahead and slug it out. I mean, here
     we are stranded on an alien world and
     you boys want to get into a pissing
     contest. So please, go for it. I'll
     have Judy down here in a heartbeat to
     declare you both unfit and I'll take
     over this mission. Now I don't want
     to hear another word from you two
     until you can play nice. Is that
     clear?

          JOHN WEST

     Maureen- Listen-

          MAUREEN

     Not another word.

     (a beat)

     Better. Now if you've finished hosing
     down the decks with testosterone, I
     suggest you come with me. I may have
     found a way to get us off this
     planet.

Maureen turns on her heal and EXITS. The two men exchange a look.

          WEST

     Wow.

          JOHN

     Tell me about it.

They head after her.

CHAPTER 18: Danger Will! (Out of Sequence in screenplay.)
------------------------

INT:-WILL'S CABIN

Will sits working over his hacker's deck. (OVER) STATIC.

          WILL

     Can you hear me? Robot?

Will tunes the deck. More STATIC. Then...

          ROBOT

     Systems error. Robot unable to
     register neural net outputs. Unable
     to locate motor controls. Unable-

          WILL

     Calm down. Your body was destroyed in
     the conflict with the space spiders.
     Do you remember?

          ROBOT

     Affirmative.

          WILL

     But I downloaded your neural net.

          ROBOT

     Robot tried to destroy the Robinson
     family. Why would Will Robinson save
     Robot's personality? Your actions do
     not compute.

          WILL

     I guess sometimes friendship means
     acting with your heart, not your
     head.

          ROBOT

     Logic error. Friendship does not
     compute.

          WILL

     Don't worry, Robot. Im going to build
     you a new body. I promise.

Will turns to face a pile of pirated components from various par of the
ship. He lifts a circular bubble of diodes. Smiles.

          WILL

     Mom always said I should try to make
     new friends.

CHAPTER 15: Follow Orders! * return to CHAPTER
--------------------------


INT.-BRIDGE

Maureen stands at her life sciences station with John and Don.

          MAUREEN

     The atmosphere here can sustain human
     life. I've located 500 Rads
     radioactive material a mile north.

          JOHN

     That's at least what we'd need to get
     the core functioning again.

John looks out the viewscreen at the alien night. Turns to Don.

          JOHN

     We'll set off at daybreak. it'll be
     safer. Those are my orders, Major.

          WEST

     I agree with your recommendation,
     Professor.

          MAUREEN

     DŽtente is a beautiful thing.

INT.-SICK BAY

Judy examines the lizard monkey. Penny strokes the tiny creature,
producing a string of BLIPS.

          PENNY

     What's the diagnosis, Doc? Is it
     cowboy or ballerina on Halloween?

          JUDY

     Right now she's a girl. But I think
     your little pal here is from a
     self-replicating species. At
     different stages of life she, or he,
     probably alternates sexes.

          PENNY

     Imagine the savings on dating outfits
     alone.

The tiny creature has begun playing with an aural scanner.

          PENNY

     Can I keep her?

          JUDY

     Penny, you've never taken care of a
     thing in your life besides yourself.

          PENNY

     Please. She's all alone. I promise
     I'll look after her. She needs me.

          JUDY

     ...The moment you misplace her, or
     forget to feed her, we leave her on
     this planet where she can live in the
     wild. I'm not kidding Penny.

And with that Judy EXITS. Penny sits, stroking the tiny creature.

          PENNY

     We're both a long way from home,
     aren't we little one?

The creature makes a tiny BLIP.

          PENNY

     That's what we'll call you. Blip.

Blip reaches out, touches a green ribbon around Penny's wrist.

          PENNY

     You like that?

Penny takes the ribbon off, ties it around Blip's wrist. Blip looks up,
eyes glowing. Penny caresses the tiny creature's cheek.

          PENNY

     Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

The creature reaches up, touches Penny's cheek. Her tiny tongue trying
to imitate Penny's words of comfort.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Judy stands, just out of sight, watching her sister, smiling.

CHAPTER 16: Alien World
-----------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-MED LAB

Don shoves an indignant Smith into the room, adjusts a newly installed
security panel in the wall.

          SMITH

     Remove that lock this instant. I
     shall not be caged like some animal

          WEST

     (lethal)

     I gave my word I'd let you live. I
     never said for how long.

          SMITH

     These quarters will be fine.

Smith stares at him a beat.

          SMITH

     Tell me, Major West. Are you really
     confident in Robinson's ability to
     guide us? If I were set free, I would
     support your right to command. With
     minimal force, we could take this
     ship and assure this mission
     continues under your leadership.

          WEST

     ...My God Smith, you're right. How
     could I have been so blind? I'll just
     run and get you a gun so we can
     hijack the ship. Okay?

          SMITH

     Sarcasm is the recourse of a weak
     mind.

          WEST

     I'm hiding the pain. Really.

And with that West leaves.

Smith tries the door. Locked. Then, from one cuff of his field suit, be
removes the control belt he stole from the probe ship.

          SMITH

     I assure you, Major West. Your pain
     has just begun.

Smith moves about the room, lifting small bits of metal, creating an
impromptu set of tools with which to alter the control bolt.

PAN DOWN. HOLD on SMITH'S BACK. Beneath the rend in his suit, the tiny
tear in his flesh is now covered with tiny, alien scales.

INT. -BRIDGE-NIGHT

Judy sits in one of the command chairs over a the remains of a meal,
sipping water, staring out into the alien night.

          WEST (OVER)

     Star light, star bright...

          JUDY

     A million strange stars and only one
     wish. I wish we were home.

Don comes and sits in the co-pilot's chair beside her.

          JUDY

     I never thought a sky could look so
     alien. ...We really are lost.

          WEST

     When the first sailors circled the
     globe and saw a brand new sky, they
     thought they had sailed off the edge
     of the earth. But they were really
     just around the corner.

          JUDY

     (smiles)

     We just billow our sails and let the
     wind blow us home, Is that it Major?

          WEST

     So those sailors found familiar
     shapes in the stars to make the skies
     more friendly, to help them find
     their way.

Don turns on a monitor below the viewscreen. MONITOR-CLOSE. It shows
the star-field above. He lifts a light-tipped stylus.

          WEST

     That's how constellations were born.

Don begins to draw on the screen, connecting the stars like dots in a
children's book. Slowly, a familiar porcine face takes form.

          WEST

     Porky the wise and mighty Pig.

Judy LAUGHS. She takes the stylus. Begins to draw.

          JUDY

     The great bucktoothed Bunny... Bugs.

Don smiles. Judy can't help but smile back. Their faces are close.

          WEST

     So, my quarters or yours?

          JUDY

     Excuse me?

          WEST

     We are the only single man and woman
     of consenting age in the galaxy. How
     much more of a set up do you need?

          JUDY

     So you figure just dispense with the
     pleasantries, get down to business?

          WEST

     You have a way with words, Doctor.

          JUDY

     (provocative)

     Right here? On this console?

Don moves his face to hers, only a breath apart.

          WEST

     Here would be fine.

Judy smiles sweetly.

DON-CLOSE. Lips parting. Suddenly water begins to pour down over his
head. His eyes open wide. Judy holds her empty glass in hand.

          JUDY

     Next time, fly slower.

She rises, walks off, leaving Don mopping his brow.

INT.-JOHN & MAUREEN'S QUARTERS

Maureen sits on the edge of her bed brushing her hair as John activates
the automated security systems.

          JOHN

     What was I thinking, bringing us all
     out here into space?

          MAUREEN

     The world needed saving. You were the
     right man for the job.

          JOHN

     But solving the world's problems
     doesn't leave much time for the
     people you love, does it?

          MAUREEN

     Did you get any time with Will?

          JOHN

     Now he's decided he can rebuild the
     robot. Wants to show me his designs.
     I've got too much to do-

          MAUREEN

     Funny creatures, men. You try so hard
     not to be your fathers, end up making
     the same mistakes. Will adores you.
     He needs your attention.

          JOHN

     We can't get off this planet much
     less back on course. I don't have
     time to...

          MAUREEN

     John, just listen to him. it doesn't
     matter what he's saying. Just listen.
     Sometimes, at least in the eyes of
     their fathers, little boys have to
     come first.

          JOHN

     As soon as we get back into space,
     we're going to spend some real time
     together. I promise.

Maureen looks out the window. A long beat. Then she smiles.

          JOHN

     What?

          MAUREEN

     It's nice to have our family under
     one roof. Even if we had to go half
     way across the galaxy to manage it.

John presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked
orbs of three glowing moons. Maureen smiles.

          JOHN

     How would you feel about a little
     late night tutorial, Professor?

John moves to her, begins pulling her down, out of FRAME.

          MAUREEN

     Mm. That's new. What are you doing?

          JOHN

     Going for extra credit.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-NIGHT

The ship sits on the alien landscape.

          MAUREEN (OVER)

     Good night John.

          JOHN (OVER)

     Good night Maureen.

          WILL (OVER)

     Good night Judy.

          PENNY (OVER)

     Good night Will.

          JUDY (OVER)

     Good night Penny.

          WEST (OVER)

     You guys have got to be kidding.

CHAPTER 17: The Core
--------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-MORNING

Will comes up on the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the
morning. He stumbles to the viewscreen.

WILL-CLOSE. His eyes widen with shock.

          WILL

     Oh man.

REVERSE ANGLE

A giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship.
Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees.

INT.-BRIEFING ROOM

The crew gathers at the table. (OVER) a RUMBLING. The ship shakes.

          PENNY

     What are those rumblings? They've
     been happening all morning.

          JUDY

     How can half the landscape have grown
     up overnight?

          JOHN

     Okay, let's get settled. Maureen?

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A geothermal analysis shows the giant plates
that make up this world appear mismatched.

          MAUREEN

     It's impossible. But this planet's
     geothermic plates don't match up.

          JOHN

     I was afraid of this.

Al1 eyes turn to John.

          JOHN

     I think these tremors are the result
     of opening and closing doorways.

          PENNY

     Doorways to where?

          JOHN

     The future.

          SMITH

     Perhaps the Professor was hit on the
     head when we landed.

          JOHN

     Remember the portal that lead us to
     the probe ship? What if we crossed a
     into a time years after Earth sent a
     rescue mission.

          WEST

     You're not serious? Time travel is
     impossible.

          WILL

     No it's not. It's just improbable.
     Like hyperdrive was a hundred years
     ago. Nothing's really impossible.

          JOHN

     This world could be riddled with
     doorways to the future.

          WILL

     So if we walk into that forest
     outside, we're really just walking
     into this crater years from now.

          MAUREEN

     Geological plates from different
     times wouldn't fit together. That
     would explain the tectonic mismatch.
     But doorways in time, John?

          JOHN

     If these portals are opening and
     closing, part of some cascading,
     natural phenomenon, they could be
     tearing this planet apart

          WILL

     These portals are exactly what I
     predicted my time machine would do.
     What if the doorways aren't natural?
     A machine that bends space, like our
     hyperdrive, could be modified to bend
     time as well. What if someone on this
     world has built a device?

          JOHN

     Son, I appreciate your input but now
     isn't the time for flights of fancy.

          WILL

     You never listen to me. Not ever.

And with that Will storms out. John stares after him a beat, sorely
wanting to follow. (OVER) another RUMBLE.

          JOHN

     There's no telling how long before
     this planet breaks up entirely.

     (rising).

     Don and I are going to locate the
     radioactive material for the core.
     Get the ship ready to go. We may have
     very little time.

INT. -BRIDGE

John, suited up, heads for the open front hatch when he spots Will
sitting alone in the Com chair, tinkering with his deck.

          JOHN

     Aren't you coming out to say goodbye?

Will just shakes his head.

          WILL

     You're always leaving. What if...

Will looks away, finally giving voice to his worst fear.

          WILL

     What if one time you don't come
     home...

John stares at his son, unsure what to say, the boy's anguish so deep
and apparent. He reaches into his shirt, takes off his dog tags.

          JOHN

     Whenever your grandfather went away
     on a mission, held leave these with
     me. For safe keeping. And when he got
     home I d always be waiting to give
     them back.

He lifts the chain and places it around the boy's neck.

          JOHN

     I'm coming back Will. I promise.

Will is silent. John touches the boy's hair, then walks out. A beat.
Will looks up after his father, fingering the dog tags.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The Robinsons, all except Will, stand-gathered around the front of the
ship. Don has a small tracking device in his hand.

          WEST

     I've got a fix on the radioactive
     material. It's through the portal.

          JOHN

     We'll just have to hope the doorways
     remain stable.

          JUDY

     These crater walls are disabling the
     com-links. You won't be able to
     communicate with the ship.

(OVER) the ground shakes again.

          Maureen

     Come home to me, Professor.

          JOHN

     I love you, wife.

John kisses her. Don looks at Judy.

          JUDY

     I'm going to regret saying this, But
     try to get back in one piece.

          WEST

     This is kind of a kiss for luck
     occasion, wouldn't you agree, Doc?

          JUDY

     See. I'm regretting it already.

     (coy)

     Kisses have to be earned. Say
     goodbye, Blip.

Blip reaches up and touches John's face. Then her CHIRPS form a rough
approximation of the words Penny taught her.

          BLIP

     Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

          JOHN

     You take care of her, Penny.

     (kisses her head)

     Take care of you too, baby.

Then the two men bead off, towards the portal and forest beyond.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Smith stares out the cabin window. PUSH IN as

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

          SMITH

     Yes, enjoy your moments of trite
     familial bonding.

He turns, heads back to his table, transformed now, into a makeshift
lab, the stolen control bolt in mid-modification.

          SMITH

     Because they will be your last.

INT.-WILL'S CABIN

The beginnings of Will's home-made robot sits on the table. WILL is in
the f.g. riffling his PERSONAL CARGO container.

Penny ENTERS, an assortment of small electronic devices, hairclips, and
other metal and electronic objects. Dumps them on the table.

          PENNY

     That's everything even close to
     nonessential. Even my bellybutton
     ring.

          WILL

     Thanks, Pen.

          PENNY

     You want to come on a land survey?

But Will just shakes his head, sulky.

          PENNY

     Look, what does dad know? Maybe
     someone did build a time machine.

She ruffles his hair. Disappears. Will activates a CPU speaker.

          ROBOT

     Robot is on line.

(OVER) a KNOCKING has begun. WILL looks up, puzzled.

          WILL

     It sounds like old morse code.


Chapter 18: Danger Will!
------------------------


INT.-CORRIDOR

Will walks down the corridor. (OVER) The KNOCKING continues. Will
follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of Smith's prison.

Smith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table, hammering
out the code with his boot. He beckons Will inside.

Will shakes his head. Smith begins TAPPING again.

          WILL

     (sounding out the code)

     Danger.

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

The door slides open and Will ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand.

          WILL

     You said someone is in danger.

          SMITH

     We all are. You are wise to arm
     yourself.

Smith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy.

          WILL

     This gun is set to fire for me only
     so don't try anything funny.

Smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going
instead to the window and opening the blast shield.

          SMITH

     William, you misjudge me. I only want
     to help you.

          WILL

     Help us? You tried to kill us all.

          SMITH

     But now our fates are intertwined. if
     your father and that idiot West fail,
     I will have no chance of getting
     home. It is in my best interests they
     succeed. And I always follow my best
     interests.

Smith gazes out at the exotic terrain. (OVER) an inhuman WAIL.

          SMITH

     What monsters roam these alien wilds?
     Fools. To set off blindly across this
     savage land. Much as I hate to admit
     it, it will be harder to manage
     without them.

          WILL

     What are you talking about? They'll
     be back. They'll be okay.

Smith is silent. A long, lethal beat.

          WILL

     Someone should go after them.

          SMITH

     Will, I forbid it. You're a boy. A
     clever one, certainly, but a child
     nonetheless. This planet is likely
     full of predators. Even if you found
     them, what if they're hurt, ravaged,
     dying, what good could you do?

          WILL

     But you're a doctor.

Smith turns away, hiding his smile.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY

Judy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater wall,
shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds.

          JUDY

     It's impossible.

          MAUREEN

     Not really. Geologists have
     speculated that Dimondium might be
     naturally occurring in many older
     worlds. Part of a biosphere's way of
     rejuvenating itself.

          JUDY

     This one is ten times more powerful
     then that on Alpha Prime. There's
     enough here to save Earth.

Penny stands in the f.g. with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples,
talking into her video recorder.

          PENNY

     After much deliberation, the Space
     Captive has decided to accept her new
     role as member of the crew. The
     Robinsons, after all, can  obviously
     use her help...

Blip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground.

          PENNY

     (flaring)

     Now look what you've done. Stop
     hanging all over me.

Blip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the
edge of the forest. She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick
brush..

          PENNY

     Blip. Wait. I'm sorry. Damn.

Penny heads after the creature. HOLD on her recorder. Forgotten.


CHAPTER 19: A Different Future
------------------------------


EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY

Will and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation
tracker in his hand.

          WILL

     I've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon.

Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves
moving in the wind like an azure sea.

          WILL

     Wow, that's Mom's favorite color.

          SMITH

     How droll.

(OVER) a tremendous RUMBLING. The WIND ROARS. Suddenly, the air in the
distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them,
flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within.

          SMITH

     Run, child, run.

Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the
rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the
distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes.

SMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing
beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown.

          SMITH

     Will? Will?

No sign of the boy. Then, from behind a tree, Will appears.

          WILL

     Wow!

The field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the
flowers a deep red. Will rushes across the rip in space.

          SMITH

     William, wait!

          WILL

     See, over here I'm in the future.

(steps back towards Smith)

     Here I'm in the past. Don't worry.
     If my theories are correct, these
     doorways should remain stable, for
     a while anyway.

          SMITH

     I can barely contain my glee. Why
     aren't you aging like the plants?

          WILL

     That's just an effect of the portals
     forming. Once they stabilize you can
     cross from one time to another
     just like stepping between two
     rooms.

     (off his tracker)

     Dad's signal is this way. Come on,
     Doctor Smith.

Will takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold.

SMITH-POV. Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing
crimson. Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared.
Younger. The sky, bright. Will has run deeper into the brush.

Smith notices something by his feet. He clears away the brush,
revealing shapes beneath the foliage. His expression darkens.

          WILL (OVER)

     What did you find?

Will has returned.

          SMITH

     Come, come, son, no time for
     distractions. Let's move on.

Smith shoves Will on, the boy unable to see what Smith saw.

PAN DOWN. Headstones. Each bears a marking, the names still legible.
Maureen, Penny and Judy Robinson.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY-PRES

John and Don emerge from the brush. They have come to one of the crater
walls. John looks from the rock face to his tracker.

          JOHN

     Damn.

          WEST

     Damn? Damn is not good.

          JOHN

     The radiation signature we've been
     tracking. it's a  ghost. A
     reflection from the Jupiter Two
     bouncing off the ore in these walls.
     There's no core material here.

(OVER) a sudden RUMBLING. The ground shakes. The ROAR of WIND. A time
portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the
crater aging and crumbling in it's wake.

John and Don race away from the distortion, ducking falling trees, roll
clear as the portal stabilizes, now a fixed doorway to a darker, more
deserted future.

          JOHN

     The ship's back that way. we have to
     go through.

EXT.-BRUSH-DAY-PRESENT

Penny is pushing through the forest.

          PENNY

     Blip? I'm sorry. Blip?

She spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance. Blip SNIFFS the
ground, runs a few steps. SNIFFS again. Looks up. There, before Blip is
another glittering hole in time. The forest beyond is far thicker, the
sky red. Blip steps through the portal.

          PENNY

     Blip, wait.

Penny goes to the edge of the portal, stares at the monstrously tall
trees beyond. A beat. Then she steps through, following.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE

Penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs and
caverns cut into the crater wall.

BLIP is standing over a large circular stone, hopping up and down,
CHIRPING and BLIPPING madly.

          PENNY

     Blip, you can't run off like that.

(closing on the stone)

     What the-?

THE STONE-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant rock,
their images the same style as those on the probe ship.

HIEROGLYPH ONE-CLOSE. A mighty battle in space is depicted.

          PENNY (OVER)

     Some kind of fight, in space. It
     almost looks like the probe ship
     Major West blew up.

HIEROGLYPH TWO-CLOSE. A fiery star falls to the planet's surface.

          PENNY

     That could be the Jupiter Two crash
     landing.

HIEROGLYPH THREE-CLOSE. Here a dark haired beauty holds a single lizard
monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's.

Suddenly BLIP begins to SHRIEK. (OVER) RUSTLING leaves.

SHAPES are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms
dropping to the ground. Five figures suddenly de-camouflage. Lizard
monkeys, two large, two smaller.

Directly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages. Fully
grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height. Around the creature's
wrist is something odd. An old, tattered green ribbon.

BLIP begins to SCREAM and SHRIEK.

          PENNY

     Blip, no!

Too late. Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. The beast
could slap Blip away like a fly. But the creature doesn't resist, just
stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness.

Blip looks at the ribbon in his hand. Then at the one around her wrist.
Save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical.

The giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw
reaching out, touching her face. The beast begins stroking Penny's
cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort.

          GIANT BLIP

     Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

Penny stares up in stunned wonder.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Don and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more
desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon.

          JOHN

     We should be able to see the ship.

Something catches the light on the ground beside them. Don reaches down
and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand.

METAL-CLOSE. On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency.

          WEST

     Could these be from the probe?

          JOHN

     Corroded. This metal is decades old.

Don finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand.

          WEST

     It's not possible.

WRECKAGE-CLOSE. The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two.

          WEST

     What kind of nightmare is this?
     Where the hell are we?

          JOHN

     No, Major, when the hell are we?

Suddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying.
John ducks and rolls, FIRING his laser from behind the cover of a rocky
mound. John goes up to take another SHOT, is bit with a powerful
electrical blast, falling hard. Still.

REVERSE ANGLE

Rolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and
apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Will and Smith are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given
way to desert. The suns hang low in the crimson sky.

          WILL

     I feel like we got turned around.

          SMITH

     Just follow your father's signal,
     young William.

          WILL

     Oh shit.

          SMITH

     A boy of your intelligence shouldn't
     swear.

          WILL

     (pointing)

     Look.

          SMITH

     Oh. Shit, indeed.

REVERSE ANGLE. At the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of
the Jupiter Two. The lower sections are gone, the hull scarred, open to
the sun.


                CUT TO:

JOHN-CLOSE. Stirring to consciousness.

WIDER

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE

Or what is left of it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers
Shattered monitors. An awful history-told in torn metal. John is
slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him.

          VOICE (OVER)

     Well, well. All things really do
     come to he who waits.

A FIGURE sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow.

          JOHN

     What is this place?

          FIGURE

     Why Professor, the shock must have
     scrambled your brain. Look around
     you. Don't you recognize the spot?
     You've come home.

          JOHN

     This can't be...

But even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is.

          JOHN

     What have you done to the ship.
     ...Where's my family?

          FIGURE

     Your family is dead. Dead and in the
     ground.

          JOHN

     No!

          FIGURE

     What fickle consort in memory. Time
     dims certain images while others
     shine clear and bright as yesterday.

The figure stands, light hitting his face. Late thirties. Long blond
hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. Eerily familiar.

          FIGURE

     I'll never forget that morning.
     Twenty years ago. What was it you
     said? I'll be back. I promise. But I
     knew better. You never came home.

The figure walks to one of the burned out panels.

          FIGURE

     Without you, your family never had a
     chance. A few spidersv survived the
     destruction of the probe ship. They
     reached the planet and attacked. I
     can still hear the women scream.

          JOHN

     Who are you?

The figure walks forward, into the light. Stands there a moment. Then
he lifts something hanging around his neck. Tarnished metal, old but
familiar. John's father's dog tags.

          FIGURE

     Don't you recognize me, Dad? It's
     me. I'm your son. Will.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES-DAY

Maureen and Judy, lasers drawn, are pushing through the brush.

          JUDY

     Penny? Penny?

The four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny.

          MAUREEN

     Penny? Baby, are you alright?

Penny rises, steps forward, carrying Blip. The other beasts hang back,
their faces genuflecting, almost reverential.

          PENNY

     It's okay, Mom. They're not going to
     hurt us. it's like  they think I'm
     their princess or something.


           CUT TO:

EXT.-CRATER CAVES -EVENING-FLITURE

Judy is examining the palm of the largest beast as Maureen scrutinizes
the images graven into the giant stone.

          JUDY

     Best as I can tell this whole clan
     was spawned by this single creature.

     (to the beast)

     We've been a busy girl haven't we?
     But...

          MAUREEN

     Speak, doctor.

          JUDY

     Each creature seems to have unique
     corpuscular patterns on their palms.
     As individual an fingerprints, no
     two alike. Except...

          MAUREEN

     Except the prints on this giant
     creature and our little Blip
     match exactly. Don't they?

          JUDY

     How did you know?

          MAUREEN

     Because, I think Blip and our friend
     here are actually one and the same.

Penny and Judy stare at her in wonder.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

The Robot, shoving John with one claw, carrying Don in the other,
follows Older Will into the giant room.

          OLDER WILL

     Father, I give you ... eternity.

          WIDER

War torn and pirated. A pit of molten lava bursts through the floor
above which floats a giant ball of silvery liquid held suspended by the
pulsing field of the hyper-drive. Tendrils of fire strain towards the
bubble. As they EXPLODE into the silver liquid, images form within the
sphere, nearly coherent, then gone.

A tracked gantry stretches from the floor, leading out over the bubble.
At the end of the track a crow's-nest of COMPUTERS SHOOTS a single
laser down into the center of the bubble.

          WEST

     (coming to)

     . . .ouch. Who ordered me that last
     drink? What the hell is going on?

          JOHN

     I think we crossed into our own
     future. We've come back to the
     Jupiter Two decades after we left.

          OLDER WILL

     Look father, what my flights of
     fancy have wrought. I used your
     hypergate to build my time machine.

Will moves to a control console at the base of the giant gantry.

          OLDER WILL

     Over the years I have struggled in
     vain to harness the awesome power of
     time. All my experiments at creating
     a stable doorway have been futile.
     Until now. Today you will witness my
     ultimate triumph.

Will hits a button. A generator opens, revealing a glowing cylinder of
core material incrementally descending into the console.

          WEST

     The core material. if we could get
     that back to our Jupiter Two...

          JOHN

     The doorways in time that led us
     here must be a side effect of his
     machine coming on line. Like streams
     running into the ocean....

          OLDER WILL

     Once this core material in fully
     introduced into the control console,
     I will open a doorway stable enough
     for one person to take one trip
     through time and space as well.
     Today, I will change history.

Will turns a switch on the control console. (OVER) More TREMORS. The
laser beam's intensity grown, and in the corridor cut by the beam into
the bubble images begins to stabilize. Images of Earth.

          OLDER WILL

     I will return home, to the very day
     you took us on this cursed mission.
     I'll stop us from taking off. I'll
     do what you never could. I'll save
     the family. I'll save us all.

          JOHN

     Look around. Your machine is ripping           this
planet apart. What if the force
     wave you ride home has the same
     effect on Earth? What if, in getting
     home, you destroy Earth in the
     process?

A beat. Then Will turns away, goes back to work.

          OLDER WILL

     I'm going home. I'm going to save
     the family.

          JOHN

     Will, I'm your father. You've got to
     listen to me-.

          OLDER WILL

     Let me tell you about my father. My
     father was a walking ghost. Never
     there when I needed him. He dragged
     his family into deep dark space and
     lost them there. My father is not
     coming to the rescue.

CHAPTER 20: Spiders Sting
-------------------------


EXT.-ALIEN PLAnet-EVENING-FUTURE

Will and Smith are closing on the battered ship. Smith puts his hand on
the boy's arm, holding him back.

          WILL

     We've got to go inside.

          SMITH

     Slow down, now. We can't know what
     waits inside that ravaged craft. But
     we can be confidant it is nothing
     good. And I for one am frightened.

          WILL

     But Dad's in there.

          SMITH

     Will, listen to me. I have crossed
     this world with you, found your
     father as promised. But I can't let
     you go in there unarmed.

          WILL

     But I've got a gun.

          SMITH

     If we go forward, the barer of that
     weapon must be ready to kill. Murder
     is a skill, one which I have
     developed and, luckily dear boy, you
     have not. Look inside your heart,
     Will. Are you truly capable of
     taking a life? If not, then I ask
     you now, put your faith in me. Give
     me your trust. Give me that gun.

Will stares him. Pulls free the pistol. Thumbs the lock pad.

          WILL

     Enable gun for all users.

          GUN

     Voiceprint confirmed.

Will hands Smith the gun.

          SMITH

     Finally.

Smith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple.

          SMITH

     A brief lesson in survival on this
     world or any other. Never trust
     anyone. Remember it into your old
     age, should you have one.

     (shoving him forward)

     Now move!

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

John stands facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the
control panel and the descending core material.

          JOHN

     We can go back across the portals to
     the past, to the functioning Jupiter
     Two, where your mother and sisters
     are still alive. We can use this
     core material to escape together.

          OLDER WILL

     And then what? All of us lost in
     space. Don't you see? I can do what
     you never could. I can save us all.

Don has edged his way to the descending core material.

          SMITH (OVER)

     I'm afraid not.

     Through the doorway comes young
     Will, Smith walking behind him, hand
     on his shoulder, gun to his head.

          SMITH

     Never fear. Smith is here.

          JOHN

     Will, I. . .

          SMITH

     Don't move, Professor Robinson or
     this rather peculiar family reunion
     will be tragically brief.

     (off Don)

     I'll ask you to step away from that
     console, Major.

Don stares at him a beat. Then obliges, walking over to join John.
Smith approaches the Robot.

          SMITH

     Well, well, some of us just don't
     know when to stay dead.

Smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt.

          SMITH

     I borrowed this from the probe ship
     in hopes of taking over the helm
     once we were in flight. But I seem
     to have found a better use instead.

Smith slaps the bolt on the Robot's CPU. The automaton's arms go up,
then fall limp. Docile.

          SMITH

     Let's try this dance again. You are
     the puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do
     get it right this time.

Smith activates the bolt. The Robot powers up once again.

          SMITH

     Robot, enable electric disrupters.

The Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. Smith smiles.

          SMITH

     Now that's a good gargantuan.

Smith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head.

          SMITH

     Say goodbye to your past. You're
     future lies with me. I'm going home
     in your place.

Smith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring
at the time machine, eyes wide with awe.

          WILL

     You did it. Just like I imagined.
     Re-routed the hypercore. But the
     natural power source, the delivery
     system. I never thought of those.

Older Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger
self. Touches his hair.

          OLDER WILL

     You will. The future is never what
     it looks like when you're ten.

          SMITH

     Heartwarming. Nauseatingly
     sentimental but heartwarming.

Smith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will.

          SMITH

     We certainly could have aged better,
     I must say Now, show me how your
     little time machine works.

But Will just smiles.

          SMITH

     An odd moment for mirth, don't you
     think? What are you grinning at?

          OLDER WILL

     Look around you, Doctor. At this
     hostile world. Do you really think a
     boy could have survived all alone?

SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled. Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be
moving, shifting. A VOICE comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar.

          VOICE (OVER)

     Never fear, Smith is here.

The shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and
legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Hello, Doctor, how nice to see me
     again after all these years.

Smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled legs,
goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye.

          SPIDER SMITH

     The spider's sting had some
     unexpected side effects.

Spider Smith flexes his three jointed arm.

          SPIDER SMITH

     But my unique gifts gave me an
     advantage in this quarrelsome world.

Spider Smith reaches out and caresses Will's cheek. Turns  to John.

          SPIDER SMITH

     After the women were savaged, I
     became the father Will never had.

He grabs Smith's arms and begins to move him about like a marionette,
engaging in a bizarre dance with himself.

          SPIDER SMITH

     (bending him)

     But you, Doctor. Your crude ambition
     fills me with self-loathing.

     (twisting him)

     You see I have looked within me and
     what I see is you.

With that Spider Smith lifts Smith over his head and hurls him like
torpedo through a torn hole in the hull, towards the rocks beyond.

          SPIDER SMITH

     I never liked me, anyway.

Spider Smith turns to face the Robot.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Kill them all.

          OLDER WILL

     No.

          SPIDER SMITH

     But my dear boy, once the doorway in
     time stabilizes, this planet is
     going to come apart at the seams.

Smith throws the back of one hand over his forehead in a parody of a
twenties starlet.

          SPIDER SMITH

     I am willing to perish here on this
     world for the sake of your most
     noble mission. But your selfish
     father will only try to stop you.

His head comes forward, neck elongating so he faces WILL.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Once your mission is complete, none
     of this will have happened anyway.
     So why not just dispose of them?

But Will's gaze is impassive. Spider Smith actually SIGHS.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Very well. Robot, take them inside
     the ship and keep them there. If
     they move, then kill them.

ECT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE

Maureen and Judy are examining the heiroglyph stone. The ground shakes.
Birds SCREAM. (OVER) RUMBLING.

          MAUREEN

     We've got to get to the ship. Penny?

She turns. The clearing is empty. No Blips. No Penny. Blip runs cut
before them, grabs Maureen's hand, trying to pull her forward.

          MAUREEN

     Where is she, girl?

In Blip's hand, a mass of colored ribbons from Penny's wrists. Blip
waves them in the air, then races off. A beat. The women follow.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

The pulse laser is increasing its intensity, the corridor of images in
the bubble stabilizing. The TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

PAN DOWN

Spider Smith stands with Will, watching as the Robot shepherds the crew
towards the body of the ship.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Well, it would seem the time is upon
     us. Off we go, William.

Spider Smith starts climbing the gantry, truly like a spider, up
towards the bridge and crows nest hanging over the bubble.

Will walks to the control console platform, the platform now beginning
to rise on the gantry, towards the bridge above.

JOHN-POV. Something hangs from below the climbing Spider Smith's back.
It's an egg pouch of the kind they saw on the probe ship log.

          JOHN

     (shouting)

     Will, it's a trick. Smith's carrying
     an egg sack. If he's willing to stay
     on this world and die, why is he
     about to spawn? He's going through
     the portal himself.

The Robot FIRES a charge between its claws.

          ROBOT

     Proceed to the ship or be destroyed.

ON THE RISING CONTROL PLATFORM.

OLDER WILL-CLOSE. Frowns.

Suddenly, Smith's head drops INTO FRAME. The creature is hanging
upside-down. He smiles.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Hurry, boy. Time waits for no man.

EXT.-GANTRY SYSTEM-WIDE SHOT

The platform bearing Will reaches the top of the gantry and begins
moving out across the bridge towards the crows-nest.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FUTURE

Spider Smith drops into place beside Older Will as the control platform
comes to a stop on the crow's-nest.

The core cylinder continues sinking into the console. Smith looks out
over the platform. Beneath them, imagine of infinity flicker.

          SPIDER SMITH

     It's almost time. I really am a
     word-smith.

          OLDER WILL

     Once the core cylinder is fully
     injected, the planet will begin to
     come apart and the time doorway will
     stabilize. Then I jump in.

          SPIDER SMITH

     A leap of faith. How fitting.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. In the circle made by the laser, the images are not
yet stable, but discernable. Earth the day before the launch.

          OLDER WILL

     Tell me again, old monster, how did
     the girls die?

          SPIDER SMITH

     We've been over this before, son.
     The spiders attacked the ship

          OLDER WILL

     In all the years since, the spiders
     have never re-surfaced. Why?

Smith stares at him. Then he smiles. A horrible sight.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Let's forget the past.

Will turns a switch. The laser generated aperture narrows.

          SPIDER SMITH

     What are you doing?

          OLDER WILL

     Focusing the aperture. Remember, the
     energy around the portal will rip a
     man to pieces.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Isn't the doorway too small?

          OLDER WILL

     Not for me.

     (a beat)

     But then I'm not going, am I? The
     spiders didn't kill the girls. It
     was you. I just never let myself see
     it. You kept me alive because you
     needed me. Because I could build
     this for you. You killed my family.
     Destroyed this world. And I helped.
     You became mad as the spiders.
     ...And I became you.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Poor, poor boy. Did you really think
     I would let you go home? Let all
     that I have become vanish? Look at
     me. I am no mere man. I am a God.

Spider Smith opens his pouch, revealing a thousand tiny spiders.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Your father was right. Within me
     roil the growing needs of a master
     race. We WILL descend upon helpless
     Earth. An entire planet to rule.

His arm whips out, grabbing Will, bringing him close, opens his mouth,
bearing venomous fangs.

          SPIDER SMITH

     An entire planet on which to feed.

INT.-MODIFIED JUPITER TWO-FUTURE

John and Don talk in the holding area. The Robot stands guard. (OVER)
the TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

          WEST

     I'll run, draw his fire. You may
     have time to get away with Will.

          ROBOT (OVER)

     Halt or Robot will destroy.

The men look up. In the b.g., Will has approached the Robot.

          WILL

     Do you remember what I taught you. A
     long time ago. About friendship?

          ROBOT

     Friendship means acting with your
     heart not your head.

          WILL

     That's why I rebuilt you. Because I
     wanted us to be friends.

          ROBOT

     Logic error. Friendship does not
     compute.

          WILL

     Forget logic. Act with your heart.

          ROBOT

     Robot has no heart. Robot is powered
     by a fusion pulse generator

          WILL

     Every living thing has a heart.

The Robot stares at him a beat.

          ROBOT

     Any attempts to override command
     protocols may result in fused
     processors in my neural net.

The floor trembles again. The planet is coming apart at the seams.

          WILL

     Please, Robot, if you don't let us
     go, we're all going to die. I'm
     asking you now, will you help us?
     Will you be my friend?

The Robot stands still a beat. Then he reaches towards Smith's control
bolt attached firmly on his CPU.

          ROBOT

     Robot attempting to deactivate
     control bolt-commands
     overriddenattempting to
     reroute-dangercircuitry
     overloadattempting to escape-kill
     them, kill them...

The Robot's claws lift into attack position, an electrical charge
building with dangerous intensity. He is about to fire.

At the last minute, the Robot jerks his hand upward, BLOWING away a
piece of the ceiling. He rips off the control bolt.

          WILL

     You did it.

          ROBOT

     Robot will save ... I will save Will
     Robinson. I will save my friend.


CHAPTER 21: Time to Die!
------------------------


EXT.-FOREST-DAY-PRESENT

Penny and Maureen chase a frantic Blip through the portal back into the
daylight of the present. Here, too, the world RUMBLES.

          MAUREEN

     (shouting )

     Penny? Penny?

Penny stands in front of the Jupiter Two, beckoning them urgently.

          MAUREEN

     Where did you go?

          PENNY

     I came through the forest. I had a
     promise I had to keep.

Before Maureen can respond the ground RUMBLES, begins crumbling.

          JUDY

     Inside. Fast.

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE

Don, John, Will and the Robot stand at the open hatch. Outside, the
ground RUMBLES.

          JOHN

     You've got find your way back to the
     ship. The portals may still be
     stable. I'll try to meet you there.

          WEST

     What do you mean?

          JOHN

     I'm going to get that core material.
     It's our only chance to escape.

          WEST

     I'll stay. The family needs their
     father

          JOHN

     The crew needs their pilot. No
     matter what happens, when the planet
     starts to break up you take off.

          WEST

     Without the core we'll never have
     enough power to make orbit.

          JOHN

     You've got to try. Promise me, Don.

A beat. Then Don extends his hand.

          WEST

     Good luck. Commander.

Just then Will and the Robot arrive.

          JOHN

     Will. Son. I want you to know-

          WILL

     (fighting tears)

     You'll tell me when you get back to
     the ship. Now there just isn't time.

John bites back a bittersweet smile. (OVER) another RUMBLING.

          JOHN

     I could use a weapon.

The Robot extends his claw. A panel opens on his arm and he tears out a
hand-made component. A conduit made from Will's golden first prize
medals, joined together to make a jagged star.

          ROBOT

     Professor, I have a plan.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FuTURE

Spider Smith has Will against the rail.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Time to die, son.

          OLDER WILL

     I'm not your son.

And with that Will SMASHES Spider Smith in the face with two closed
lists. Smith recoils, lifts the boy aver his head.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Goodbye.

Smith hurls Will over the rail towards the time pool below.

The creature walks to the end of the arm, stares at the forming
aperture into the past below him.

PORTAL-CLOSE. Images of the day before the mission launch swirl in the
laser-generated opening, growing ever more stable.

WIDER

Will is hanging over the time bubble, unconscious and unseen, dangling
from the gantry by a flashing chain around his neck.


CHAPTER 22: Time Travel
-----------------------


EXT:-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Don and the Robot, Will riding his back, navigate the terrain alongside
the ravaged hull of the Jupiter Two.

          WILL

     Look.

On the ground, crumpled in a heap, is Smith. Don checks his pulse.

          WEST

     (disappointed)

     Damn. He's still breathing.

(OVER) the rushing WIND. RUMBLING. A portal opens before them to a far
younger world. Then another portal, to a world far older. A third
portal RIPS across the sky overhead.

          WILL

     The time machine must be near full
     power. The portals are collapsing.

          WEST

     Which one leads us home?

More portals are opening around them, others winking shut.

          WILL

     There.

Through a new rip in time, the intact Jupiter Two can be seen in relief
of the battered future craft. The ground beneath their feet is
beginning to give way.

          WILL

     We can't just leave him here.

          WEST

     Sure we can.

     (off WILL's stare)

     Damn it.

     (slapping the Doctor)

     Smith. Wake up. Smith.

          SMITH

     (coming to)

     Oh, the pain, the pain.

          ROBOT

     Danger. Will Robinson. Danger.

The PORTAL is beginning to shimmer. The ground starts to fall away.

          WEST

     Jump!

Don hurls Smith through, Will, the Robot and West darting across the
threshold just as the portal winks closed.

EXT. -FOREST- PRESENT

The trees are bursting into flames an Will, Don, the Robot and Smith
emerge from the woods. Race forwards towards...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-PRESENT

The women are powering up the ship. The men are visible through the
windscreen. Outside, the ground in beginning to crumble.

          PENNY

     Mom, the forest.

Penny opens the air lock. Maureen holds close her son. Steps back.

          MAUREEN

     Where's John?

          WEST

     The portal closed behind us. It was
     his only way back.

MEE GROUND-CLOSE. A geyser of fire BLOWS into the air.

          WEST

     We've got to try and lift off.

          MAUREEN

     We've already begun the pre-flight
     countdown. You have the Com.

     (off Don's expression)

     I'm going to save as many lives as I
     can, Major. Now strap in.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFoRm-FUTURE

(OVER) TREMORS. More lava is rushing up towards the mercury, the walls
themselves beginning to crack.

SMITH opens a gate at the end of the crow's-nest and a gang plank
unfolds above the doorway in time.

          JOHN (OVER)

     Not so fast.

WIDER

John stands on the platform behind Smith, fighting star in hand,
slashes for his face. Smith moves fast, knocking the star to the gantry
bridge with his arm. John leaps on Smith, using his fists.

          JOHN

     You sabotaged our mission.

     (hook)

     You killed my family

     (jab)

     You stole my son. It's payback time.

Smith's head moves from each impact, but the punches have no effect. It
smiles. Grabs John and hurls him across the platform.

          SPIDER SMITH

     Spare me the fury of the righteous.

The monster leans down over John. Opens its jaw.

          SPIDER SMITH

     I think there's time for a snack
     before my trip.

John's hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star. At the last
moment John grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk, slashes Smith
across the face, silver-red blood pouring down his cheek.

          SPIDER SMITH

     (sarcastic)

     Oh, the pain. The pain.

          JOHN

     You ain't seen nothing yet.

John feints towards Smith's head and then slashes low, cutting the
viscous membrane of the monster's egg pouch.

SPIDER SMITH-CLOSE. Surprised.

          JOHN

     Remember the probe ship? These
     monsters eat their wounded.


SMITH'S EGG SACK-CLOSE. Scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of
the sack, rushing up towards Smith's face, tiny jaws chomping.

          SPIDER SMITH

     No. Stop. No!

Spider Smith tumbles backwards, falling against the rail on the side of
the platform. John rises and rushes him, SHOULDER-SLAMMING him, sending
Smith hurling over towards the bubble below.

Spider Smith hits the bubble, missing the doorway formed by the red
laser and is swept up by the tides of time.

          JOHN

     Take all the time you want to die.


Spider Smith SCREAMS as he disappears and reappears in the various
half-formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether.

John turns. The core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the
main console. only seconds before it's too late to retrieve it.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The landscape is a sudden inferno.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Don is at the Com. Maureen strapped into the co-pilot's chair.

          MAUREEN

     I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

          MAUREEN

     Let's go, Major.

Don hits the engine switch. The.mighty generators WHINE into life.

          MAUREEN

     (quiet)

     Goodbye, my love.

CHAPTER 23: Escape Velocity
---------------------------


The ship rocks as land masses on all sides begin to give way.

          WEST

     Engaging primary thrusters. Now!

EXT. -JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The power drive begins to glow, diodes spinning. The landing struts
retract. The Jupiter Two begins to rise.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-INSERTION ARM-FUTURE

CONTROL CONSOLE-CLOSE. The core material in sinking fast. John moves
towards it when something on the gantry catches his eye.

GANTRY-CLOSE. Wedged into the grill work is a shiny scrap of metal
reflecting the setting sunlight. John's father's dog tags.

John rushes to the rail. There, still unconscious and hanging by the
dog-tag chain is Older Will.

CHAIN-CLOSE. The metal links are pulling apart. Will is seconds away
from falling into the pool.

JOHN-POV. The cylinder has completely sunken into the machine. It's
Will or the core material. No time for both.

John stands a beat, immobile. Then he drops to his knees, reaching down
as the chain breaks, grabbing Will's wrist at the last second.

The dog tags tumble into the pool below as John hoists Older Will up
onto the safety of the gangplank.

          JOHN

     Come on, son. Wake up.

Will is still. Then, finally, his eyes open.

          OLDER WILL

     Dad?

          JOHN

     I thought I lost you.

          OLDER WILL

     The core.

Will turns in time to see the core cylinder sink into the control
panel, the laser exploding in intensity below them as it drains the
cylinder's radioactive power. The world begins to EXPLODE.

          OLDER WILL

     You could have taken the core and
     left before it was too late. You
     saved me instead.

John stares at him.

          JOHN

     There wasn't any choice. I couldn't
     let you fall.You're my boy.


THE LASER-CLOSE. Reaches full power. The image in the time pool
stabilizes, becoming clear.

TIME POOL-CLOSE. Mission Control the day before the launch.

Father and Son stare into the past, eyes filled with wonder.

          OLDER WILL

     Look. They made it.

PAN UP. Through a torn hole in the hull and a glowing rip in space, the
Jupiter Two is rising into the flame ravaged sky.

INT.JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

The ship is shaking madly.

          WEST

     We're not getting any altitude.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The fire GEYSERS are legion, giant chunks of the planet's surface now
falling away beneath them. A huge spew of flame rages from the fire-
pocked surface, hitting the bull of the tiny craft.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Judy is at navigation, frantically enhance the stabilizers.

          JUDY

     I'm reading a power build up.
     Markers in the red-

Suddenly the panel EXPLODES, sending Judy flying across the bridge.
Penny races to her sister. Kneels. Judy's eyes are wide, still.

          PENNY

     She's dead.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

The ground is breaking, falling into an endless fiery abyss below.

          WEST

     Not enough power to make orbit.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRES ENT

Another firestorm. A flame geyser hits the ship. Then another.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Control panels all around the ship begin to SLOW. The main screen is
hit by a flying chunk of rock. The giant glass begins to crack.

          WEST

     (to Maureen)

     I'm sorry.

The windshield EXPLODES, sucking them both out into space.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The ship is hit by another fire geyser. The Jupiter Two EXPLODES.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

John and Will kneel on the crow's nest as the Jupiter Two dodges the
fire geysers in the sky through the torn hull. The ship is struck once,
again, finally EXPLODING in a ROARING ball of fire.

JOHN-CLOSE. A man who has lost everything he ever loved.

          JOHN

     I couldn't save them.

Will stares at his father and beyond him. There, in the time doorway, a
young Will walks towards the entrance to Mission Control in the morning
sun, innocent with no knowledge of the future.

          OLDER WILL (OVER)

     So many years ago and I can still
     feel it. Our sun. Our Earth. It's
     all I've thought about. Going home.

Will reaches forward and touches the control console. The images in the
laser generated doorway begin to change.

          OLDER WILL

     A long time ago, you told a small
     boy that one day he'd understand how
     precious he was, how much his father
     loved him. Today is that day.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. Instead of Earth we now see this planet's surface,
the Jupiter Two rising as it did just moments ago.

          OLDER WILL

     All I could see was your need to go
     forward at any cost. What you never
     showed me was your love. I lost
     that. Robbed by time. I could never
     see how much you cared. Until now.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The Jupiter Two tries in vain to dodge the fire
geysers, then EXPLODING all over again. Will enters some commands.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The image in the portal begins to run backwards, the
Jupiter Two reconstituting from a ball of flame, receding past
diminishing flame geysers, beginning to land again.

          OLDER WILL

     Father, take my hand.

INT.-CUPITER TWO

We are back in the ship just before take off. DON mans the Cam. Maureen
straps herself into the co-pilot's chair.

          MAUREEN

     I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

          MAUREEN

     Let's go, Major.

Don hits the engine switch. The mighty generators WHINE into life.

          MAUREEN

     (quiet)

     Goodbye my love.

          PENNY

     Look.

The roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like
water. There, standing above them, John and Older WILL.

2NT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-CROW'S NEST-FUTURE

The bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated
doorway. Older WILL looks to his father.

          OLDER WILL

     DON'T make me wait another lifetime
     to know how you feel.

And with that he pushes John over the edge, the Professor falling down
through space and into the bubble and the doorway below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship. Maureen cradles
her husband. Then she looks up. Will is still visible through the
watery hull.

          JOHN

     Come with us.

But the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the
world of the engine room EXPLODES in the b.g.

          OLDER WILL

     I can't. There was only enough power
     for one person, one trip, remember?

          MAUREEN

     Will?

          OLDER WILL

     It's good to see you again, Mom.
     It's good to see you alive.

     (fading)

     Sorry about all the monkey business.

Maureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands almost
touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever.

          JOHN

     He sacrificed everything for his
     family.

          MAUREEN

     (fighting tears)

     He had a good example.

Maureen holds him close. A small figure walks up beside them. Will.

          WILL

     Dad?

A beat, then Will reaches up, hands him his dog tags.

          WILL

     I'm glad you came back.

          JOHN

     I just want you to know I love you
     son. I love you very much.

John takes the boy in his arms, father and son finally holding close.
(OVER) more RUMBLING as the ground continues to give way.

          WEST (OVER)

     The planet is breaking up around us.

John moves fast to the Com.

          WEST

     Nice of you to drop in.

John smiles a beat, then he's all business.

          JOHN

     Status?

(OVER) A tremendous CRASH.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The land masses are falling away beneath them, plummeting into

giant caverns of fire.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

          SMITH

     We're doomed. We're doomed.

West turns, hauls off and PUNCHES Smith, knocking him out cold.

          WEST

     Boy, that felt good.

          JOHN

     Get us airborne.

Don throws the power switches to full.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The landing struts retract. The power drive begins to spin. The Jupiter
Two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses upon itself.
Fire geysers ERUPT. History in about to repeat itself.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

          WEST

     I'm going to try to reach escape
     velocity. Maybe we can break the
     gravitational pull.

          JOHN

     No. We don't have the core material.
     The gravity wells will drag us down.

          WEST

     We might-

          JOHN

     We won't make it. Trust me. I know.
     We've got to go down.

          WEST

     What?

          JOHN

     Through the planet as she breaks up.

          WEST

     That's insane.

          JOHN

     I don't have time to argue. I'm
     giving you a direct order, Major.

Don and John stare at each other a beat. Then Don smiles.

          WEST

     Yes Sir.

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The world is breaking up beneath them, revealing a
fiery maw. DON GUNS the engines, heading straight for the chasm.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies into the giant expanding crevice.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

DON is flying into the shattering center of the planet. Masses of
continents, some bearing forests, others oceans, all soar past.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies deeper toward the molten center of the planet.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

          JOHN

     There.

A window out the windscreen a portion of the planet has torn away
revealing the black of space and the starfield beyond.

          WEST

     I see it.

Don banks the ship toward the opening, flying past exploding fragments
of this shattering world.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship clears the planet as the world EXPLODES in the b.g.

CHAPTER 24: Alpha Prime
-----------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO

DON guides the ship out into space. Judy comes up behind him.

          JUDY

     Nice work, flyboy.

          WEST

     So, I earn that kiss yet?

          JUDY

     (a peck on the cheek)

     You earned that.

DON shrugs, begins to turn away. Judy grabs him.

          JUDY

     This one is on credit.

She gives him a long, passionate kiss. She lets him go, stunned.

          JUDY

     Cold fish, huh?

Penny holds Blip in her arms, who has begun to BLIP madly.

          MAUREEN

     Poor thing. She's lost her whole
     family.

     (off Penny)

     Penny, why are you looking at me
     like that. Penny?

Penny presses a button. Blast doors open on a storage hold.

          PENNY

     I promised Judy I'd take care of
     her. I couldn't leave her all alone.

(all stare at her)

     Well I am their princess, after all.

     (turning)

     You can come out mow.

Forms in the cargo hold de-camouflage. The other lizard monkeys,
standing amidst glittering canisters of Dimondium.

          JOHN

     Dimondium. Now if we could only find
     our way back to Earth.

          ROBOT

     If I may, Professor.

The Robot projects a holographic schematic of the galaxy. The Jupiter
Two is highlighted. Earth blinks at the other and.

          ROBOT

     Your son's star charts.

          WILL

     It's a map home.

(OVER) ALARMS. The shattered planet's core is turning bright red, a
sudden ROARING blast wave heading towards the ship.

          WEST

     The planet's gravity field in
     collapsing.

          MAUREEN

     We'll be sucked in.

          JOHN

     There's no way to get clear in time.
