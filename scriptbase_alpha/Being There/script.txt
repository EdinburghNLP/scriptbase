Being There - December 16, 1978 Draft


     FADE IN:

     EXT. TOWNHOUSE GARDEN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

     An afternoon in late November, the leaves have left the
     trees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches.
     The garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a
     high brick wall. At one end stands the rear of a three-story
     brick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building.
     CLASSICAL MUSIC is heard in the distance. A MAN, handsomely
     dressed in a well-tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the
     garden. A gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth
     as he turns the loam along one of the walkways. He works
     slowly,-precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings.
     This man is called CHANCE.

     Chance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from
     inside his coat, checks the time. He looks to the darkening
     skies, returns the watch to his pocket. As Chance starts
     toward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag
     from his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of
     his pitchfork.

     INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON

     The sound of the music increases as Chance enters the garage
     from the garden. A gleaming 1921 TOURING CAR is revealed as
     he walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a
     wall. Chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf,
     carefully puts it over the car. When he finishes covering the
     car for the night, Chance picks up the pitchfork, leaves the
     garage through a side entry.

     INT. POTTING ROOM - AFTERNOON

     The Potting Room is filled with the tools of the gardener,
     everything arranged in an orderly fashion. Rows of small pots
     are on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them. A
     small, 1940's table model black-and-white TV rests on a
     shelf. It is playing, tuned to the BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA.
     Attached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing
     colored gels. The wheels spins, creates an early form of
     color TV. As Chance enters, his attention is on the
     television set. He watches it as he oils the tines of the
     pitchfork and puts it away. Chance turns off the TV and
     leaves the room, but the sound of the Boston Pops continues.

     INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

     A room adjacent to the Potting Room. A large screen remote
     control color television set dominates the room. It is on,
     tuned to the Boston Pops. In contrast to the new TV, the rest
     of the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with
     expensive furniture of the twenties. There are no books,
     magazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be
     seen. Chance comes in, watches the TV with a detached gaze as
     he removes his apron. He changes the channel with the remote
     control as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a
     laundry bag. He takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the
     closet where it is accompanied by several others, all of like
     quality. Chance changes the channel once again.

     EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT

     Chance, wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry
     bag, crosses from the rear building to the main house.

     INT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - NIGHT

     The interior of the main house has the mustiness of age, the
     warmth of oak. White dropcloths and sheets cover all of the
     furniture. Chance enters, walks through the hallway.

     INT. MAIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     A large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs.
     It is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and
     place setting uncovered. A small portable color TV is next to
     the place setting.

     Chance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near
     the doorway. He sits at the dining room table, turns on the
     TV, and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as
     he watches the screen. LOUISE, an elderly black maid, enters
     with a tray of food and Chance's clean laundry.

                    LOUISE
               (sets dinner before
                    Chance)
          ... Evening, Chance.

                    CHANCE 
               (slowly, perfect diction,
                    no accent of any kind)
          ... Good evening, Louise.

     Louise sets Chance's clean clothes on the small table, picks
     up his laundry bag.

                    LOUISE 
          ... The Old Man is getting weaker,
          Chance.

                    CHANCE 
               (begins to eat)
          I see.

                    LOUISE 
          I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with
          every hour that goes by...

     Chance, his manners impeccable, concentrates on the TV as he
     eats. A buzzer SOUNDS, Louise looks upstairs.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          ... Back up those stairs - damn...
          That Man's needin' me more and more
          just before he never needs me
          again...

                    CHANCE 
               (still watches TV)
          Is his back feeling better?

     Louise gives Chance a look.

                    LOUISE 
          ... Gobbledegook... You and your
          gobbledegook. You're gonna be the
          death of me yet, Chance...
               (she turns to leave)
          ... Unless those stairs are... The
          Good Lord's liable to snatch up two
          unwillin' souls at the same time if
          I keep on trampin' up those
          stairs... I don't want none of
          that...

     Louise disappears through the doorway. Chance continues to
     eat and watch TV.

     INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN

     Chance is asleep, lying on his back. His eyes slowly open,
     and, with no change of expression, he sits up and turns on
     the TV with the remote control. Chance gets out of bed, goes
     to the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer,
     checks the time. He crosses to the closet, his eyes never
     straying from an early morning show on television. He puts on
     a bathrobe and leaves the room.

     INT. POTTING ROOM - DAWN

     Chance enters, turns on the TV with the spinning color wheel,
     then waters a few of the pots with a sprinkling can. He turns
     off the TV and exits.

     INT. GARAGE - DAWN

     Chance comes into the garage, takes the cover off of the
     touring car, folds it and puts it on a shelf. He leaves the
     garage.

     INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN

     Chance returns to his room, changes channels on the
     television, takes off his robe and hangs it back up in the
     closet, then goes into the bathroom.

     EXT. GARDEN - MORNING

     A light snow is falling. The door to the small building
     opens, Chance peeks out, then goes back inside. A few seconds
     pass and Chance reappears, this time with an umbrella.
     Smartly dressed in suit and tie, he crosses to the main
     house.

     INT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - MORNING

     Chance opens the door, shakes off and closes the umbrella
     before entering. He hangs the umbrella on a doorknob, then
     heads for the dining room.

     INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING

     Repeating his ritual, Chance enters the dining room, sits,
     turns on the TV, carefully spreads his napkin on his lap. He
     watches the screen for a moment, then turns, expecting
     Louise. She doesn't appear, so he turns back, watches TV.
     After a few beats, Chance hears Louise's footsteps hurrying
     down the stairs. She comes into the dining room, visibly
     distraught. Chance looks up, smiles.

                    CHANCE 
          Good morning, Louise.

                    LOUISE 
               (out of breath)
          He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's
          dead!

                    CHANCE 
               (flatly, turns back to TV)
          ... I see.

                    LOUISE 
          Must of happened durin' the night,
          I don't know... Lord, he wasn't
          breathin' and as cold as a fish. I
          touched him, just to see, and you
          believe me, Chance - that's doin'
          more than I get paid to do... Then
          I just covered him up, pulled the
          sheet over his head...

                    CHANCE 
               (nodding)
          Yes. I've seen that done.

                    LOUISE
          Then I got the hell out of that
          room and called the doctor and I
          think I woke him probably, he
          wasn't any too alert. He just said,
          'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and
          said he'd send somebody over...'
          Lord, what a mornin'!

                    CHANCE 
               (watches news, flashes of
                    season's first snowfall)
          ... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in
          the garden today. Have you looked
          outside and seen the snow? It's
          very white.

     A beat of silence from Louise, then anger.

                    LOUISE 
          Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to
          say? More gobbledegook? 
               (Chance smiles, is silent)
          That Old Man's layin' up there dead
          as hell and it just don't make any
          difference to you!

                    CHANCE 
               (with a smile, accepting
                    death)
          Yes, Louise. I have seen it often.
          It happens to old people.

                    LOUISE 
          Well, ain't that the truth...

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. It is.

     Louise throws back the cover from a chair next to Chance and
     sits, softening a bit toward him.

                    LOUISE 
          Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know
          what I was expectin' from you...
          I'm sorry for yellin' like I did...
          No sir, I just don't know what I
          was expectin' ... 
               (Chance doesn't react,
                    watches TV)
          ... I 'spose I'd better gather up
          some breakfast for you...

                    CHANCE 
               (a turn to her)
          Yes, I'm very hungry.

                    LOUISE 
               (rises, looks upstairs)
          Well, no more stewin' those prunes
          every mornin', that's somethin', I
          guess... 
               (she starts out, stops by
                    the door)
          ... what are you goin' to do now,
          Chance?

                    CHANCE
               (gazing at TV)
          I'm going to work in the garden.

     Louise gives Chance a long look, then turns to leave.

                    LOUISE
               (as she goes)
          ... I'll get you some eggs.

     Chance nods in approval, then changes the channel on the TV.

     INT. MAIN HOUSE - SERVANT'S STAIRWAY - MORNING

     An enclosed stairway. Chance enters, proceeds up the stairs.

     INT. MAIN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING

     Chance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase.
     He moves off down the hall.

     INT. MAIN HOUSE - OLD MAN'S ROOM - MORNING

     The furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the
     Old Man is. There is a polite knock at the door, then Chance
     enters the room. As Chance moves slowly to the Old Man's bed,
     we sense a feeling of respect from Chance, as well as a bit
     of curiosity. Chance stands by the side of the bed for a
     moment, then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back
     from the Old Man's face. He touches the man's forehead,
     lightly, briefly, then replaces the sheet. Chance moves to
     the TV (like the one in his own room) and turns it on. He
     sits in an easy chair next to the Old man's bed and watches a
     movie from the early forties. Chance puts an arm out, rests
     it on the Old Man's covered body. With the other, he changes
     the channels with the remote control.
     He returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to
     become absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat
     to a lady. The scene seems to have 'sunk into' his mind.

     EXT. GARDEN - MORNING

     It has stopped snowing. Chance, wearing a hat, the gardening
     apron over his suit and boots, putters in the garden. Louise
     comes out of the main house. She is dressed warmly, a scarf
     over her head, a heavy coat. Chance sees her, tips his hat to
     Louise exactly like the man he saw on television.

                    LOUISE 
          ... Well, ain't you the gentleman
          this mornin'...
               (a pause)
          ... gotta go now, Chance...

                    CHANCE 
               (resumes working)
          Yes.

                    LOUISE 
          You're gonna need somebody,
          someone's gotta be around for you,
          boy... 
               (he keeps working)
          ... You oughta find yourself a
          lady, Chance... 
               (she smiles slightly, with
                    caring)
          But I guess it oughta be an old
          lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a
          young one any good, not with that
          little thing of yours... 
               (she reaches out, puts a
                    hand on his shoulder)
          ... You're always gonna be a little
          boy, ain't you? 
               (he smiles, keeps working)
          ... Goodbye, Chance...

     Louise gives his shoulder a squeeze, turns and moves toward
     the house.

                    CHANCE 
               (as she goes)
          Goodbye, Louise.

     Louise waves as she enters the townhouse. Chance tips his hat
     once again as she disappears.

     INT. MAIN HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MORNING

     Louise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit cases
     waiting by the door. She stops as she sees TWO MEN in white
     carrying a stretcher down the main staircase. She notices the
     ease with which they bring the Old Man's body down the
     stairs.

                    LOUISE 
          ... He used to be a big man...
          'Spose he wasted away to about
          nothin'... 
               (a beat - then she talks
                    to the body of the old
                    Man)
          ... I guess I'll be goin' off to
          find me some folks, Old Man... I'm
          not batty enough to stay around
          this neighborhood any longer...

     The stretcher bearers move to the front door. Louise steps in
     front of them.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
               (to stretcher bearers)
          Wait up! I'm goin' out that door
          first.

     Louise takes one more look at the covered body, then opens
     the front door, leaves.

     INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAY

     The TV plays offstage as Chance washes up in the bathroom. He
     finishes, comes into the bedroom, takes a pair of house
     slippers from his closet, turns off the television and leaves
     the room.

     EXT. GARDEN - DAY

     Chance, carrying his slippers, crosses through the layer of
     fresh snow to the townhouse.

     INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

     Chance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place.
     He turns on the TV, puts the napkin on his lap. He watches TV
     for a moment, then turns, looks for Louise. She does not
     appear so he resumes watching TV. He changes channels, views
     a wildly exciting FOOTBALL game. At a peak in the excitement,
     he again switches channels. Chance watches TV News coverage
     of the PRESIDENT of the United States greeting foreign
     dignitaries at the White House.
     CLOSE SHOTS on television reveal that the President uses a
     two-handed handshake when meeting his guests. Unconsciously,
     Chance grips one hand with the other, the scene on TV seeming
     to have 'sunk into' his mind.

     INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

     A key is heard in the lock. The door opens and THOMAS
     FRANKLIN and SALLY HAYES enter. Franklin, an attorney, is in
     his late thirties, carries a large briefcase. Hayes is
     younger, attractive, also an attorney. She totes a briefcase,
     has the look of a modern, liberated woman. Hayes appears to
     be surprised at the interior of the house.

                    HAYES
               (looks around)
          ... This is another world, Tom - I
          never would have believed it...

                    FRANKLIN 
          Yeah... He and my father used to
          ride together back in the
          thirties... Fox hunting... Before I
          was born...

                    HAYES 
          ... Would you take me on a tour?

                    FRANKLIN 
          Gladly... 
               (he smiles)
          ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings'
          bedroom, that'll be stop number
          one.

     Franklin puts a hand on Hayes' shoulder as they,go off down
     the hall.

     INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

     Chance still watches TV, waits for Louise to serve him.
     Franklin and Hayes appear in the doorway of the dining room.
     They are both surprised to see Chance.

                    FRANKLIN 
          ... Why... Hello, we thought we
          heard something... 
               (moves to Chance, hand
                    outstretched)
          I'm Thomas Franklin.

     Chance remains seated, takes Franklin's hand warmly in both
     of his like the President did on TV.

                    CHANCE 
          Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the
          gardener.

                    FRANKLIN 
               (a beat)
          ... The gardener? 
               (thinks it's a joke,
                    laughs)
          ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance,
          this is Ms. Hayes.

     Hayes moves to shake Chance's hand.

                    HAYES 
          Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to
          meet you.

                    CHANCE 
               (doesn't rise, again
                    shakes with both hands)
          Yes.

     Chance turns back to the TV and Hayes and Franklin exchange
     looks.

                    FRANKLIN 
               (after an uneasy pause)
          ... We're with Franklin, Jennings
          and Roberts, the law firm handling
          the estate.

                    CHANCE 
               (a smile, totally at ease)
          Yes, Thomas - I understand.

     Another period of silence. Franklin and Hayes seem perplexed.

                    FRANKLIN 
          ... Are you waiting for someone? An
          appointment?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Your lunch? You have a luncheon
          appointment here?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Louise?... The maid?...
               (a look to Hayes)
          But she should have left earlier
          today...

                    CHANCE 
               (smiles at Hayes)
          I see...

                    FRANKLIN
               (a beat)
          ... You've quite a sense of humor,
          Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside,
          may I ask just what you are doing
          here?

                    CHANCE 
          I live here.

                    FRANKLIN 
          You live here?
               (a look to Hayes)
          ... We don't have any record of
          that.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. It's very cold outside today,
          isn't it, Thomas?

                    FRANKLIN 
               (a beat)
          ... How long have you been living
          here?

                    CHANCE 
          Ever since I can remember, since I
          was a child.

                    FRANKLIN 
               (doubting)
          Since you were a child?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Thomas. I have always been
          here. I have always worked in the
          garden.

                    HAYES 
          ... Then you really are a gardener?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes.

                    HAYES 
          Your appearance doesn't suggest
          that at all, Mr. Chance.

                    CHANCE
          Oh. Thank you.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Do you have any proof of your
          employment, Mr. Chance - any checks
          from the deceased, any contracts or
          documents?

                    CHANCE 
          No.

                    FRANKLIN 
          How were you compensated for these
          duties you say you performed?

                    CHANCE 
          Compensated...?

                    FRANKLIN 
          How were you paid?

                    CHANCE
          I was given meals, and a home...

                    HAYES 
          What about money?

                    CHANCE 
          I never needed money.

     Franklin steps to the TV, turns it off.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show
          us some identification with your
          address -- a Driver's License, a
          credit card, checkbook?

                    CHANCE 
          No, I do not have any of those.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Then how about medical records?
          Could you give us the name of your
          doctor, or your dentist?

                    CHANCE 
          I have no need for a doctor or
          dentist. I have never been ill. I
          have never been allowed outside of
          this house, and, except for Joe, I
          have never had any visitors.

                    FRANKLIN 
          ... Joe? Who's Joe?

                    CHANCE 
               (turns TV back on)
          Joe Saracini. He was a mason that
          did some repairs on the brickwork
          at the rear of the house. That was
          in 1952.

                    FRANKLIN 
          1952...?

                    CHANCE 
               (changes channels)
          Yes. I remember when he came. He
          was very fat and had short hair and
          showed me some pictures from a
          funny little book.

                    HAYES 
          Some pictures...?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. Of men and women.

                    HAYES 
          ... Oh.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven
          years ago.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes and the Old Man used to come to
          my garden. He would read and rest
          there.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Come now, Mr. Jennings had been
          bedridden for thirty-five years,
          since he fractured his spine.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then
          he stopped visiting my garden.

                    FRANKLIN 
               (a beat)
          ... We shall need some proof of
          your having resided here, Mr.
          Chance.

                    CHANCE 
          You have me, I am here. What more
          proof do you need?

     Franklin and Hayes exchange looks.

     INT. TOWNHOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

     Chance puts on his snow-boots as Franklin and Hayes continue
     their questioning.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Have you served in the Army?

                    CHANCE 
          No, Thomas. But I have seen the
          Army on television.

                    HAYES 
          How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely
          you must have paid taxes?

                    CHANCE 
          No.

     Chance picks up his slippers and leads the attorneys outside.

     EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON

     Chance describes his garden with pride as they walk toward
     the rear building.

                    CHANCE
               (points)
          Those trees were very young when I
          first arrived.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Are you related to the deceased,
          Mr. Chance?

                    CHANCE 
          No, I don't think so. And I have
          planted and shaped all the hedges,
          and in the springtime you will be
          able to see my flowers.

                    HAYES 
          Might you have a birth certificate,
          Mr. Chance?

                    CHANCE 
          No.
               (points to wall)
          That's where Joe fixed the bricks.

     They arrive at the rear building and Chance opens the door to
     the garage. Franklin and Hayes follow him inside.

     INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON

     Franklin and Hayes are taken aback by the touring car.

                    FRANKLIN
               (admires car)
          ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?

                    CHANCE 
          No, Thomas. I have never been in an
          automobile.

                    HAYES
               (amazed)
          You never been in a car?

     Chance is silent for a moment, he blushes slightly.

                    CHANCE 
          ... Well... From time to time I did
          sit in it... Just in here... It
          hasn't been outside since the Old
          Man hurt himself.
               (he turns)
          I live in here.

     Chance moves toward his room, Franklin and Hayes follow.

     INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

     Chance sits on the bed to remove his boots as Hayes and
     Franklin inspect the room.

                    CHANCE 
          The Old Man gave me nice television
          sets, this one has remote control.
               (he turns it on with the
                    remote)
          He has one just like it.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Mr. Chance, the fact remains that
          we have no information of your
          having any connection with the
          deceased.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, I understand.

     Chance puts on his slippers, crosses to the closet, opens the
     door. It is filled with men's wear.

                    CHANCE 
          I am allowed to go to the attic and
          select any of the Old Man's suits.
          They all fit me very well. I can
          also take his shirts, shoes and
          coats.

                    HAYES 
          It is quite amazing how those
          clothes have come back into style.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I have seen styles on
          television.

                    FRANKLIN
               (getting back to business)
          What are your plans now, Mr.
          Chance?

                    CHANCE 
          I would like to stay and work in my
          garden.

     Chance turns to watch TV. Franklin takes Hayes to a side of
     the room.

                    FRANKLIN 
               (quietly)
          ... What do you make of all this?

                    HAYES 
          I really don't know, Tom - he seems
          so honest and simple... In a way,
          he's quite charming...

                    FRANKLIN 
               (looks at Chance)
          ... Yeah...

                    HAYES 
          ... It's very bizarre - I don't
          know what to think...

                    FRANKLIN 
          Well... He's either very, very
          bright or very, very dense - he's
          hard to figure...
               (he unzips briefcase)
          ... Let's just keep everything
          legal.

     Franklin takes out some papers, approaches Chance.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Mr. Chance, assuming what you say
          is the truth, I would like to know
          what sort of claim you are planning
          to make against the deceased's
          estate.

                    CHANCE
               (does not understand)
          I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a
          healthy one. There is no need for a
          claim.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Good. That's good. Then if you
          would please sign a paper to that
          effect.

     Franklin hands the release to Chance but Chance does not take
     it.

                    CHANCE 
          No, Thomas. I don't know how to
          sign.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Come now, Mr. Chance.

                    CHANCE 
               (smiles)
          I have no claim, Thomas.

                    FRANKLIN 
          But you won't sign, correct?

                    CHANCE 
          Correct.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Very well, Mr. Chance - if you
          insist on dragging this matter
          on... But I must inform you this
          house will be closed tomorrow at
          noon. If indeed, you do reside
          here, you will have to move out.

                    CHANCE 
          Move out? I don't understand,
          Thomas.

                    FRANKLIN 
          I think you do, Mr. Chance.
          However, I will reiterate, this
          house is closed and you must
          leave...
               (he gives Chance his
                    business card)
          Call me if you change your mind
          about signing.
               (turns to Hayes)
          C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...

                    HAYES
               (a smile to Chance)
          Good day, Mr. Chance.

                    CHANCE
               (returns smile)
          Good day, Sally.

     Chance watches as they leave, then puts Franklin's card on a
     desk without ever looking at it and turns to stare at
     television.

     INT. TOWNHOUSE - ATTIC - AFTERNOON

     A large attic filled with the Old Man's possessions of the
     past. Chance enters, turns on an old black-and-white TV with
     a magnifying lens attached to the front. As it plays, he
     selects a fine leather suitcase from several, takes a hand
     made suit from a long rack.

     INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

     The TV is on as Chance packs his belongings.

     EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON

     Chance, very nicely dressed, comes out of the rear building
     carrying his suitcase. He stops on occasion to inspect his
     garden as he walks toward the townhouse.

     INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

     Chance is reluctant to open the front door. After some
     hesitation, he gathers up his courage, opens it and steps
     outside, closing the door behind him.

     EXT. FRONT OF TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON

     Chance stops short on the front steps; the townhouse is
     situated in a decaying ghetto.
     The snow is a dirty grey, houses adjoining have their windows
     shattered, are smeared with grafitti. Chance tries to return
     to the safety of the townhouse, but the door is locked. He
     stands on the steps for a moment, then moves to the trash
     laden sidewalk. He stops, ponders which way to go, finally
     makes up his mind and moves off to his left.

     EXT. GHETTO STREET - AFTERNOON

     The buildings are crumbling, rusted out cars line the street.
     A group of Black people huddle together in threadbare stuffed
     furniture on the sidewalk, a fire burning between them for
     warmth. Chance rounds the corner, walks up to them. He stands
     by them, smiles. They stare back, no sign of friendship in
     their faces. Chance nods politely to them, then walks away
     down the sidewalk.

     EXT. GHETTO STREET - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

     A group of eight to ten hard-core ghetto youths hang out on a
     corner. Other passersby give them a wide berth, they are
     unapproachable. Chance nears the group, approaches.

                    CHANCE
               (friendly)
          ... Excuse me, would you please
          tell me where I could find a garden
          to work in?

     They turn to him as one, silent, amazed that this White
     trespasser would intrude on their jiving.

                    CHANCE (CONT'D)
               (after a beat)
          ... There is much to be done during
          the winter, I must start the seeds
          for the spring, I must work the
          soil...

     One of the Black youths, LOLO, interrupts Chance.

                    LOLO 
          What you growin', man?

     The leader of the gang, ABBAZ, shuts up Lolo with an elbow
     and moves menacingly forward.

                    ABBAZ 
               (nose to nose with Chance)
          ... What you doin' here, boy?

                    CHANCE 
          I had to leave my garden. I want to
          find another.

                    ABBAZ 
          Bullshit. Who sent you here, boy?
          Did that chickenshit asshole
          Raphael send you here, boy?

                    CHANCE 
          No. Thomas Franklin told me that I
          had to leave the Old Man's house,
          he's dead now, you know...

                    ABBAZ 
          Dead, my ass! Now get this, honkie -
          you go tell Raphael that I ain't
          takin' no jive from no Western
          Union messenger! You tell that
          asshole, if he got somethin' to
          tell me to get his ass here
          himself! 
               (edges closer to Chance)
          You got that, boy?

     Chance smiles at Abbaz and reaches into his pocket.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I understand. 
               (he takes out his remote
                    control TV changer)
          If I see Raphael I will tell him.

     Chance points the changer at Abbaz and clicks it three times,
     tries to change the picture. Abbaz immediately pulls out a
     switchblade, whips the blade open.

                    ABBAZ
               (holds knife at Chance)
          Now, move, honkie! Before I cut
          your white ass!

     Chance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns
     it to his pocket.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. Of course.
               (as he leaves)
          Good day.

     Abbaz, Lolo and the gang watch him go, then begin to buzz
     with excitement: "Who the fuck died?" "Why'd he pull that
     changer on us, man?" "The Old Man died, must be Papa Joe!"
     "He's some weird honkie, man."

     EXT. CHINATOWN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

     A Bulletin board affixed to a storefront in Chinatown. Chance
     gazes at the notes pinned to it, written in Chinese. Smiling,
     he turns from it, walks on through the area.

     EXT. PORNO AREA - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

     A street lined with adult book stores, X-rated movies and
     strip joints. An elderly Black woman approaches carrying a
     bag of groceries. Chance steps in front of the woman, stops
     her.

                    CHANCE 
          I'm very hungry now. Would you
          please bring me my lunch?

     The woman looks up to Chance, becomes very frightened. She
     turns and half-runs into a sleazy bar for safety. Chance
     watches after her for a moment, then continues along.

     EXT. PARK - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

     Chance stands looking through a chain-link fence watching
     some teenage boys playing basketball. He bangs on the fence,
     calls to them.

                    CHANCE 
          I have seen your game! I have
          watched Elvin Hayes play it many
          times! They call him "Big E!"

     The boys ignore him, Chance walks away.

     EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

     Chance walks down the center meridian of a divided street. He
     seems oblivious to the automobiles passing on either side. In
     the background can be seen the Washington Monument.

     EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

     Chance seems stumped on which way to go. He looks up one
     street, then the other, has no idea where they lead. He
     turns, looks behind him and sees a large statue of Benito
     Juarez pointing. Chance smiles and goes off in the direction
     that Benito points.

     EXT. REAR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DUSK

     Tourists are gathered around gaping through the fence at the
     White House.
     Chance is turned the other way, inspecting the branches of a
     dying tree. Chance moves to a POLICEMAN standing nearby.

                    CHANCE 
          Excuse me...
               (points to tree)
          ... That tree is very sick. It
          should be cared for.

     The Policeman looks at the tree, then at Chance, figures a
     man dressed that well must be important.

                    POLICEMAN 
          Yes sir. I'll report it right away.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. That would be a good thing to
          do. Good day.

                    POLICEMAN
          Good day.

     The Policeman takes out his walkie-talkie as Chance walks
     away.

     EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - EVENING

     A fashionable area. Expensive shops, well-kept streets and
     sidewalks. A television store has caught Chance's eye. He
     stands by the display window, looks in at a dozen or so color
     TVs, all turned on, playing various channels. A video camera
     points outward from a corner of the window and is focused on
     the sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves
     live on an Advent TV. Chance is intrigued by his own image.
     He poses, lifts one arm, then the other to make sure that it
     is really him on television. He moves forward, smiles, then
     moves slowly backward, notices himself become smaller on the
     screen. He steps back off the curb, frowns as his likeness
     disappears from frame on the Advent. Standing between two
     parked cars, Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it
     at the Advent. Four or five other sets in the window change
     channels, but he does not reappear on the giant screen. As he
     does this, the car to his,left, a large, American-made
     limousine, backs up. The car bumps Chance, pins him against
     the car to his right. Chance cries out in pain, drops his
     suitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the
     limo. The chauffeur, DAVID, and the liveryman, JEFFREY,
     immediately jump from the car, run back to Chance.

                    DAVID
          I'm very sorry, sir... I...

     David and Jeffrey reach out to help, but Chance is wedged
     solidly between the two cars.

                    CHANCE
               (in pain)
          ... I can't move... My leg...

                    DAVID
               (rushes back to limo)
          ... My Lord...

                    JEFFREY
          This is terrible, sir -  I hope
          you're not badly injured...

                    CHANCE 
          No. I'm not badly injured. But my
          leg is very sore.

     David pulls the car forward, freeing Chance. A few bystanders
     begin to gather as Jeffrey helps Chance to the sidewalk.

                    JEFFREY 
          Can you walk? It's not broken, is
          it?

                    CHANCE
               (leans against limo, holds
                    leg)
          It's very sore.

     David gets out of the car, comes back.

                    DAVID 
          Perhaps I should call an ambulance.

     A BYSTANDER interrupts.

                    BYSTANDER 
          Somebody ought to call the police!

                    CHANCE 
               (looks over, smiles)
          There's no need for police, it's
          just my leg.

     During this, the rear door of the limo opens and EVE RAND
     steps out. Eve is in her late thirties, has the look of a
     traditional New England lady. She watches as Jeffrey tends to
     Chance.

                    JEFFREY 
          I don't think we should call anyone
          just yet, it may not even be all
          that serious.

                    CHANCE 
               (obviously hurting)
          I agree.

                    JEFFREY 
          Let's have a look, do you mind?

                    CHANCE 
          Of course. I would like to look.

     Chance bends, raises his trouser leg. A red-bluish swollen
     bruise, three inches in diameter, is forming on his calf.

                    JEFFREY 
          It's starting to swell, is it
          painful?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes.

     Eve moves closer to Chance, looks at the bruise.

                    EVE
               (to Chance)
          ... Won't you let us do something
          for you? Your leg should be
          examined, we could take you to a
          hospital.

                    CHANCE
               (smiles at Eve)
          There's no need for a hospital.

                    EVE 
          Why, there certainly is. You must
          see a doctor, I insist on it.
          Please, let us take you.

     Eve turns to get back into the limo. David goes with her to
     hold the door.

                    DAVID 
          I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Rand, I
          never saw the man.

                    EVE 
          Oh, I don't think it was anyone's
          fault, David. 

                    DAVID
          Thank you, ma'am.

     Chance is hesitant about getting in the car. Jeffrey offers a
     helping hand.

                    JEFFREY
          Please, sir.

                    CHANCE 
          I've never ridden in an automobile.

                    JEFFREY 
               (a beat)
          I assure you, sir, David is a very
          careful driver. Please, won't you
          let us take you?

                    CHANCE 
               (looks at the car, then
                    decides)
          ... Yes. You can take me.

                    JEFFREY 
          Very good.

     Jeffrey assists Chance into the rear seat of the limo.

                    CHANCE 
               (as he gets in)
          ... My suitcase.

                    JEFFREY 
          Yes sir. I'll take care of that.

     Jeffrey closes the door, goes back to pick up Chance's
     suitcase, does not notice the remote control. As Jeffrey puts
     Chance's bag into the trunk, we see the personalized license
     plate "RAND l."

     INT. LIMOUSINE - EVENING

     Chance and Eve settle in the back seat. As they talk, David
     starts up the limo, Jeffrey joins him in front and the limo
     pulls out into traffic.

                    EVE 
          I hope you're comfortable.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I am.

                    EVE 
          These can be such trying situations
          everyone seems to make such a to-do
          over a simple little accident. Of
          course, they can be very
          frightening, and I must apologize
          for David, he's never had an
          accident before.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. He's a very careful driver.

                    EVE 
          ... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg
          feeling any better?

                    CHANCE 
          It's feeling better, but it's still
          very sore.

                    EVE 
          I see.
               (a thought)
          ... Say, would you mind seeing our
          family doctor?

                    CHANCE
               (doesn't understand)
          Your family doctor?

                    EVE 
          Yes. My husband has been very ill.
          His doctor and nurses are staying
          with us. Those hospitals can be so
          impersonal - why, it might be hours
          before you are treated...

                    CHANCE
          I agree.

                    EVE 
          Fine, it will save a lot of
          unnecessary fuss and it will be so
          much more pleasant for you...
               (leans forward)
          David, we'll just go on home.
          Jeffrey, would you call and let
          them know?

                    JEFFREY 
          Yes ma'am.

     Eve presses a button, the glass partition closes. As the
     window rolls up behind him, Jeffrey dials the limo telephone.

     There is a moment of silence. Eve, still a bit on edge from
     the accident and feeling a bit uncomfortable with a stranger
     in the car, presses another button. The limo's bar moves out,
     revealing a row of decanters and glasses.

                    EVE
          Would you care for a drink?

                    CHANCE
          Yes. Thank you.

     As Eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass, Chance
     notices the limo's TV set.

                    CHANCE (CONT'D)
          I would like to watch television.

                    EVE
               (a bit surprised)
          Oh? Certainly...

     She hands Chance the cognac, turns on the TV.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
          Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.

                    CHANCE
          Hello, Eve. 

     Chance takes a sip of the cognac, is not accustomed to
     alcohol, coughs. There is another moment of silence.

                    EVE
          May I ask your name?

                    CHANCE
               (with a slight cough)
          My name is Chance.

                    EVE
          Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?

                    CHANCE
               (still indistinct)
          No. I'm a gardener.

                    EVE
          Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey
          Gardiner... You're not related to
          Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?

                    CHANCE 
          No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil
          and Perdita.

                    EVE 
          Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful
          couple, we've been friends for
          years. We visit their island quite
          often.

     Chance reaches out to change the channel on the TV, suddenly
     realizes he doesn't have his remote control. He starts going
     through his pockets, searches for it.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
          Did you lose something?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I lost my remote control.

                    EVE 
          Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...

     Another pause, Chance reaches out, changes channels on TV.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
          ... I'll feel so relieved after Dr.
          Allenby examines your leg. After
          that, David can run you on home, or
          to your office or wherever you'd
          prefer... 
               (Chance still watches TV)
          ... Is there anything special you
          would like to watch?

                    CHANCE 
          I like to watch. This is fine.

     Chance watches the news. Eve sips on her cognac as David
     eases the limo out of the city of Washington.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

     The limo approaches, then turns into the entrance-way of the
     Rand Estate. Two guards stand on either side of the open
     gate, salute as the car passes through.

     EXT. RAND DRIVE - NIGHT

     The drive runs alongside a stream, then turns and crosses a
     large meadow. The limousine passes, still no sign of the
     house. It is a very, very long driveway.

     INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

     Chance is glued to the TV, switches channels, again watches
     the news. Eve takes his fascination with television as a sign
     of intelligence.

                    EVE 
          I can see that it must be very
          important for you to stay informed
          of all the latest events.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes.

                    EVE 
          I admire that in a person. As for
          myself, I find there is so much to
          assimilate that it can become quite
          muddling at times...

     Chance nods, changes the channel, watches a Mighty Mouse
     cartoon. Eve looks at him perplexed, then takes it for a joke
     and smiles.

     EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT

     Two uniformed valets, WILSON and PERKINS, await the
     limousines by the front door of the Rand mansion. Wilson
     stands behind a wheelchair. As the limo parks, Perkins and
     Jeffrey assist Chance into the chair. Wilson turns to Eve as
     she gets out of the limo.

                    WILSON 
          Good evening, Mrs. Rand.

                    EVE 
          Good evening, Wilson.

                    WILSON 
          I shall take the gentleman to the
          third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr.
          Allenby is standing by.

                    EVE 
          Thank you, Wilson. That will be
          fine.

     Perkins and Jeffrey carry Chance in the chair up the steps
     and into the house. Eve and Wilson follow.

     INT. RAND MANSION - FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Once inside the house, Wilson takes over wheeling Chance. A
     lady, GRETA, is waiting to take Eve's coat.

                    EVE 
          Thank you, Greta.
               (to Wilson)
          I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm
          needed.

                    WILSON 
          Yes, ma'am.

                    EVE
               (to Chance)
          I'll see you after the doctor has a
          look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.

                    CHANCE
               (looking around mansion)
          Yes, I think he should examine my
          leg.

     Eve watches as Wilson wheels Chance around a corner.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     The doors open, Wilson pushes Chance into the elevator. As
     Wilson pushes a button and the doors close on them, a strange
     look comes over Chance's face.

                    CHANCE
               (looks to Wilson)
          ... I've never been in one of
          these.

     Wilson thinks that Chance is talking about the wheelchair.

                    WILSON
          It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's
          been ill...

     Chance looks around the elevator.

                    CHANCE 
          Does it have a television?

                    WILSON 
               (laughs)
          No - but Mr. Rand does have one
          with an electric motor, that way he
          can get around by himself.

                    CHANCE 
          I see.

     Chance again checks out the elevator.

                    CHANCE (CONT'D)
          How long do we stay in here?

                    WILSON 
          How long? I don't know, see what
          the doctor says ...

     The elevator stops on the third floor.

     INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

     A hallway adjoining a large, glass-enclosed room. Eve passes
     through the hall, enters the room.

     INT. BENJAMIN RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Eve enters into a hermetically sealed area, set up with all
     the latest hospital emergency gear; oxygen, EKG machine, X
     ray machine, transfusion equipment, sterilizers, etc.
     BENJAMIN RAND, wearing a silk bathrobe, lies in a king-sized
     bed in the center of the room. A nurse, CONSTANCE, is
     attending to her duties in the room, looks up as Eve comes
     in.

                    CONSTANCE 
          Good evening, Mrs. Rand.

     EVE 

     Good evening, Constance.

     Ben Rand perks up as he sees Eve crossing to him. He is in
     his sixties, maintains an inner strength and dignity despite
     the sapping effects of his illness.

                    RAND
          (with weakness) 
          ... Eve...

     Eve kisses him, holds his hand.

                    EVE 
          Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm
          out... How are you feeling?

                    RAND 
          Tired... And I'm getting tired of
          being so tired. Other than that,
          I'm doing very well.

                    EVE 
          No headaches?

                    RAND 
          No, it's been a good day - better
          than yours, from what I've been
          told.

                    EVE
               (holds his hand against
                    her cheek)
          You heard?

                    RAND 
          I may be a shut-in, but I do not
          lack for news. I'm sorry you had to
          go through all that.

                    EVE 
          Oh, it wasn't all that bad,
          darling. We were fortunate that Mr.
          Gardiner turned out to be so
          reasonable.

                    RAND 
          Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet
          a reasonable man. Why don't you ask
          this Gardiner to join us for
          dinner?

                    EVE 
               (sits on the side of the
                    bed)
          Do you feel well enough for that?

                    RAND 
               (smiles)
          Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if
          I wait until I feel better, will I
          ever meet the man?

     There is silence from Eve. Rand squeezes her hand, turns to
     Constance.

                    RAND (CONT'D)
          Constance! I want new blood
          tonight, I'm getting up for dinner.

                    CONSTANCE 
          But, Mr. Rand...

                    RAND 
          Don't argue, tell Robert I want new
          blood!
               (turns to Eve)
          ... Ask him to dinner.

     Rand pulls Eve's hand close, kisses it.

     INT. EAST WING GUEST SUITE - NIGHT

     An enormous bedroom, filled with 18th Century antique
     furniture. DR. ROBERT ALLENBY dabs Chance's ass with a piece
     of cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection. Chance
     stands with his pants to the floor, looks to the television
     which is not turned on.

                    ALLENBY 
          The injection will ease the pain
          and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.

                    CHANCE 
          I understand. I've seen it done
          before.

                    ALLENBY 
          Now, you'll barely feel this. It
          won't hurt at all.

     Allenby administers the injection, Chance reacts from the
     pain.

                    CHANCE 
          You were wrong, it did hurt.

                    ALLENBY 
               (a chuckle)
          But not for long...

     As Allenby puts a band-aid on Chance's ass, Chance spots a
     remote control for the TV on the bedside table. He reaches
     out, picks it up.

                    ALLENBY (CONT'D)
          It's good that there was no
          apparent damage to the bone.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I think so, too.

                    ALLENBY 
          However, with injuries such as
          this, I have run into minor
          hemorrhaging, which really isn't
          too serious at the time, but can
          cause secondary problems if not
          looked after.

                    CHANCE 
          I see.

     Chance turns on the TV.

                    ALLENBY 
               (a look to the TV, then to
                    Chance)
          You can pull your trousers up, now.

                    CHANCE
          Oh, fine. 

                    ALLENBY
               (as Chance pulls up pants)
          Just to take the proper
          precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd
          recommend we take you downstairs
          and X-ray your leg.
               (no reaction from Chance,
                    Allenby takes a long look
                    at him)
          ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I
          would like to ask you something
          straight out.

                    CHANCE
               (doesn't understand)
          ... Straight out?

                    ALLENBY 
          Yes. Are you planning on making any
          sort of claim against the Rand's?

                    CHANCE 
               (after a beat)
          Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's
          what Thomas asked me.

                    ALLENBY 
          Thomas? Who's Thomas?

                    CHANCE 
          Thomas Franklin, an attorney.

                    ALLENBY 
          An attorney?

                    CHANCE 
               (turns back to TV)
          Yes.

                    ALLENBY
               (suddenly very cold)
          Then you wish to handle this matter
          through your attorneys?

                    CHANCE 
          There's no need for a claim, the
          garden is a healthy one.

                    ALLENBY
               (gives Chance a look)
          Oh, I see...
               (warms up)
          ... Well, then... You're a very
          funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught
          me off guard, I must admit...

                    CHANCE
               (changes channels, sits on
                    bed)
          Thank you.

                    ALLENBY 
          Good, keep your weight off that
          leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it
          would be best if you could stay
          here for a day or two, if that
          would be would be possible. Since
          Benjamin became ill we have our own
          hospital downstairs. I can promise
          you the finest in care, unless, of
          course, you would prefer to go
          elsewhere.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.

                    ALLENBY 
          Fine. Would you like me to speak to
          your personal physician?

                    CHANCE 
          No.

     Allenby waits for Chance to say more, he does not. Finally,
     Allenby picks up his bag, heads for the door.

                    ALLENBY
               (stops by door)
          I'll send Wilson up to take you for
          X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to
          use the telephone, and please let
          me know if you have any discomfort.

                    CHANCE
               (clicking changer)
          Yes, I will.

     Allenby gives him a look, then leaves. Chance watches an old
     movie of a man lighting a cigar. The man enjoys the cigar,
     blows out smoke. The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's
     mind.

     EXT. MANSION - PATIO - NIGHT

     Eve sits next to a roaring patio fireplace with a steaming
     cup of tea. Allenby comes outside, joins her.

                    ALLENBY 
          Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out
          here.

                    EVE 
          I wanted some fresh air, Robert.
          How is Mr. Gardiner?

                    ALLENBY 
          A rather large contusion, but I
          don't feel there is any serious
          damage. I'd like to keep an eye on
          him, though - I suggested that he
          stay here for a couple of days.

                    EVE 
          Stay here? Is that necessary?

                    ALLENBY 
          Not necessary, but preferable. I
          don't think he'll be a bother, he
          seems like a most refreshing sort
          of man.

                    EVE 
          Yes, he is different... Not the
          kind of person one usually meets in
          Washington.

                    ALLENBY 
          How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a
          welcome change of pace.

                    EVE 
          He's very intense, and internal,
          don't you think?

                    ALLENBY 
          At times, yes. But that's not an
          uncommon reaction to such an
          accident. Actually, I found him to
          have quite a sense of humor.

                    EVE 
          Good. It might be pleasant for a
          couple of days. 
               (Eve puts down her tea)
          ... Robert... Is there any
          improvement...?

                    ALLENBY 
          No, Eve... I'm sorry.

     Eve is silent for a moment, looks out to the darkness.

                    EVE 
          ... Sometimes when I see Ben I
          could swear that he's getting
          stronger... Something that he might
          say, the way he moves, or a look in
          his eyes - makes me feel that this
          is all a nightmare and that he'll
          be better soon... It's just so hard
          to believe what's really
          happening...

     Allenby reaches out, holds Eve's hand.

     INT. RAND MANSION - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     The elevator door opens, Wilson guides Chance in the
     wheelchair into the hallway.

                    CHANCE 
               (looks back to elevator)
          ... That is a very small room.

                    WILSON 
               (laughs)
          Yes sir, I guess that's true
          smallest room in the house.

                    CHANCE 
               (glancing around)
          Yes. It seems to be.

     Wilson takes this as another joke, chuckles as he wheels
     Chance toward Rand's hospital room.

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     CONSTANCE and another nurse, TERESA, stand by as Rand is
     being given a transfusion. Rand lifts his head as Wilson
     wheels Chance into the room.

                    RAND
          Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital,
          Mr. Gardiner.

                    CHANCE
               (looks around room)
          ... I see.

     Wilson pushes Chance to the X-Ray machine, where the
     technician, BILLINGS, a Black man, waits. As Wilson and
     Billings help Chance onto the X-Ray table, Chance's face
     brightens up.

                    CHANCE (CONT'D)
          I feel very good in here.

                    RAND
          Sure you do. This ward is air
          tight, I have a little extra oxygen
          pumped in, keeps my spirits up.

                    CHANCE
          Yes. I like that very much.

                    BILLINGS
               (lining up Chance's leg)
          This won't take long, Mr. Gardiner.
          Please hold still when I ask.

     Chance stares at Billings, reacts to him being Black.

                    CHANCE
               (to Billings)
          Do you know Raphael?

                    BILLINGS
          No sir, I don't believe I do.

                    CHANCE 
          Oh. I have a message for him.

                    BILLINGS
          Yes, sir.

                    CHANCE
          A Black man gave me the message.

                    BILLINGS 
          Well, I still don't believe I know
          the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold
          still.

     Rand looks over as Billings takes the X-Ray.

                    RAND 
          Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner -
          aplastic anemia.

     Chance smiles to Rand.

                    RAND (CONT'D)
          Failure of the bone marrow to
          produce red blood cells... Not a
          damn thing they can do about it.
          Oh, they can make me comfortable,
          prolong my life with steroid
          therapy and transfusions... And
          what makes my blood boil, what
          little I have left, that is, Mr.
          Gardiner - is that it's generally a
          young person's disease... Here I
          am, getting on in years and about
          to die of a young person's
          disease...

                    CHANCE 
               (still smiles at Rand)
          Yes. You look very sick.

                    BILLINGS 
          Hold still, please, Mr. Gardiner.

                    RAND 
               (a laugh)
          I am very sick, and, as you can see
          by all this paraphernalia, I am
          very wealthy. I think I would
          rather be wealthy and sick than
          poor and sick.

                    CHANCE 
               (looks around the room)
          I understand. I've never seen
          anything like this on television.

                    BILLINGS 
          Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.

                    CONSTANCE 
          You too, Mr. Rand, you must stay
          quiet.

     Rand lays his head back.

                    RAND 
          ... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner -
          we're prisoners of tubes and
          technology.

                    CHANCE 
          I agree.

                    RAND 
               (flat on his back)
          ... You will join us for dinner,
          won't you, Mr. Gardiner?

                    CHANCE 
               (also flat on his back)
          Yes. I am very hungry.

                    RAND 
          ... So am I, my boy - so am I.

     INT. RAND DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     THURMAND, a waiter, and MARIANNE, a waitress, enter into the
     Rand dining room carrying trays of food. The dining room is
     immense, a 70-foot ceiling, huge fireplace. Allenby, Eve,
     Rand, and Chance (both in wheelchairs) sit around the table.
     Rand speaks slowly, with obvious weakness.

                    RAND
          I know exactly what you mean. Today
          the businessman is at the mercy of
          kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they
          want to do is regulate our natural
          growth! It's happening across the
          country!

                    ALLENBY 
          To everyone, I'm afraid. The
          Government controls are so
          restricting that the Medical
          Profession, as we know it, is being
          legislated out of existence.

                    RAND 
          Of course! By kid-lawyers!

     Eve turns to Chance.

                    EVE 
          Won't your injury prevent you from
          attending to business, Mr.
          Gardiner?

                    CHANCE 
          No. It won't do that.

                    EVE 
          ... Would you like us to notify
          anyone for you?

                    CHANCE 
          No. The Old Man died and Louise
          left.

     There is a moment of silence.

                    EVE 
          Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you
          have any need for any of our
          facilities, please do not hesitate
          to ask.

                    RAND 
          Do you need a secretary?

                    CHANCE 
          No, thank you. My house has been
          closed.

                    RAND 
          Oh. When you say 'Your house has
          been closed', you mean to say that
          your business was shut down?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. Shut down and locked by the
          attorneys.

                    RAND 
          What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The
          S.E.C.! Damn them!

                    EVE 
          I hope that staying here won't be
          an inconvenience for you.

                    CHANCE 
          No. I like it here.

                    RAND 
          That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I
          call you Chauncey?

                    CHANCE 
               (agreeable to being called
                    Chauncey)
          Yes. Chauncey is fine.

                    RAND 
          And I'm Ben.

                    ALLENBY 
               (smiles to Chance)
          ... And please call me Robert.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Robert. I will.

                    RAND 
          So tell me, Chauncey, what are your
          plans now?

     Chance looks around the room. 

                    CHANCE 
          Does this house have a garden?

     Allenby gives Chance a look.

                    RAND 
          Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow,
          Chauncey, you will see our gardens.

                    CHANCE 
          I see. I would like to work in your
          garden.

                    EVE 
               (laughs)
          Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I
          sometimes enjoy puttering around
          myself, such a pleasant way to
          forget one's troubles.

                    CHANCE 
          I am a very good gardener.

                    RAND 
          A gardener! Well put, Chauncey
          excellent! Isn't that what a
          businessman is? A gardener? A
          person that makes flinty soil
          productive with the labor of his
          own hands, who waters it with the
          sweat from his own brow, and who
          creates a place of value for his
          family and community? Yes,
          Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor
          -- yes, indeed, a productive
          businessman is a laborer in his own
          vineyard.

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you, Ben. The garden that I
          left was such a place. Everything
          which grew there was with the labor
          of my own hands. I planted seeds
          and watered them and watched
          everything grow.

                    RAND 
               (weakly)
          Bravo!

                    CHANCE 
          But I don't have that any more...
               (points to ceiling)
          ... All that's left for me now is
          the room upstairs.

                    RAND 
          Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you
          are young, you are healthy, for
          God's sake don't give up on
          yourself! You have to fight! You
          can't let those bastards keep you
          down! I don't want to hear any more
          from you about the 'Room Upstairs'.
          That's where I'm going soon.

     There is a long pause. Chance looks up, then smiles at Rand.

                    CHANCE 
          It's a very pleasant room, Ben.

                    RAND 
               (laughs)
          Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what
          they say, anyway.

     Another period of silence. The servants bustle around the
     room as Allenby studies Chance.

     INT. RAND'S POOL ROOM - NIGHT

     Allenby opens the door. Rand enters in his electric
     wheelchair followed by Chance being pushed by Wilson.

                    RAND 
          ... I don't know what you've heard
          about me, Chauncey, but I'm sure
          you know everything there is to
          know. Cigar?

     Rand holds out humidor to Chance.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, thank you.
               (takes cigar)
          No Ben. I don't know everything
          about you.

     Rand smiles as he takes a cigar for himself.

                    RAND 
          ... No, of course you don't. Excuse
          me for being so presumptuous. No
          man knows everything about another
          man - however, very few are honest
          enough to admit it.

                    ALLENBY 
          That is so true. You're different,
          Chauncey... Quite different than
          most men.

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you, Robert.

     Rand lights his own cigar, then hands an ornate lighter to
     Chance.

                    RAND 
               (picks up pool cue, weakly
                    strokes the balls)
          ... You know, Chauncey, there are
          thousands of American businessmen,
          large and small, that share your
          plight. I've been concerned with
          the situation for some time now.

     Chance, not knowing to bite off the tip, tries to light the
     cigar like the man on TV. It will not light.

                    RAND (CONT'D)
          So I've been thinking about
          beginning a financial assistance
          program, Chauncey, to help out
          American businessmen that have been
          harassed by inflation, excessive
          taxation, unions and other
          indecencies...

     Allenby watches Chance trying to light the cigar as Rand
     speaks on, shooting pool as he talks.

                    RAND 
          ... I'd like to offer the decent
          'Gardeners' of the business
          community a helping hand. After
          all, they are our strongest defense
          against the pollutants who so
          threaten our basic freedoms and the
          well-being of our middle class.
          Tell me, would you have any
          thoughts on such a program?

     Chance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray, smiles at
     Allenby, then answers Rand.

                    CHANCE 
          No, Ben.

                    RAND 
               (a smile)
          Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey?
          Well, I can understand that. When a
          man loses everything, anger has a
          tendency to block out reason for a
          time. Just give it some thought,
          work with the idea, I'm sure you'll
          have plenty to say in a few days.

                    CHANCE 
          I could give it some thought, Ben,
          but my leg is very sore.

                    RAND 
          ... Oh?
               (looks to Allenby)
          Robert, take a look, would you?

                    ALLENBY 
          Some pain is to be expected... 
               (bends to Chance, looks at
                    leg)
          ... And I think what would be best
          for the two of you is a good
          night's rest. 
               (checks watch)
          ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time
          for my patients to prepare for bed.

                    RAND 
               (puts down pool cue)
          We have common foes, Chauncey - kid
          lawyers and our physician!

                    CHANCE 
          I agree.

     Allenby laughs as he takes Rand's cigar from him, snuffs it
     in the ashtray.

     INT. MANSION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Wilson stands behind Chance in the wheelchair. Chance glances
     slowly and inquisitively around the elevator. When his eyes
     meet Wilson's, the valet breaks out in laughter.

                    WILSON
               (laughing, trying to
                    apologize) 
          ... Sorry, sir - I just couldn't
          contain myself... I knew you were
          going to come out with another one
          of your jests about the elevator...
          Excuse me, sir...

     The elevator stops, the door opens.

     INT. MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Wilson wheels Chance out of the elevator.

                    CHANCE
               (looks back as the door
                    closes)
          ... Hmmm... Elevator.

                    WILSON
               (laughs again)
          ... Yes sir - elevator!

     Wilson stops laughing, becomes the stone-faced servant once
     again as he notices Eve coming out of her bedroom. Wilson
     stops wheeling Chance, stands stiffly at attention as Eve and
     Chance talk.

                    EVE 
          Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how
          dreadful I feel about the accident
          today, but that I'm delighted that
          you are staying with us.

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you, Eve - I like this house
          very much.

                    EVE 
          ... And Ben is just mad about you -
          you've lifted his spirits so - it's
          just... Well, it's just a real
          pleasure having you with us.

                    CHANCE 
          Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen
          that before.

                    EVE 
          Yes... I know, Chauncey.

                    CHANCE 
          I like Ben very much... He reminds
          me of the Old Man...

                    EVE 
          He does...?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. Are you going to leave and
          close the house when he dies?

     Eve is not prepared for such a question.

                    EVE 
          ... Why... No, I don't think so...

                    CHANCE 
          That's good.

     Chance smiles at Eve and there is a moment of silence before
     Eve steps back into her bedroom.

                    EVE
          ... Good night, Chauncey.

                    CHANCE
          Good night, Eve.

     Eve closes the door. Wilson wheels Chance down the hallway
     toward the guest room.

     EXT. FRONT OF RAND MANSION - MORNING

     Eve comes out of the house, Jeffrey holds the door for her as
     she gets into "RAND l." Jeffrey gets in and the limo pulls
     away. Chance comes out of the front door, walking with a
     limp. His first view of the Rand grounds in the daylight, he
     is taken by the extent of the greenery. An attendant, LEWIS,
     hurries to Chance.

                    LEWIS 
          Did you want a car, sir?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I would like a car.

                    LEWIS 
          Yes, sir.

     Lewis goes to his post, picks up a phone. As Chance looks at
     the surroundings, Allenby and Wilson, with Chance's
     wheelchair, come out of the house.

                    ALLENBY 
               (frowns as he sees Chance
                    walking)
          Chauncey, there you are. What are
          you doing on that leg?

                    CHANCE 
          It's fine today, Robert.

                    ALLENBY 
          Shame on you, Chauncey - you should
          let me be the judge of that.
               (motions to Wilson)
          Please, sit in the chair.

     Wilson pushes the wheelchair to Chance, he sits.

                    ALLENBY (CONT'D)
               (checks leg)
          I swear, Chauncey, between you and
          Benjamin, I've got my hands full... 
               (looks at calf)
          ... Say, that is coming along, the
          swelling has gone down
          considerably...
               (pokes a spot)
          ... Any pain here?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.

     A limousine pulls up to the front of the mansion, waits for
     Chance.

                    ALLENBY 
               (continues examining)
          ... Benjamin has been hounding me
          to allow him to address the annual
          meeting of his Financial Institute
          today, but obviously, the strain
          would be impossible... How about
          here, Chauncey, any soreness?

                    CHANCE 
          Hardly any, Robert.

     Lewis, the attendant, interrupts.

                    LEWIS 
          Your limousine, sir.

                    CHANCE 
          Oh, thank you.

                    ALLENBY 
               (reacting to limo)
          ... Were you going somewhere?

                    CHANCE 
          No, Robert.

                    ALLENBY 
               (a beat)
          ... Oh. 
               (checks leg)
          ... My God, I only wish that
          Benjamin had your recuperative
          powers... Anyway, the President
          offered to sit in for Ben at the
          meeting, quite a nice gesture, I
          felt. He's due here soon, I
          believe.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Robert. I know about the
          President.

                    ALLENBY 
               (mildly surprised)
          ... Oh? You've heard?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to
          meet the President.

                    ALLENBY 
               (stands)
          He does, does he?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Ben told me to be in his room
          at ten o'clock.

                    ALLENBY 
          Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.

                    CHANCE 
          How do I know when it's ten
          o'clock?

     A long look from Allenby, then he looks at his watch.

                    ALLENBY 
          ... It's five of, you'd best get on
          in there.

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you, Robert.

     Wilson begins to push Chance.

                    CHANCE (CONT'D)
          I would like to walk today.

                    ALLENBY
          Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the
          President, aren't you?

                    CHANCE
               (gets out of chair)
          Oh, really?

     Allenby, a bit puzzled, watches as Chance goes into the
     house.

     INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING

     Chance limps aimlessly through a hallway. He stops, admires a
     large tapestry on the wall. A servant, SMYTHE, notices Chance
     appears confused, approaches him.

                    SMYTHE
          May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?

                    CHANCE
               (with a smile)
          Yes. I would like to go to Rand
          Memorial Hospital.

                    SMYTHE
               (a pause)
          ... Sir?

                    CHANCE
          Yes.

     There is another long pause.

                    SMYTHE
          ... Did you wish to see someone,
          sir?

                    CHANCE
          Yes, I would like to see Ben.

                    SMYTHE
          Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this
          way, sir.

     Chance follows Smythe down the hall.

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     Rand is in an easy chair, dressed for his meeting with the
     President. The two nurses are working at the disinfecting
     table. Rand smiles as Chance is shown into the room by
     Smythe.

                    RAND 
          Chauncey, up and around this
          morning, are you?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.

                    RAND 
          Well, that's good news, my boy.

                    CHANCE 
          You're looking much better today,
          Ben.

                    RAND 
          Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey...
          I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up,
          I didn't want the President to
          think I was going to die during our
          talk.

                    CHANCE 
          I understand.

                    RAND 
          No one likes a dying man, my boy -
          because few know what death is. All
          we know is the terror of it. But
          you're an exception, Chauncey -
          that's what I admire in you, your
          marvelous balance. You don't
          stagger back and forth between fear
          and hope - you're a truly peaceful
          man.

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you, Ben. 
               (looks at Rand closely)
          ... The nurse did a very good job,
          Ben.

     The nurses turn, look at Chance.

     EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING

     Wilson is at the head of eight servants lined up on the front
     steps. Two black PLYMOUTH SEDANS pull up and park. EIGHT MEN
     in grey business suits get out. One of them, WOLTZ, goes
     directly to Wilson.

                    WOLTZ 
          Good morning, Mr. Wilson.

                    WILSON 
          Good morning, Mr. Woltz, nice to
          see you again.

                    WOLTZ 
          Thank you. How have you been?

                    WILSON 
          Fine, thank you.
               (hands Woltz paper)
          We have an additional guest with us
          today, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

                    WOLTZ
               (reads list)
          I see...
               (turns to other men)
          Okay, let's go to work.

     The eight servants pair up with the eight men in suits and go
     into the house.

     INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING

     Allenby gets off the elevator, stands and thinks for a
     moment, then heads off down the hallway in the direction of
     Chance's room.

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     Chance watches television as Rand speaks.

                    RAND 
          Yes, when I was younger I had
          thoughts about public office... But
          I found, Chauncey - that I was able
          to contribute more as a private
          citizen... of course, my wealth
          provided me with considerable
          influence, but I've tried, believe
          me, not to misuse that power...
          It's extremely important, Chauncey,
          when one is in a position of
          eminence, that he does not allow
          himself to become blinded to the
          needs of the country... The
          temptations are strong, and I've
          been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many,
          but I have tried to stay open to
          voices of the people... I have
          tried to remain honest to myself...

                    CHANCE
               (changing channels)
          I see, Ben.

                    RAND 
          ... Maybe one day you shall find
          yourself in a similar position,
          Chauncey... Maybe one day...

     EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING

     Two black limousines followed by a station wagon with small
     holes in the side pull up in front of the mansion. As men
     from the first limousine and the station wagon jump out and
     take positions around the driveway, Lewis hurries to his
     post, picks up his phone.

     INT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - MORNING

     The nerve center of the Rand Enterprises since he has become
     ill. Four or five desks, all the latest electronic office
     equipment, three TV's with video taping facilities, countless
     telephones. MRS. AUBREY, Rand's senior secretary, is at her
     desk, answers her phone.

                    MRS. AUBREY
               (into phone)
          Yes... Oh, very good, Lewis, thank
          you.

     Mrs. Aubrey hangs up, picks up another phone, pushes a
     button.

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     Rand smiles at Chance as the phone rings.

                    RAND 
          He's here.
               (into phone)
          Yes, Mrs. Aubrey?
               (listens)
          Fine. Show the President to the
          library, we'll be along in a few
          minutes.

     Rand hangs up the phone, turns to Chance with a twinkle in
     his eyes.

                    RAND (CONT'D)
          It's an old habit that goes along
          with power -- keep them waiting...

     Teresa brings Rand's wheelchair to him.

                    RAND (CONT'D)
               (stands, very weak)
          Not now, Teresa. I'm seeing the
          President on my own two feet.

                    TERESA 
          But, Mr. Rand...

                    RAND 
               (puts an arm around Chance
                    for support)
          Shall we go, Chauncey?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Ben. That's a good idea.

     Rand walks slowly, clings to the limping Chance tightly as
     they leave the room.

     EXT. HALLWAY - MORNING

     Secret Service Men are seen in the background as Rand stops
     outside Mrs. Aubrey's office, leans in.

                    RAND 
          Mrs. Aubrey, have you received the
          papers on the Caracas agreement?

                    MRS. AUBREY
          Yes, sir. They're ready for you to
          sign.

                    RAND
          Excellent. 
               (turns to Chance)
          A good woman, Mrs. Aubrey.

                    CHANCE 
               (seeing her for first
                    time)
          I agree, Ben.

     They shuffle off down the hallway. Chance smiles at the
     Secret Service men that they pass.

     INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY BY LIBRARY - MORNING

     Woltz and Wilson wait by the library door. Woltz takes a
     small metal detector from his pocket as Rand and Chance
     approach.

                    WOLTZ
          Good morning, Mr. Rand.

                    RAND
          Woltz, how have you been?

                    WOLTZ 
               (passes detector over
                    Rand's body)
          Just fine, thank you, sir. 
               (turns to Chance)
          And you must be Mr. Gardiner.

                    CHANCE
          Yes.

                    WOLTZ 
               (passes detector over
                    Chance)
          Just a formality, Mr. Gardiner.

                    CHANCE 
               (as he finishes)
          Thank you very much.

     Wilson knocks lightly, then opens the library door, Rand and
     Chance enter.

     INT. RAND LIBRARY - MORNING

     Rand and Chance come into the Library and the President goes
     to Rand with both hands outstretched.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Ben!

                    RAND 
               (very weak)
          ... Mr. President, how good to see
          you.

                    PRESIDENT 
          It's so good to see you too, Ben,
          you look terrific!

                    RAND 
               (barely able to stand)
          I'm not convinced of that, Mr.
          President, but your visit has
          raised my spirits...

                    PRESIDENT 
          Well, I'm delighted to be here, my
          friend. I've missed you. 
               (guides Rand to chair)
          Here, sit down, get off your feet.

     As Rand sinks into the chair, Chance approaches the President
     with both hands outstretched.

                    CHANCE 
          Good morning, Mr. President.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (smiling)
          ... Hello.

     Chance and the President exchange a two-handed handshake.
     Rand, still weak from standing, catches his breath and
     introduces Chance.

                    RAND 
          Mr. President, I'd like you to meet
          my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey
          Gardiner.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.

                    CHANCE 
          You look much taller on television,
          Mr. President.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (a beat)
          ... Oh, really...

                    RAND 
               (smiling)
          You will find that my house guest
          does not bandy words, Mr.
          President.

     The President gives Chance a look, then laughs.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just
          fine with me - I'm a man that
          appreciates a frank discussion...
          Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...

                    CHANCE 
               (sitting)
          Yes, I will.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (also sits)
          Now, Ben, did you happen to get a
          chance to...

     Chance perks up at the mention of his name, interrupts.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes?

     There is a beat as the President looks at Chance quizzically,
     then he continues.

                    PRESIDENT
          I just wondered if you had gone
          over my speech, Ben.

                    RAND 
          Yes, I did.

                    PRESIDENT 
          ... Well?

                    RAND 
          Overall - pretty good. But, Mr.
          President, I think it's very
          dangerous to resort to temporary
          measures at this stage of the game.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Well, Ben... I...

                    RAND 
          I sympathize with your position,
          Mr. President, I know how difficult
          it is to be straightforward, the
          reaction to such a speech could be
          chaos.

                    PRESIDENT 
          That's too big a risk, I can't take
          the chance.

                    CHANCE
               (again perks up)
          Yes?

     Once again, the President gives Chance a puzzled look.

     INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING

     Perkins accompanies Secret Service Agent RIFF as he checks
     out the third floor. Riff knocks on each door, looks inside,
     then moves in.

     INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING

     Allenby is searching through Chancels clothes looking for
     some sort of identification. There is a knock at the door,
     Allenby pulls back from the closet as Riff opens the door,
     looks inside.

                    ALLENBY 
          Oh... Hello.

                    RIFF 
               (entering)
          Good morning. I'm Riff, Secret
          Service.

                    ALLENBY 
          ... Yes. Of course.

     Perkins watches curiously as Riff passes the metal detector
     over Allenby's clothing.

     INT. LIBRARY - MORNING

     The President is worried about what Rand is telling him. He
     paces, smokes a cigarette. Chance smiles through it all.

                    RAND 
          ... There is no longer any margin
          for inflation, it has gone as far
          as it can, you've reached your
          limits on taxation, dependence on
          foreign energy has reached a
          crisis, and, from where I see it,
          Mr. President, the Free Enterprise
          System has reached the breaking
          point. We are on the brink of
          another crash from which recovery
          might not be possible.

                    PRESIDENT 
          It's that serious, huh?

                    RAND 
          I'm afraid so.

     The President now looks nearly as bad as Rand. He sits, turns
     to Chance.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Do you agree with Ben, Mr.
          Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do
          you think we can stimulate growth
          through temporary incentives?

                    CHANCE 
               (a beat)
          As long as the roots are not
          severed, all is well and all will
          be well in the garden.

                    PRESIDENT
               (a pause)
          ... In the garden?

                    CHANCE 
          That is correct. In a garden,
          growth has its season. There is
          spring and summer, but there is
          also fall and winter. And then
          spring and summer again...

                    PRESIDENT 
               (staring at Chance)
          ... Spring and summer...
               (confused)
          Yes, I see... Fall and winter.
               (smiles at Chance)
          Yes, indeed...
               (a beat)
          Could you go through that one more
          time, please, Mr. Gardiner?

                    RAND 
          I think what my most insightful
          friend is saying, Mr. President, is
          that we welcome the inevitable
          seasons of nature, yet we are upset
          by the seasons of our economy.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. That is correct.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (pleased)
          ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must
          admit, that is one of the most
          refreshing and optimistic
          statements I've heard in a very,
          very long time.

     The President puts out his cigarette, rises.

                    PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          ... Many of us forget that nature
          and society are one! Yes, though we
          have tried to cut ourselves off
          from nature, we are still a part of
          it! Like nature, our economic
          system remains, in the long run,
          stable and rational. And that is
          why we must not fear to be at its
          mercy! 
               (he smiles at Chance, who
                    is absorbed in looking
                    around the room at the
                    books)
          ... I envy your good, solid sense,
          Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely
          what we lack on Capitol Hill. 
               (glances at watch)
          I must be going. 
               (holds out hand to Chance)
          Mr. Gardiner, this visit has been
          enlightening...

     Chance rises and shakes the President's hand.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. It has.

                    PRESIDENT 
          ... You will honor me and my family
          with a visit, won't you?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I will.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Wonderful, we'll all look forward
          to seeing you. 
               (turns to Rand)
          Is Eve around? I'd like to say
          hello.

                    RAND 
          No, she flew up to Boston for
          another charity event. She'll be
          sorry to have missed you.

                    PRESIDENT 
          I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted
          me to send along her best to the
          two of you - and, Ben, I want to
          thank you for your time and
          thoughts.

                    RAND 
          Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank
          you for coming to spend time with a
          dying man.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Now, Ben, I won't have any of that.
          Why don't you listen to your good
          friend Chauncey this is a time to
          think of life!

     The President clasps Rand's hand.

                    RAND 
          You're right, Mr. President I don't
          like feeling sorry for myself.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Take care of yourself, Ben.

                    RAND 
          You take care too, Bobby.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (as he turns to go, a
                    smile to Chance)
          Mr. Gardiner...

     The President leaves the library and Chance sits back down.

                    RAND 
               (as the door closes)
          He's a decent fellow, the
          President, isn't he?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Ben - he is.

                    RAND 
          He was quite impressed with your
          comments, Chauncey - he hears my
          sort of analysis from everyone, but
          yours, unfortunately - seldom if
          ever at all.

                    CHANCE 
          I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice
          talking to the President.

     EXT. RAND MANSION - MORNING

     An aide, KAUFMAN, waits by the front door of the Rand
     mansion. As the President comes out, he speaks quietly to
     Kaufman.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Kaufman, I'm going to need
          information on Mr. Chauncey
          Gardiner's background.

                    KAUFMAN
               (makes note of name)
          Gardiner, yes, sir.

                    PRESIDENT 
          And put it through on a Code Red -
          I want it as soon as possible.

                    KAUFMAN 
          No problem, Chief.

     They head toward the waiting limousines.

     INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING

     Rand has an arm around Chance, hangs on for dear life as the
     two of them walk through the hall. Behind them, Wilson and
     Perkins push empty wheelchairs.

                    RAND
               (very weak)
          ... You know, Chauncey, there's
          something about you... You're
          direct, you grasp things quickly
          and you state them plainly. You
          don't play games with words to
          protect yourself. I feel I can
          speak to you frankly... You know
          what I was talking to you about
          last night?

                    CHANCE
               (blankly)
          No, Ben.

                    RAND 
          Oh, sure you do, the financial
          assistance program. I think you
          might be just the man to take
          charge of such an undertaking. I'd
          like you to meet with the members
          of the Board, we'll be able to
          discuss the matter at greater
          length at that time.

                    CHANCE 
          I understand.

                    RAND 
               (stops outside his door)
          And, please, Chauncey - don't rush
          your decision. I know you're not a
          man to act on the spur of the
          moment.

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you, Ben.

                    RAND 
          And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you
          must excuse me - I'm very tired all
          of a sudden.

     Wilson and Perkins leave the wheelchairs, assist Rand into
     his hospital room.

                    CHANCE 
               (as they go in)
          I'm sorry that you are so sick,
          Ben.

     The door closes, Chance limps off down the hall.

     EXT. RAND MANSION - GARDEN - DAY

     Chance, with a limp, walks down a pathway in the garden,
     admires the greenery. In the background, coming from the
     house, we see Eve.

                    EVE 
               (approaches Chance, calls)
          Chauncey!

                    CHANCE 
               (stops, turns)
          Hello, Eve.

                    EVE 
          Your leg must be getting better.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. It's feeling much better now.

                    EVE 
          Good. I'm glad to hear that.
               (they walk together)
          ... How did you like meeting the
          President?

                    CHANCE 
          Fine. He's very nice.

                    EVE 
          Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get
          to see him.

     They walk along in silence for a moment. Chance sees a huge
     greenhouse not far from them, heads toward it. Eve turns to
     him, hesitates, then questions.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
          ... Chauncey... Last night you
          mentioned an old man, that died.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes.

                    EVE 
          Was he a relative? Or an intimate
          friend?

                    CHANCE 
               (looking at greenhouse)
          He was a very wealthy man, he
          looked after me since I was young.

                    EVE 
          Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?

                    CHANCE 
               (quizzically)
          ... Mentor...?

     Eve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the Old
     Man.

                    EVE 
          Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't
          mean to pry. You must have been
          very close to him.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I was.

                    EVE 
          I'm sorry... 
               (getting more to the
                    point)
          ... And what about Louise? YOU
          mentioned that she had gone, were
          you close to her also?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I liked Louise very much. She
          was his maid.

                    EVE 
               (relieved)
          Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I
          thought perhaps she was someone
          that you may have been romantically
          involved with.

                    CHANCE 
          Oh, no. She brought me my meals.

                    EVE 
               (pleased)
          Of course.

     Eve edges slightly closer to Chance. Chance edges slightly
     closer to the greenhouse, is fascinated by it.

                    CHANCE 
          What is that?

                    EVE 
          Our greenhouse.

                    CHANCE 
               (pleased)
          Oh, I like that very much.

                    EVE 
          Yes, so do we.

     Chance peeks through one of the windows.

     INT. RAND'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Rand is in bed. Eve, Chance and Allenby are seated around
     him, the two nurses standing to one side. They all watch the
     President's address to the Financial Institute on TV. Chance
     inhales deeply, enjoys the oxygen in the room. Rand is
     looking weaker. Every so often, Allenby casts a concerned
     glance his way.

                    PRESIDENT'S VOICE 
          ... And there are so many of you
          that have proclaimed that we are on
          the brink of the worst financial
          crisis in this nation's history.
          And there are so many of you
          demanding that we put into effect
          drastic measures to alter its
          course. Well, let me tell you,
          gentlemen, I have been conducting
          multiple-level consultations with
          members of the Cabinet, House and
          Senate. I have conducted meetings
          with prominent business leaders
          throughout the country. And this
          very morning I had an in-depth
          discussion with your founder and
          Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr. Benjamin
          Turnbull Rand and his close friend
          and advisor Mr. Chauncey
          Gardiner...

     Rand perks up a bit at this mention. Allenby manages a smile,
     once again looks at Rand, checking his condition. Eve looks
     proudly at Chance, who continues to enjoy the oxygen.

                    PRESIDENT'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          ... Well, gentlemen, I found this
          to be a most rewarding
          conference... To quote Mr.
          Gardiner, a most intuitive man, 'As
          long as the roots of industry
          remain firmly planted in the
          national soil, the economic
          prospects are undoubtedly sunny.'

     Rand starts coughing, breathing heavily. Allenby and the
     nurses rush to his bedside. Allenby shoots a quick look to
     Eve and Chance.

                    ALLENBY
               (motioning toward door)
          Excuse us, please. 

     Eve and Chance leave the room as Allenby administers aid to
     Rand.

                    PRESIDENT'S VOICE 
          Gentlemen, let us not fear the
          inevitable chill and storms of
          autumn and winter, instead, let us
          anticipate the rapid growth of
          springtime, let us await the
          rewards of summer. As in a garden
          of the earth, let us learn to
          accept and appreciate the times
          when the trees are bare as well as
          the times when we pick the fruit.

     EXT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - DAY

     Eve and Chance sit in silence on the patio. Eve's eyes are
     swollen, red, she has been crying. She turns to Chance,
     reaches out, touches his hand.

                    EVE
               (hesitates)
          ... I'm...
               (pause)
          ... I'm very grateful that you're
          here, Chauncey...
               (pause)
          ... With us ...

                    CHANCE 
          So am I, Eve.

     Allenby comes out the door, his mood is serious,
     professional. Eve turns quickly, awaits his news.

                    ALLENBY
               (sits alongside Eve)
          ... Eve - this has been an
          exhausting day for Ben...

                    EVE
               (anxious)
          ... But he's...?

                    ALLENBY 
          He's resting comfortably now.
          There's no cause for alarm, yet...

     Mrs. Aubrey comes out of the house.

                    MRS. AUBREY 
          Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone
          call for you. Sidney Courtney, the
          financial editor of the Washington
          Post.

                    CHANCE 
               (not moving)
          Thank you.

                    MRS. AUBREY 
          Would you care to take it, sir?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes.

     Chance still does not move. Eve mistakes Chance's not moving
     for concern for herself. She puts a hand on his shoulder.

                    EVE 
          I'll be all right, Chauncey you go
          ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...

                    CHANCE 
               (rising)
          Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.

     Chance follows Mrs. Aubrey into the house. Eve watches him
     go, then turns to Allenby.

                    EVE 
          ... He's such a sensitive man, so
          considerate...

     INT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Mrs. Aubrey leads Chance to a phone at one of the desks. The
     three television sets are on, attract Chance's attention.

                    CHANCE 
               (picks up phone, looks at
                    TVs)
          Hello.

     INT. WASHINGTON POST - COURTNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

     SID COURTNEY, a Black man in his fifties, wears a rumpled
     wool jacket, smokes a pipe.

                    COURTNEY 
          Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid
          Courtney, Washington Post.

     INTERCUT - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE / COURTNEY'S OFFICE

                    CHANCE 
          Hello, Sid.

                    COURTNEY 
          I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr.
          Gardiner, I know you must be very
          busy.

                    CHANCE 
               (looking from one TV to
                    the other)
          No. I'm not busy.

                    COURTNEY 
          Then, I'll be brief. I covered the
          President's speech at the Financial
          Institute today, and since the Post
          would like to be as exact as
          possible, we would appreciate your
          comments on the meeting that took
          place between Mr. Rand, the
          President and yourself.

                    CHANCE 
          The President is a nice person. I
          enjoyed it very much.

                    COURTNEY 
          Good, sir. And so, it seems, did
          the President - but we would like
          to have some facts; such as, uh...
          What exactly is the relationship
          between yourself and that of the
          First American Financial
          Corporation?

                    CHANCE 
          I think you should ask Mr. Rand
          that.

                    COURTNEY 
          Of course. But since he is ill I'm
          taking the liberty of asking you.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, that is correct. I think you
          should ask Mr. Rand that.

     Courtney doesn't understand but continues his questioning.

                    COURTNEY 
          I see. Then one more quick
          question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at
          the Post would like to, uh - update
          our profile on you - what exactly
          is your business?

                    CHANCE 
          I have nothing more to say.

     Chance hangs up the phone, watches the TVs.

     Courtney listens to the dial tone, then puts the receiver
     down.

                    COURTNEY 
               (to himself)
          Typical - no wonder he's so close
          to Rand...

     INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - DAY

     Chance comes out of Mrs. Aubrey's office, notices the service
     elevator.

                    CHANCE 
          Hmmm. Elevator.

     He gets in the elevator.

     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

     Chance looks at the row of buttons, presses one. He smiles as
     he feels the elevator move.

     INT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT - DAY

     One of Mrs. Aubrey's secretaries, JENNIFER, waits with an arm
     load of paperwork for the elevator. The door opens, Chance
     smiles at her as he steps out.

                    JENNIFER 
               (surprised to see him)
          Why, hello, Mr. Gardiner - are you
          looking for someone?

                    CHANCE
          No.

     Jennifer gets in the elevator, the doors Close. Chance looks
     around the basement, puzzled. He had expected to be on the
     third floor.

     INT. MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Mrs. Aubrey is at her desk, buzzing her inter-house phone. As
     Jennifer enters, Mrs. Aubrey hangs up in frustration.

                    MRS. AUBREY
          I can't find Mr. Gardiner anywhere.

                    JENNIFER
          He's in the basement.

                    MRS. AUBREY
          What's he doing in the basement?

                    JENNIFER
          I don't know, Mrs. Aubrey.

     Mrs. Aubrey grabs a notepad, leaves the office.

     INT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT - DAY

     Mrs. Aubrey comes out of the service elevator, hurries
     through the basement. She checks:
     The boiler room.
     The electrical room.
     The photographer's studio (Eve is sitting for a portrait)
     The gym (Allenby is working out)

     INT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

     Chance stands in the middle of the two-lane bowling alley,
     totally confused. Mrs. Aubrey enters, he smiles at her.

                    MRS. AUBREY 
          Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking
          all over.

                    CHANCE
          Oh, yes.

                    MRS. AUBREY 
          Morton Hull, the producer of 'This
          Evening' just called.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, I have seen that show on
          television.

                    MRS. AUBREY 
          Of course. They would like you to
          appear on the show tonight. The
          Vice President was scheduled, but
          he had to cancel, and they asked if
          you would be interested.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I would like to be on that
          show.

                    MRS. AUBREY 
          Fine. They felt that since you had
          such close ties with the President,
          you would be a splendid choice. 
               (Chance nods, there is a
                    pause)
          ... Can I help you? Are you looking
          for something?

                    CHANCE 
          No. I like this attic very much.

     Mrs. Aubrey gives him a look, leaves.

     EXT. SKY - DUSK

     AIR FORCE 1 passes through the clouds.

     INT. AIR FORCE 1 - DUSK

     The President sits on a couch in one of the compartments on
     the jet. Before him, stand six of his STAFF, Kaufman
     included.

                    PRESIDENT 
          ... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on
          national television today he is
          obviously a financial sophisticate
          of some reknown.

                    KAUFMAN 
          Yes, sir - we are aware of all
          that, but still, we haven't been
          able to...

                    PRESIDENT 
               (interrupts)
          He's an advisor and close personal
          friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes,
          they have volumes of data on
          Benjamin!

                    KAUFMAN 
          Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to
          contact Mr. Rand, but he was too
          ill to...

                    PRESIDENT 
               (again interrupts)
          I do not want Benjamin Rand
          disturbed! You have other ways of
          gathering information than to
          trouble a dying man. Use whatever
          agencies are necessary to put
          together a detailed history of
          Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into
          problems, alert Honeycutt.
               (he stands)
          I'll be in the office at seven in
          the morning and I would like to
          have it at that time.
               (he starts for door)
          I've got to take a leak.

                    KAUFMAN 
          Right, Chief.

     As the President goes to the Men's Room, two of the aides
     reach for telephones.

     INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - EVENING

     Chance wears a velvet bathrobe, watches TV. Perkins lays out
     a suit, shirt, tie, etc. on the bed.

                    PERKINS 
          I believe these garments will be
          quite appropriate, Mr. Gardiner.

                    CHANCE 
               (eyes on TV)
          Yes. They are fine.

     There is a knock at the door.

                    PERKINS 
          Excuse me, sir.

     Perkins answers the door, it is Eve.

                    EVE 
               (entering)
          Chauncey...

                    CHANCE 
               (rises)
          Hello, Eve.

                    EVE 
          Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you
          well. I know you'll be smashing.

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you, Eve.

                    EVE 
          And Benjamin sends along his best
          wishes.

                    CHANCE 
          How is Ben feeling?

                    EVE 
          He's tired, Chauncey - but he's
          going to watch you tonight. We'll
          both be watching.

                    CHANCE 
          That's good. I like to watch, too.

                    EVE 
          I know you do - you and your
          television...
               (a pause)
          ... Good luck, Chauncey. 

     Eve impulsively steps forward, kisses Chance on the cheek.
     Chance smiles at her, and Eve, slightly embarrassed, turns
     and leaves the room. Chance sits back down, watches TV as
     Perkins attends to his clothes with a whisk broom.

     INT. WASHINGTON POST - STAFF ROOM - NIGHT

     Courtney heads a meeting of his four staffers. One man,
     KINNEY, a research assistant, sits behind a stack of
     paperwork, has a downcast expression as he listens to
     Courtney.

                    COURTNEY 
          ... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of
          fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's
          a strong candidate for one of the
          vacant seats on the board of First
          American. But before we can do any
          sort of a piece on the man, we're
          going to need facts on his
          background...
               (turns to Kinney)
          ... Kinney, what did you come up
          with?

                    KINNEY
               (after a pause)
          ... Nothing.

                    COURTNEY
               (sighs, taps pencil on
                    table)
          ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what
          have you got?

                    KINNEY
               (another pause)
          ... I realize this sounds banal but
          there is no information of any sort
          on Gardiner. We have no material on
          him - zilch...

     The room is quiet except for the tapping of Courtney's
     pencil.

     EXT. TELEVISION STATION - NIGHT

     The RAND 1 limousine parks in front of the station. As
     Jeffrey opens the door for Chance, MORTON HULL steps to the
     limo.

                    HULL
          Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the
          producer of 'This Evening.'

                    CHANCE
               (as they shake hands)
          Hello, Morton.

     Hull takes Chance into the station.

     INT. RAND MANSION - CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Constance, Rand's nurse, enters Chance's room, goes to the
     closet.

     INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Chance is intrigued by the surroundings as Hull guides him
     through the corridor.

                    HULL 
          Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact
          that you occupy such a position in
          the world of finance makes you
          ideally suited to provide our
          millions of viewers with an
          explanation of this nation's
          economic crisis.

                    CHANCE 
          I see.

                    HULL 
          Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that
          more people will be watching you
          tonight than all those who have
          seen theater plays in the last
          forty years?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. It's a very good show.

                    HULL 
          I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.

     Hull takes Chance into the MAKE-UP room.

     INT. RAND MANSION - CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Constance is in the closet, searching through Chance's
     pockets, finding nothing. She takes out a small knife, cuts a
     label from one of the jackets. Quickly, she examines one of
     Chance's shoes, copies the name of the shoemaker in a
     notebook. Constance hurries to the dresser, continues her
     search.

     INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR/MAKEUP ROOM  NIGHT

     COLSON, the makeup man, comes through the corridor carrying a
     glass of water. He turns into the makeup room, goes to Chance
     who sits in front of the lights. Hull sits next to Chance,
     briefs him on the show. Chance has his eyes on a TV monitor,
     watches the guest preceding him on "This Evening."

                    COLSON
               (gives Chance water)
          Here you go, Mr. Gardiner.

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you. I'm very thirsty.

                    COLSON 
          Yes, sir - it's hot under those
          lights.

     Colson applies finishing touches to Chance.

                    HULL 
          Now, if the host wants to ask you a
          question, he'll raise his left
          forefinger to his left eyebrow.
               (Chance watches TV)
          Then you'll stop, and he'll say
          something, and then you'll answer.

     On the TV, WILLIAM DUPONT, the host, wraps up his talk with
     his guest.

                    COLSON 
               (a last-minute dab)
          Okay, Mr. Gardiner, you're all set.

     Hull leads Chance out of the makeup room. Colson closes the
     door, then carefully picks up Chance's water glass, wraps it
     in Kleenex, puts it in his overcoat pocket.

     INT. TV STATION - "THIS EVENING" STUDIO - NIGHT

     William Dupont introduces Chance.

                    DUPONT 
          Ladies and gentlemen, our very
          distinguished quest, Mr. Chauncey
          Gardiner!

     The BAND plays as Chance comes onto the stage. An audience of
     about three hundred applauds Chance as he appears. Two TV
     cameras move with him as he walks, with a smile and a limp,
     to center stage. Dupont shakes Chance's hand, Chance holds
     Dupont's hand with both of his own.

                    DUPONT (CONT'D)
          Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have
          you with us this evening.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes.

                    DUPONT 
               (showing Chance to chair)
          I'd like to thank you for filling
          in on such short notice for the
          Vice President.

                    CHANCE 
               (sits)
          You're welcome.

                    DUPONT 
               (also sitting)
          I always find it surprising, Mr.
          Gardiner, to find men like
          yourself, who are working so
          intimately with the President, yet
          manage to remain relatively
          unknown.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. That is surprising.

                    DUPONT 
               (a beat)
          ... Well, your anonymity will be a
          thing of the past from now on.

                    CHANCE
               (doesn't understand)
          I hope so.

                    DUPONT 
          Yes... Of course, you know, Mr.
          Gardiner, that I always prefer an
          open and frank conversation with my
          guests, I hope you don't object to
          that.

                    CHANCE 
          No. I don't object.

                    DUPONT 
          Fine, then let's get started. The
          current state of our country is of
          vital interest to us all, and I
          would like to know if you agree
          with the President's view of the
          economy?

                    CHANCE 
          Which view?

     Applause and laughter from the audience. Dupont accustomed to
     parrying with his guests, asks again.

                    DUPONT 
          Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his
          speech at the Financial Institute
          the President consulted with you
          and Benjamin Rand, did he not?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I was there with Ben.

                    DUPONT 
          I know that, Mr. Gardiner.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes.

                    DUPONT
               (a beat)
          Well, let me rephrase the question;
          the President compared the economy
          of this country to a garden, and
          stated that after a period of
          decline a time of growth would
          naturally follow. Do you go along
          with this belief?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, I know the garden very well. I
          have worked in it all my life. It
          is a good garden and a healthy one;
          its trees are healthy and so are
          its shrubs and flowers, as long as
          they are trimmed and watered in the
          right seasons. The garden needs a
          lot of care. I do agree with the
          President; everything in it will
          grow strong, and there is plenty of
          room in it for new trees and new
          flowers of all kinds.

     The audience applauds Chance's apparent metaphor. Dupont
     waits for it all to subside, then asks another question.

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Rand is in bed. Eve sits in a chair next to the bed, squeezes
     Rand's hand in excitement as they both watch Chance on
     television. Teresa, the nurse, watches in the background.

                    DUPONT 
               (over TV)
          ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, that was
          very well put indeed, and I feel it
          was a booster for all of us who do
          not like to wallow in complaints or
          take delight in gloomy predictions.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The President and First Lady are in bed together watching the
     show.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Gloomy predictions? That insolent
          son of a bitch!

                    DUPONT 
               (over TV)
          Let's make it clear, Mr. Gardiner,
          it's your view that the collapse of
          the Stock Market, the dramatic
          increase in unemployment, you feel
          that this is just another season,
          so to speak, in the garden?

     The First Lady cuddles close the President, ruffles his hair,
     tries to cheer him up.

     INT. TV STUDIO - "THIS EVENING SHOW" - NIGHT

     Chance answers.

                    CHANCE
          In a garden, things grow - but
          first some things must wither; some
          trees lose their leaves before they
          grow new leaves...

     INT. CIA ROOM - NIGHT

     A small, dark room. A videotape machine is running. Also, a
     machine is turning that records the harmonics of Chance's
     voice. TWO CIA MEN run the equipment, watch as a needle
     charts Chance's voice onto paper.

                    CHANCE
               (over TV)
          ... Then they grow thicker and
          stronger and taller. Some trees
          die, but fresh saplings replace
          them. Gardens need a lot of care
          and a lot of love.

     INT. THOMAS FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Franklin, the attorney that evicted Chance, comes out of the
     bathroom brushing his teeth. His wife, JOHANNA, is in bed
     absorbed in "This Evening." Franklin sits on the end of the
     bed, watches the show.

                    CHANCE 
               (over TV)
          ... And if you give your garden a
          lot of love, and if you work very
          hard and have a lot of patience, in
          the proper season you will see it
          grow to be very beautiful...

     More applause from the TV. Franklin leans closer to the set.

                    FRANKLIN 
               (puzzled)
          It's that gardener!

                    JOHANNA 
          Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.

                    FRANKLIN 
          No! He's a real gardener!

                    JOHANNA 
               (laughs)
          He does talk like one, but I think
          he's brilliant.

                    DUPONT
               (over TV)
          I think your metaphors are quite
          interesting, Mr. Gardiner, but,
          haven't we seen seasons that have
          been devastating to certain
          countries?

     INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The President and First Lady continue to watch.

                    DUPONT
               (over TV)
          Such as disasterous winters,
          prolonged droughts that have wiped
          out crops, hurricanes that have all
          but swept away island communities?
          Doesn't a country need to have
          someone in charge that can see it
          through such crises?

                    PRESIDENT
          ... That bastard...

     The First Lady moves closer to him.

     INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     The TV, its volume low, plays in the background as Constance,
     with a pair of tweezers, plucks a hair from Chance's pillow,
     puts it into a small vial.

                    DUPONT
               (over TV)
          Don't we need a leader capable of
          guiding us through the seasons? The
          bad as well as the good?

                    CHANCE
               (over TV)
          Yes. We need a very good gardener.

     INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

     Dupont continues his questions.

                    DUPONT 
          Do you feel that we have a 'Very
          good gardener' in office at this
          time, Mr. Gardiner?

     At the end of the question, Dupont glances over Chance's
     shoulder to look at the monitor.

                    CHANCE 
               (a beat)
          I understand.

     Chance turns to see what Dupont is looking at, sees the back
     of his own head on the TV screen.

                    DUPONT 
          I realize that might be a difficult
          question for you, Mr. Gardiner -
          but there are a lot of us around
          the country that would like to hear
          your thoughts on the matter.

     Chance is still turned to the monitor.

                    CHANCE
          Oh, yes. It is possible for one
          side of the garden to be flooded,
          and the other side to be dry...

     INT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Allenby watches Chance on television. The camera that covered
     Dupont in close-up has now pulled back, includes Dupont and
     Chance, both looking into camera. Allenby is concerned, he is
     unsure of Chance.

                    CHANCE
               (over TV)
          ... Some plants do well in the sun,
          and others grow better in the cool
          of the shade.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

     A group of ELDERLY BLACK PEOPLE sit in the lobby, watch "This
     Evening" on an old black-and-white TV.

                    CHANCE
               (over TV)
          ... It is the gardener's
          responsibility to take water from
          the flooded area and run it to the
          area that is dry. It is the
          gardener's responsibility not to
          plant a sun-loving flower in the
          shade of a high wall...

     During the preceding speech, Louise, the maid from the Old
     Man's house, chatters.

                    LOUISE 
          Gobbledegook! All the time he
          talked gobbledegook! An' it's for
          sure a White man's world in
          America, hell, I raised that boy
          since he was the size of a pissant
          an' I'll say right now he never
          learned to read an' write - no sir!
          Had no brains at all, was stuffed
          with rice puddin' between the ears!
          Shortchanged by the Lord and dumb
          as a jackass an' look at him now!
          Yes, sir - all you gotta be is
          white in America an' you get
          whatever you want! Just listen to
          that boy - gobbledegook!

     There is a chorus of "Amens" as she finishes.

     INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

     Chance continues.

                    CHANCE 
          ... It is the responsibility of the
          gardener to adjust to the bad
          seasons as well as enjoy the good
          ones. If the gardener does his job,
          everything will be fine.

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Audience applause is heard over TV. Rand claps weakly along
     with the TV sound. Eve and Teresa also clap.

                    RAND
               (smiling)
          Splendid. Just splendid...

     Rand looks up as Constance comes into the room.

                    RAND (CONT'D)
          Damn, Constance, get in here! You
          shouldn't miss any of this!

     Constance hurries to Teresa's side. Rand turns to Eve.

                    RAND (CONT'D)
          I'm becoming quite attached to
          Chauncey - quite attached... 
               (Eve smiles)
          ... And so are you, aren't you,
          Eve.

                    EVE 
               (a beat)
          ... Yes, I am, Ben.

                    RAND 
               (reaches out, takes her
                    hand)
          That's good... That's good.

                    DUPONT 
               (over TV)
          Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound
          of our audience, I'd say that your
          words are a most welcome respite
          from what we've been hearing from
          others...

                    CHANCE 
               (over TV)
          Thank you.

     INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

     Dupont asks another question.

                    DUPONT 
          I'm sorry to say that our time is
          running short, but before we close,
          I'd like to ask one final question.
          What sort of gardener, sir, would
          you be?

                    CHANCE 
               (with confidence)
          I am a very serious gardener.

     INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     More applause over the TV. The President pales.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Oh, Jesus...

     He rolls over in bed. The First Lady reaches out, puts a
     comforting hand on his shoulder.

     INT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Franklin holds a phone to his ear with one hand, shuts off
     the TV with the other.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Okay, I'll see you in twenty
          minutes.

     Franklin hangs up the phone, scurries around getting dressed.
     His wife, Johanna, sits grimly in bed.

                    JOHANNA
               (coldly)
          ... Business, bullshit! Going out
          in the middle of the night to meet
          that bitch in a bar...

                    FRANKLIN 
          Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's
          a damn fine attorney! I've got to
          talk to her about this Gardiner...

                    JOHANNA 
               (turns over in bed)
          Good night.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Look, Johanna...

                    JOHANNA 
               (cuts him off)
          I said good night!

     Franklin gives up, hurries from the room.

     INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Colson, carefully carrying his overcoat, walks with Chance
     through the corridor. A delighted Hull walks behind them.

                    COLSON 
          Marvelous! Just marvelous, Mr.
          Gardiner! What spirit you have,
          what confidence! Exactly what this
          country needs!

     Chance smiles at well-wishers as they continue on through the
     corridor.

     INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The First Lady is snuggled up close to the President,
     caresses his body. After a moment, it becomes clear to her
     that he is not up to the occasion.

                    FIRST LADY 
          ... Darling... What's wrong?

                    PRESIDENT,
          ... I can't... I just can't right
          now... I'm sorry, dearest... I just
          can't...

     The First Lady looks at him for a beat, then turns, lies on
     her back and stares at the ceiling.

     INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

     An 'in' meeting place for the upper-middle Washington, D.C.
     crowd. Thomas Franklin and Sally Hayes sit at a table, drinks
     in front of them.

                    FRANKLIN 
          ... It didn't make any sense to me
          at all. I didn't know what the hell
          he was talking about...

                    SALLY 
          He wasn't making a speech to us,
          Tom - he was talking to the masses.
          He was very clever, keeping it at a
          third grade level - that's what
          they understand...

                    FRANKLIN 
          Yeah? Well, I don't understand what
          was up his sleeve when he pulled
          that stunt with us? What was he
          doing? And why?

                    SALLY 
          Who knows...? Maybe the government
          had something to do with it.

                    FRANKLIN
          You know, Sally - I really feel
          like I've been had, and you know
          what that means, don't you?... It
          means that any political future I
          had is right down the toilet!

     The CAMERA begins to slowly move away from the table, the
     sound of Franklin's voice continues.

                    FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
          ... Jesus, the thought of spending
          the rest of my life as an attorney,
          that is really a downer... And,
          Christ, Sally, I almost forgot
          Johanna is starting to think
          something's going on between...

     Franklin's voice fades into the background hubbub. The voice
     of Kinney, the research assistant from the Washington Post is
     heard as the camera settles on a table occupied by Sidney
     Courtney and his staff.

                    KINNEY 
          ... Sid, be reasonable - I've been
          everywhere, there's no place left
          to check!

                    COURTNEY 
          Try again.

                    KINNEY 
          Sure, try again - where? There's
          nothing, it's like he never
          existed!

                    COURTNEY 
          Try again.

                    KINNEY 
          Sid, it's useless!

                    COURTNEY
          I said - try again.

     Kinney stands, shoves his paperwork across the table.

                    KINNEY 
          Up yours, Sid. You try again, I
          quit!

     Kinney takes his drink with him as he leaves the lounge.

     EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT

     The household staff is lined up on the front steps,
     applauding Chance as he steps from the limousine. Chance
     accepts the plaudit, though does not understand the reason.
     As he nears the steps, Perkins and Wilson step forward.

                    WILSON 
          An outstanding speech, sir.

                    PERKINS
          May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. Thank you, Perkins.

     Perkins nods, takes Chance's overcoat, allows everyone to
     enter the house ahead of him. Alone on the steps, Perkins
     quickly searches through the pockets of the coat, finds
     nothing.

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Rand is in bed. Eve sits on the edge, looks warmly to Chance
     who stands nearby.
     Allenby prepares an injection for Rand, and occasionally
     glances curiously at Chance. Chance breathes deeply, enjoys
     the oxygen.

                    RAND
               (with some effort)
          ... You possess a great gift,
          Chauncey, of being natural. And
          that, my boy, is a rare talent, the
          true mark of a leader. You were
          strong and brave, yet did not
          moralize. I hope the entire country
          was watching you tonight, the
          entire country...

     Allenby crosses to Rand, needle in hand.

                    ALLENBY 
          And you, Benjamin, must be strong
          and brave for me. Turn over,
          please.

                    RAND 
               (holds up hand)
          In a minute, Robert - in a
          minute... Chauncey, I would like to
          ask a favor of you...

                    CHANCE 
          Certainly, Ben.

                    RAND 
          Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is
          hosting an evening reception
          tomorrow evening honoring
          Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet
          Union... I think it's rather
          obvious that Robert won't allow me
          to attend, so - would you go in my
          place, and escort Eve?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I would like to escort Eve.

                    RAND 
          Good. Together, the two of you
          should create quite a stir - I can
          already hear the gossip.

                    EVE 
               (with a blush)
          ... Ben, really...

                    RAND 
               (reaches out a tired hand
                    to Chance - Chance holds
                    it)
          ... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank
          you very much. 
               (takes back hand)
          ... All right, Robert, I'm all
          yours.

     Eve and Chance quietly leave the room. Allenby watches Chance
     go, then readies Rand for the injection.

     INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     The elevator door opens, Eve and Chance come into the
     hallway. Chance looks back at the elevator for a beat, then
     the two walk quietly down the hall.

                    EVE 
               (stopping by bedroom door)
          ... You don't happen to have a
          tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?

                    CHANCE 
          No, thank you.

                    EVE 
          Oh. Well, we can fix up one of
          Ben's for you tomorrow night.
          Sophie insists an Black Tie.

                    CHANCE 
          I see.

                    EVE
               (a pause, softly)
          ... I have very few friends,
          Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends
          are all quite a bit older...

     Eve gives Chance a long look, then kisses him on the lips.
     She steps back, smiles.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
          ... Good night, Chauncey.

                    CHANCE 
          Good night, Eve.

     Eve goes into her bedroom, closes the door. Chance heads for
     his room as though nothing had happened.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE ANTE ROOM - MORNING

     Kaufman and the five other Aides nervously await the
     President's arrival. The door opens, the President briskly
     enters the room.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Good morning, gentlemen.

                    AIDES 
               (as one)
          Good morning, sir.

     The President leads the way into the Oval Office.

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

     As the President goes to his desk, Kaufman hands him a
     folder. The President sits, reads it quickly, it is very
     brief.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (to Kaufman)
          This is not what I requested.

                    KAUFMAN 
          No, sir.

                    PRESIDENT 
          This information goes back three
          days. I want the standard file, you
          know that.

                    KAUFMAN
          Right, Chief.

                    PRESIDENT 
          So...? Where the hell is it?

                    KAUFMAN 
          We... uh, have been unable to come
          up with any information before the
          man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ...
          and, uh...

                    PRESIDENT 
          What the hell are you talking
          about, Kaufman?

                    KAUFMAN 
          Well, we do have data from
          Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it
          isn't pertinent.

                    PRESIDENT 
          I'd like to hear that data,
          Kaufman.

                    KAUFMAN
          Yes, sir.

     Kaufman takes a clipboard from the man at his right.

                    KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
               (reading)
          Suits hand-made by a tailor in
          Chicago in 1918. The tailor went
          out of business in 1929, then took
          his own life. 
          ... His shoes were hand-made in
          1928. The cobbler has long since
          been dead. Underwear, all of the
          finest cloth, factory destroyed by
          fire in 1938. The man carries no
          identification; no wallet, no
          driver's license, no credit cards.
          ... He carries one item along with
          him, a fine Swiss pocket-watch
          crafted at the turn of the century;
          so far they have been unable to
          ascertain where or when purchase
          was made.
          ... He has never dyed his hair.
          ... Computers have analyzed
          Gardiner's vocal characteristics;
          it is impossible to determine his
          ethnic background, they feel his
          accent may be northeastern, but
          they will not commit to that.
          ... Fingerprint check proved
          negative, no identification
          possible.
               (a pause)
          ... That's it, Mr. President.

     The President stares at Kaufman for a beat, then speaks into
     his intercom.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (into intercom)
          Miss Davis - I'd like my eggs
          poached this morning, please.

     A quick "Yes sir" from Miss Davis over the intercom. The
     President leans back in his swivel chair, looks at Kaufman.

                    PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          ... So what does all that add up
          to?

                    KAUFMAN 
          Well, sir - it occurred to us that
          he might be an agent of a foreign
          power. But, we ruled that out, as
          they invariably are provided with
          too much documentation, too much
          American identity... We, uh...don't
          quite know what to make of it yet,
          sir... But we'll keep on top of it,
          Mr. President - we'll come up with
          the answer.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (with sarcasm)
          I would appreciate that.

     The Aides quickly leave the office.

     INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING

     Chance is in bed, a bed tray on his lap, eating breakfast. A
     pile of the morning's newspapers lies at the foot of the bed,
     untouched. The TV is playing, Chance watches as he eats.
     There is a knock at the door. 

                    CHANCE 
               (without turning from TV)
          Come in!

     Eve enters, wearing a robe over her nightgown.

                    EVE 
          Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?

                    CHANCE 
          No, Eve. I don't read the papers.

                    EVE 
               (moving to bed)
          Well, it seems you've been
          described as one of the architects
          of the President's speech. And your
          own comments from the 'This
          Evening' show are quoted side by
          side with the President's.

                    CHANCE 
          I like the President. He is a very
          nice man.

                    EVE 
               (sits on bed)
          I know...  
               (a moment) 
          ... So are you, Chauncey ...  
               (another moment, Chance
                    watches TV)
          ... Do you mind my being here, like
          this?

                    CHANCE
               (a bite of toast)
          No, Eve. I like you to be here.

     Eve smiles, moves a little closer to Chance.

                    EVE 
          ... You know, Chauncey... I want us
          to be...
               (with difficulty)
          I want us... You and I to become...
          close... I want us to become very
          close, you know...?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Eve. I know that.

     Eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first, then
     losing control, the tears flowing freely. To comfort her,
     Chance puts his arm around her shoulder, nearly tipping his
     breakfast tray. Eve responds to his touch, draws closer,
     holds Chance tightly. Chance does his best to avoid spilling
     his breakfast, keep an eye on the TV, and to comfort Eve. She
     gives in to her desires, begins to caress Chance, running her
     hand over his body. She kisses him, his eyes, his neck, his
     lips, his ears. Chance does not return the lovemaking, and
     Eve eventually catches hold of herself, stops. She lies
     quietly beside Chance for a time, regains her demeanor, then
     speaks.

                    EVE
          ... I'm grateful to you,
          Chauncey... I would have opened to
          you with a touch, and you know
          that...
               (Chance,confused, turns to
                    her)
          ... But you're so strong - I can
          trust myself with you. I'm glad,
          Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed
          so much restraint...

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you
          didn't open.

                    EVE 
          I know you are, Chauncey...
               (a pause)
          ... You conquer a woman from within
          herself, you infuse in her the need
          and desire and the longing for your
          love.

                    CHANCE
               (another bite of toast)
          Yes. That could be true.

                    EVE
               (sits up)
          ... I guess I may as well be honest
          about my feelings, Chauncey, as I
          know you are I am in love with
          you... I love you and I want you...
          And I know that you know it and I'm
          grateful that you've decided to
          wait until... Until...

     Eve cannot bring herself to finish the sentence. She rises,
     straightens her robe and moves toward the door.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
               (stopping by door)
          ... I do love you, Chauncey.

     A knock at the door startles Eve. She turns, opens it to
     MAGGIE, the seam tress. Maggie carries one of Rand's tuxedos.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
          Oh, come in, Maggie.

                    MAGGIE 
               (entering)
          Yes, ma'am.

                    EVE 
          Chauncey, Maggie will alter Ben's
          tuxedo for you now.

                    CHANCE 
          Fine.

     Eve leaves. Maggie stands by patiently as Chance eats his
     once-warm scrambled eggs and watches"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood"
     on TV.

     INT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S ROOM - DAY

     Allenby is at his desk, searching through the Washington,
     D.C. telephone book. He finds a number, dials.

                    ALLENBY
               (into phone)
          Mr. Thomas Franklin, please.
               (a wait)
          Is Thomas Franklin in?
               (a beat)
          Yes, this is Dr. Robert Allenby,
          would you please tell Mr. Franklin
          that I would like to talk to him?
          It concerns Chauncey Gardiner.

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK

     Teresa and Constance work in a corner of the room. Rand is in
     bed, very still, deep in thought.

     EXT. SOPHIE'S - EVENING

     The RAND 1 limousine pulls up to Sophie's house. Jeffrey
     opens the door for Eve and Chance. He wears Ben's tuxedo, Eve
     is in a formal gown. The press is waiting, a couple of
     reporters, 5 photographers and a mini-cam crew from local TV
     station gather around Eve and Chance.

                    REPORTER #1
          Mr. Gardiner, what did you
          think of the Post's editorial on
          the President's speech?

                    CHANCE 
               (smiling for photogs)
          I didn't read it.

                    REPORTER #2 
               (surprised)
          But air - you must have at least
          glanced at it.

                    CHANCE 
          No. I did not glance at it.

                    REPORTER #3
          Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times
          spoke of your 'Peculiar brand of
          optimism,' what was your reaction
          to that?

                    CHANCE 
               (continues to pose for
                    pictures)
          I did not read that either.

                    REPORTER #3 
          Well, how do you feel about that
          phrase, 'Peculiar brand of
          optimism?'

                    CHANCE 
          I do not know what it means.

                    REPORTER #2
          Sorry to persist, air, but it would
          be of great interest to me to know
          what newspapers you do read.

                    CHANCE 
          I do not read any newspapers. I
          watch TV.

     There is a moment of silence as the reporters digest this.
     The TV Reporter smiles, questions Chance.

                    TV REPORTER
          ... Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that
          you find television's coverage of
          the news superior to that of the
          newspapers?

                    CHANCE 
               (flatly)
          I like to watch TV.

                    TV REPORTER 
               (pleased) )
          Thank you, Mr. Gardiner, for what
          is probably the most honest
          admission to come from a public
          figure in years. Few men in public
          life have the courage not to read
          newspapers none have the guts to
          admit it.

                    CHANCE 
          You're welcome.

     Eve and Chance walk toward the front door, leaving the
     newsmen to talk among themselves.

                    EVE 
          I've never seen anyone handle the
          media as well as you, Chauncey.
          You're so cool and detached -
          almost as if you were born to it.

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you, Eve.

     The front door is opened for them by an attendant.

     INT. SOPHIE'S - EVENING

     The Black Tie reception is in progress. The house is crowded,
     possibly a hundred guests, mostly foreign ambassadors and
     other such dignitaries. Eve and Chance enter, are greeted by
     DENNIS WATSON, a State Department official.

                    WATSON
          Mrs. Rand, how good to see you.

                    EVE 
          Mr. Watson.

                    WATSON 
               (looks to Chance)
          And you must be Mr. Gardiner,
          correct?

                    CHANCE
          Yes.

                    EVE
          Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson
          of the State Department.

                    CHANCE
               (they shake)
          Hello, Dennis.

                    WATSON
          A pleasure to meet you, sir.

                    CHANCE
          Yes. It is.

     SOPHIE, an older woman bedecked with jewelry, approaches,
     embraces Eve.

                    SOPHIE
          Eve, child! How nice of you to
          come.

                    EVE
          Hello, Sophie.

     Sophie steps back, looks at Chance.

                    SOPHIE
          And look who you brought with!

                    EVE
          Sophie, this is Chauncey
          Gardiner...

                    SOPHIE
               (hugs Chance)
          Oh, I've been just dying to meet
          you, Mr. Gardiner!

                    EVE
          Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia
          Rowley.

                    CHANCE
               (being hugged)
          Hello, Sophia.

                    SOPHIE 
               (steps back, admires
                    Chance)
          Sophie, please - call me Sophie!

     Sophie pulls them both into the party, leaving Dennis looking
     after Chance as he walks away.

                    SOPHIE (CONT'D)
               (as they go, to Chance)
          You just have to let me introduce
          you to some of the exciting people
          here... Why, Pat Boone and his
          daughter may drop by later!

     They disappear into the crowd.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     The President is hunched over his desk, absorbed in
     constructing a model airplane, a World War II flying fortress
     bomber. The First Lady sits nearby, plays solitaire on a
     small table. The President glances to her, then back to his
     work.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (gluing the wing)
          ... How are the kids getting along?

                    FIRST LADY 
          Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy
          this morning. She loves California,
          but to quote her, she says, 'The
          Secret Service is getting to be a
          drag.' I guess she wants her
          privacy...

                    PRESIDENT 
          Huh... I'm glad they're along with
          her, if you know what I mean... How
          about Jack?

                    FIRST LADY 
          Well, I think Jack needs some time
          alone with you, darling... He's
          getting to that age, you know... He
          really misses you...

                    PRESIDENT 
          Yeah... I'll have a talk with him
          as soon as...

     A KNOCK at the door interrupts the President.

                    PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
               (calls out)
          ... Yes, come in!

     Kaufman enters.

                    KAUFMAN
          Sorry to disturb you, chief but we
          have new developments.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Oh? What?

                    KAUFMAN 
          We have word that the Soviets have
          put out a top priority alert for
          information on Gardiner's
          background. So far, they haven't
          come up with a thing - what's more,
          as a result of their eagerness, one
          of their ablest agents blew his
          cover, we have him in custody at
          this time.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Good. Anything else?

                    KAUFMAN 
          Yes, chief - eight other foreign
          powers have put Gardiner under
          surveillance. We're around-the
          clock now, sir - I'll keep you
          posted.

     The President nods, Kaufman leaves. The President puts some
     more glue on the wing.

     INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

     Sophie pulls Eve and Chance to AMBASSADOR SKRAPINOV and his
     WIFE. Skrapinov smiles as he sees Eve.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          Mrs. Rand. How delightful.

     Skrapinov kisses Eve's hand.

                    EVE 
          It seems like ages, Mr. Ambassador.
               (a nod to his wife)
          Mrs. Skrapinov.

     Mrs. Skrapinov returns the nod as Sophie introduces Chance.

                    SOPHIE 
          Mr. Gardiner, let me introduce you
          to our guest of honor, His
          Excellency Vladimar Skrapinov,
          Ambassador of the Soviet Union.

     Chance warmly shakes Skrapinov's hand with both of his own.

                    CHANCE
               (stumbles over name)
          Hello... His... His...

                    SOPHIE 
          Ambassador Skrapinov, this is Mr.
          Chauncey Gardiner.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          Delighted. Delighted.

                    SOPHIE 
          And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.

     Chance smiles at Mrs. Skrapinov as The Ambassador puts an arm
     around him.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          You must sit with us, my friend, we
          have much to discuss.

                    CHANCE 
          I agree.

                    SKRAPINOV
               (to Eve)
          How is my dear friend Benjamin
          feeling?

                    EVE 
          He's doing as well as could be
          expected, Mr. Ambassador. He still
          speaks of the stimulating
          discussions he's had with you.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          Ah, Yes. Please give him my
          regards.

                    EVE 
          Of course.

                    SOPHIE
               (tugs at Eve)
          Come on, Eve. Let's let the men
          talk, there are so many people that
          have been asking about you.

                    EVE
               (to Chance and Skrapinov)
          Would you two excuse me for a
          moment?

                    SKRAPINOV 
          Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall
          yield the pleasure of your company
          to others.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.

                    EVE 
               (smiling)
          I'll be back soon...

     Eve and Sophie leave. Skrapinov leads his wife and Chance to
     their table.

                    SKRAPINOV
               (as they walk)
          I'm sorry we haven't met sooner,
          Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of
          seeing you on television last night
          and I listened with great interest
          to your down-to-earth philosophy.
          I'm not surprised that it was so
          quickly endorsed by the President. 
               (quietly)
          ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how
          serious is Benjamin's illness? I
          did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by
          discussing it in detail.

                    CHANCE 
          Ben is very ill.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As
          you know, we in the Soviet Union
          have the keenest interest in
          developments of the First American
          Financial Corporation... We are
          pleased to hear that you may fill
          Benjamin's place should he fail to
          recover. 
               (arrive at table)
          Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.

     Chance sits between Skrapinov and Mrs. Skrapinov.

                    SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)
               (moves chair close to
                    Chance)
          ... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be
          quite candid - considering the
          gravity of your economic situation,
          shouldn't we, the diplomats, and
          you, the businessman - get together
          more often?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, I agree, I think so too.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          To exchange our thoughts - what
          does a Russian know about business?
          On the other hand, what does an
          American know about diplomacy?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, I understand.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          And I have noticed in you a certain
          reticence regarding political
          issues - so why not a coming
          together? An interchange of
          opinion? We may find, my friend,
          that we are not so far from each
          other, not so far!

                    CHANCE 
               (an engaging smile)
          We are not far... 
               (motions at nearness of
                    their chairs)
          ... our chairs almost touch.

                    SKRAPINOV 
               (laughs)
          Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed
          almost touching! And we want to
          remain seated on them, correct? We
          don't want them snatched from under
          us, am I right? Because if one
          goes, the other goes, and then -
          boom! Boom! And we are both down
          before our time, you see? And
          neither of us wants that, do you
          agree? 

                    CHANCE
          I certainly do.

                    SKRAPINOV
          Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you
          by any chance enjoy Krylov's
          fables? I ask this because there is
          something... there is something
          Krylovian about you.

                    CHANCE 
          Do you think so? Do you think so?

                    SKRAPINOV 
          So you know Krylov!

     Skrapinov pauses, then leans close to Chance, speaks softly
     in Russian. Chance, having never heard this language, raises
     his eyebrows and laughs. Mrs. Skrapinov remains impassive.

                    SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)
               (amazed)
          So you know your Krylov in Russian,
          do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must
          confess I had suspected as much all
          along - I know an educated man when
          I meet one!

                    CHANCE 
          Oh, good.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          Yes, it is very good!

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, it is. 
               (beat)
          Would you tell me your name again,
          please?

                    SKRAPINOV 
               (slaps Chance on the back)
          Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor!
          Vladimar Skrapinov!

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I like that name very much.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner! 
               (in Russian)
          How poetic! Chauncey, a name of
          uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a
          bit of the French, a suggestion of
          a stroll through the flowers! A
          beautiful name, my friend!

     As he speaks in Russian, Eve comes to the table, taps
     Skrapinov on the shoulder.

                    SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)
               (immediately rises)
          Mrs. Rand! You have returned to us!

                    EVE 
          Only to steal Mr. Gardiner away, if
          I might. 
               (to Chance)
          Everyone wants to meet you.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Eve. That would be good.

                    SKRAPINOV 
               (shakes Chance's hand)
          We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner,
          many times!

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you.

     As Eve and Chance leave, Skrapinov turns and nods to a MAN
     standing a short distance away. The man, KARPATOV, hurries to
     the table.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          Yes? What have you found?

                    KARPATOV 
               (in Russian)
          We have nothing on him, Ambassador
          Skrapinov.

                    SKRAPINOV 
               (holds up hand, looks
                    around)
          Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for
          one, understands our language.

                    KARPATOV 
               (in English, softly)
          Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          What do you mean there is nothing?
          That's impossible.

                    KARPATOV 
          There is no information available
          on the man before he moved into
          Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to
          be such a difficult task that it
          has resulted in the loss of one of
          our agents to the United States
          Government.

     Mrs. Skrapinov strains to overhear the conversation.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          But... Where was this man Gardiner
          before last week?

                    KARPATOV 
          Apparently the White House shares
          our curiosity - they have also
          launched an investigation, and,
          according to our sources, neither
          the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met
          with success.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          I see. Clearly, such interest on
          their part is of great political
          significance.

                    KARPATOV 
          Clearly, yes comrade.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          Hmmm... Take this down. 
               (Karpatov takes out
                    notepad)
          I want this quote included in the
          Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner,
          in an intimate discussion with
          Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that
          "Unless the leaders of the opposing
          political systems move the chairs
          on which they sit closer to each
          other, all of their seats will be
          pulled from under them by rapid
          social and political changes."'

                    KARPATOV 
          Very good, Your Excellency.

     Karpatov leaves the table.

     INT. WASHINGTON, D.C. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

     The same lounge as before. Sidney Courtney sits at the same
     table as earlier, only this time with the editor of the
     Washington Post, LYMAN STUART. Courtney puffs on his pipe as
     he speaks.

                    COURTNEY
          ... It's strictly rumor at this
          stage, Lyman - just something in
          the wind... 

                    STUART 
          Something rather big in the wind,
          I'd say. So whose files were
          destroyed? The CIA's or the FBI's?

                    COURTNEY 
          I don't know. Like I said, it's
          just rumor so far, but we should
          start nosing around, see if we can
          talk to some people...

     The CAMERA begins to slowly MOVE AWAY from their table.

                    STUART 
          ... But why? The question is why?
          Why would they destroy Gardiner's
          files? What is it about his past
          they are trying to cover up?
               (his voice fades)
          ... A criminal record? A membership
          in a subversive organization?
          Homosexual, perhaps?

     The SOUND of Stuart's voice dissolves into Thomas Franklin's
     as the CAMERA SETTLES on Dr. Allenby and Franklin sitting at
     a table nearby.

                    FRANKLIN 
          ... And he told us that he had been
          living there since he was a child,
          working as a gardener. He showed us
          a room in the garage, where he said
          he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't
          really believe him, of course - but
          why the act?

                    ALLENBY 
          I have no idea...

                    FRANKLIN 
          Another thing that baffles me,
          Doctor - what was his connection
          with the deceased? Major financial
          dealings, obviously - but our firm
          has no record of any such
          transactions.

                    ALLENBY 
          Hmmm. You say he showed you his
          garden?

                    FRANKLIN 
          Well, he said it was his, he walked
          us through it.

                    ALLENBY 
          I see. 
               (leans close to Franklin)
          Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and
          Miss Hayes to keep this incident
          with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves.
          There's no telling what he was
          involved in, and the matter may be
          extremely confidential. So please,
          not a word.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Of course, Doctor, I understand.

                    ALLENBY 
          Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

                    FRANKLIN 
          Certainly, glad to be of help.

     Allenby rises, leaves the bar.

     INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - DINNER PARTY - NIGHT

     Eve and Sophie are talking to a small group. Chance moves
     away to get an hors d'oeuvre and is approached by RONALD
     STIEGLER, a publisher.

                    STIEGLER
          Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler,
          of Harvard Books.

                    CHANCE 
               (a two-handed handshake)
          Hello, Ronald.

                    STIEGLER 
          Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have
          been wondering if you'd consider
          writing a book for us? Something on
          your political philosophy. What do
          you say?

                    CHANCE 
          I can't write.

                    STIEGLER 
               (smiles)
          Of course, who can nowadays? I have
          trouble writing a post card to my
          children! Look, we could give you a
          six figure advance, provide you
          with the very best ghostwriter,
          research assistants, proof
          readers...

                    CHANCE 
          I can't read.

                    STIEGLER 
          Of course not! No one has the time
          to read! One glances at things,
          watches television...

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I like to watch.

                    STIEGLER 
          Sure you do! No one reads!...
          Listen, book publishing isn't
          exactly a bed of roses these
          days...

                    CHANCE 
               (mild interest)
          What sort of bed is it?

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Rand is in bed. Sitting nearby are two attorneys, MONROE and
     TOWNSEND. Mrs. Aubrey stands to one side and Constance and
     Teresa prepare an IV for Rand.

                    RAND 
               (speaks slowly, with
                    effort)
          Everything. I said everything and
          that's exactly what I mean.

                    MONROE 
          But, Mr. Rand, the holdings are so
          extensive, I would like to be more
          precise in...

                    RAND
               (interrupts)
          What could be more precise than
          everything...?

     Allenby enters the room, stands by the door, unnoticed.

                    MONROE
               (turns to Townsend)
          Everything to Mrs. Rand.

                    TOWNSEND
               (drafting a will)
          Right - everything.

                    RAND 
          You two don't have to lecture me on
          the complexities of the situation,
          no one knows that better than
          myself... But you must understand
          that I have an endless faith in
          Mrs. Rand's abilities - I know that
          she will select the right person
          for guidance when she has the
          need... She has shared my life,
          gentlemen, she has given me far
          more pleasure than any of my so
          called assets... Life has suddenly
          become very simple for me now - I
          may be older than my years, and you
          might think me to be somewhat
          feeble... But I am still in love,
          gentlemen, thank God for that...

     Allenby silently leaves the room.

     INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - DINNER PARTY - NIGHT

     Dennis Watson, of the State Department, talks with Chance in
     a corner of the living room. Dennis whispers something into
     Chance's ear and Chance gives him an innocent smile. Dennis
     is encouraged by the smile.

                    DENNIS 
          We could do it now, we can go
          upstairs.
               (no reaction from Chance)
          ... Please, it's time for us. Come
          upstairs.

                    CHANCE
               (blankly)
          I like to watch.

                    DENNIS 
          Watch? You mean just watch me?
          Doing it alone?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I like to watch very much.

                    DENNIS 
          Well, if that's what you want, then
          I want it too.
               (takes Chance's arm)
          We can go this way.

                    CHANCE 
          I want to tell Eve.

                    DENNIS 
          Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes.

                    DENNIS
               (pulling Chance)
          Oh, you can tell her later. She'll
          never miss you in this crowd.

     Dennis leads Chance out of the crowded room.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     A light from the adjoining bathroom filters into the darkened
     bedroom. The President and the First Lady are in bed. They
     each lie on their backs, a distance apart and are silent.

                    FIRST LADY 
               (after some time)
          ... Maybe you should talk to
          somebody, darling.

                    PRESIDENT 
          No, that won't do any good.

                    FIRST LADY 
               (another pause)
          ... Is it me? Is there something
          I've done?

                    PRESIDENT 
          Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not
          you...

                    FIRST LADY
               (another pause)
          It's your damn job. It never
          happened when you were a senator...

                    PRESIDENT 
          It's not that, I just...

     The inter-White House phone rings, the President reaches for
     it.

                    PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
               (into phone)
          Yeah, Kaufman - what is it?

                    KAUFMAN'S VOICE 
               (over phone)
          Chief, we have a break in the case.
          Our man at the Washington Post says
          they are working on a story that
          either the CIA or the FBI destroyed
          Gardiner's files before anyone
          could get to them.

                    PRESIDENT 
          What? Why?

                    KAUFMAN'S VOICE 
               (over phone)
          I can't say at this time - neither
          agency will admit to a thing.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (getting out of bed)
          Okay, get both Directors over here,
          I'll be right down.

     The President hangs up the phone as the First Lady stares at
     the ceiling.

     INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS ROOM - NIGHT

     A small room exquisitely decorated in pale lilac tapestry.
     The lights are very dim, and Dennis, who we cannot see, is
     lying on the floor. Dennis' clothes are draped over a chair.
     Chance sees a very small pocket television on a desk. He
     turns the TV on.

                    DENNIS' VOICE 
               (softly)
          Can you see well?

                    CHANCE 
               (squints at small screen)
          Yes, very well, thank you.

                    DENNIS' VOICE
          Do you like it?

                    CHANCE
          Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.

                    DENNIS' VOICE 
               (disappointed at it being
                    'tiny')
          ... Are you sure you like it?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, I do, it's very good.

                    DENNIS' VOICE 
               (excited)
          Really? Really!!!

     Chance reacts to the change in tone of Dennis' voice, turns
     to look at him on the floor. Hearing the groans and heavy
     breathing, Chance thinks Dennis is ill.

                    CHANCE 
          Do you need a doctor? I could call
          Robert...

                    DENNIS' VOICE 
          I don't want Robert.

                    CHANCE 
          I see.

                    DENNIS' VOICE 
               (through the groans)
          Your foot! Give me your foot!!

     Dennis reaches out with his free hand, grabs Chance's foot,
     pulls it to himself.

                    CHANCE 
               (some pain)
          Thank you. But my leg is still a
          little sore. 

     Chance watches as Dennis goes through some spasms, then his
     body relaxes. Chance is concerned for Dennis' health.

                    CHANCE (CONT'D)
          Are you sure you're not ill?

     We hear a contented sigh from the man on the floor.

     EXT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

     A long, black limousine with a Red Star on the door pulls
     away from Sophie's house.

     INT. RED STAR LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

     ALEXIS NOVOGROD, a high-ranking KGB officer, and two of his
     underlings are in the limousine, along with Skrapinov, his
     wife and Karpatov. Novogrod and his men wear heavy clothing,
     fresh from Moscow. They all drink vodka.

     (Dialogue in Russian, English subtitles)

                    NOVOGROD 
          The rank-and-file in the FBI feel
          he is FBI, but others feel he is a
          CIA man who knows how to destroy
          FBI files.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          That could be possible...

                    NOVOGROD 
          But we are quite certain, comrade,
          that this man Gardiner is a leading
          member of an American elitist
          faction planning a coup d'etat.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          A coup d'etat! Of course, that was
          foreseen by Lenin himself!

                    NOVOGROD 
          That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov.
          We have ascertained that Gardiner
          heads a big-business power group
          that will soon be taking over the
          American government.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          Big business. I could work with
          that faction quite nicely, Colonel
          Novogrod.

                    NOVOGROD 
          You have proven that already,
          Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be
          congratulated for recognizing the
          importance of this man and
          establishing an early friendship.

                    SKRAPINOV 
          Thank you, Colonel.

                    NOVOGROD 
               (raising his glass)
          Let us toast to the success of the
          coup.

     They all raise their glasses.

                    GROUP TOAST 
          Na zdorov'e!

     The men and Mrs. Skrapinov drink their vodkas.

     INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The reception is breaking up. Eve, wearing her coat, searches
     for Chance in the crowd. She sees him, taps him on the
     shoulder from behind.

                    EVE
          Chauncey, where have you been? I
          was afraid you got bored and left,
          or that you were with some
          mysterious woman.

                    CHANCE 
          No. I was with a man. We went
          upstairs.

                    EVE 
          Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always
          involved in some sort of
          discussion...

                    CHANCE 
          He was very ill, I stayed with him
          for a while.

                    EVE 
          It must be the punch, and it is
          stuffy in here -- I feel it a
          little myself. You're an angel, my
          dear - thank God there are still
          men like you around to give aid and
          comfort.

     Eve and Chance leave the reception.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     The President sits behind his desk in a bathrobe, his hair
     mussed. Standing before him are GROVER HONEYCUTT, the
     Director of the F.B.I., and CLIFFORD BALDWIN, C.I.A. Chief.
     Kaufman stands to one side. All are red-eyed, tired, and
     frustrated.

                    HONEYCUTT 
          I never gave such a directive, Mr.
          President.

                    BALDWIN 
          Nor I, sir - it would be out of the
          question.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Gentlemen, I didn't call you here
          at such an hour to make
          accusations, I just want to explore
          the possibilities. Now, I have
          three questions; Is the man a
          foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly
          found that our methods of gathering
          data are grossly inefficient? Or,
          thirdly, have the man's files been
          destroyed? Now, I'd like some
          answers.

                    BALDWIN 
          Gardiner is not a foreign agent,
          there are now sixteen countries
          investigating the man. We can rule
          that out.

                    PRESIDENT 
          Very well... Can we rule out
          inefficiency...?

     There is silence in the room. A couple of looks, but silence.

                    PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          I see. What about question three?
          Is it possible to erase all traces
          of a man?

                    HONEYCUTT 
          Highly unlikely, sir... In fact,
          the boys around the Bureau feel
          that the only person capable of
          pulling it off would be an ex
          F.B.I. man.

                    BALDWIN 
               (a look to Honeycutt)
          I don't think that's entirely true,
          Grover.

                    PRESIDENT
               (to Baldwin)
          And what do the boys around
          Intelligence think?

                    BALDWIN 
          Well, Mr. President... They don't
          quite know what to think.

                    PRESIDENT 
               (rising)
          Gentlemen, needless to say, there
          is going to be a full Congressional
          investigation of your respective
          operations.
               (goes to door)
          Good night.

     The President leaves the Oval Office.

     INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Eve and Chance walk down the hallway.

                    EVE
               (holding his hand)
          I feel so close to you, so safe
          with you, Chauncey...
               (stops at her bedroom
                    door)
          ... And Benjamin understands that,
          dearest... He understands and
          accepts my feelings for you...

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.

                    EVE 
               (opens her door)
          ... Come in, Chauncey - please come
          in...

                    CHANCE 
          Thank you.

     Chance enters, Eve closes the door behind them.

     INT. EVE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Eve turns on a soft lamp, Chance goes directly to her TV,
     turns it on.

                    EVE 
          I can sense that you've been
          through a lot, Chauncey. But one
          day, when you feel like it, you'll
          tell me all about your life...
               (Chance watches an old
                    movie)
          ... But, even if you tell me
          nothing, even if it's too painful
          for you to reveal your past...

     As she talks, Chance watches a love scene on TV. The hero
     gives his lady a passionate kiss and embrace. The scene seems
     to 'sink into' Chance's mind. He abruptly turns, takes Eve
     into his arms and kisses her full on the mouth. Just as
     abruptly, he turns away and changes channels on TV.

                    EVE 
               (breathless)
          Oh, Chauncey... I do love you so
          much!

     She takes Chance in her arms, kisses him wildly. They fall to
     her bed in an embrace. As she holds him, kisses him, runs her
     hands over his body, Chance watches television, neither
     resists nor responds to Eve's caresses. Suddenly she stops,
     lets her head fall on Chance's chest.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
          ... You don't want me, Chauncey...
          You don't feel anything for me...
          Nothing at all...

     Chance sits up on the bed, then, feeling her sadness, gently
     strokes her hair as he looks at TV.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
          I just don't excite you at all... I
          don't know what you want... I don't
          know what you like...

                    CHANCE 
          I like to watch.

                    EVE  
               (not understanding)
          To watch...? To watch me...?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I like to watch.

                    EVE 
               (uncertain)
          ... Is that all you want...?
               (a hesitation)
          ... To watch me...?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. It's very good, Eve.

                    EVE 
          ... But I've never done...
               (another hesitation)
          ... You mean...? When... When...
          When I do it? ... When I touch
          myself...?

     Eve slowly gets up from the bed, nervously paces the bedroom
     as Chance watches TV. She makes a decision, moves to Chance,
     kisses him.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
               (getting aroused)
          Oh, Chauncey...

     She steps back, slips off her dress. She does not undress any
     further, instead, leans close to Chance.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
          One of those little things you
          don't know about me yet, darling -
          I'm a little shy.

     She smiles, gets in bed and pulls the covers over herself.
     Chance divides his attention between Eve and the TV, watching
     both with an equal detachment. Eve begins to respond to her
     own touch, finds a heretofore undiscovered pleasure with her
     own body. Chance changes the channel as she reaches orgasm.
     As Eve's body trembles, Chance yawns, gets up from the bed.

                    CHANCE
               (going to door)
          Good night, Eve.

     A low purr is heard from Eve as Chance leaves.

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     Allenby, Constance and Teresa are readying a transfusion for
     Rand. There is a feeling of urgency as they work.

     Rand, very weak, strains to speak to Allenby.

                    RAND 
          No more, Robert... No more
          needles...

                    ALLENBY 
               (sits on the side of the
                    bed)
          It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you
          can feel it.

                    RAND
          I know, Robert... But, strangely
          enough, I don't feel too bad about
          now... I feel all right... I guess
          it's easier... knowing Chauncey is
          here... to take care of things...

     Teresa is about to swab Rand's arm with alcohol but he pulls
     away.

                    RAND (CONT'D)
          No, I don't want any of that...
          Please... please, just get me Mr.
          Gardiner, Teresa - please... he'll
          head it up...

     Teresa looks to Allenby, he nods to her. Teresa puts the
     cotton down, leaves the room.

     EXT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - MORNING

     A light snow is failing. Eve is in a fur coat, holds a
     steaming cup of coffee. Chance stands next to her, an
     umbrella in one hand. He holds his other arm out, catching
     the snowflakes as they fall.

                    EVE 
          ... And I feel so free now,
          Chauncey. Until I met you, I never
          felt acknowledged by a man... 
               (Chance gazes out at the
                    falling snow)
          ... I always had the feeling that I
          was just a vessel for a man,
          someone that he could take hold of,
          pierce, and pollute. I was merely
          an aspect of somebody's lovemaking.
          Do you know what I mean?

     Chance turns to her, says nothing, presses the cold
     snowflakes to his face.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
               (presses close to him)
          Dearest, you uncoil my wants;
          desire flows within me, and when
          you watch me my passion dissolves
          it. You set me free. I reveal
          myself to myself and I am drenched
          and purged.

                    CHANCE 
          That's very interesting, Eve.

     Teresa appears in the doorway.

                    TERESA 
          Mr. Gardiner. Mr. Rand would like
          to see you.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I would like to see Ben.

     Chance gives Eve a warm smile, then follows Teresa into the
     house.

     INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     Allenby, with nothing more he can do to prolong Rand's life,
     sits on the bed close to him, grips his hand tightly. Teresa
     shows Chance into the room and Allenby motions to the nurses
     to leave. As they do, Chance, once again breathing the oxygen
     with a smile, goes to Rand's bedside.

                    RAND
               (slowly)
          ... Chauncey... Chauncey...

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Ben - are you going to die
          now?

     Allenby winces.

                    RAND 
               (a weak smile)
          ... I'm about to surrender the Horn
          of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel,
          my boy...

                    CHANCE 
          Oh, I see.

                    RAND 
               (reaches out to him)
          Let me feel the strength in your
          hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your
          strength...
               (holds Chance's hand)
          Yes, that's good... I hope,
          Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay
          with Eve... Take care of her, watch
          over her, she's a delicate flower,
          Chauncey...

                    CHANCE
               (smiling)
          A flower...

                    RAND 
          She cares for you and she needs
          your help, Chauncey... there's much
          to be looked after...

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I would like to do that.

                    RAND 
          ... I've worked very hard and
          enjoyed my life... I've known
          success... and I've felt love... My
          associates, Chauncey - I've talked
          with them about you... They're
          eager to meet you... very eager to
          meet you... I'm very fond of you,
          Chauncey... And I understand Eve...
          Tell her that... tell her I'm madly
          in love with her...

     Rand slumps down, dead. Allenby checks his pulse, turns to
     Chance.

                    ALLENBY 
          ... He's gone, Chauncey.

                    CHANCE 
          Yes, Robert. I have seen it before.
          It happens to old people.

                    ALLENBY
               (covers Rand's face)
          Yes, I suppose that's true.

     Chance reaches out, uncovers Rand's face, gently touches the
     man's forehead, feels the coldness. Allenby eyes him as
     Chance stays with Rand for a moment, then replaces the sheet.

                    CHANCE
               (turns to Allenby)
          Will you be leaving now, Robert?

                    ALLENBY 
          In a day or two, yes.

                    CHANCE 
          Eve is going to stay. The house
          will not be closed.

                    ALLENBY
               (a moment, a look)
          ... You've become quite a close
          friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...
               (a beat)
          ... Chance...?

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I love Eve very much.

                    ALLENBY 
          I see...
               (another beat)
          ... And you are really a gardener,
          aren't you?

                    CHANCE 
               (brightens)
          Yes, Robert - I am.
               (a smile at Allenby)
          I'll go tell Eve about Ben now,
          Robert.

     Chance leaves the bedroom. Allenby watches him go, then sits
     back in a chair, his head spinning.

     EXT. RAND MANSION - DAY

     A cloudy, cold day patches of snow are on the ground. The
     Rand servants are lined up in front of the mansion, listen to
     funeral services for Rand on a pair of loudspeakers. PAN
     AROUND, reveal the services being held on a hill overlooking
     the mansion. Fifty mourners are gathered around the Rand
     family mausoleum. Chance stands with Eve and Allenby. The
     President of the United States stands before a microphone.

                    PRESIDENT 
          ... Millions of people across the
          world have heard of the passing of
          Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately,
          only relatively few will feel the
          pain and sadness at such a loss. To
          most, Benjamin Rand was a legend;
          to those of us gathered here today,
          Benjamin was a beloved friend. My
          personal association with Benjamin
          dates back many years, and my
          memories of our friendship will
          stay with me forever.

     As the President speaks, Chance turns and walks away. Eve and
     Allenby watch as he goes into the trees surrounding the area.

                    PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
          I initially came in contact with
          the Rand name in 1943. 1 was a
          young lieutenant in the Air Corps,
          a navigator flying missions over
          Europe. That plane that I learned
          to know so well was manufactured by
          the Rand Aeronautics Corporation.
               (a beat)
          Benjamin Rand was an industrial
          giant, known to be powerful and
          uncompromising, and yet, on a
          personal level, we have all felt
          his warmth and humor...
               (a beat)
          ... I would like to share with you
          a few quotes, and a few feelings
          from our dear friend.
               (holds up paper, reads)
          ... 'I do not regret having
          political differences with men that
          I respect; I do regret, however,
          that our philosophies kept us
          apart.'
          ... 'I have no use for those on
          welfare, no patience whatsoever...
          But, if I am to be honest with
          myself, I must admit that they have
          no use for me, either.'
          ... 'I was born into a position of
          extreme wealth, I have spent many
          sleepless nights thinking about
          extreme poverty -  I do not know
          the feelings of being poor, and
          that is not to know the feelings of
          the majority of people in this
          world. For a man in my position,
          that is inexcusable.' 
          'Life is a state of mind.'
          ... 'When I was a boy, I was told
          that the Lord fashioned us from his
          own image. That's when I decided to
          manufacture mirrors.'

     INT. LARGE AUDITORIUM - DAY

     Ah auditorium with row upon row of empty seats. Huddled
     together at one end of the hall are six important
     businessmen, speaking in hushed tones. JAMES DUDLEY, a
     powerful industrialist, speaks.

                    DUDLEY 
          But what do we know of the man?
          Nothing! We have no inkling of his
          past!

     SEWELL NELSON, a corporation chairman, joins in.

                    NELSON 
          Correct, and that is an asset. A
          man's past can cripple him, his
          background turns into a swamp and
          invites scrutiny.

     Another executive, PETER CALDWELL, agrees.

                    CALDWELL 
          To this time, he hasn't said
          anything that could be used against
          him.

     CHARLIE BOB BENNET, a Texas oil millionaire;

                    BENNET 
          Well, I'm certainly open to the
          thought - it would be sheer lunacy
          to support the President for
          another term.

                    NELSON 
          No one will go along with that...
          Look at the facts, gentlemen, the
          response from his appearance on
          'This Evening' was overwhelming; he
          has excited and awakened the people
          of this country at a time of
          despair.

     LYMAN MURRAY, a banker;

                    MURRAY 
          He's personable, elusive, yet
          seemingly honest. He's riding a
          crest of popularity that builds
          with every statement. As far as his
          thinking goes, he appears to be one
          of us. I firmly believe, gentlemen,
          that he is our only chance - Mr.
          Chauncey Gardiner!

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     Chance, his umbrella under his arm, walks through the woods.

     EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY

     The services are over. Eve, Allenby talk with the President
     and the First Lady.

                    EVE
          It was very moving, Bobby - thank
          you so much...

                    PRESIDENT
          We're all going to miss him, Eve... 
               (glances around)
          ... Where's Mr. Gardiner?

                    ALLENBY
          ... He walked off...

                    EVE
          Chauncey is so sensitive... He was
          overcome with grief...

                    PRESIDENT
          I can certainly understand that...

                    FIRST LADY
          Of course... I'm so sorry for you,
          Eve...

                    EVE
          Thank you, Nancy.

                    FIRST LADY
          I'll call you soon.

     The President and First Lady head toward their limousine.

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     Chance walks deeper into the woods, absorbed in the greenery.
     He stops by a tree, brushes some snow from a branch, moves
     on.

     EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY

     The majority of mourners have left. Eve and Allenby walk
     slowly to the RAND 1 limousine, look around for Chance.

                    EVE 
          ... Do you think we should look for
          him?

                    ALLENBY 
          I don't think so, he should be
          along soon...

                    EVE 
          I wish he were here...

     Eve keeps looking as they walk to the limousine.

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     Chance happens on a tree with a cracked limb, hanging to the
     ground. He stops, inspects the break, runs his fingers along
     the split in the bark. He looks to the ground, notices that
     an end of the limb has fallen on a seedling, bending it
     double. Chance pulls the limb away, then kneels beside the
     seedling. He removes an expensive paid of suede gloves, and,
     with gentle fingers, brushes the dirt and snow away from the
     seedling. Chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the
     larger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree.
     He unfolds his umbrella, places it over the seedling in a way
     to give it protection, yet to still allow it to receive light
     from the winter sun. Chance stands, puts his gloves back on
     and continues his walk, disappearing into a remote section of
     the woods.

     EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY

     Jeffrey stands holding the door for Eve and Allenby, all the
     other cars have gone. Eve is worried, gets into the car.

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     Chance walks through the woods, his pace faster than before.

     EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY

     The limousine still waits for Chance.

     INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

     Eve is deeply concerned for Chance.

                    EVE 
          We have to find him, Robert - he
          could be lost, something may have
          happened, we can't leave him!

                    ALLENBY 
          You really care for him, don't you,
          Eve?

                    EVE 
          I do - we do - both of us, Ben and
          I feel so much for Chauncey...

                    ALLENBY 
          I think we'd better go look for
          him. 
               (he taps on the glass
                    partition)
          David!

     David starts up the limousine.

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     Chance walks with determination through the woods.

     INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

     Allenby and Eve search for Chance as David drives along a
     narrow road through the woods. Jeffrey, sitting in front,
     suddenly calls out.

                    JEFFREY 
          Look!

     About 100 yards ahead of them, Chance crosses the road,
     continues on down a hill.

                    EVE 
          There he is! Chauncey!

     David stops the limousine at the point where Chance crossed.
     Eve hurries out of the car.

     EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - DAY

     Chance is about twenty yards down the side of a hill. Eve
     calls to him.

                    EVE 
          Chauncey! Chauncey!

                    CHANCE
               (stops, looks up)
          Hello, Eve.

     Eve runs, half falls as she goes down the hill.

                    EVE 
          Oh, Chauncey...!

     She gets to him, holds him tightly.

                    EVE (CONT'D)
          Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have
          you been? We thought we'd lost you -
          we've been looking all over!

                    CHANCE 
          Yes. I've been looking for you,
          too, Eve.

     She hugs him one more time, then she leads him back up the
     hill to the waiting limousine. Allenby gets out of the car,
     greets Chance with a handshake and an arm around the
     shoulder. Then the three get into the limousine.

                                FADE OUT.

                           THE END
