In the not-too-distant future, a less-than-perfect man wants to travel to the stars.
Society has categorized Vincent Freeman as less than suitable given his genetic make-up and he has become one of the underclass of humans that are only useful for menial jobs.
To move ahead, he assumes the identity of Jerome Morrow, a perfect genetic specimen who is a paraplegic as a result of a car accident.
With professional advice, Vincent learns to deceive DNA and urine sample testing.
Just when he is finally scheduled for a space mission, his program director is killed and the police begin an investigation, jeopardizing his secret.
