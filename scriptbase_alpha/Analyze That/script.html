</b>
<b>INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT
</b>
Two men, CAESAR and MARTY "DUCKS," stand at  the   end of the
deserted bar, talking quietly, oblivious to  the   exotic dancer
grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle  of   the small
stage. Body language and charisma tell us   that   Caesar is the
boss, "Ducks" his lieutenant.
<b>                         DUCKS
</b>           It's Peezee. Gotta be.    He hates your
           fuckin' guts.
<b>                         CAESAR
</b>                   (brooding)
           I don't know.
<b>                         DUCKS
</b>           Who else knew about the money? And
           how did Peezee know they popped Tony
           Cisco when we didn't even hear about
           it 'til last night?
<b>                         CAESAR
</b>                   (sighs heavily)
           I don't know.
<b>                         DUCKS
</b>                   (pressing)
           What is so hard to understand here?
           You said yourself Peezee was a
           mamaluke and you couldn't trust him.
           Now suddenly you're soft on the guy?
<b>                         CAESAR
</b>           I just don't think it was him.
<b>                         DUCKS
</b>           Okay, I'll bite. If not Peezee, then
           who?
<b>                         CAESAR
</b>                   (slowly rising to
                    his full height)
           I think it was you, Ducks.
Caesar starts to walk away as the bartender, now holding a
sawed-off shotgun, moves closer to Ducks. The exotic dancer
splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage.
<b>                         DUCKS
</b>                   (scared)
           You gotta be kiddin'!
Caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have

</b>appeared, holding AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
<b>                          DUCKS
</b>            Caesar, you know me! What kind of
            fuckin' idiot would I have to be to
            try that shit with you?
<b>                          CAESAR
</b>            A dead fuckin' idiot.
As he walks out the door, the soldiers OPEN FIRE on Marty
"Ducks." Caesar doesn't look back.

<b>PULL BACK TO:
</b>
<b>TV SCREEN
</b>The title credits come up on the made-for-cable series we've
been watching, "Little Caesar." CLAPPING AND CHEERING from
<b>O.S.
</b><b>WIDEN TO:
</b>
<b>INT. SING SING PRISON - NIGHT
</b>
Maximum-security prisoners are gathered around watching their
favorite show in the rec room. In the front row is PAUL VITTI,
former New York crime boss, and a couple of other wiseguys.
<b>                           VITTI
</b>            Garbage.   Change the channel.
<b>                           WISEGUY
</b>            Okay, Paul.
The WISEGUY gets up and starts switching channels on the TV.
A couple of CONVICTS in the back start to protest.
<b>                           CONVICT
</b>            Hey!   What're you doin', asshole!
Vitti turns and stares at them.      They fall silent
immediately.
<b>                          CONVICT
</b>            Sorry, Mr. Vitti. Didn't mean any
            disrespect.
<b>                           WISEGUY
</b>            Punks.
Vitti turns the page and sees a huge headline in the Post:
MOB SHRINK TELLS ALL. He gets up, agitated.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             3.
</b><b>                        VITTI
</b>          I'm going to bed.
Vitti stands up and heads back to his cell.

<b>                                                   CUT TO:
</b><b>INT. CELL BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER
</b>As Vitti approaches his cell, he sees a prison guard standing
by. His cellmate, EARL, a giant of a man, comes out of their
cell carrying his bedroll and a box containing his other
meager possessions.
<b>                        VITTI
</b>                  (suspicious)
          What's goin' on, Earl?
<b>                        EARL
</b>          They're transferring me.
<b>                           VITTI
</b>          Why?
<b>                        EARL
</b>                  (shrugs)
          Don't know. Thanks for looking out
          for me, Mr. Vitti.
<b>                           VITTI
</b>          Yeah.     Take it easy.
He notices something in the box.
<b>                           VITTI
</b>          Hey, Earl.     Is that my after-shave?
<b>                         EARL
</b>                  (blanches)
          I'm sorry. I just grabbed stuff -- I
          didn't know --
<b>                           VITTI
</b>          That's okay.     Keep it.   Go ahead.
<b>                           EARL
</b>          Thanks.     See you around.
Earl exits with the guard. Vitti hesitates a moment, then
warily steps into his cell.
<b>                                                   CUT TO:
</b><b>INT. VITTI'S CELL - MIDDLE OF NIGHT
</b>The cellblock is quiet. A guard stops outside the darkened
cell, looks around to make sure no one is watching, then

</b>pulls out a GUN with a SILENCER, reaches through the bars and
FIRES REPEATEDLY into Vitti's shadowy form under the blanket.
Then he slips away as quietly as he appeared.

ON his exit we PAN DOWN TO Vitti, unhurt, curled up under his
bunk.
<b>                                                 CUT TO:
</b><b>INT. MEMORIAL CHAPEL - DAY
</b>A deluxe casket flanked by elaborate floral displays and an
easel displaying a portrait of the deceased, Dr. Isaac Sobel.
Mourners fill the pews, standees at the back, an overflow
crowd. BEN SOBEL sits in the front row, staring at the
casket with his wife, LAURA, his son, MICHAEL, now a
teenager, BEN'S MOTHER, and her friend, DR. JOYCE BROTHERS.
At the podium, the RABBI is speaking.
<b>                        RABBI
</b>          And now I'd like to call on Isaac's
          son, Dr. Ben Sobel, who would like to
          say a few words.
Ben rises and crosses solemnly to the podium.

<b>                        BEN
</b>                  (addressing audience)
          It's very difficult for me to talk
          about my father, because in a sense
          I'm talking about two men.
<b>                           BEN (CONT'D)
</b>          One, of    course, is the public Isaac
          Sobel,    the eminent psychotherapist and
          popular    author known to millions of
          readers    around the world.
Laura, Michael and Ben's Mother listen proudly to the eulogy.
<b>                        BEN
</b>          The second Isaac Sobel is the private
          man -- my father -- Dad. And for
          those of you who knew him well and
          knew our family -- well, let's face it
          -- my father was a psychotic, mind-
          fucking prick. An arrogant, abusive,
          ego-inflated --
A RINGING CELL PHONE interrupts him.

CONTINUES as all the mourners and even the Rabbi discreetly
check their cell phones.

Then Ben realizes it's his, fumbles for the phone in his
jacket pocket and answers it.
<b>                         BEN
</b>                   (whispers)

Vitti is disheveled, his hair messed, his shirt buttoned
wrong.
<b>                        VITTI

BUZZING in his ear.

Vitti and another WISEGUY pass through the cafeteria line
with their trays. Vitti now looks catatonic.
<b>                         WISEGUY #2
</b>          Ooh, they got tapioca. I love
          tapioca.
                   (looks at Vitti)
          You all right, Paul?
Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little.
<b>                        WISEGUY #2
</b>          Can I have your tapioca?

A guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from
his post. Then he nods to someone across the room.
COYOTE, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in
response.
Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other
tough Hispanic gang members.

          Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido?
His friends laugh.
Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them.

</b>          Just keep walkin', Don Corleone.
There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing.
<b>                        COYOTE
</b>          Shut up!
Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic.

</b>But Vitti can't stop. He drops his tray of slop, splattering
food on the men. Coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv.
<b>                        COYOTE
</b>          You're a dead man, jefe!
Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly
whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray
and bursts into song.

          From your first cigarette
          To your last dyin' day...'
Prisoners and guards stare at him like he's nuts.
Coyote stabs at him again, but Vitti dodges and smashes him
over the head with the tray.

Coyote rushes him, but Vitti sidesteps and hits him in the
face.
Guards move in from all sides.   Vitti jumps up on the
tabletop to escape them.

carry him out stiff as a board.

Laura notices FBI AGENTS CERRONE and MILLER waiting for them
in the living room. Cerrone is an attractive woman in her
late twenties, wearing a dangerously-short skirt. Miller is
a clean-cut man in his thirties.

</b>Ben meets with RICHARD CHAPIN, the U.S. Attorney for the
Southern District of New York.
<b>                        BEN
</b>          Based on his symptoms and the test
          results, I'd say brief psychotic
          disorder -- if it persists, possibly
          schizophreniform disorder. And Dr.
          Cutler agrees with my diagnosis.
<b>                         CHAPIN
</b>          So he's crazy?

</b>Dr. Cutler?   No, he's annoying, but --
<b>              CHAPIN
</b>Vitti.
<b>              BEN
</b>Not crazy. At least not permanently.
In certain people, continuous exposure
to an extremely stressful situation --
soldiers in combat, for instance,
disaster victims, a hostage situation,
or being locked up in a maximum
security prison with someone trying to
kill you -- it can produce a temporary
psychotic state.
<b>              CHAPIN
</b>How temporary?
<b>              BEN
</b>A day, a week, up to a month -- if the
precipitating stressors are removed.
<b>              CHAPIN
</b>        (musing)
Which means he's not going to get any
better while he's still in the can.
<b>              BEN
</b>He could get worse. He could
deteriorate to the point where he'd be
permanently schizophrenic.
<b>              CHAPIN
</b>Then I'd say he's got a real problem,
because he goes before the parole
board in four weeks.
<b>              BEN
</b>You think they'll let him out?

release a major Mafia figure who's now
totally deranged on top of it.
<b>              BEN
</b>        (thinks)
Well, couldn't you release him to    a
halfway house or some place where    he
could get some decent treatment?
Based on my earlier work with him,    I
don't think he's dangerous, and I
think he was making a real effort    to
reform himself.

</b>I do, Dad.

He takes a small loaf from the breadbasket on the next table,
stuffs it into the Businessman's mouth and walks off.

Eddie DeVol and his guys, all at least ten-feet-tall and all
holding huge guns.

Ben enters the nightclub and starts moving through the crowd,
looking for Vitti.
He pushes through and sees Jelly and a few of the guys
watching an exotic dancer, a beautiful young blonde in a
skimpy costume, standing on a platform grinding in mock
ecstasy.

Jelly tucks a few bills into her G-string.     She looks at Ben
and winks suggestively.
<b>                        JELLY
</b>          I think she likes you, Doc.     Give her
          a couple of bucks.
Ben reluctantly digs in his pocket and holds out a bill to
the stripper.

</b>          Can you break a twenty?
The stripper sensuously fingers the top of her G-string, and
Ben gingerly sticks the twenty in it.
<b>                        BEN
</b>          Do I just make my own change?
He tentatively reaches for some smaller bills in her G-string
but she dances away.

</b>Vitti's guys are dressed like construction workers as they
load their gear into two trucks. Vitti supervises while
others work on a New York City bus.
Eddie DeVol, Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby stand guard over
the whole scene, in case anyone is thinking of defecting.
Ben is wearing heavy dungarees and an oversized plaid shirt,
struggling to lace his work boots. Jelly approaches him and
tosses a bulletproof vest on the table.

handgun.

Ben puts the gun into the waistband of his dungarees, but it
slips through and drops into his pants.

clatters onto the floor. He smiles weakly and picks it up.

has slipped out the other side and disappeared.
Suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes
around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points
crunching into the metal sides. Then the truck starts rising
off the pavement. A couple of determined marshals jump out
of their vehicles, race over and grab onto the bumpers as the
armored truck is lifted off the ground.

then swings silently over the perimeter fencing.
