<b>                    WARM SPRINGS
</b>
                     Written by

                   Margaret Nagle




                                          Shooting Draft: 9.14.2004

<b>    FADE IN:
</b>
<b>    EXT. A BODY OF WATER - LATE AFTERNOON
</b><b>1                                                                 1
</b>    A glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way
    through a gray sky before being obliterated.
<b>4
</b>    A MAN, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge
    of a boat and into the ocean.
<b>                                                  D
</b>    UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs are
    FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward.

    He breaks the surface and gasps for air.

    He begins to swim. His massive arms and shoulders grab at the
    tide in large, hard strokes. His legs and feet are buried
    beneath the dark ocean water.

<b>    EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>2                                                                 2
</b>
    A floating tenement.
    A crane LOWERS a fishing net into the water. The MAN swims
    into it. The net is RAISED as he lays, motionless, within its
    grip.

<b>    EXT. BOAT DECK - CONTINUOUS                                   3
</b><b>3
</b>    The crane swings around with the MAN in the net.

    He is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish.

    AHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over
    on his stomach. Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he
    DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a
    labored lobster-walk.

    He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge
    of the boat. They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white
    and flaccid.

    A towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to
    him by a CREW PERSON. He pours himself a generous amount of
    scotch and begins drinking.

<b>                                                   ISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>    INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                                      4
</b>
    The same MAN is illuminated by the light of a single candle.

    He is dancing, holding on tightly to a WOMAN.

<b>                                                                2.
</b>
    Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven,
    with his hair neatly trimmed.

    Their connection is powerful and alive. They stop dancing,
    overwhelmed with mutual desire.

    He holds the WOMAN's face in his hands and KISSES it all
    over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him.

    He kisses her passionately on the mouth.

<b>                        MAN
</b>              Oh, my dear...

    His fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts. She
    begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around
    her ankles. Wearing only her tight corset she brings his
    hands to the laces and together they undo it.

<b>                        WOMAN
</b>                  (whispering softly)
              It's all right, darling. It's all
              right.

<b>    INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
</b><b>5                                                                    5
</b>    OSCAR, a manservant, is carrying both a silver tray and a
    pair of pants over his extended arm.

<b>                        A VOICE (O.S.)
</b>              Oscar! Where the devil are you?

    Deftly, Oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom.

<b>                        OSCAR
</b>              My apologies, Mr. Roosevelt.

<b>    INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>6                                                                    6
</b>    There with his bare legs, muscular and lean, sporting black
    socks held up with garters is FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, 39.

    He projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man
    who can have anything he wants.

    Right now... he wants his pants.

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              I've been standing here for five minutes.

    Oscar offers the tray to Franklin which bear cuff links and a
    Tiffany watch which Franklin grabs.

<b>                                                               3.
</b>
<b>                        OSCAR
</b>              Did you sleep well, sir?

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              Don't remember. That's good, isn't it?

<b>                          OSCAR
</b>              Yes, sir.

    Franklin takes his pants from Oscar and steps into them,
    pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders.

<b>7                                                                   7
</b><b>    INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
    Striding into the dining room, Franklin lifts a silver lid
    off a breakfast plate. He dismisses it and instead pours
    himself a cup of coffee from a silver pot on the sideboard.

    He overhears a voice from the nearby sitting room.

<b>                        WOMAN (O.S.)
</b>              I could not be more delighted to have
              received your most charming letter.
              It has been far too long since we last
              corresponded. However, it is with
              great reluctance I must decline your
              kind speaking invitation...

<b>                                                                    8
</b><b>    INT. SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
    ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, 34, is dictating a letter. Her enormous
    eyes, liquid and blue, reveal a woman of extraordinary
    intelligence and depth.

<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>              Unfortunately, I would be of little
              assistance to the Junior Assistance
              League. Particularly if my purpose
              were to appear as an alumna who is
              gifted at public speaking.

    She is dictating to LUCY MERCER, 27, deeply feminine with a
    head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature. She is
    Eleanor's social secretary and closest friend.

    She is also the WOMAN dancing with Franklin the night before.

<b>                        LUCY
</b>              And what do you really want me to say?

<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>              Thank you and if you ask again I
              shall scream?

<b>                                                          4.
</b>
They share a laugh -- which is not shared by the homely
rumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          Why don't you ask your husband for
          some pointers? He's a pretty gifted
          public speaker, don't you think?

LOUIS HOWE, 48, is a wizened man of limited stature and
unlimited soul. Franklin's political advisor extraordinaire --
part consiglieri and part priest. He is the mastermind behind
what he believes will be the greatest political career of the
twentieth century.

He gets up and leans in closely to Eleanor. A cigarette dangles
off his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          You should get out once in a while.
          Accepting that invitation would be
          good for Franklin's career.

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          Mr. Howe, wouldn't you be more
          comfortable waiting for my husband
          outside?

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          In the street, Mrs. Roosevelt?

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          If you like.

Eleanor smiles oh-so politely at Louis, as Franklin enters
from the dining room.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          I see it's not even eight a.m.
          and already the gloves are off.
              (kissing Eleanor on the
               cheek)
          Good morning, Babs. Hello, Miss
          Mercer.   L
<b>                     UCY
</b>          Good morning, sir.

Quickly, she lowers her eyes to her work.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>              (annoyed)
          You're late. Honestly, why do you
          enjoy keeping people waiting?

<b>                                                                5.
</b>
<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              Because they always seem more
              grateful to see me when I arrive.

    He leans in and kisses Eleanor on the cheek.

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              Have a lovely day, Babs.

<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>              Should I expect you for dinner?

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              I have the Navy reception this
              evening. I'll be home quite late.
              Unless you've changed your mind
              about coming?

    Louis looks up from his paper at Lucy who is writing
    furiously.

<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>              Do you wish me to come?

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              Well... whatever you'd like.

<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>                  (a beat)
              Thank you, no.

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              Very well then.
                  (tipping his hat)
              Good day, Miss Mercer.

    Lucy nods and Franklin exits. Then Louis tips his hat to the
    ladies and follows him out.

    Louis, walking at a brisk pace as they cross the opposite
    side of the street. Louis struggles to keep up while
    consulting a small appointment book.

An AFRICAN-AMERICAN man steps off the curb, letting Franklin
and Louis pass.

</b>          You had some problems with it.

Louis shoots him a look that says "you know who."

Louis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows
him inside a building.

     quietly enters. His hair is a mess and his clothing is
     slightly askew.

     They belong to Eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee, listening
     to the sound of Franklin's footsteps going up the stairs.

     so as not to wake him.

     Carefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then
     turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an
     open duffle bag.

     Tentatively she reaches for them. She brings the packet, tied
     with a piece of ribbon, up to her nose. She is shocked by
     their familiar scent.

     With trembling hands she unties the ribbon. Tears flood down
     her cheeks as she reads.

     Franklin opens his eyes.

     Franklin is at the opposite end of the table, looking pale.
     Louis, as always, is by his side.

     Eleanor, like a prisoner who has accepted her fate, sits
     across from them, calm and composed.

               families and their careers.

     Eleanor rises from the table.

     and attempts to light a cigarette, but his hands shake.

     Franklin sees his son, ELLIOT, 10, playing separately from
     the rest of his siblings. Elliot looks up at his father as
     Franklin bares his best politician's smile at him.

     A ROAR begins to fill his ears. It becomes clearer that it is
     the sound of a CROWD CHEERING.

</b>               Guiseppe.

     Franklin puts his arm around Guiseppe, forcing the moment
     between them. He waits patiently as the cameras click away.

<b>                         FRANKLIN

               Okay, I guess.

     The SCOUTS begin washing their hands together in the water
     barrel and Franklin joins in as Louis looks on admiringly.

     As Guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face, Franklin,
     not to be outdone, does so as well. It's all for the cameras.

     A few feet away -- also in a world of his own -- sits Louis,
     overdressed for summer in a three piece suit. An overflowing
     ashtray is by his side and piles of newspaper lie at his
     feet.

     He holds up a paper to Eleanor with the photo of Franklin and
     the Boy Scouts.

Franklin and Elliot break out from the rest and begin racing
up the lawn. Franklin, no match for his son's speed, loses.
He doubles over, trying to catch his breath.

Everyone runs up the porch stairs and into the house except
Franklin.

Utterly spent, Franklin lays on the grass, not moving.

Slowly, Franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the

her cheek but Eleanor quickly stands.

     shaved and cleaned up considerably.

     However, the tension between them is palpable. Eleanor knits
     furiously while talking. Franklin looks out the window at

     suit. Laconic, with a dry sense of humor, Tom is a man of few
     words whose poker face hides a true desperation. He holds a
     telegram from Franklin in his hand.

     As the train pulls in Tom looks for Franklin among the
     passengers making their exit.

     There are two different exits on the platform clearly marked
     WHITE and COLORED. Whites exit from the front of the train
     and Blacks from the rear.

     LIONEL PURDY, tiny, and dressed in a mailman's uniform,

     shoulder of ROY COLLIER, African-American, 29. His brother
     PETE, 27, is close behind, carrying luggage -- both hover at
     around 6' 4".

     Tom approaches. Franklin attempts to hide his embarrassment
     with good cheer.

     him inside. Pete follows.

     "The Meriwether Inn" opened in his lap. He tries to spy the
     building through the trees but cannot.

     He looks back at the brochure. The picture is of a lavish
     Victorian Hotel and the words, "Our renowned mineral hot
     springs can cure whatever ails you!"

     Franklin looks up and sees a three-story hideous green and
     yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side. Paint is
     peeling everywhere. What once were flower beds are overgrown
     with weeds.

     The car pulls to a stop.

     An immense, T-shaped pool rimmed in concrete. The bluish
     water is clear and sparkling and a delicate steam rises out
     of the warmth.

     comes to the edge of the pool and coaxes her CHILDREN out of
     the water.

     AUNT SALLY, an ancient, gaunt, African American woman, stands
     guard by the edge of the water.

     Roy wheels Franklin as close to the rim of the pool as
     possible. Tom lends his assistance and both he and Roy HOIST
     Franklin out of the chair and place him at the edge, letting
     his feet dangle in the warm water.

     Twisting on his massive arms, Franklin lowers himself cautiously.

               boy who swam here was actually able
               to walk in the water.

</b>          I think this might be the reason I
          am having such a difficult time
          giving voice to my own thoughts
          here today.

The immediacy of her self-effacing comment charms the room.

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          I'm reminded of what someone once
          said about looking at an elephant.
          That it is impossible to ever see
          an entire elephant from one place --
          you must walk around it. If our
          elected leaders are to be truly
          effective then they must be willing
          to go out of their way to look
          beyond what is right in front of
          them. To see the entire elephant.
          And for that... they need our help.

The ladies applaud her, much to her relief. Louis beams.

               I got word a local reporter wants

               probably won't amount to more than
               a provincial puff piece but it
               might give us some free publicity
               for the Inn.

               the editorial pieces I wrote
               offended the sensibilities of a

     raking leaves.

     over.

     The WHISTLE is coming from a MODEL TRAIN as it zooms around a
     track set up on a table in the Roosevelt living room. Elliot,
     now 15, is mesmerized.

     Sara sits at a piano between FRANKLIN, JR., 9, and JOHN, 7.
     They are finishing a rousing rendition of "Angels We Have
     Heard on High" as an enormous Christmas tree gets decorated.

     JAMES, 18, is at the top of a ladder while his sister, ANNA,
     19, decorates from the lowest rung.

     Eleanor holds up a tiny porcelain ornament to Anna.

</b>               Grandmother Delano brought this

</b>               That sounds like an adventure.

     Anna looks over at her father, sadly and Franklin catches her
     eye. She quickly looks away.

     From behind his back, John, pulls out the Christmas star and
     places it on his father's knee.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>               Put it on top.

     Silence descends over the room. No one dares to breathe.

<b>                         ANNA

<b>                         FRANKLIN
</b>               I can do it.

     Franklin tosses the star in an attempt to reach the top. It
     almost catches, but it falls to the floor.

     Quickly, aiding to avoid his father's embarrassment, James
     climbs back up and puts the star on top. Sara sensing the
     awkwardness of the moment begins to play and sing an overly
     cheery rendition of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."

     Eleanor is flushed with pride. Franklin, catching her look,

<b>                         ROY
</b>               I've got you, sir.

     to one of pure heartbreak.

     Roy turns Franklin around on the bars and they begin walking
     away from Eleanor.

     The smile on Franklin's face slips to a look of shock as he
     takes in Tom's changed appearance. His face is sallow and his

chair up and stops the Conductor in his tracks.

          this chair!

Franklin pushes the wheels of his chair with such force he
knocks the Conductor over.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          You ignorant son of a bitch. If I

The Conductor struggles to get up.

Franklin wheels himself towards Tom's car where Fred is now
lying across the back seat. The sight of Fred drains all
anger from Franklin's face.

          not use the pool during regular
          hours. I'll put time aside for you
          late in the day... and it won't be
          possible for you to eat in the

          That won't be necessary.

Franklin goes back to writing out the check. Tom stands
waiting, the sound of the pen scratching seemingly
interminable. Their mutual discomfort is obvious.

Franklin rips the check from the ledger and holds it for Tom.

like a child.

     Sara looks away.

</b>               He's a grown man who makes his own
               decisions.

<b>                         SARA
</b>               But he does not need to buy it.

</b>               If it's of any comfort to you, I
               agree.

<b>                         LOUIS
</b>               I'm against it as well. It will
               consume too much of his time and
               energy.

<b>                         SARA

They are surrounded by many others, Franklin, Eloise,
Woodhall, Pat and Jake.

The BEEPING of a car horn gets their immediate attention.

Roy leaps off the porch, skipping the stairs as his brother
Pete drives up in Tom's car. He parks it and steps out.

<b>                    PETE

</b>          Mr. Loyless had me come up and
          fetch this right after he brung it
          to Asheville. "Pete, he said, "Take
          this home and fix it up for Mr.

Roy opens the passenger door and lifts Franklin into the
driver's seat.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Get on in and I'll teach ya'!

He begins showing off a system of pulleys and levers that
have been attached to both pedals. They thread through holes
in a second dashboard, attached to polished wood knobs.
It's a hand-controlled automobile.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That one there is your brake.

<b>                                                               75.

<b>                          FRED

<b>                          PAT
</b>                That is a thing of beauty!

      Franklin begins running his hands over the polished wood knobs.

<b>                          PETE
</b>                Now you got to push it real smooth
                or it goes all herky-jerky.

      Franklin excitedly turns the key and starts it up.

<b>                          PETE
</b>                Wait, Mr. Roosevelt, you're not

<b>                          FRANKLIN
</b>                Oh, yes I am!

      Franklin hits the gas as the car begins HALTING and JERKING
      the whole way down the driveway. Pete is yelling out
      instructions but Franklin ignores him.

      They all watch as he pulls away.

      As the car hits the end of the driveway Franklin reaches
      across Pete and opens his passenger door pushing him out.
      Franklin tears off alone -- out on his first solo spin.

Eleanor, seated next to Franklin, watches as Franklin, in a
rare moment of emotional nakedness, is at a loss for words.

Eloise wheels herself out. In a sweet, but untrained voice,
she begins the introduction to her song:

          You just look and say emphatically:
          Not this season!
          There's a reason!"

Some members of the audience begin to smile, knowing what's
coming. Various STAFF step out from the kitchen to watch.

Eloise is joined by three others -- all of them in wheelchairs.

      Daisy's mother, Cecile, carries Daisy to the center of the
      room where Helena meets them. Helena bends down and removes
      Daisy's braces.

      The room is hushed.

      Daisy then begins to WALK tentatively towards her mother.

      Overwhelmed by what is taking place. He looks around and
      takes in the sight of so many different faces...

      Some are beaming, some are fighting back tears, some look
      away... the sight of it almost too painful... a reminder of
      their own private battles.

</b>
      Only a step or two away from her mother she FALLS the short
      distance and lands in her mother's outstretched arms.

      WILD CHEERS go up in the room while Daisy's face glows with
      pride. She connects with Franklin, who matches her smile with
      his own -- genuine and beatific.

lies back on the bed.

Eleanor kneels before him and tugs the pants down, slowly, so
as not to catch on the braces.

Eleanor folds the pants and carefully places them over the
back of a chair.

intricate buckles.

Eleanor slides the braces off his legs. His legs, though now
deeply tanned are withered and spindly. He is still wearing
his shoes.

once again to untie his shoelaces.

          attention. The owners claimed
          everything was satisfactory, but
          would never let anyone in to
          conduct a proper inspection.

She reaches for Franklin's hands and pulls him up to a seated
position. They are now face to face.

He searches her face for clues as to the woman she's become.
He starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top.

Eleanor sits in a chair across from him.

      grow louder connecting to the despair deep inside him. It
      unleashes an avalanche of grief.

</b>                   (squinting)
                Who's that?

      ELLIOT ROOSEVELT is now 17 years old. He has his mother's
      enormous blue eyes and his father's natural charisma.

</b>      Elliot is climbing a rope dangling high from a tree as
      Franklin and Eleanor look up at him. Franklin is standing on
      crutches.

      Elliot descends with a flourish as Helena approaches Franklin
      with a single cane.

<b>                          HELENA
</b>                Franklin, let go of your crutches.
                You're not going to need them.

<b>                    HELENA
</b>          We're going to make your arms
          function as your legs.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          How is that possible?

<b>                    HELENA

          on his left side.

</b>          Think this may work, Pop.

<b>                    HELENA
</b>          Eleanor, take the crutch.

Eleanor takes one crutch as Helena takes the other, replacing
it in Franklin's hand with a cane.

Then, with Elliot on Franklin's left side she bends Elliot's
arm at a right angle, like a parallel bar, and hooks
Franklin's left arm around his.

Going over to Franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand.

          Now use your right shoulder and

He does so.

<b>                    HELENA
</b>          Good! Now with the muscles in your
          left shoulder, pull your right leg.

<b>                    FRANKLIN

          on my keister!

<b>                    HELENA
</b>          That's what Elliot is for. He's
          going to hold you up. Hitch your
          leg! Come on!

Franklin and Elliot attempt to walk. It requires immense
strength and effort on both their parts.

<b>                     HELENA
</b>              (ever the taskmaster)
          Elliot, don't lean in -- stand up
          straight. Pull against him. He
          needs you!

After one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms Franklin.

<b>                     FRANKLIN
</b>          I can't.

<b>                    ELLIOT
</b>          I'm strong, pop. You can't hurt me.

<b>                    HELENA
</b>          You can do this, Franklin! Keep
          going!

They start the walk again. It's awkward... difficult... but
it's working.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>              (under his breath)
          I'll be damned.

Franklin stops, exhausted.

Roy runs in with a chair and helps Franklin into it as
Helena, Eleanor, Louis, Elliot and Roy all look at him,
concerned.

<b>                    HELENA
</b>          This isn't a replacement for the real
          work we're doing to get you on your
          feet again, understand? No one is
          throwing in the towel or even agreeing
          with that doctor's report...

      Louis and Eleanor stand stock still, tense, watching the
      scene unfold

      Roy is sweating; his arms growing weak. Elliot brings the
      chair around and Roy gently lowers Franklin into it.

      It's a measure of Reed's standing with this group that his
      authority is unquestioned.

      But the Photographer raises his camera again. Only now Reed
      isn't as kind. He grabs the camera from him and opens the
      back, pulling out the film and exposing it.

<b>                             PHOTOGRAPHER

</b>      The enormous arena is empty but for some maintenance WORKERS
      and JANITORS. Louis enters and makes his way to the stage.

      He approaches dead center and stands behind the podium looking
      out. GRIPPING the podium hard he ROCKS it back and forth.

      Taking no chances, he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his
      waistband and a bunch of nails from his coat pocket.

      Looking around to see if anyone is paying any attention to
      him he quickly ducks down behind the podium.

      The sound of HAMMERING fills the hall as Louis, on his knees,
      NAILS the podium to the floor.

</b>      Twenty thousand CONVENTIONEERS are roasting in the hall. It
      is Houston in the summer and it's broiling hot. A sea of hand-
      held red, white and blue fans are being waved all at once --
      most bearing the words "SMITH FOR PRESIDENT."

      Near the stage is a long table where the new breed of RADIO
      REPORTERS are seated, each in front of a primitive looking
      microphone.

</b>      Franklin is standing ramrod straight holding onto Elliot's
      arm. He looks handsome in a navy pin-striped suit. As
      everyone else is sweating no one notices that Franklin is
      perspiring more than F
                           most.

<b>                           RANKLIN
</b>                Where is she seated?

      Louis, a human train wreck himself, reaches over to mop
      Franklin's brow with a handkerchief.

<b>                          LOUIS
</b>                In a box stage left. Give me your
                hand.

      Franklin takes his hand off his cane. It's soaking wet. Louis
      wipes it, gently.

<b>                          FRANKLIN
</b>                Louis, what the hell am I doing?

<b>                          LOUIS
</b>                Putting your big toe in the water.

      Just then, a VOICE booms out from the loudspeakers:

<b>                          LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)
</b>                Ladies and gentlemen, I would like

                Delano Roosevelt!

      Franklin turns to Elliot and they both take deep breaths.

<b>      INT. THE STAGE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION - CONTINUING 137
</b><b>137
</b>      A BLINDING SPOTLIGHT picks up Franklin and Elliot. The
      SPOTLIGHT follows them as they make their way to the podium.

      Franklin is hitching each leg forward, slowly. The tip of his
      cane hits the floor with pinpoint accuracy for balance and
      support.

      He leans heavily on Elliot's arm. The walk appears effortless.

      He chats with Elliot the whole way, still managing to flash
      the CONVENTIONEERS his million dollar smile. But the walk is
      slow and the ovation is beginning to fade.

</b>      Franklin and Elliot are still ten steps away from the podium.
      Sensing the crowd noise weakening, he whispers to Elliot.

<b>                          FRANKLIN
</b>                Laugh as if I'm making a joke.

      Elliot throws back his head and laughs. The crowd, wanting to
      be in on it, rise as one in a sustained CHEER!

      But a puddle of sweat caused by the dripping perspiration
      from Franklin's hands is causing the tip of his cane to slip.

      Elliot, ever aware, grips him tighter, averting disaster and
      finally they reach the podium.

      Franklin grabs one side of the podium while Elliot, with a
      sleight of hand Houdini would admire, LOCKS his father's
      braces, whisks the cane away, pulls his father's speech from
      his breast pocket and lays it smoothly on the podium.

      THE VIEW FROM BEHIND displays how Franklin's legs are spread
      wide for stability as he clutches the podium. He holds on
      tightly, as if the wood might snap from his grip.

      FROM OUT FRONT the crowd sees only a powerful man standing
      tall amidst the flashbulbs POPPING.

</b>
      Four years later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected
      President of the United States. He was elected three more
      times -- unprecedented in U.S. History.

      During his years as President, he saw the country through the
      Great Depression and a world war waged on six continents.

      On April 12, 1945, in the thirteenth year of his presidency,
      at the age of sixty-three, Franklin Roosevelt died in his
      cottage at Warm Springs.

      The beneficiary of his $562,000 life insurance policy was
      Warm Springs... which continues to flourish as a
      rehabilitation center to this day.
