<b>                                  BAD TEACHER
</b>

                                  Written by

                        Lee Eisenberg &amp; Gene Stupnitsky




                                                    June 6, 2008

                         

<b>                         FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
          To establish.
          A school marquee with removable plastic letters reads,
          "GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS!" A JANITOR opens the glass and
          starts removing the letters.

<b>          INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
</b>
          POP! A Champagne cork hits the ceiling.
          TEACHERS who rarely get to drink at work, jockey for
          position, holding out their plastic flutes. (Note:
          female teachers outnumber male teachers 12:1.)
          PRINCIPAL WALLY SNUR, 40s, balding, faces the teachers.
          He has a habit of blinking hard before speaking.

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          Well, it's been another great year here
          at JAMS. Who can forget Mr. Pinkus'
          haunted classroom? Sandy, thank you.
          SANDY PINKUS, 40s, sporting a ponytail, smiles, clearly
          enjoying the small compliment.

<b>                         SANDY
</b>          I ain't afraid of no ghost.
          The other teachers laugh.

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          Or the wild success of...

<b>          VOICE (O.C.)
</b>          Wally, can I just say one quick thing?
          Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and
          wholesome. Any trace of sexuality she might have is
          wiped away by her adult pigtails. She treats students
          and adults alike -- like students.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Just wanted to remind everyone the school
          day's not over. So let's keep the
          drinking under control, hmm? That's it.
          Back to you, Wally.
          A bunch of teacher roll their eyes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          Thanks, Amy,
          (then, back to his notes)
          . Or the wild success of the book drive
          for the women's prison sponsored by Ms.
          Savicki's class?
          A broad-shouldered teacher with spiky hair, MS. SAVICKI, nods.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
</b>          But now as the summer is upon us, it's
          time to not only say goodbye to another
          school year, but to also say goodbye to a
          member of our faculty.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Elizabeth, can you come up here?
          ELIZABETH HALSEY, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to
          the front. She sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses
          slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
</b>          You've only been with us for one short
          year, but know that you'll always be a
          part of the JAMS family.
          Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile.
          The Teachers lightly applaud.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
</b>          And we got you a little something.
          Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and.
          pulls out a gift card: BOSTON MARKET. $37.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Almost forty dollars. Thank you!

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          Why don't you say a couple words?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this
          type of thing so I'll make it quick. I
          know I've only been here a year, but
          there's so much I'm going to miss...

<b>          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
          Elizabeth sits at her desk, cleaning it out. She's tossing
          the few personal effects she has into a banker's box.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>
<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
</b>          My students, probably most of all.I'm not
          saying they were little angels, butthey
          were all there to learn and that'sthe
          greatest gift a student can give a teacher.
          Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last
          days of seventh grade.
          A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with
          his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who
          considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she
          signs it.

<b>          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
          Elizabeth walks down the hall holding her box.
          SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her,
          running toward their summer vacation.

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
</b>          And I wish that I had gotten to know all of
          you better, but between four classes and
          planning a wedding, I had my hands full.
          From the little I do know about you, I know
          that our students are in good hands.
          Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully
          removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling
          them into cardboard tubes.

<b>          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
          Three middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a
          thicket on the outskirts of the school property.

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
</b>          And I can't believe it's all over. This
          year flew by. And even though I'll never
          teach again professionally, I've realized
          that I don't need a blackboard and
          classroom to set an example.
          Elizabeth comes up behind them.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Hand it over.
          The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of
          the burnouts hands her the joint.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Everything.
          The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with
          a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          This was a warning. Next time, I don't
          call the principal. I call the cops.

<b>          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
          Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES. She gets in,
          pulls out a joint and lights it. She takes a huge TOKE,
          and then PEELS out of the lot. She tosses her banker's
          box out the window and extends her hand, giving the
          school THE FINGER.

<b>          ELIZABETH (O.S.)
</b>          Woo-hoo!
          A couple students look at her strangely.

<b>                         ANGLE ON
</b>          The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook.
          He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of
          Elizabeth is her message: "YOU ARE ILLITERATE!"

<b>                         DIM-LOOKING KID
</b>          (struggling to read)
          You are... Illit... Illit...
          Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly
          hits him.
          She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the
          JANITOR from the opening shot, who's changing the plastic
          letters to read, "HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!"

<b>                         JANITOR
</b>          Slow down!

<b>          CHYRON: BAD TEACHER
</b>
<b>          EXT. TOWNHOUSE NIGHT
</b>
          A Mercedes with the vanity plate "HIS" is parked in the
          driveway of an upscale neighborhood. Elizabeth's matching
          Mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot. Her license plate
          reads "HERS."

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          INT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          A bachelor pad. Top of the line electronics. Lots of
          black leather furniture. Tacky, but expensive.
          Elizabeth pours two glasses of wine and takes a long sip.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         (CALLING)
</b>          Baby Doll?

<b>          MARK (O.S.)
</b>          Coming!
          MARK, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear.
          He's shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and
          is also a full four inches shorter than Elizabeth.
          Thankfully for him, he has money.

<b>                         MARK (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                         (ANXIOUS)
</b>          Hey! That was a quick party.
          Elizabeth kisses Mark on the top of his head and hands
          him a glass.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Yeah. You should have seen it. What a
          joke.
          She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Here's to me never having to work again.
          And I owe it all to you, Lover.
          Elizabeth takes a big sip.

<b>                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
</b>          So I made a reservation at Ruth's Chris,
          and then I booked us a suite at the
          Drake, and I thought we could finish the
          night in "anal alley." Hmm?
          Something drops in the bedroom. Mark, alarmed, turns
          towards the door. Elizabeth brushes past him into --

<b>          INT. TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Elizabeth enters to find -- NOTHING. Mark follows her in.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Elizabeth looks around -- under the bed, in the closet,
          behind the door.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          See? Nothing.
          Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES.
          Elizabeth opens the latch to find SHEILA, 23, dressed only
          in a thong, scrunched in the fetal position. She stands,
          revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS, and steps out of the chest.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         (TO MARK)
</b>          Motherfucker!

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          How could you do this to me?!
          I'm sorry.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You are buying me the biggest pair of
          yellow diamond earrings they make! I'm
          talking serious blood diamonds.
          Sheila SNEEZES again.
          Bless you.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         (TO SHEILA)
</b>          Get out of my house, bitch!

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Don't talk to her like that.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Excuse me?
          I love her.
          Mark puts his arm around Sheila. Elizabeth eyes Sheila's
          large breasts.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You love her? She's a hooker.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         MARK SHEILA
</b>          She's not a hooker. I dance.
          Elizabeth takes a deep breath.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                         (SWEET)
</b>          Listen, Marky, you made a mistake.
          You're human. I'm human. And this time
          it was you. Maybe six months from now,
          you'll walk in on me. I don't know, but
          probably.
          Sheila SNEEZES again.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Shut the fuck up.
          (then, to Mark, sweet)
          And. maybe I'm talking crazy, but I don't
          want to throw away our life together over
          something like this. We're getting
          married! I'm willing to fight for us.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          I'm not. And you know why? Because
          Sheila loves me -- and not just for my
          money.
          Sheila squeezes his shoulder.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          I'm sorry if I care that my future husband
          can support me. We didn't all grow up
          with a silver spoon in our mouths. You
          can't even imagine what it's like going to
          bed hungry, night after night.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          What are you talking about?! Both your
          parents are CPAs.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          My parents worked their asses off to send
          me to private school. Do you know what
          it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone
          else gets a Beemer the second they
          menstruate? That shit stays with you.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          It's over, Elizabeth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          For the record, there's a shitload of
          things that I hate about you, but I still,
          would've gotten married.
          (beat, sweet)
          Because I love you.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          (rolls his eyes)
          I'm gonna need the ring back.
          She grabs her bag and heads for the exit. Mark follows.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You sad little troll! I hope you and
          your hooker enjoy chlamydia together!

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Elizabeth. The ring.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          (not turning around)
          I'm not even listening to you anymore.
          She starts to open the door. He closes it.
          The ring!

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Like I even want your gay-ass ring.
          She tries pulling it off.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          It's not coming off. I'll go to the
          jeweler's tomorrow.
          Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease.
          Elizabeth steps out into the night. The door SLAMS
          behind her.

          A red 1994 Grand Am with a cracked windshield peels into
          the half-empty lot and screeches to a halt. The license
          plate reads "HERS."

<b>          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          Elizabeth walks down the empty hall. It's possible a
          person has never looked less happy to be anywhere.
          FAINT SOFT ROCK plays from an open door. Something from
          inside the classroom catches Elizabeth's eye.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          (under her breath)
          You've gotta be shitting me.

<b>                         AMY'S CLASSROOM
</b>          The room has been decorated to within an inch of its
          life. Every surface is covered with posters like "Noted
          African-Americans," or "Hispanic American Hall of Fame,"
          or "Women Who Dared." A RED DELICIOUS APPLE has been
          placed on each student's desk.
          Amy, dressed casually in cargo shorts and texas, is trying
          to hang a large "INTEGRITY" poster. She looks over, sees
          Elizabeth staring at her, and immediately lights up.

<b>                         AMY

</b>          And I know you kinda skated by last year,

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Hm. Another time then.
          Elizabeth takes an apple from a desk.

</b>          Of course. I'd never serve a student

          CRUNCH. Elizabeth takes a huge bite out of the apple.

</b>
<b>                         (MOUTHFUL)

</b>          Stupid.
          Elizabeth tosses the mostly uneaten apple into the trash
          and exits. It hits the rim and lands on the floor.
          Okey-dokey.

          It's like an asylum -- nothing on the walls. Elizabeth
          reads from a stack of US Weekly's and circles pictures of
          CELEBRITY BREASTS. LYNN, late 30s, the kind of woman who
          spends a lot of time on her internet dating profiles, but
          rarely gets emailed, pokes her head in.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Um -- kinda.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          Do you want to grab some lunch?

<b>                         ELIZABETH

          Elizabeth and Lynn sit at an outdoor table. Lynn picks at
          a garden salad. Elizabeth is eating a bucket of chicken
          and drinking a large drink. She pulls a bottle of cough
          syrup from her purse and dumps it into her drink.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          You have that thing going around, huh?

<b>                         ELIZABETH

</b>          If you hate teaching so much, why don't
          you just get another job?

          Work at a day care center?
          (slurps her big gulp)
          You know, when I first got into teaching,
          I thought I was doing it for all the
          right reasons: short hours, summers off,
          no accountability.

<b>                         LYNN

</b>          From now on, my full-time job will be
          finding a guy who will take care of me --

</b>          Oh god, I pray for that --

<b>                         ELIZABETH

          I spent most of my summer hanging out at
          the bars near where the Bulls practice.
          Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that
          I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to
          settle down. And they all wear condoms.
          And then they take the condoms with them.
          That's how paranoid they are that a girl
          will try and get pregnant. Like it's so
          easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting
          into a condom.

</b>          I know I'm hot, Lynn, but I don't stand a
          chance against all those Barbies dolls

          Lynn checks her watch.

<b>                         LYNN

</b>          Yeah, I probably won't go either. I
          don't know I might. I'll probably go,
          but just sit in the back. Maybe leave
          early. Maybe stay till the end. Play it
          by ear. Or just stay till the end.
          Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them.

</b>          Yeah, it was alright. When you said you

          Elizabeth is online looking at a PORN SITE. She stares
          at the SCREEN and compares breasts to the ones in US

           Elizabeth is asleep. After a beat, the ALARM goes off.
          She checks the clock: 5.:15. She groans.

<b>          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
          First day of school excitement. The bell RINGS, and like
          rats, the KIDS scurry to their various classes. Before
          long, the hallway is empty.

<b>          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MORNING
</b>
          In one corner, CHASE, clearly at the top of the seventh
          grade food chain, shows off a photo spread of herself
          modelling in a "Western-Style" clothing catalogue.
          GARRETT, 12, wearing grey, stained sweatpants and a grey
          sweatshirt with block letters that read "GYMNASTICS,"
          stares longingly at Chase from a few desks away.

</b>          The photographer was, like, sooo nice.
          He made me feel sooo comfortable.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          I might get flown to Kansas City for
          their fashion week.

</b>
<b>                         (RIVETED)
</b>          Oh my.
          Chase and her friends turn to face Garrett, who's as
          surprised as they are that he spoke.

<b>                         CHASE
</b>          Stalk much?
          Garrett quickly turns away. Chase rolls her eyes. An
          angry-looking kid, TRISTAN, wearing a MICHAEL VICK
          JERSEY, turns to Garrett.

<b>                         TRISTAN
</b>
<b>                         (FAKE SNEEZING)

<b>                         (EARNEST)
</b>          Bless you.

<b>                         TRISTAN
</b>          What'd you say to me?
          Elizabeth, with large bags under her eyes, enters the
          class. Tristan, on a dime, heads back to his seat.
          The class immediately quiets down. SASHA, 12, dressed
          like a paralegal, walks up to Elizabeth with a large
          Tupperware tray.

<b>                         SASHA
</b>          Hi, I'm Sasha. It's a pleasure to meet
          you.
          (handing over tupperware)
          My mother baked these for you.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          (not looking up)
          Just leave them on the desk.
          Sasha, confused, gently puts them down and stands there.
          After a moment, Elizabeth looks up.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          You need something?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          16.
</b>          - Sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the
          front of the class.

<b>                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Anyone here seen "Stand and Deliver?"
          Show of hands.
          (off their blank stares)
          No one? Edward James Olmos? Wow.
          Elizabeth takes a DVD from her bag. She points to two
          KIDS in the front of the class.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          You and you, go grab the TV and roll it
          up front.
          (pointing to Sasha)
          And you, go shut off the lights.
          The two kids, SHAWN and SPENCER, roll the TV over. Sasha
          shuts off the LIGHTS.

<b>                         SASHA
</b>          We're watching a movie on the first day?

<b>                         CHASE
</b>
<b>                         (TO ELIZABETH)
</b>          I think it's awesome. You rock.

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          I agree with Chase.
          Elizabeth pops in the DVD. "Stand and Deliver," starring
          Edward James Olmos as a tough-as-nails calculus teacher
          in an inner-city school begins. Elizabeth takes a bite
          of one of Sasha's cookies and immediately spits it out.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Ugh. Oatmeal raisin?
          She pushes the Tupperware tray into the trash next to her
          desk. Sasha looks on, sadly.

<b>          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
</b>
          Lunch is in full swing. Each clique has staked its own
          territory. Several TEACHERS, Elizabeth and Amy among
          them, are on lunch duty.

<b>                         ANGLE ON
</b>          GARRETT, sitting alone, writing in a journal. Tristan,
          the bully, tosses a bowl of cole slaw at Garrett.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         TRISTAN
</b>          Incoming!
          Direct hit. The cole slaw nails him in the shoulder.
          Garrett picks some of the cole slaw off his shirt and
          eats it. He continues writing. Amy races over to
          Tristan and writes him up.
          Elizabeth watches, bored, struggling to keep her eyes
          open. Amy heads over to Elizabeth.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Somebody's got a case of the sleepies.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         AMY
</b>          Did you see what just happened?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Yeah, that one kid hit the other kid with
          the cole slaw.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          You weren't at the orientation the other
          day, but we're doing something new this
          year. It's very exciting. We're
          splitting the cafeteria into quadrants.
          Elizabeth yawns.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          So, anyways, in order for the quadrant
          system to work, it's vital that each
          teacher maintain order within their
          quadrant. Because it's really tough for
          me as head lunch monitor -- or another
          teacher -- to leave their quadrant to
          discipline a kid in another quadrant. I
          know it's a lot to take in. I'd be happy
          to sit with-you after school and explain
          all of the new guidelines.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Tell you what. Why don't you send me a
          memo, and if I have any questions, I'll
          come to you.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Okay, Elizabeth. Sounds like a plan,
          Stan.

<b>                         (TO ELIZABETH)
</b>          Oh, I meant to ask you. Did I hear that
          you were showing a movie this morning?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          How do I know what you heard?

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Fair enough. Listen, I don't want to
          tell you how to run your class, but maybe
          it might be fun to do some ice-breakers.
          Like "Telephone Charades" or "The String
          Game." Or start doing practice questions
          for the state test. It's never too soon
          to start.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Are we gonna have a problem, me and you?

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Oh, shishkebobs, no. If I gave you that
          impression, I am so sorry. Actually, I
          was really hoping that we could be more
          than across-the-hall-mates.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          I don't know what you've heard, but I
          don't munch box.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          No, of course not. I don't even know
          what that is. I just meant friends.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Like getting manicures and going shopping
          on Sundays? Shit like that?

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Yes! Yes! And helping each other out.
          Looking out for one another.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          That's cool. Tell you what, friend, I'm
          gonna get going. Cover for me?
          Elizabeth doesn't wait for an answer, walks off.

<b>                         AMY
</b>
<b>                         (NERVOUS)

          poster on the wall. She walks over and studies it.

<b>          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          Elizabeth walks down the hallway with the rolled up
          poster. She. passes a man, obviously lost, looking at a
          map. This is SCOTT, 30. Handsome in a wholesome way.
          Elizabeth walks by as he looks up at her helplessly. She
          turns on her heels. Fresh fish.

          there.

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          Oh, you don't have to do that.

</b>          It's a bummer knowing my watch could feed
          a village for .a year, but my grandfather

          Danni puts her bra and blouse back on and exits.

<b>          DR. VOGEL (CONT'D)
</b>          So, Elizabeth, have you given any thought
          to size?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          I was thinking, you know, maybe a D.

<b>          DR. VOGEL
</b>          IJh huh, uh huh. I ,would say, though,
          with your frame, you might consider
          something smaller. A large B, maybe a C
          cup. You'd be surprised how significant
          those would look.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Hmm. Yeah, I think I'll go with the D's,
          really turn some heads.

<b>          DR. VOGEL
</b>          You know, Elizabeth, breast enhancement's
          not a cure-all. I just want to make sure
          you have realistic expectations.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Doctor, I lost my fiance to a woman with
          monster fake tits. So now I need monster
          fake tits so that I won't lose my next
          fiance. Those are my expectations. Is

<b>                         DANNI
</b>          The 19th it is. So the total is $9300
          for the surgery plus one night stay at

          Elizabeth laughs. Danni laughs.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          That's absurd. What if I don't spend the
          night at your facility?

<b>                         DANNI

          She pulls the kitchen knife from her bag and SLASHES the

          Elizabeth and Lynn speak in hushed voices in the corner
          by a vending machine. Amy grades papers on a ratty-
          looking couch. She glances up at Elizabeth and Lynn.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          I don't know. That's a lot of money.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          I know. And I hate asking a friend for

</b>          'Scuse,me. Just gonna scooch in here.
          She drops quarters into the vending machine, but doesn't
          bother selecting an item. This was clearly her "in."
          She turns to Elizabeth and Lynn.

          Amy stammers.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

          So maybe you should think before you
          interrupt a private conversation.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          I guess that's what you get for trying to

          Amy pushes the coin release on the vending machine and
          takes back her change without getting a drink. Amy heads
          back to the couch.

<b>                         ELIZABETH

          The office is decorated with a DOLPHIN motif. Figurines,
          a picture of Principal Snur kissing a dolphin. Dolphin

          Principal Snur sits next to ARKADY, a small pale kid.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          What a phony.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          Major phony. But she also cares a lot, too.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          So what's going on with your boobs?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Shit. Shit is going on with my boobs. I'm
          never gonna get married. I'm gonna die
          broke. I should just blow my brains out.
          (then, lighting up)
          There he is!
          Scott walks down the ramp and HIGH-FIVES a bunch of kids.
          He gives them a big wave.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          I love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          I want to sit on his face.

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          Hey, guys.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You're really making a habit out of this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          40.

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          Ha, yeah. Actually, Sandy Pinkus in the Math
          department, I guess he got that stomach bug
          that's been going around and I got the call.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          I heard he pooped himself in first
          period. A kid had to walk him to the
          nurse.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Lynn, would you mind grabbing me a milk?
          Elizabeth gives her a "can you get out of here?" look.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          Scott, do you want anything?

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          I'm good, thanks for asking.
          Lynn walks off.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          So, Scott --
          Lynn comes back.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          Sorry, what kind of milk do you want?
          Skim? Whole? 2%? Chocolate?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          I don't know. Surprise me.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          Okay, I'll get you skim. No, no, 2%.
          Lynn walks off again.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          She's funny.
          Elizabeth notices Amy looking at her as she continues to
          console the girl. Elizabeth turns back to Scott.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          So, Scott, I was thinking, I would love to
          hear about your experiences in the Peace
          Corps. I love Haiti. Maybe we could go
          grab a drink some night. Maybe tonight.

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          Isn't it Back-to-School Night?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          41.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          (news to her)
          Yeah, Silly, I meant after.

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          Cool! Let's get a group together.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Yeah, definitely! Or just the two of us.
          Scott looks around, then lowers his voice.

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          Oh. Um, listen, I'm really flattered.
          You're one of the nicest people I've met
          here. But... I'm actually seeing
          someone.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Oh?

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          Yeah, we've been keeping it quiet.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Because she's ugly?

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          No. She's beautiful. She's great. She
          really cares about the kids. It's
          just... when you're dating a co-worker...

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         (REALIZING)
</b>          Squirrel?
          Elizabeth whips around to see Amy, who's now sharing a
          frozen yogurt with the formerly bawling girl. Amy looks
          up, smiles and gives a thumbs up to Elizabeth and Scott,
          signalling that everything's okay with the girl. Elizabeth
          NOTICES Amy's LARGE BREASTS straining against her blouse.
          She quietly seethes.

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          Anyways, thanks again for asking me out.
          I'm honored. And I'll take a raincheck
          on that group date. See ya!
          Scott crosses through the cafeteria. Lynn returns with a
          four cartons of milk.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          Here you go. I got you one of each.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          42.
</b>          Lynn hands them to Elizabeth, who takes them, drops them
          in the trash and storms off.

<b>          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT
</b>
          At night, under the stars, the SCHOOL looks peaceful, serene.

<b>          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Elizabeth is up front. She's staring,at the PARENTS.
          They stare right back at her. It's awkwardly silent for
          a beat too long.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey.
          Soooooo... Any questions?
          Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points
          to her.

<b>                         SASHA'S MOTHER
</b>          Hi, I'm Sasha's mother. We waved to each
          other at the carwash. I'm a little
          concerned with the importance you're
          placing on movies. What about the state
          test?
          Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- "Don't
          Question My Authority."

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          That's exactly what I say to my students.
          Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school
          hired me because I'm good at what I do.
          (as the parents take this in)
          And the reason your son loves my class is
          because I inspire him. Movies are one
          tool that I use. I also use other
          multimedia techniques, which I'm not
          going to get into right now. Look, I
          could take you day by day through my
          entire syllabus, but that's not how I do
          things. I'm not one of these stuffy
          teachers who's totally by the book. I
          talk to the kids like they're little
          adults. It's about mutual respect. So
          that's my spiel, as the Jews say.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          Help yourselves to some delicious snacks
          and drinks in the back. Class dismissed.
          They head to the back of the class. ANGLE ON

                         

                         

                         

                         
          A "refreshments" table. A lonely package of OREOS rests
          against a PITCHER OF TAP WATER.
          Elizabeth tries to sneak out the door, but is stopped by
          a sharply dressed PARENT.

<b>                         PARENT #1
</b>          Excuse me, Ms. Halsey.

<b>                         (EXTENDING HAND)
</b>          I'm Chris' dad.
          From Elizabeth's reaction, she clearly has no idea who
          Chris is.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Chris... Great kid -- and precocious.
          You must be so proud.

<b>                         CHRIS' DAD
</b>          Oh, what a relief. I just wish his
          grades would reflect it.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          If I know Chris, he'll get there.

<b>                         CHRIS' DAD
</b>          Listen, I know you have a full plate, but
          if you could keep an eye on Chris, my
          wife and I would really appreciate it.
          Chris' dad shakes her hand. Elizabeth opens her hand,
          sees a tightly folded HUNDRED DOLLAR bill. She looks
          back up at Chris' dad.

<b>          CHRIS' DAD (CONT'D)

<b>                         (WINKING)

<b>          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Elizabeth stands with another set of parents. They're
          eating Oreos and sipping water.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You're Chase's parents? Great kid -- and
          precocious. You must be so proud.
          The parents beam.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

          from some extra attention.

<b>                         CHASE'S MOM
</b>          You think we should hire a tutor?
          (then, to Chase's Dad)
          I told you.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         (CONSPIRATORIAL)
</b>          I'd be happy to do it myself. It's just
          hard in a class of twenty-five.

<b>                         CHASE'S MOM
</b>          Oh, to be a teacher.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          It's just so hard, on my salary, having to
          pay for my supplies, my fiance cheated on
          me with his twin sister... and, unlike a
          lot of these other teachers, all I truly
          care about is helping your child learn.
          And as their personal tutor, I guarantee a
          full grade higher -- or your money back.
          Chase's mom takes out her check book.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

          Parents are leaving the class, ad-libbing "thank.you's."
          Another SET OF PARENTS surreptitiously hand Elizabeth
          some cash.
          A Bohemian mother, MELODY, wearing a beret, lingers behind.

<b>                         MELODY

</b>          I am. So so so so so proud. So proud.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          A kid like that, if I could just give some
          more one on one time, he would just blossom.

<b>                         MELODY
</b>          I'm so happy to hear you say that.
          would really benefit from that.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Unfortunately, in a class of twenty-
          five...

<b>                         MELODY
</b>          Ugh. Class sizes are ridiculous.

</b>          I guess what I'm getting at is, maybe you
          could help out by giving me a little --
          you know -- somethin somethin.
          Elizabeth offers her hand, palm up. Melody stares back
          at her blankly.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          It's just, it's really tough to teach the

<b>                         MELODY

<b>                         MELODY (CONT'D)

          Melody exits. Elizabeth is left in the classroom by
          herself.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          So long, Crazy.
          As Elizabeth pulls out the CASH she just made, we hear

          tell me everything and there are drugs in

<b>          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - THE NEXT DAY
</b>
          The class is split up into mini-sections of four desks
          each. The students are quietly and dutifully working.
          As Elizabeth reads papers and grades them, we HEAR the
          various student's voices.

<b>          TRISTAN (V.0.)
</b>          Atticus Finch is a good lawer because
          he's a good person whose a layer.
          Elizabeth looks at Tristan. As she writes, we HEAR --

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
</b>          Proofread.

<b>          JUMP CUT TO:
</b>          QUICK CUTS. Elizabeth grades another paper. She's
          growing more agitated and is now feverishly writing.

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Wrong!!!

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Is this English?

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Are you fucking kidding me?
          Elizabeth crosses out with one line, so it's
          clearly visible beneath. From out in the hallway, we
          HEAR the loud, aggressive BARKING of the DOGS. Tristan
          runs to the door and peeks out.

<b>                         SPENCER
</b>          Whoa. Drug dogs. Cool.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Sit down.
          Elizabeth races to the window.

<b>                         ELIZABETH'S POV
</b>          The Police officers and the dogs enter the classroom next
          to hers. Elizabeth glances back at her pocketbook.

<b>                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>           (under her breath)
          Balls.
          She races back to her desk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          66.
</b>
<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D
</b>          Keep reading.
          Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk,
          obscuring her from her class. She opens her pocketbook
          and pulls out a CIGARETTE CASE. She pops it open and we
          SEE three neatly rolled JOINTS.
          Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her
          mouth and starts chewing vigorously. As she. makes her
          way through the second and then the third, the chewing
          becomes slower and the BARKING becomes louder and louder.
          Elizabeth starts CHOKING as the door opens and the Police
          Officer and the German Shepherd enter, followed by
          Principal Snur and Amy.

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          Elizabeth, sorry to bother you. This
          will only take a second.
          Elizabeth,. still choking, digs into her purse. She grabs
          her cough syrup and takes a huge swig. Elizabeth wipes
          her mouth, breathes normally.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Sorry. I had something caught in my
          throat.
          The German Shepherd continues barking.

<b>                         POLICE OFFICER #1
</b>          What is it, Axel? Where is it, boy?
          The Dog comes bounding at Elizabeth. Elizabeth's eyes go
          wide. Amy licks her lips. The Dog sideswipes Elizabeth,
          almost knocking her over, and jumps onto Garrett.

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          Ahhh!!!
          The'Police Officer starts rummaging through Garrett's bag
          and pulls out an opened bag of CORN CHIPS.

<b>                         POLICE OFFICER #1
</b>          (holding up Corn Chips)
          All clear. Dog must've responded to
          these. Happens.
          Elizabeth glares at Amy -- "I know you were behind this."
          Amy glares back.
          Principal Snur looks at Amy and shakes his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         AMY
</b>          (grasping at straws, to Garrett)
          Even though that wasn't drugs, junk food
          is still contraband. That's detention,
          Buster.

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          Enough, Amy. I think it's time we call
          off this witch-hunt.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          (pointedly to Amy)
          Thank you, Principal Snur. Now if you'll
          excuse me, my class has a state test to
          prepare for.
          Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit.
          Elizabeth slumps down into her chair, and all at once,
          the combination of WEED and COUGH SYRUP HITS HER.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Whoa.

<b>                         CHASE
</b>          Are you okay, Ms. Halsey?
          Elizabeth takes a long beat before answering.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Class dismissed.

<b>                         SASHA
</b>          But the bell didn't ring.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Get out of my face.
          (then, to Garrett)
          And leave the corn chips.
          The class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out.
          From outside Elizabeth's window, we SEE the SCHOOL BUSSES
          idling curbside. Elizabeth stares at the papers she
          still needs to grade. The papers stare back at her.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          (to no one)
          But first, a nap.

<b>          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Elizabeth is asleep at her desk. She wakes with a jolt.
          A paper is stuck to her face.
          She looks again at the stack of work, then at the pile of
          things she's already corrected. There's FOUR.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Balls!
          She knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground.
          After a beat, she collects herself, goes to pick the,
          papers off the floor. As she starts tossing them into
          the trash, something catches her eye: a PRACTICE TEST
          MANUAL. And in the corner, an address:

<b>                         54 LAKEVIEW STREET
</b>          Peoria Il, 61602

<b>                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Huh.
          Elizabeth tears off the corner and pockets it.

<b>          ELIZABETH (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey, it's Elizabeth Halsey...

<b>          I/E. ELIZABETH'S CAR - DAY
</b>          Elizabeth is driving down the highway and smoking a joint.

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
</b>          Unfortunately, I can't make it in today.
          My grandmother took a turn for the worse
          and it looks like she's dead.

<b>          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
          The kids are laughing and engaged. TURN TO REVEAL SCOTT,
          dressed in overalls and a straw hat with a piece of hay
          in his mouth, animatedly teaching. He's holding a copy
          of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
</b>          Yeah. So I'm off to the funeral. Wish
          me luck.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          EXT. SIGMA NU - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Elizabeth knocks on the door. A buff, shirtless guy in a
          backwards hat opens it. He likes what he sees.

<b>                         FRAT GUY
</b>          Hi there.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Is Tucker here?

<b>                         FRAT GUY
</b>
<b>                         (DISAPPOINTED)
</b>          Yeah, hold on. T-baaaaag! Someone's
          here.
          (then, back to Elizabeth)
          So you coming to our "CEOs and Corporate
          Ho's" party tonight?
          Elizabeth just stares at the Frat Guy. He turns away.
          Tucker, dressed identically to the Frat Guy but twenty
          pounds overweight, hustles down the stairs. He has a
          tattoo of intertwined teabags around his bicep.

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>
<b>          INT. SIGMA NU - TUCKER'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
          Tucker sits on his bed. Elizabeth leans against a desk,
          unwilling to sit down on anything in his disgusting room.
          BOB MARLEY plays softly.

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          Do you ever talk to my brother?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          No. He dumped me, remember?

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          You and my brother always had the
          histrionics.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          So, do you want to come to our party
          tonight? "CEOs and Corporate Ho's?"
          We're kinda light on Ho's.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Like I told "Frat Guy #1," I'm not
          interested.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          Then what's up?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          I need some date rape drugs.

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          (hurt, defensive)
          Two things. Number one: who do you think
          I am? Yeah, I like to party and yeah,
          I'm in an awesome frat, but that really
          hurts. And two: they're not "date rape"
          drugs. It's called GHB -- and it's for
          weightlifting. It helps build mass,
          okay? Why do you even want it?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         (DEADPAN)
</b>          For lifting.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          I have money and I'm in a rush.
          She takes out a wad of cash.

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          That's all you needed to say. No need to
          get all histrionic on me.
          Tucker walks over to a chest, opens it, and takes out a
          small lockbox. He unlocks it and takes out a small
          bottle containing a clear liquid.

<b>                         TUCKER (CONT'D)
</b>          One capful makes you feel really good.
          Two capfuls will knock her out for a
          couple hours. You don't want to take any
          more than two.
          Elizabeth hands him some cash. He hands her the jar and
          then gives her a big, warm hug.

<b>                         TUCKER (CONT'D)
</b>          Listen, I know you and my brother aren't
          together anymore, but I still think of
          you as a sister, okay?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Get your hand off my ass.

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          Sorry, didn't even know I put it down
          there. Good luck with your lifting.

</b>          I.S.A.T. How can I direct your call?

<b>          ELIZABETH (O.S.)

          A portly, unkempt man in a cheap suit, CARL HALABI,
          nervously walks through the hotel bar. He sees the back
          of a WOMAN with a RED PERM.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Marjorie?
          "Marjorie" turns and we SEE that it's actually ELIZABETH,
          wearing the "Little Orphan Annie" wig. She's sipping a
          cocktail.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You must be Carl.
          His face lights up, excited to be in the company of such
          an attractive woman. Elizabeth stands and extends her
          hand. Carl notices Elizabeth's very short skirt.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Thanks for meeting me on such short

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Wow. I did not know that.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Yup yup. And it was actually founded
          before Chicago.

<b>                         ELIZABETH

          No. I should, I should. Definitely
          thought about it.

<b>                         ELIZABETH

</b>          Like I told you on the phone, every couple

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Look, Marjorie, I know my tests aren't

          all for free thinking and creativity, but
          how do you formulate an education budget
          without hard numbers from one of my tests?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You don't need to convince me. But you

</b>          No problem at all.
          Elizabeth lights up.

<b>                         CARL (CONT'D)
</b>          I'll send you one the day after the
          schools administer them.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          I'd really love to see it sooner. I'm on
          a bit of a deadline.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          I wish I could, but unfortunately, you
          need one of these bad boys.
          Carl holds up a lanyard with a STATE ID CARD and some
          keys attached.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Ooh, you look like you're CIA. Listen, I
          totally get it. Enough business for one night.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          I'm gonna have another drink before I hit
          the road. What's your poison?

<b>                         CARL
</b>          My poison is the white devil. Wine.
          White wine.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Fantastic.
          (then, to Bartender)
          One white wine, one tequila sunrise, and
          two shots of tequila.

          Carl is a little tipsy and slurring his words. Elizabeth
          seems to be fine.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          You know, Marjorie, this is the best
          night I've had in a longtime.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Well, that makes two of us.
          Elizabeth gives Carl "fuck me" eyes. He nervously sips
          his drink.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          What turns you on, Carl?

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Everything.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You know what turns me on, Carl?
          He giggles nervously.

</b>
          Carl flips on the fluorescent lights and they flicker on,
          like dominoes across the ceiling. They enter his office
          and Carl awkwardly leans against the metal desk.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          (gesturing, as promised)
          So this is the desk.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Do you have anything to drink?
          Carl goes to a mini-fridge and pulls out an already
          opened bottle of white wine.

</b>          White wine in the office. You're a bad
          boy.
          Carl pours a glass. Elizabeth swigs from the bottle.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you have any music?

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Um... I could put on some internet radio.
          Carl goes to fiddle with his computer. Elizabeth quickly
          reaches into her purse and pulls out the bottle of GHB.
          She pours a little into Carl's wine. And then a little
          bit more. As he turns around, she hands him the glass.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          A toast. To new friends.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          To new lovers.
          CLINK. Carl downs his glass.

</b>
<b>                         (NERVOUS)

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Whatever, man. I'm gonna hit the lady's
          room.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          K, first door on your right. Don't be
          long.
          Carl starts carefully clearing everything off of his desk.

<b>          INT. STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Elizabeth waits in the bathroom. Yawns. Checks her watch.

<b>          INT. STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - LATER
</b>
          She walks back in. Carl looks woozy. The only thing
          keeping him from passing out is the prospect of seeing
          Elizabeth naked.

<b>                         CARL
</b>

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Easy, Cowboy.
          Carl stumbles towards her. Elizabeth deftly moves around
          the desk and exits into the bullpen.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Marblorie!

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          (as to a child)
          Carl, I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out.
          Carl smiles as he feebly chases after her. He. stops at
          the photocopier, steadies himself momentarily and then
          passes out, STILL STANDING.
          Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads back
          into his office. She goes over to the filing cabinets,
          unlocks it with one of the keys, and starts rifling. She
          pulls out a folder.

</b>          And bingo was his name-o.
          She walks over to the photocopier and pushes Carl over. He
          collapses on the ground -- out cold. She copies the test and
          puts it back and grabs a stack of scantrons from a shelf.
          She takes a post-it, scribbles something and sticks it to
          his forehead. As Elizabeth exits, the camera PUSHES IN:
          "You were AMAZING. Love, Marjorie."

          A couple of groans. A couple of frantic moves to fill in
          more scantron bubbles.

          The students dutifully place their tests into a neat
          stack on the corner of Elizabeth's desk and exit.
          Elizabeth waits for all the kids to leave and then slides
          all of the exams into the trash. She pulls out a match
          and lights the exams on fire.
          She then reaches into her bag and pulls out a new stack
          of completed exams. She places the new exams into an
          official-looking folder and exits.

          stopped talking to me in fifth grade, I
          don't care. I remember the Chase that
          wrote me a card when my dad was
          overweight and had to go to the hospital
          because of his heart --

          different card.

<b>                         (CONTINUING)
</b>          And then, a year later, when he left my
          mom and moved in with his trainer, you
          wrote me another card. What happened to
          us? Remember when we had a sleepover in
          the second grade and you wet your bed and
          you were so embarrassed and you made me
          promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I
          never did and I never will. I know we're
          really young, but remember Romeo and
          Juliet were only 13. A lot of people
          don't know that. So there it is. My
          heart on a sleeve.
          (goes into rhyming verse)
          Don't let me leave / Always believe /

          sign that reads "Office of the Poet Laureate."

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          It's closed. Won't be open till morning.
          Come on. Let's get back to the hotel.
          I'm sure everyone's mad at you.
          Garrett stands his ground.

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          I'm not leaving without talking to the
          poet laureate.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Do you think that some Shel Silverstein
          wannabe is going to tell you the meaning
          of life?

<b>                         GARRETT

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          I'm here, right?

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          You have to be here. You're a teacher.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Not for long. I'm getting fired for
          cheating as soon as we get back.
          Garrett takes a seat next to Elizabeth.

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          So. you came looking for me on your own?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Yup.
          (holds up her shoes)
          And you owe me a new pair of
          Nanette Lepores.

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          I just want to know what to say to Chase
          to get her to like me.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You know what you should do?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          What?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Just go out and sleep with as many girls,
          as you possibly can. Get her out of your
          head.

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          They'll probably reject me, too.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Yeah, probably. But life's about how you
          deal with rejection. You can either hide
          in a corner and cry or you can get
          stronger every time. And I figure a kid
          like you with not much going for him --
          if he were to choose the latter -- might
          end up becoming a pretty strong man.

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>
<b>                         (TOUCHED)
</b>          Thanks.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Now come on, let's get out of here. I'm
          freezing and Mr. Delacourte's probably
          shitting a brick.

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          I can't go back there. All the kids will
          laugh at me.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You seriously think they haven't been
          laughing already?

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          Maybe Chase is wondering where I am.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Hate to break it to you, kid, but I don't
          think anyone gives two shits where we are.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          Elizabeth keeps walking and turns a corner. A BELL RINGS
          and the hallway starts filling with STUDENTS.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)
</b>          Well, it's been another great year at

<b>          JAMS...
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          108.
</b>
<b>          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - GYM - DAY
</b>
          QUICK CUTS. The year is winding down. Instead of gym,
          kids are using the time to sign each other's yearbooks.
          Chase walks up to Garrett with her yearbook, asks him to
          sign it.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)
</b>          Who can forget the exciting addition of a
          climbing wall to the small gym...

<b>          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
          QUICK CUTS. It's class photo day. With each FLASH, we
          SEE a different TEACHER with a different CLASS.
          And finally AMY, with a bandage over her nose and two
          black eyes, smiles widely alongside her CLASS.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)
</b>          .Or the student/teacher spelling bee.

<b>          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
</b>
          Much like the first scene of the movie. The teachers are
          sipping plastic flutes of Champagne. Principal Snur is
          up front. Elizabeth lingers in the back.

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          I think that was a huge s-u-c-c-a-s-s.
          Polite laughter.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
</b>          But seriously... With summer around the
          corner, it's time to not only say goodbye
          to another school year, but to also say
          goodbye to one of our own.
          Elizabeth smiles.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
</b>          Amy Squirrel.
          Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a
          pursed smile.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
</b>          After six short years of outstanding,
          tireless work here, Amy is transferring
          out of the district.

<b>                         (MORE)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
</b>          I know she'll bring her love for learning
          to her new students.
          Sandy, the ponytailed teacher, pipes up.

<b>                         SANDY
</b>          Speech! Speech!

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Although leaving was a difficult
          choice...
          Amy looks over to Elizabeth, who motions for her to
          continue.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          When the superintendent personally asks
          you to work at one of the worst schools
          in the state, you say yes. I'm looking
          forward to bringing my brand of zany
          energy and lust -- not love, lust -- for
          learning to the underprivileged students
          at Malcolm X High. I welcome the
          challenge.
          The Teachers applaud, Scott the most enthusiastic.
          Elizabeth steps up to Amy, who flinches.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Here, I got you this.
          Elizabeth hands Amy a poster tube. She.opens it and
          unravels the "Integrity" poster that Elizabeth stole.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          And good luck. Somebody's gonna need it.
          Elizabeth heads for the door. Scott catches up to her.

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          Hey, Stranger.
          (then, whispers)
          Listen, now that Amy's transferring,
          maybe the two of us could go grab a
          drink.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         SCOTT
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         
          Elizabeth walks out.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          CHYRON: THREE MONTHS LATER
</b>
<b>          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
          Elizabeth's 1994 Grand-Am pulls into her spot. And as
           her bare leg steps out of the car, we

<b>          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
          The hallway is empty. We FOLLOW Elizabeth from behind,
          and as she reaches for the door to her class, we

<b>          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
          Quick cuts. From behind, we see Elizabeth place an APPLE
          on each desk, just as Amy did earlier.
          Elizabeth's walls are still bare, except for a framed
          photo of Amy's class picture, with Amy's messed up face,
          from the year before.
          The bell RINGS.
          Elizabeth turns and we now SEE that she has TASTEFUL FAKE

<b>          BREASTS.
</b>          Elizabeth walks to her door and opens it, watching the
          students as they reconnect with friends and share stories
          about summer camp.
          She notices Sasha who is MASSAGING a BOY's shoulders.
          bunch of other EIGHTH GRADE BOYS wait their turn.

<b>          EIGHTH GRADE BOY
</b>          Do me! Do me!
          Sasha clearly enjoys the attention. Elizabeth smiles.
          Garrett walks by, hand in hand with Chase. Trailing both
          of them are identical rolling backpacks. He sees
          Elizabeth and runs over.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You and Chase, huh? She likes the
          poetry?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          She likes that I'm kind of a celebrity.
          But I'm cool with it. I'm the man around
          here!

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Easy.

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          Well, I should get going. See you
          around, Ms. Halsey. Oh, and nice...
          He points at her breasts.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         (TOUCHED)
</b>          Thanks! You're the first student to
          notice.
          Garrett smiles and walks off. Lynn walks by. She's
          cleaning another big stain from her shirt.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          Elizabeth, hey! How was your summer?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          It was great. I met a doctor! Plastic
          surgeon, actually. He's amazing.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          He sounds amazing. How'd you meet him?
          The internet?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          No, in recovery. And I looked like ass,
          so I know it's real.

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          Sounds like a fairy tale.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          It is. Storybook. Well, not total
          storybook. It's a little messy because
          his wife filed for divorce last week, but
          we're gonna get through that.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          So you want to grab lunch later?

<b>                         LYNN
</b>          Sure! My treat.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          No, you got it last time. We'll split it.
