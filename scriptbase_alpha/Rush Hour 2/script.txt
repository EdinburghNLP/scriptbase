Rush Hour 2



















                         RUSH HOUR 2

                         BY

                         Jeff Nathanson

































     EXT. HONG KONG SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING

     A smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like
     watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and
     a half million people a day.

     EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY

     THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side. 

     HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET
     VENDOR across the street.

     She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
     bite we see:

     THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER

     TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball
     erupting over one side of the embassy.

     People panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes
     a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned
     street vendor.

                    HU LI
               (Chinese, subtitled)
          Someone better call the police.

     EXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

     The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in
     a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English
     dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
     look to two girls in a convertible.

                    CARTER
               (int Chinese)
          Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.

     The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who
     is driving and singing to his radio.

                    LEE
               (singing)
          ...wish they all could be California...
          wish they all could be California
          girls...

     Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it
     out of the SUNROOF.

                    CARTER
          I warned you about playing that shit
          when I'm in the car.

                    LEE
          That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a
          Chinese man's CD.

                    CARTER
          Did you see the way those girls drove
          off?  I did you a favor.

                    LEE
          Those girls drove off because of you.

                    CARTER
          All I did was invite them for a drink.

                    LEE
          You invited them to get naked and
          sacrifice a small goat.

                    CARTER
               (checking Chinese-English
                dictionary)
          I said that?  Which word was "goat?"

     Lee picks up his CD case.

                    LEE
          You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys
          Greatest Hits, Volume Two.

                    CARTER
          Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've
          been here three days and we haven't done
          shit.  We haven't been to a club,
          haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on
          vacation, and I want some mu-shu.

                    LEE
          Mu-shu?  You're hungry?

                    CARTER
          Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some
          women.  Now stop playing dumb and show
          me the shu!

     Carter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over
     LEE'S CELL PHONE.

     INTERCUT

     INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
          Lee, there was a bombing at the American
          Embassy.  Two American translators were
          killed.

                    LEE
          Any leads?

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
               (beat)
          We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't
          want to take the case, I'll understand.

                    LEE
          It's my responsibility.

     Lee hangs up the cell phone.

                    CARTER
          What was that?  Did you just pick up a
          case?  Did we just take another damn
          case on my vacation?

     Lee smiles at Carter.

                    LEE
          Of course not.  My Superindendent
          invited us to a club tonight.  Big
          party.

                    CARTER
          Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will
          kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard
          you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

                    LEE
          Carter, would I lie to you?
                              
               EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

     Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their
     way to the door of the Raven Club.  Carter is combing his
     hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping
     when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.

                    CARTER
          That's what I'm talking about.  A real
          Hong Kong night club.  You want an
          Altoid?

                    LEE
          No.

                    CARTER
          You better take one.  Your breath has
          been a little funky all day.  Let me
          look at you.

     Carter looks at Lee.  Fixes his collar.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Just relax and don't worry about a
          thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You
          got condoms?

                    LEE
          No.  

                    CARTER
          Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold
          it in half.

     Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.

     INT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

     A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL
     GIRLS and CIVILIANS.  Lee and Carter walk in.  Lee is trying
     to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where
     a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael
     Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."

                    LEE
          I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. 
          They don't like tourists in here, so try
          to blend in.

                    CARTER
          Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than
          everyone here.  Where you going?

                    LEE
          Bathroom.

     Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to
     the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.

                    CARTER
          How you boys doing tonight?

     The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the
     OLD MAN continues to sing.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          That is the worst singing I've ever
          heard.  That sounds like something you'd
          hear in prison after lights out.

     The thugs continue to ignore Carter.

     INT. RAVEN CLUB - BACK HALL - NIGHT

     Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open
     door - sees a private room.  Several TRIADS are using hi-tech
     MACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

                    CARTER (V.O.)
          Get closer to my body now.  And just
          love me, till you don't know how...

     Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he
     realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL
     YOU GET ENOUGH."

     INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS

     A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open,
     watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael
     Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a
     few of the smitten women who are watching him.

                    LEE
               (whispering from side of stage)
          Carter, get off that stage!

                    CARTER
          Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a
          star, Lee.  A god to these people!

     Carter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to
     the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.

                    LEE
          This is a gangster bar, we're here
          undercover.

                    CARTER
          I knew you were lying.

                    LEE
          I'm sorry.

                    CARTER
          Damn it, why are you ruining my night? 
          I'm just starting to have fun.
               (beat)
          Well fine then, go ahead, pull your
          badge and do your thing.

                    LEE
          No, we're here for information, to find
          out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We
          must tread softly and keep our ears
          open.

                    CARTER
          Tread softly?  Who taught you how to
          roost a bar?

                    LEE
          Carter, you don't understand.  These men
          are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the
          most deadly gang in China.

                    CARTER
          Man, are you crazy?  You think that
          scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented
          gangs.  We were having gang wars before
          anybody even thought about it.  We get
          royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme
          your badge and gun and I'll show you how
          it's done.

                    LEE
          No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am
          Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.

                    CARTER
          You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner
          last night.

     Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. 
     Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
     fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
               (Chinese)
          Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang
          lui.

     Nobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to
     Lee.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
               (whispering)
          What'd I say?

                    LEE
          You just said you're their worst
          nightmare - and to line their mothers up
          for a milking.

                    CARTER
          Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me
          out.

     Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese
     as Carter speaks, Lee translating.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go
          to that side, all fine ass women on this
          side.

     Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Let's try this again.  Who here knows
          Ricky Tan, raise your hand.

     Nobody moves.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.

     Nobody moves.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Now I know you're lying.  

     The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee
     spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage --

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
               (as they run out)
          I come back and catch y'all singing
          Michael Jackson and you're all going to
          jail.

     EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

     Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI
     and several gangsters round a corner.

                    CARTER
          Stop!  LAPD!

     Lee takes off and chases them on foot.

     EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

     EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

     The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS.  The
     GANGSTERS look around frantically.  An apartment building is
     under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom. 
     Their only way out is UP.

     Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
     SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.  Lee wastes no time going after
     them.  With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
     VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.

                    CARTER
          Hang on, Lee.  I'm coming.

     Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN
     CLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

     ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the
     LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood
     against wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his
     pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.

     BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
     to pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the
     bar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...

     WHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
     CARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Forget this...

     He dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
     come at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
     SEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS
     them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs
     after the GANGSTER LEADER.

     ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS

     Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up
     the hill.

     EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

     Lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
     WHAM!  He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE.  Lee TOPPLES
     OVER THE EDGE!  We see his adversary for the first time.

     HU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS

     As she steps to the edge... BOOM!  The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES
     OPEN and CARTER EMERGES.  Gun low and ready.  Hu Li is gone.

                    CARTER
               (out of breath)
          Freeze!  Nobody move!

     Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. 
     Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

     She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
     and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
     ROOF!

     He falls along the side of the building.  He manages to grab
     the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.

     LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!

     They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu
     Li looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off. 
     She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

     CARTER AND LEE

     holding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting
     to bend.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          All I wanted was a little mu-shu.

                    LEE
          Try to land on your feet.

     Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.

                    CARTER
          I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
          miles for this shit.

     The POLE BREAKS
               
     SUPER THE TITLE:

     RUSH HOUR 2: REMEMBER THE DRAGON

     INT. LEE'S UNMARKED POLICE CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in
     silence, bruised and covered in garbage.

                    CARTER
          You lied to me. 

                    LEE
          I'm sorry.

                    CARTER
          You're sorry.  I got somebody's old
          chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't
          tell me you're sorry.  Just take me
          home.

                    LEE
          No time.  There was an explosion at the
          American Embassy today -- two American
          translators were killed.

     Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck.

                    CARTER
          So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew
          up the Embassy?

     EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING

     Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12
     year olds are going through their warm up routines.  

     MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.

                    CARTER
          I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of
          this shit.  There's two billion Chinese -
          let one of them be your partner.

                    LEE
          This won't take long. 

     Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.

                    MASTER FU
          Dragon kick!

     Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.

                    MASTER FU (CONT'D)
          Lotus block!

     The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.  Master Fu
     notices Carter and Lee watching from the back.

                    MASTER FU (CONT'D)
          Twisting Tiger!

     No response.  The students exchange baffled looks.

                    MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D)
               (staring straight at Lee)
          Twisting Tiger!

     Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move
     that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in
     the glow...

     ...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.

                    MASTER FU (CONT'D)
          Didn't I teach you to always arch your
          back?

                    LEE
               (bowing, humbled)
          Yes, Master.

     While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12
     YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 

     Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.

                    CARTER
          I was watching you kids.  My name is
          Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree
          black belt.  At least that's what I tell
          the girls at the Holiday Health Spa
          where I work out.

     Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no
     reaction.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Let me give you kids some tips.  The key
          to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why
          don't you stand up.

     THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw
     punches.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show
          you how to block.  Come on, stand up,
          give me your best shot -- try to kick
          right to my head.

     The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from
     shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
     HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around
     to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
     flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of
     the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          That's pretty good.  Which one of you
          kids did that?

     INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Lee and Master Fu walking.

                    LEE
          I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a
          man who used to train with you.  He's
          become a killer - the worst kind of
          animal.

                    MASTER FU
          Animals kill only from hunger or fear. 
          The man you seek is lower than a
          serpent.  
               (faces Lee)
          ...he kills for money.

     In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over
     Carter from all sides.  Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the
     kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  They
     disappear O.S.

     Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in
     thought.

                    MASTER FU (CONT'D)
          He was the best I ever trained, you
          know.

                    LEE
          Ricky Tan?

                    MASTER FU
          No.  Your father.
               (Lee reacts)
          Your father and Ricky Tan were my
          favorite students... and for such awful
          things to happen as they did --

     Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously
     uncomfortable.

                    LEE
          How do I find Ricky Tan?

     AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by
     in the other direction, disappear O.S.

     Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant.

                    MASTER FU
          A seeding spends its entire life
          reaching towards Heaven.

                    LEE
          I know, Master, but...

                    MASTER FU
          The answers you seek can be found in
          Heaven on Earth.

                    LEE
          Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't
          understand.
               (working it)
          A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A
          mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

                    MASTER FU
          It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven
          on Earth."  You will find your answers
          there.

     Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the
     pathway.

                    MASTER FU (CONT'D)
          Wait!  Put a c-note in the jar.

     Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway. 
     Master Fu walks over and takes the cash.

                    MASTER FU (CONT'D)
          Cheap bastard...

     EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

     Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two
     students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor
     locked between his legs, holding another two down with his
     hands, and sitting on the last one.

                    CARTER
          And that's how you use the LAPD choke
          hold.  Now start practicing and don't
          make me come back here!

                    LEE
          Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

     EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

     A neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor.

                    LEE
          Just follow my lead and act like a
          tourist.

                    CARTER
          I am a tourist.

     INT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

     Lee and Carter walk into an upscale MASSAGE PARLOR and stand
     in a lobby.  SOFT MUSIC is playing. 

                    HOSTESS
          Good afternoon, gentlemen.

     Lee bows, followed by Carter.

                    LEE
               (in Chinese)
          Hello.

                    CARTER
          How you doin'?

                    LEE
          My friend is on vacation, from America. 
          I want to show him a good time.

                    HOSTESS
          Oh, you American?

                    CARTER
          That's right.

                    HOSTESS
          You bring American money?

                    CARTER
               (holding up a Platinum AmEx)
          Never leave home without it.
               (to Lee)
          Lee, this one's on me.  You save your
          money.

     The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN
     SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL
     WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven.

                    HOSTESS
          You get massage from Chinese girl
          before?

                    CARTER
          No.  It's my first time.

                    HOSTESS
          You pick any girl for you and your
          friend.

     Carter looks like a kid in a candy store.

                    CARTER
          Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that
          one.

                    HOSTESS
          Oh yes, she's very nice.

                    CARTER
          She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm
          gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take
          that one, too.  How you doin', baby? 
          And...that one in pink.  She can do my
          feet.

     Lee elbows Carter.

                    LEE
          What are you doing?

                    CARTER
          She said I could pick any girl I want.

                    LEE
          Well, hurry up.

                    CARTER
          Hey!  You don't break in front of a
          black man in a buffet line.

                    HOSTESS
               (to Lee)
          Your friend have big appetite.
               (handing ROBES to Lee and
                Carter)
          Please put these on and wait upstairs in
          the quiet room.

     INT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

     TWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women
     massaging their feet and hands.  There are BIG SCREEN TV's
     showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the
     background. 

     Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING
     PURPLE ROBES.  Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH
     TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same
     time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink.

                    CARTER
          Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come
          through, Lee.

     LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR
     SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of
     sophistication and brutality.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          What's wrong?

                    LEE
          Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

                    CARTER
          That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. 
          I'll go over with you right now, shake
          him down.

                    LEE
          This is a very dangerous man.

                    CARTER
          I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna
          ruin my massage because of some midget
          in a house coat.

                    LEE
          I'm calling for back up!

     Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.

     Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair
     with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a
     decision, gets up and walks towards him.

                    CARTER
          Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over
          for you.  Get up.

     Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.

                    RICKY TAN
          I'm busy at the moment.

                    CARTER
          I said get on your feet!

                    RICKY TAN
          I know you, Detective Carter, right? 
          You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying
          your visit?

                    CARTER
          I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm --
          and don't let the robe fool you.  This
          is the only color they had left.  Now
          get up!

     Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP
     from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT
     against the wall.  Ricky glances at his men who are seated
     around the room waiting to move.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          I told you to get on your feet!

     Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side,
     breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.

                    RICKY TAN
          Lee, I've missed you, brother.
               (getting up, giving Lee a hug)
          I heard about the two Americans, I'm so
          sorry, you must be under great pressure.

                    LEE
          You must come with me for questioning.

                    CARTER
          Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken
          and hot oil waiting for me.

                    RICKY TAN
          I don't think so...

     A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and
     towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing
     Lee and Carter.  A beat...

                    CARTER
          I'd like to pay you for that laptop.

                    RICKY TAN
          It's no problem.  But I must excuse
          myself, inspector.

                    CARTER
          That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

     Tan bows to Lee and Carter.

                    RICKY TAN
          Congratulations.  And good day.

     As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. 
     But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.

     Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man
     covers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other
     henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
     towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
     blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
     the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
     his robe, or some other found object.

     Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
     flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

                    CARTER
               (ref: his privates)
          Damn!  No wonder you're pissed off.

     Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of
     the men's punches.

     In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he
     flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. 
     Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men
     throwing him out the front door.

     Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over
     their shoulders.

     EXT. HONG KONG HIGHWAY - DAY

     Ricky Tan's black limo SCREECHES to a stop.  The door flies
     open and Lee and Carter are TOSSED out onto the highway. 
     Both men are completely naked.

     EXT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - DAY

     A packed street - Lee and Carter dodging in and out of
     people.  The CAMERA PANS and we see Lee and Carter from
     behind.

                    CARTER
          Goddamn you got a small ass.

                    LEE
          Don't look at my ass!

     INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

     PANDEMONIUM

     The station is packed with Americans -- FBI AGENTS, SECRET
     SERVICE... they've set up shop right in the middle of the
     bullpen.

     SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a
     50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.

                    SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
          Chin, you have been ordered by the
          Ministry of Public Security to assist
          the FBI and Secret Service with our
          investigation, to provide us with
          whatever we need.  If you have
          information, it belongs to us.

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
          This is still Hong Kong.

                    SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
          Two Americans have been killed on United
          States Government property -- this is
          our investigation.

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
          Chief Inspector Lee will brief your
          people...

                    SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
          No.  He will report to me.  Do we
          understand each other?

     SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen. 
     Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash
     can lid, Carter using a red construction cone.

                    SPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D)
          Who the hell is that?

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
               (humiliated)
          That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The
          detective in charge of our
          investigation.

                    SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
          Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to
          talk to the great Inspector Lee.

     INT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

     The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting
     on a suit and fixing his tie. 
     Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from
     Lee's closet, then moves for the door.

                    LEE
          Where are you going?

                    CARTER
          Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn
          passport back.  I'm going home.

                    LEE
          Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.

                    CARTER
          Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up,
          so I backed you up.  I was about to take
          out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.

                    LEE
          Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!

                    CARTER
          My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes
          to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! 
          I'm not the one who goes to massage
          parlors to bust crime lords!

                    LEE
          It's my job!

                    CARTER
          You're pathetic, man.  When's the last
          time you had some fun?  When's the last
          time you took a night off, had a date?

                    LEE
          I have plenty of dates.

                    CARTER
          Really?  When's the last time you had
          some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when
          was it?  Year of the rat?

                    LEE
          You would never understand my life. 
          You're not Chinese.

                    CARTER
          And you ain't black!

     The two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly
     walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half
     dressed.

     INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY

     Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin
     stands in the back.

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
          Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from
          the United States Secret Service.

                    LEE
          The Secret Service?  Why?

                    STERLING
          What I'm about to tell you cannot leave
          this room.  The men who were killed
          yesterday were not American translators. 
          They were undercover U.S. customs agents
          trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. 
          We don't know what they're transporting
          out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it
          got the agents killed.

                    LEE
          How can we help?

                    STERLING
          Stay the hell out of our way.

                    LEE
          I can get to Ricky Tan.

                    STERLING
          We know all about Tan.  That's why we're
          leaving him out there as bait.  We think
          this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan
          and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.

     INT. LEE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Carter is on the phone, his feet on Lee's desk.  As he talks
     he opens a drawer, pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it.

                    CARTER
          Captain, you're gonna have to speak up. 
          I'm on a car phone!

     INT. CAPTAIN DIEL'S OFFICE - LAPD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

     CAPTAIN DIEL sits behind his desk talking on the phone.

                    CAPTAIN DIEL
          Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong
          Kong right now?

                    CARTER
          Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm
          in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and
          Vine, two minutes from the station.  How
          about I pick you up right now and take
          you to dinner?

                    CAPTAIN DIEL
          It's nine-thirty in the morning.

                    CARTER
          Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. 
          Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.

                    CAPTAIN DIEL
          Do you know what happened yesterday,
          Carter?  I was officially nominated for
          the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. 
          There was a dinner last night, two
          hundred LAPD officers were there.

                    CARTER
          Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez
          there?  He owes me money.

                    CAPTAIN DIEL
          I've waited my whole life for this job,
          but I don't have a shot in hell of
          getting it.  Do you know why?

                    CARTER
          Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You
          tell them there's no crime in being
          lonely.

                    CAPTAIN DIEL
          No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is
          because the entire department is about
          to find out the stolen credit cards we
          impounded were used to buy two first
          class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what
          the hell is Heaven on Earth?

                    CARTER
          Sir, I'm working on a big case over here
          -- and by the time I get back they're
          gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you
          there?  Hello?  Shit!

     As Carter walks out the DOOR, he brushes past HU LI, who is
     standing in the hallway disguised as a FED EX DELIVERY
     PERSON.  Carter checks her out as he exits.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     CARTER starts walking down the street, making his way past an
     outdoor BUTCHER MARKET, getting strange looks from locals and
     tourists alike.  He motions to an OLD WOMAN who is selling
     LIVE DUCKS, PIGEONS AND CHICKENS

                    CARTER
          How you doing?  Can you direct me to the
          Heaven on Earth massage parlor?  

     The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES
     filled with birds.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          No, I don't eat live birds.  I like my
          birds dead and deep fried.  You ever
          been to Popeyes?

     The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          No, don't do that, I had a big lunch. 
          I'm warning you, I'm a police officer --
          just put the blade down and let the bird
          go.

     INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN/LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

     Lee walks out of the Captain's office, heads for his own
     office - but never gets there.

     AN EXPLOSION rips through the second floor of the station. 
     Lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his
     head.  Sheer pandemonium as Lee quickly looks up at his
     destroyed office, tries to get to his feet.

     STUNNED POLICE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES are crowded around
     Lee's office, looking at the rubble.  Lee pushes through the
     crowd -- it's all smoke and fire.  Now way anyone held back
     by the heat.

                    LEE
          Carter!  CARTER!

     EXT. HONG KONG STREET - DAY

     Carter walks down the street holding a CAGE WITH A LIVE RED
     BIRD inside.  He stops a MAN who is sweeping in front of his
     store.

                    CARTER
          How you doing?  I'm looking for Heaven
          on Earth.

     The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:

     ENGLISH/CHINESE DICTIONARY

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Shan-shui cao guo-jiu, pao gai niu tao
          zi.

                    MAN
          You wish to spank my sister with a ping
          pong paddle?

                    CARTER
          No man, I was just asking...

                    MAN
          Wait here.  I'll go see if she's awake.

     As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off.

     Pause.

     Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see
     if it's worth staying...

     INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - DAY

     Lee sits by himself in shock.  Superindendent Chin
     approaches.

                    LEE
          All he wanted was some mu-shu.

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
          Are you okay, Lee?

     Beat.

                    LEE
          I'm sorry, I have to go.

     EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - AFTERNOON

     Carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving
     for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.  Carter ducks
     to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a
     waiting Daimler.

     The Daimler drives off.  Carter rushes to the middle of the
     street with a determined look on his face.

                    CARTER
          I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi!

     Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.

     INT. TAXI - EVENING

     The CAB DRIVER turns to Carter, who motions to the limo.

                    CARTER
               (loud)
          Follow that limo.

     The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          You understand what I'm saying?  Follow
          that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This
          is a chase -- we are chasing that limo!
               (beat)
          We are still parked -- we're not moving! 
          This is the opposite of chasing -- drive
          the car or I will kill you!

     The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes
     in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash.

                    CAB DRIVER
          Now you speak my language.
               
     INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY

     Lee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo. 
     Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in
     tribute to Carter.

     His CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music.

     INTERCUT -- 

     INT. CHIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
          Lee, we just got a call from the harbor
          patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little
          party on his boat tonight.  Victoria
          harbor.  If you don't want to...

                    LEE
          Did you tell Sterling?

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
          Let him find out on his own.  I want the
          Hong Kong police handling this.

                    LEE
          Thank you.

     Lee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC
     up, a man on a mission.

     EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT

     A 190-FOOT YACHT is anchored in Victoria Harbor.  Ricky Tan
     walks along the top deck with HU LI, disappearing into a
     crowd of people who are partying on the ship.

     Carter steps out of the cab.

                    CARTER
          Stay here.  I'll be right back.  You
          understand?

                    CAB DRIVER
          Yes.  I understand.

     Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off,
     leaving him alone on the docks.

     Carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station
     parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their
     names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.

     INT. YACHT - NIGHT

     A huge PARTY, a live band plays for a crowd of business men,
     politicians and beautiful women - a who's who of Hong Kong.

     CARTER walks up to the front of the boat -- TWO DOORMEN
     HOLDING clipboards immediately stop him.

                    DOORMAN #1
          Invitation, please.

                    CARTER
          I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.

                    DOORMAN #1
          The band has been playing over an hour.

                    CARTER
          I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. 
          Ricky here yet, I need to get his
          requests.

     As Carter walks past the doorman -- 

                    DOORMAN #1
          Wait.

                    CARTER
          Last party all he wanted was Sting --
          not one person danced.  Tonight I'm
          doing Superfreak, I don't care what he
          says.  Where is he?

                    DOORMAN #1
          Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the
          help.

     Carter turns back to the doorman, grabs him by the collar.

                    CARTER
          Help?  I'm not the help, man -- I'm the
          star.  That's my band up there -- I
          control the mood, the groove, the
          atmosphere.

     Carter cuts a smoking DANCE MOVE.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Can you do that?
               (man shakes head "no")
          That's why you're down here and I'm up
          there.  Now this is my party -- don't
          forget it!

     Carter walks onto the ship, starts singing to himself.

     EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS

     The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea. 
     Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of
     the slip.  He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice
     but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the
     side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.  He
     clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging
     LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --

     EXT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS

     As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
     from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner 
     - almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN
     REIGN.  Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
     impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
     money. 
     He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,
     Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
     as sociopath.

     Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li.  Carter
     hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room
     for signs of trouble.  He heads into the main party.

     Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a
     stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of
     champagne.  Carter lights her cigarette for her.

                    CARTER
          How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince
          Mubutu from Nigeria.

                    ISABELLA
          Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That
          seat is taken.

                    CARTER
               (in mangled Spanish)
          San Juan!  You must know my good friend
          Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector
          Elizondo.

                    ISABELLA
               (in English)
          I don't think so.

                    CARTER
          I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled
          in the best circles.  But hey, I
          understand.  Make yourself at home,
          Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever
          you want.  My ship is your ship.

                    ISABELLA
          This is your ship?

                    CARTER
          That's right.  I'm the owner, the
          Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

                    ISABELLA
          El Capitan?

                    CARTER
          I don't want to play games with you,
          Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself
          with you -- in one of those bathrooms
          over there in about five minutes.

                    ISABELLA
          Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a
          beautiful yacht.  What's it called?

                    CARTER
          Called?  What's my ship called?
               (he has no idea)
          Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow
          Johnson.

                    ISABELLA
          The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name
          on the back was "Red Dragon."

                    CARTER
          Red Dragon?  You sure about that?

                    ISABELLA
          I'm sure, because this is my friend's
          yacht.  And it's his party.

                    CARTER
          Your friend's ship?
               (looking around)
          Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the
          wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason
          my keys didn't work.

                    STEVEN REIGN
               (taking seat next to Isabella)
          Who's your friend?

                    ISABELLA
          Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

                    CARTER
          Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? 
          You're big time.  You own all them big
          hotels.  What are you doing in Hong
          Kong?

                    STEVEN REIGN
               (ushering away Isabella)
          I'm just in town for the weekend, taking
          in the sights.

                    ISABELLA
          Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.

     Carter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away. 
     Carter's watching.

     INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Lee makes his way toward a STAIRCASE that is blocked by a
     BODYGUARD.  He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the
     throat, pushing him against the wall.

                    LEE
          Ricky Tan.  Where is he?

                    BODYGUARD #1
          Who's asking?

                    LEE
          The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a
          detective today and he's not getting
          away with it.  Now where is he?

                    CARTER
          Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or
          we'll kick your lying ass!

     Lee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing
     right behind him.

                    LEE
          Carter?

                    CARTER
          Who died?

                    LEE
          You.

                    CARTER
          Detective Yu?  Never met him.

                    LEE
          Not Yu.  You!

                    CARTER
          Who?

                    LEE
          Do you understand the words that are
          coming out of my mouth?

                    CARTER
          Nobody understands the words that are
          coming out of your mouth.

                    BODYGUARD #1
          Get your hands in the air.

     Lee and Carter turn to see FOUR BODYGUARDS standing in front
     of them with GUNS in hand.

                    BODYGUARD #1 (CONT'D)
          Ricky Tan is expecting you.
               
               INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

     It looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED
     and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen
     satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door
     and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom.

                    RICKY TAN
          Come on, Shaq, hit a damn free-throw! 
          You can do it, big guy.

     ON TV

     We see Shaq miss his free throw.

                    RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
          Shit!  He still doesn't follow through. 
          I just lost five grand.

     Tan turns off the TV, turns to Lee.

                    RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
          Why don't we go on the deck, get some
          air...and some privacy.
               (to Hu Li)
          Leave us alone.

     Hu Li hesitates, upset at being dismissed.

                    RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
               (to Lee)
          Could you have your partner wait for us
          outside?

                    CARTER
          I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I
          got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

                    LEE
               (to Carter)
          I'll meet you on the main deck in ten
          minutes.

     Carter pulls Lee aside.

                    CARTER
          What, leave you alone so he can cap you?

                    LEE
          I'm okay, you go.

                    CARTER
          Why the hell should you believe him?  He
          had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty
          shit.

                    LEE
          Remember I told you my father was a
          policeman?
               (beat)
          Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.

                    CARTER
               (pause)
          What the hell is going on here?

     No answer.  Carter holds Lee's glance for a beat, then turns
     and walks the other way.

     EXT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - UPPER DECK - NIGHT

     Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.

                    RICKY TAN
          Despite what people suspect...what you
          suspect --

                    LEE
          Don't.

     Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.

                    RICKY TAN
          ... if your father were alive, I would
          be turning to him now.
               (beat)
          I didn't blow up the American Embassy,
          but I believe some of my people did.  My
          enemies are trying to frame me.
               (beat)
          There is a war going on within the
          Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My
          name has been written into the book of
          death.

                    LEE
          The police can protect you.

                    RICKY TAN
          Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal
          with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get
          me out of Hong Kong.

                    LEE
          Tell me why they killed the customs
          agents.

                    RICKY TAN
          There is a ship, in the Hong Kong
          Harbor...

     Hu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.

     Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.  Hu Li
     screams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.  Tan
     falls back, over the rail, and into the water.

     Lee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee,
     attacking from all sides.  Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight
     off the bodyguards.

     INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

     Reactions from the crowd as GUNSHOTS echo from the deck
     above.

     INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Hu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and
     suddenly goes FLYING, landing flat on her face.

     It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED
     Hu Li with his leg.

                    CARTER
          All right, get your hands up.

     Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head.

     EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

     Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on
     one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and
     Bodyguard #2.

     INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Carter and Hu Li face off.

                    CARTER
          You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give
          you a little LAPD ass kickin'.

     Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows.

     INT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

     Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches
     his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines.

                    LEE
          Hu Li!

     Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT
     starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the
     moving boat.

     Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the
     stern.
               
     EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS

     Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time --
     watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat.

     Carter turns his head, sees --

     -- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li
     escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should
     during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears
     back into the shadows.

     EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

     The yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs. 
     Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks.

     Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock.

                    SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
          Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was
          our only bait, and now he's gone.  You
          finally got your revenge - at the
          expense of a U.S. Government
          investigation.

                    CARTER
          What "revenge" is he talking about?

                    SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
          I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid
          you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was
          a pure vendetta killing -- but you're
          off this case.  I don't ever want to see
          you again, you got that?

                    CARTER
          Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are
          you --

                    SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
          Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going
          back to L.A.

                    CARTER
          Fine with me.

     Sterling walks away disgusted.

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
          I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to
          fully cooperate with the Secret Service.

     Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin
     motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to
     approach.

                    SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D)
               (to police officers)
          Escort Detective Carter to the airport --

                    LEE
          I'll take him.

                    CARTER
          Hell no.

     The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
               (to Lee)
          Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to
          you.

     Carter stalks off.

                    LEE
          Don't push me, Carter.  I'm in no mood
          for your bullshit.

     Carter gets in Lee's face.  The two men look like they're
     about to come to blows.

                    CARTER
          What are you gonna do about it,
          grasshopper?

                    LEE
          I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

                    CARTER
          Give me your best shot, you flat assed
          mama's boy.

                    LEE
          Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my
          ass!

                    CARTER
          I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.

                    LEE
          No.  She's a school teacher.

                    CARTER
          You're not very good at this, are you?

                    LEE
          Good at what?   

                    CARTER
          Forget it.

     A long beat while Lee considers what to say.

                    LEE
          Five years ago, my father was Chief
          Inspector working a big international
          smuggling case.

                    CARTER
          Ask me if I give a shit.

     Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.

                    LEE
          Ricky Tan killed my father.

     Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.

                    LEE (CONT'D)
          He found out his partner, Tan, had been
          working for the Triads all along.
               (beat)
          Before my father could prove it, he was
          killed in the line of duty.

                    CARTER
          How the hell did Tan get away with it?

                    LEE
          All the evidence against him
          disappeared, the smuggling case was
          unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to
          the Triads openly.

                    CARTER
               (pause)
          This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell,
          Lee, you know my father died on the job. 
          You could have told me...
               (realizing)
          This is about more than all that, isn't
          it?  This is about your Daddy's last
          case, right?

     Lee's caught, fibs badly.

                    LEE
          No, no, that would be crazy --

                    CARTER
          You thought the "Customs Agents get
          blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky
          Tan" and you put it all together and
          came up with a five year old case. 
          That's why you didn't tell me what we
          were doing...

                    LEE
          I thought you'd think it was crazy.

                    CARTER
          IT IS CRAZY!

                    LEE
          I know.  I know.  I am sorry.

     Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his
     car.  Carter watches him.  Finally he rolls his eyes and
     yells.

                    CARTER
          So are you getting on the plane or not?!

                    LEE
          What?

                    CARTER
          Come on, we still got time to order the
          Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher
          meal, they bring it first.

                    LEE
          I cannot go to LA...

     Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the
     cop beneath the attitude.

                    CARTER
          It sounds impossible --

                    LEE
          You said --

                    CARTER
          -- but if somebody gave me the chance to
          square up my father's death, I'd go to
          hell to do it.

     Carter turns, walks away without looking back.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          You want to figure out why they killed
          your Daddy, get on the plane.

                    LEE
          Why LA?

                    CARTER
               (still not turning)
          I guess you're going to have to trust me
          on this one.
               
               INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT

     Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other
     passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of
     doubt.

                    LEE
          I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a
          boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

                    CARTER
          Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter
          Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow
          the Rich White Man.

                    LEE
          Follow the Rich White Man?

                    CARTER
          Almost, but you've got to say "Rich
          White Man" all run together like it's
          one word.

                    LEE
          Follow the RichWhiteMan...

                    CARTER
          Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere,
          has a rich white man taking his cut. 
          Every single one.  Now in our case, we
          know the rich white man is Steven Reign.

                    LEE
          Who?

                    CARTER
          Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky
          Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just
          before Ricky got smoked.

                    LEE
          How do you know he's our man?

                    CARTER
          Because when the shooting started he was
          way too cool.  See most white people,
          when there's shooting, they either hide
          in a toilet or start screaming high
          pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!

                    LEE
          You sound like that all the time.

                    CARTER
          Black people keep their cool when the
          shit goes down.

                    LEE
          Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never
          panic.

                    CARTER
          Yeah, what about when Godzilla was
          coming?  You people were screaming your
          asses off.

                    LEE
          Just tell me where I can find this
          Steven Reign.

                    CARTER
          The same place you find all
          RichWhiteMen.
               (a tray arrives)
          Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love
          this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

     BINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL

     CUT TO REVEAL --

     Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars.

     Lee standing next to him.  WE ARE:

     INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

     Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down
     hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack.

     BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL

     Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the
     penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven
     Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the
     door.

     Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.

                    CARTER
          Yeah, that's definitely the woman from
          Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in
          his suite at his hotel, I told you this
          would work out.  They still just
          talking?

                    LEE
          He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

                    CARTER
          He'll be back soon.

                    LEE
          How do you know?

                    CARTER
          Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour,
          I'll take over.

     Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to
     sleep on the bed.

                    LEE
          Carter, there's something I have to tell
          you.  You were right about what you said
          in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never
          take a day off.  It's all I have right
          now.

                    CARTER
          Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.

                    LEE
          The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu
          in six months.

                    CARTER
          You pull a muscle or something?

                    LEE
          My fiancee left me over the summer -- a
          month before our wedding.

                    CARTER
          I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?

                    LEE
          It's a long story.

                    CARTER
          Let me guess, she couldn't handle the
          cop thing -- never knowing if you were
          dead or alive.  I've seen it a million
          times.

                    LEE
          No.  It was my singing.

                    CARTER
          Excuse me?

                    LEE
          She hated my voice.  Said it drove her
          crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in
          bed - in the shower - I thought she
          liked it.  She finally told me it was
          driving her crazy.

     Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.

                    CARTER
          Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss
          our personal lives.  Let's die curious.

     LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          What's she doing?

     BINOCULARS P.O.V. - ON ISABELLA

     She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER
     CURTAINS.  Slowly taking off her coat.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Lee?  You okay?

     Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to
     unbutton her blouse.

                    LEE
          She's just standing around -- not doing
          much.

                    CARTER
          Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later
          something's gonna happen.

                    LEE
          I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

     Isabella starts to remove her blouse.  Lee starting to sweat
     as he watches her undress.

                    LEE (CONT'D)
          Slow down, baby.

                    CARTER
          What did you say?

                    LEE
          Nothing.  I said nothing.

     Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.

                    LEE (CONT'D)
          Is it hot in here?

                    CARTER
          Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.

                    LEE
          I'm gonna go in the hall and get a
          bucket of ice.  You want some ice?

                    CARTER
          What's going on?  

     Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.

                    LEE
          She's getting undressed.

                    CARTER
          Gimme the binoculars.

                    LEE
          No.  It's not right.

                    CARTER
          Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot
          you.

     Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as
     Carter watches to the window.

                    LEE
          What's she doing?

                    CARTER
          Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

                    LEE
          I don't want to hear this.

                    CARTER
          Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra
          and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring
          Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec -
          there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it
          looks like Snoopy.

                    LEE
          Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

                    CARTER
          She just took her hair down.  Now she's
          going for the bra -- the clasp is in
          front -- she's using both hands.
               (to Lee)
          You better get that ice.

     Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.

                    LEE
          That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing
          this!

     Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the
     living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in
     bra and panties.

                    CARTER
          This is our job.  We took an oath as
          police officers.  If we don't do this,
          who will?  Firemen?

     Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees
     Isabella hang up the phone.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Wait a sec - what the hell is that
          between her legs?

                    LEE
          What?

                    CARTER
          She's reaching into her panties --
          something is strapped to her leg.  Oh,
          God...please don't let it be a dick.

                    LEE
          What is it?

                    CARTER
          No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a
          microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

     CLOSE ON ISABELLA

     As she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She
     puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom
     and puts on a robe.

                    LEE
          I don't understand?

                    CARTER
          She's walking back towards the door.

     BINOCULARS P.O.V.

     We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her
     hotel room talking with someone.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          She opened the door.  Someone is
          delivering a package.

     BINOCULARS P.O.V.

     Inside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Lee...it's the girl who delivered the
          package to your office.  It's a bomb!

     Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.

     INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

     Isabella closes the door.  She BRINGS THE BOMB WITH HER as
     she walks into the bedroom --

     EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

     Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the
     entrance of the hotel.

     INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Lee and Carter sprint out the Penthouse Elevators, running
     down the hallway.

     INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

     Isabella takes her robe off, glances at the package, picks it
     up and starts to open it as Lee and Carter come BURSTING
     THROUGH the BEDROOM DOOR.

                    LEE/CARTER
          NO!

     Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and
     panties.

                    CARTER
          Damn girl, you fine.

     Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the
     BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.

     INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

     Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the BOMB
     toward the END OF THE HALL as he and Carter dive to the
     floor.

     Nothing happens.

     Lee looks up, SEES a HOTEL EMPLOYEE pushing a room service
     CART, about to walk right past the package --

                    LEE
          GET DOWN!!

     Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.

                    CARTER
          Pick it up!

                    LEE
          It's your turn!

                    CARTER
          I don't need a turn!

     Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall,
     heading for the elevator.

                    LEE
          Throw it!

     Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE
     STANDING INSIDE.

                    HOTEL GUESTS
          Do you want us to hold the elevator?

                    CARTER
          Get the hell away from here!

     Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do
     with it --

                    LEE
          Stairs!

     Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs --

     INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     Lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell -- when he
     sees TWO MAIDS WALKING toward him.

                    CARTER
          Get out of the building!

     Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no
     choice but to throw it back to Carter.

                    LEE
          Roof!

     EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT

     Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to
     hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. 
     He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets
     are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.

                    LEE
          Wait!  There's people down there!

                    CARTER
          There's people up here!

                    LEE
          Get it out of here!

                    CARTER
          Take it!

     Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee
     and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides
     to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT
     OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed
     off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.

                    ISABELLA
          Get on your feet.

     Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella
     begins to open the package.

                    CARTER
          I wouldn't do that!!!

                    LEE
          It's a bomb.

     Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED
     DOLLAR BILLS.

                    ISABELLA
          You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before
          I throw you both in jail for
          obstruction.

                    CARTER
          Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you
          right now.

                    ISABELLA
          I'm an undercover agent for the United
          States Secret Service.

                    CARTER
          How do we know you're not lying?  Let me
          see your badge.

     Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to
     her bra.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Let me see it again?

                    LEE
          We can help you.  I'm a detective in
          Hong Kong.

                    ISABELLA
          I know who you are, Inspector Lee.

                    LEE
          Then you know I'm not walking away from
          this case.

                    CARTER
          Yeah, that's right.

                    ISABELLA
          We need to get out of sight.  Come down
          to my suite.

     INT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER

                    ISABELLA
               (she locks the door)
          Look, I've been working this case for
          months now...

                    CARTER
          So what's your story?

                    ISABELLA
          They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

     Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's
     package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the
     food from the mini fridge.

                    LEE
          Is this a payoff?

                    ISABELLA
          No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard
          of the Superbill?

                    CARTER
          It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.

                    ISABELLA
          It's much more than a counterfeit.  14
          out of 15 world banks can't tell the
          difference.  The paper is Crane linen
          blend -- and the bills are printed on
          U.S. Intaglio presses.

                    CARTER
          How're they getting into the U.S. Mint
          to use the presses?

                    ISABELLA
          In 1959, the United States was very
          friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We
          wanted his oil, so for the Shah's
          birthday, the government gave him a gift
          -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The
          only one to ever leave the country. 
          Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that
          press on the black market.

                    LEE
          Five years ago?!  
               (beat)
          That's right before he left the force.

     Lee and Carter exchange looks.

                    ISABELLA
          It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until
          this past year.  Then Tan got hold of
          one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar
          plates -- and started making superbills.

                    LEE
               (understanding)
          And Hu Li killed him for the plates.

                    ISABELLA
          Yes.  They've printed and shipped one
          hundred million dollars, and there's
          only one way to spot a fake.

     Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns
     RED.

                    ISABELLA (CONT'D)
          They use an optical transfer ink from
          India that burns red -- the real ink
          burns black.

                    CARTER
          What the hell are they going to do with
          a hundred million dollars in funny
          money?

                    ISABELLA
          The real question is, where are the
          plates?  If we can find the plates, we
          can stop the whole operation.

     Isabella thinks for a beat.

                    ISABELLA (CONT'D)
          Maybe that's where you can help us. 
          Carter, this is your city, right?

     Carter nods.

                    ISABELLA (CONT'D)
          And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads?

     Lee nods.

                    ISABELLA (CONT'D)
          Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the
          plates.
               (hands Lee a card with a phone
                number)
          Welcome aboard, gentlemen.  From this
          moment on, you're working for the United
          States Secret Service.

     Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out.  They exit
     quickly, trying to hide their excitement.  CAMERA STAYS on
     Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a
     number.

                    STERLING (O.S.)
          Sterling.

                    ISABELLA
          Lee and Carter are officially out of the
          Secret Service's way...

     EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

     Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through
     the street trying their best to look like Secret Service
     Agents.  They approach Carter's parked VETTE.

                    CARTER
          Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my
          calling, Lee. 
          Give me six months and I'll be in
          Washington protecting a white guy.

                    LEE
          We both know you would never take a
          bullet for someone else.

                    CARTER
          They don't know that.  What are they
          gonna do, try and shoot the President
          during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella
          can pull some strings.  You saw the way
          she was staring at me.

                    LEE
          She never even looked at you.

                    CARTER
          You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked
          me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're
          third world ugly.

                    LEE
          I am not third world ugly.  Women like
          me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.

                    CARTER
          Snoopy is about six inches taller than
          you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a
          chance.

     Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette.  Lee
     reluctantly gets in, too.
               
               EXT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CHINESE SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall.  

     INT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Carter and Lee pass through the restaurant, only two tables
     are occupied.

     INT. KITCHEN

     Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the OWNER, a
     BLACK MAN named KENNY, is yelling in Chinese to an over
     worked waiter.  Kenny's wife, a spectacular looking Chinese
     woman, works the stove.  A couple of cute half-black, half
     Asian kids run around the kitchen.

                    CARTER
          Kenny!  How you doin'?

     Kenny looks up at Carter.  A cool, appraising glance.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          How's the action tonight?  The house
          making out okay?

     Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to --

     INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     MEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for
     big money.  Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside.  It's very
     smokey and very crowded.

                    CARTER
               (to Kenny)
          This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud
          voice, they all scream and run and shit. 
          Watch.  It's real funny.

     Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.

                    KENNY
          Come with me.

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Kenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door.

                    KENNY
          Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong
          Kong, James.

                    CARTER
          What??  Where'd you hear that?

                    KENNY
          I got my sources.

                    CARTER
          And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how
          that works out.
               (beat)
          I'm serious this time, I'm closing this
          place down.

                    KENNY
          James, you see my kids back there?  You
          know how much I'm paying for private
          school?  How can you come in here with
          this attitude, you being little Chang's
          godfather?

                    CARTER
          Little Chang is gonna have to go visit
          his daddy in jail if you don't
          cooperate.

                    KENNY
          Jail!?  James, you better back off. 
          Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.

                    CARTER
          I'd like to see you try.

     Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial
     arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him --
     countering Kenny's move.

                    KENNY
               (to Lee)
          We're on, then.

     Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence --
     Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.

                    LEE
               (impressed)
          That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where
          did you learn that?

     They switch to Chinese.

                    KENNY
          Master Ching taught me.

                    LEE
          The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?

                    KENNY
          No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

     Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          What are you doing hanging out with Baby
          Duck?

                    LEE
          Baby Duck?

                    KENNY
          That's what we all used to call him when
          he was a kid -- cause he was always
          quacking.  Never shut up.

                    CARTER
          I heard that.

     Lee and Kenny laugh.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Look, I need some info and I don't have
          time to play around.

                    KENNY
          Is this about the funny money?

                    CARTER
          How'd you know?

                    KENNY
          You've been asking loud questions in all
          the wrong places all morning.  How come
          you always save me for last, James? 
          When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't
          happen I don't know about.

                    CARTER
          So tell me what you know.

                    KENNY
          I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty
          good double sawbuck -- but you knew that
          too, didn't you?

                    CARTER
          Yeah.  We already been there.  This is
          big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service
          calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even
          tell the difference.

     Kenny considers this for a moment.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          What?

                    KENNY
          One of my regulars lost fifty thousand
          dollars at the table here last week.  I
          was about to send my boys down to tune
          his ass up, when the guy comes in and
          pays off the whole thing.  Including the
          vig -- brand new sequential hundred
          dollar bills.  I knew something was
          wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular
          job, no way he comes up with fifty grand
          in cash. 
          But I tested the bills, infrared.  The
          whole thing.  And they checked out. 
          100%.

                    LEE
          Do you still have the bills?

                    KENNY
          I still have my lunch money from third
          grade.

                    CARTER
          Lemme see 'em.

     Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. 
     He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter
     checks it out.

                    KENNY
          See.  It's perfect.

     Carter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
          Whoa, what are you doing?

     Kenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED.

                    KENNY (CONT'D)
               (pissed off)
          I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He
          works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

                    CARTER
          All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off
          the hook.  For now.

     Carter and Lee move for the door.

                    KENNY
          You sure you guys don't want to stay and
          have a bite?  My wife's got the best mu
          shu this side of Compton.

     Carter and Lee exchange a look as we CUT TO:
               
               EXT. REIGN PLAZA - DAY

     Establishing.  Carter and Lee park their car and walk inside.

     EXT. REIGN SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Carter and Lee enter.

                    CARTER
               (to a worker)
          We're looking for a guy named Zing.  Is
          he here?

     Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them.  Then RUNS.  Carter
     and Lee exchange looks and run after him.

     INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Zing sprints down an employee hallway, through a doorway and
     down some stairs.  Carter and Lee in pursuit.

     EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - REIGN PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

     Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the
     stairway -- coming almost face to face with --

     HU LI

     Who has her gun out.  Waiting for them.  ISABELLA is standing
     near by, and ZING is visible off to the side.  An 18-WHEELER
     in the loading bay is just being shut and locked.  A LIMO is
     parked beside it.

     Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions.  When most of
     the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out,
     putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.  They can't blink
     without getting mowed down.

                    HU LI
               (in Chinese)
          The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will
          be remembered for ridding the Triads of
          your petulance.

     Hu Li savors the moment.

                    CARTER
          I hope you just said I have no business
          being here, 'cos I was just leaving.

     Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him,
     freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several
     feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.

                    ISABELLA
          Hu Li, I think there's someone who will
          want to talk to them first.

     Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee
     falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt
     of her gun.

     BANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across
     the jaw with her fist.

                    CARTER
          ...oh, that's a filling right there. 
          That's gonna cost you.

     Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.

                    HU LI
          Put them in the truck.

     The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.

                    CARTER
          I should kill you right now, but I'm
          gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine,
          and maybe you can be reformed.

     The WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck
          myself.

     As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a
     look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li
     COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun.

     EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - DAY

     The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car
     pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway.

     EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DAY

     The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it.

     INT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - TRUCK BED - DAY

     LEE and CARTER are in the back with crates filled with MONEY.

     They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows. 
     Carter is flexing his battered body.

                    LEE
          Are you okay?

                    CARTER
          What's the first thing I told you --
          never trust nobody.  How could you fall
          for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.

                    LEE
          She saved our lives.

                    CARTER
          For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's
          playing both sides.

     Lee looks disappointed.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a
          thing for her.

                    LEE
          Shhh, my head hurts.

                    CARTER
          I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh"
          me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky
          Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang
          Long are not in South Central.  I didn't
          have to help you.

                    LEE
          Why did you help me?

                    CARTER
          It doesn't matter.

     Lee thinks about this for a BEAT.

                    LEE
          I'm not used to having a partner.

                    CARTER
          We are not partners.  Between your
          daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just
          took, as far as I can tell all partners
          get you is dead.

                    LEE
          Well we're not friends.

                    CARTER
          You got that right.  And we ain't
          brothers.  Maybe we should just end this
          right here.

                    LEE
          Fine with me.

                    CARTER
          I won't talk to you, you don't talk to
          me.  We'll die in peace.

                    LEE
          See you in the next world.

     A BEAT OF SILENCE

                    CARTER
          I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I
          won't see you in the next world.

                    LEE
          Fine. 

                    CARTER
          I believe in heaven.  You people believe
          in heaven?

                    LEE
          Yes.  We have heaven.

                    CARTER
          Is it the same heaven, or is it a
          Chinese heaven?

                    LEE
          What's a Chinese heaven?

                    CARTER
          I thought it might be like those five
          foot and under basketball leagues.  They
          don't let everybody in.

                    LEE
          I think we should stop talking.

                    CARTER
          Fine by me.

     ANOTHER BEAT OF SILENCE

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          You thinking about that girl that dumped
          you?

                    LEE
          No.

                    CARTER
          If she was the right girl, you'd be
          thinking about her.

                    LEE
          Mind your own business.

                    CARTER
          How was the sex?

                    LEE
          There was no sex.  She was very
          traditional.  We were waiting until we
          were married.

                    CARTER
          You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No
          mu-shu?

                    LEE
          No mu-shu.

                    CARTER
          What about a little king pao chicken?

                    LEE
          No kung pao chicken.  Never.

                    CARTER
          Steamed dumplings?

                    LEE
          Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But
          only when she was drunk.

                    CARTER
          That's rough, man.  If I don't get
          steamed dumplings once a week, I go
          crazy.

                    LEE
          Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think
          I have a good voice?

                    CARTER
          Are you serious?

                    LEE
          Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

     Lee turns away from Carter.

                    CARTER
          As long as you're asking...I think you
          have a pretty good voice.

                    LEE
          I knew it.  What does she know.  You
          want me to sing something?

                    CARTER
          That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long
          usually kill their victims?

                    LEE
          They'll probably torture us first, shock
          our privates, then put two bullets in
          our eyes and one in the back of the
          head.

                    CARTER
          Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

     Lee clears his voice.

                    LEE
          Did you happen to see the most beautiful
          girl in the world...and if you did, was
          she crying, crying...hey!

     EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

     The 18-WHEELER drives by followed by the LIMO.

     INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

     Hu Li and Isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that
     is driving behind the truck.  Hu Li is on the car phone.

                    HU LI
          Don't worry, the plates are safe.  Yes,
          the dragon's been fed.

     She HANGS UP and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best
     to appear completely uninterested.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     The LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER.

     INT. 18-WHEELER - TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS

     Carter works at opening one of the crates.  Lee steps up,
     takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet
     spot, and PUNCHES a hole in one of the thick boards.  They
     start prying the crate open.

                    CARTER
          Very nice.

                    LEE
          It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak
          spot.  You ignore everything around you,
          and put all your energy into one perfect
          strike.

                    CARTER
          I'll remember that next time I'm
          fighting a box.

     Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about
     $1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Hello, Benjamin.

                    LEE
          Who's Benjamin?

                    CARTER
          Benjamin Franklin, he discovered
          electricity.

                    LEE
          A Chinese man discovered electricity.

                    CARTER
          No Chinese man discovered electricity.

                    LEE
          Yes he did.  He also invented the
          bicycle.

                    CARTER
          Now that I believe.

     Carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          You never know.  Besides, I always
          wanted to die rich.

     The truck lurches.

                    LEE
          We're slowing down.  This must be it.

                    CARTER
          End of the line.

                    LEE
          You've been a good friend, James Carter.

                    CARTER
          Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting
          corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass
          from here to Compton.

                    LEE
          You could never kick my ass.  You mama's
          boy.

                    CARTER
          Don't you talk about my mama.
               (winks at Lee)
          That's more like it.

     EXT. 18-WHEELER - CONTINUOUS

     The truck is parked in the underground loading docks.  It's
     approached by FOUR TRIAD SOLDIERS.  Soldier #1 opens the
     TRUCK'S DOUBLE DOORS to find.

     Lee and Carter are gone.  Except for boxes of money, the
     truck bed is EMPTY.

     Two soldiers enter the truck bed.

     ANGLE UP TO REVEAL

     Lee and Carter WEDGED up against the CEILING of the truck
     bed.  Above the doors and over the soldiers.

     Lee and Carter SWING DOWN in unison -- knocking both soldiers
     to the ground.  In the next instant:

     ON LEE

     still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips
     onto the roof of the truck.

     ON CARTER

     who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to
     use a shield as gunfire erupts.

     Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the
     ground.  He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield
     and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN
     the first two guards.

     Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them
     CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like
     the closest way out:

     A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.

     INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

     Lee and Carter run through - it extends out from the
     underground loading docks.

                    LEE
          This way.  I see some lights.

     Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a
     MANHOLE COVER.  They start climbing up the metal stairs that
     lead up to the street.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. - DUSK

     The blvd.'s packed with PEOPLE and CARS.  

     CLOSE ON

     Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing
     together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS
     VEGAS STRIP.  They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest
     light show in the world.

                    LEE
          Vegas...

                    CARTER
          Lee.  I just got an idea how someone
          could launder a hundred million dollars
          in cash.

     They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH:

     A TEN-STORY DRAGON.  Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
     SECONDS.
               
               EXT. RED DRAGON HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

     FIRE BALLS BLOW out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up
     at the RED DRAGON.  The HUGE NEON SIGN READS: GRAND OPENING -
     EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

     Lee and Carter come out of the sewer.

                    LEE
          Red Dragon.

                    CARTER
          That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

     Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the
     hotel -- it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE.  The richest of the
     rich are making their way inside.

                    LEE
          Let's go.

                    CARTER
          Wait a second.  We can't go in like
          this.  Look at this place, we gotta look
          fly.  We gotta Mac out.

                    LEE
          What is Mac out?

                    CARTER
          Follow me my Asian brother.

     Carter and Lee start to walk away.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Just stay down wind, because I think you
          stepped in some serious rat shit down
          there.

     EXT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - NIGHT

     Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store.

     INT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS

     As they enter, a SALESMAN approaches them.

                    SALESMAN
          May I help you gentlemen?

     Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of
     superbills.

                    CARTER
          Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this
          body but pure silk.  And get my partner
          something from the children's
          department.

     Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

                    SALESMAN
          Would your partner like silk as well?  I
          personally like it when a couple
          matches.

     Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder.

                    CARTER
          Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's
          no couple here.  Just two single police
          officers working a very dangerous case.

                    LEE
          Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing
          us.

                    SALESMAN
          I'm sure all the boys are chasing you
          two.  Don't worry, I'll make you guys
          the bell of the ball.

     He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee.

                    CARTER
          This is the last time I go shopping with
          you.

     EXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT

     Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly
     tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit. 
     Le is awkward in "player" guise.

                    CARTER
               (whispering)
          Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You
          own the place.

     Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as
     they walk through the doors.

                    LEE
          I own the place.

     INT. RED DRAGON - CONTINUOUS

     Carter STRUTS through the lobby, Lee doing his best to
     imitate Carter's pimp and roll.  THEY WALK PAST THE GIANT
     BUDDHA --

                    CARTER
          That looks exactly like my Uncle
          Darrell.

                    LEE
          Buddha is the symbol of luck and good
          fortune.

                    CARTER
          Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. 
          The man has the biggest tits in Asia.

     They are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA
     COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle.

     RICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The
     MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around
     the perimeter - a sign reads:

                    SIGN
          $50,000 buy in -- EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

     The LIGHTS DIM - a spotlight comes on and finds STEVEN REIGN
     on the balcony overlooking the ENTRANCE.

                    STEVEN REIGN
          A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy
          village in China hired a young Dragon to
          guard their treasure in a cave, hoping
          to scare off potential bandits.  Their
          plan worked quite well, until the people
          of the village started sneaking the
          Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him
          bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so
          much and grew so big -- that he
          eventually got stuck inside the cave --
          and the treasure was stuck behind him
          for all eternity.
               (beat)
          Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that
          lost treasure.  It is here, inside the
          greatest casino in the world!  Welcome
          to the Red Dragon, where everybody is a
          winner!

     Reign smiles, flips a switch -- the CASINO COMES TO LIFE. 
     Fireworks, bright lights, endless rows of tables, dealers
     waiting.

     A BAND PLAYS on a stage in the casino lounge.

     Chinese ACROBATS perform suspended from the ceiling and on
     the balconies above.

     Applause all around as the FLAME shoots out of the dragon's
     nostrils and the acrobats perform.  Carter and Lee walk down
     the red carpet.

                    CARTER
               (to waitress)
          Bring us some twelve-year old scotch...
               (to a cigarette girl)
          Get us a box of your finest cigars.
               (to a change girl)
          Give me ten dollars in nickels.
                              
     INT. CASINO - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON

     Dice ROLLING on a craps table.

                    CRAPS DEALER
          Winner!  Seven!

     We see BLACKJACK DEALERS BUSTING - paying out CUSTOMERS.

     Hundred dollar slot machines paying out jackpots.

     GAMBLERS winning all over the casino.  Then going to the main
     cage and exchanging their chips for SUPERBILLS.

                    CARTER
          Look at this place, Lee.  The biggest
          front in the world.

     As people pour into the casino, Steven Reign is making his
     way through the crowd, shaking hands and posing for pictures.

                    LEE
          Carter...here comes the rich white man.

                    CARTER
          Wait here.  I'll handle this.

     As Carter walks off, a WOMAN grabs Lee and pulls him onto the
     dance floor.

     INT. LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

     The woman spins to face Lee, her face half-hidden under the
     dance floor lights.

                    ISABELLA
          Put your arms around me.

                    LEE
          Excuse me?

     Isabella grabs him around the waist, pulls him close.

                    ISABELLA
          Hold me close.  There's cameras
          everywhere.

     An ASIAN BAND sings STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT as Lee tries his
     best to slow dance.  An intimate moment between Isabella and
     Lee, her face nestled in the crook of his neck, hiding her
     face.

                    LEE
          What's going on?

                    ISABELLA
          I need your help.

                    LEE
          Last time you needed my help I ended up
          in the back of a truck.

                    ISABELLA
          I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You
          have to trust me.

     Lee starts to get into the music, moving his hips in a slow,
     sensual rhythm.

                    ISABELLA (CONT'D)
          You move well.

                    LEE
          Just trying to make it look real.

                    ISABELLA
          Look over there.  That's the eye in the
          sky room.

     Lee looks over her shoulder. 

                    ISABELLA (CONT'D)
          Behind me is the soft count room.  We're
          pretty sure the plates are back there.

                    LEE
          Why don't you go get them?

                    ISABELLA
          If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

                    
     INT. CASINO - NIGHT

     As Steven Reign makes his way through the casino, Carter
     steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug.

                    CARTER
          Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody
          get a picture, we can use it for a mug
          shot.

                    STEVEN REIGN
          Detective Carter, you always seem to
          show up where you don't belong.

                    CARTER
          Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I
          want the truth.  Is there any way I can
          date your daughter?  Just dinner and a
          movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...

                    STEVEN REIGN
          Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I
          crawled out from under the first rock. 
          Do you really think you can intimidate
          me here?

                    CARTER
          You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most
          counterfeiters only get ten cents on the
          dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure
          genius.

                    STEVEN REIGN
          You play games with me, Detective, and
          you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. 
          The odds are always in favor of the
          house.

     Reign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave.

     INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

     Lee is dancing close with Isabella.

                    ISABELLA
          The Secret Service almost busted Reign
          at his casino in Macao, but the place
          burned down before we could move in.

                    LEE
          How do I know I can trust you?

                    ISABELLA
          Dip me!

     Lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT.

                    ISABELLA (CONT'D)
          I'm asking for real now -- will you help
          the Secret Service?

                    LEE
          No.
               (beat)
          But I'll help you.

     Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. 
     He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. 
     Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor.

                    CARTER
          Lee, what the hell are you doing?

                    LEE
          Dancing?

                    CARTER
          Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong
          arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the
          line, and you're up here dancing with
          some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?

                    LEE
          It was Isabella.  She says the plates
          are in the soft count room.

     Lee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD
     standing in front of a small door.

                    CARTER
          Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She
          almost got us killed.  She's setting you
          up again!

                    LEE
          No.  I'm going to find out.

                    CARTER
          Wait a second.  There's guards all over
          the place.  You'll need a distraction.

     Carter looks around the casino.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          I'll go to the craps table, make a big
          scene.  When security comes over, you
          make your move.  

                    LEE
          Try to keep them busy for five minutes.

                    CARTER
          I'll give it my best shot.
                              
               INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

     Carter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare.

                    CRAPS DEALER
          Sir, you're aware that we require a
          fifty-thousand dollar buy in to gamble
          here this weekend?

     Carter throws a HUNDRED THOUSAND in $100 BILLS onto the
     table.

                    CARTER
          I saw the sign, I can read.  Now gimme a
          hundred-thousand in chips.  And a Diet
          Coke and some wash-n-dries.  Let's move,
          people, I came to play.

     The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          What the hell is that?

                    CRAPS DEALER
          Those are five hundred dollar chips.

                    CARTER
          Did you give me five-hundred dollar
          chips because I'm black?

                    CRAPS DEALER
          No, I just assumed...

                    CARTER
          You assumed a brother coming in here can
          only afford five-hundred dollars a roll,
          is that right?  Are you a racist?

                    CRAPS DEALER
          No, sir.

                    CARTER
               (starting to scream)
          Everyone else at the table has thousand
          dollar chips, but the black man gets the
          nickel, is that it?  Did my people
          survive two-hundred years of slavery so
          you could send us back to the cotton
          fields with five-hundred dollar chips? 
          Do I look like Chicken George to you?

     The PIT BOSS gets on his walkie-talkie.

                    PIT BOSS
          Floor security, we have a problem at
          table nine.

     EXT. SOFT COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

     The SECURITY GUARD lowers his walkie-talkie, starts moving
     towards Carter's table.

     INT. CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

     TWO SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.

                    CARTER
          Answer me one question.  How come Ben
          Vereen isn't performing here at the
          hotel?  Is Ben Vereen not good enough
          for you people?

                    PIT BOSS
          Lionel Ritchie is performing here
          tonight.

                    CARTER
          Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since
          the Commodores.

                    PIT BOSS
          Sir, you're going to have to calm down.

     Carter watches as Lee moves past the guard and makes his way
     into the soft count room.

                    CARTER
          I have a dream, where black people and
          white people can gamble together without
          getting different chips!

     A BIG CROWD has gathered as the Security Guards try and push
     their way through.  The pit boss picks up the phone, calls
     upstairs.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Sing with me!  "We shall overcome!"

     Carter starts clapping, and the confused crowd joins in as
     the Security Guards move in.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Thank you.  Now in the spirit of
          brotherhood, let's play craps!

     INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Lee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the
     walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room.

     He hears noise, TWO SECURITY GUARDS coming behind him through
     the casino door.  He has no choice but to crawl over the back
     of a money cart and hug the top.  He lies as still as he can,
     trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring
     directly into the EYE IN THE SKY cameras that are in the
     ceiling.

     WE SEE LEE'S FACE

     as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the
     words "oh shit" as he rolls by.

     Lee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain
     of COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out. 
     On the opposite side, the REAL MONEY is being WHEELED OUT
     toward a waiting TRUCK that is parked at the back door.

     Lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is
     blown.  He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of
     the locked vault.  There's no way to get the plates. 
     Isabella has set him up again.

     He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.

                    LEE
          Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have
          change for a twenty?

     The GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them
     down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO
     MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward
     the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a
     right cross.

     Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she
     stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife
     to Lee's throat.

                    HU LI
               (in Chinese)
          Open your mouth.

     She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. 
     She holds the detonator in her hand.

                    HU LI (CONT'D)
               (continuing in Chinese)
          That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector. 
          Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth
          into your brain.

     INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

     A crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table
     rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him.

                    CRAPS DEALER
          Winner six!

                    CARTER
          How much is that?

                    CRAPS DEALER
          Two-hundred thousand!

                    CARTER
          Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants
          a hundred dollars?

     Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional
     AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Here, your highness, have a hundred
          dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight!

                    GAMBLER
               (South African accent)
          I am not royalty, sir.

                    CARTER
          Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My
          great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit --
          we probably cousins, man.  How much you
          got on the table?

                    GAMBLER
          One million.

                    CARTER
          Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who
          wants to blow on my hand for luck?

     Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS
     YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady
          blows on my hand for luck?

                    TEXAN
               (embarrassed)
          She's not my lady.  She's my niece.

                    CARTER
          Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come
          on, baby, give me some luck.

     The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Nice blowing.  When's your next
          birthday, I'll be the cake.

                    TEXAN
          Hey, buddy, watch yourself.

                    CARTER
          Don't threaten me.  I got friends in
          this town that will bite off your ears. 
          Just sit tight, because I've got the
          dice and I am on fire!

     Carter throws the dice.

                    CRAPS DEALER
          Winner, seven!

     The table erupts as Carter grabs the dice.

                    CARTER
          Let it ride!
                              
               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

     The elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the
     sky room by Hu Li and the three Triads.  As they walk into
     the room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room.

     INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     FORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel.  A MAN
     stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the
     casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.

     Lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind
     his back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.

                    RICKY TAN
          Imagine a business where people hand you
          money.  And you hand them back
          absolutely nothing.

     Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. 
     Isabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the
     sight of Ricky Tan alive.

                    RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
          Now that's a true American dream. 
          Thanks to a few pieces of metal and a
          very greed driven US Customs agent.

     Ricky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.

                    RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
          Look at you, you're ridiculous.  You
          know it didn't have to be like this. 
          But it's too bad!  Like father, like
          son.

     Lee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of
     the monitors.

                    HU LI
               (in Chinese)
          He's going for the plates.

     Ricky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign
     walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE
     SUITE.

                    RICKY TAN
          Look at this old fool, what does he
          think he's doing?

     Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.

                    RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
          It's almost impossible to find a partner
          that's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't
          you agree, Lee?

     ON ANOTHER SCREEN

     We see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life. 
     Ricky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to
     Isabella as he goes.

                    RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
          Well, at least you will die with honor. 
          But choy Gien.

     SUBTITLES: "Won't see you again."

     INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

     Carter has two racks of chips in front of him, a huge crowd
     surrounding him.

                    CRAPS DEALER
          Winner!  Four, winner!

                    CARTER
          I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. 
          That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those
          here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me
          out!

     Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach
     Carter's table.

                    PIT BOSS
          Sir, we'd like to escort you to the
          cashier.

                    CARTER
          That would be great.  Don't want any of
          these rich white people to jump me.

     As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter
     glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.

     INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - NIGHT

     Ricky Tan turns to Hu Li.

                    RICKY TAN
          Chai Hu Li.
               ("Little Fox")
          Have fun.

     Ricky Tan walks out.  Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee,
     plays with the button.

                    HU LI
               (in Chinese)
          In a few minutes...you'll beg me to push
          this button.

     Hu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee.  She holds the
     blade to his face.  About to cut him.  When Isabella pulls
     her gun.

     Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind
     his back.  Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her
     knife in the other.  She takes a step toward Isabella.

                    ISABELLA
          It's time to end this, Inspector.

     Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator
     from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and
     sticking the gun under her chin.

                    ISABELLA (CONT'D)
          Don't move!  United States Secret
          Service.

     Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the
     hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator --
     the TWO WOMEN fight around it.

     Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and
     rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when:

     THE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR

     They're about to move in.

                    HU LI
          Get the detonator!

     The Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet,
     KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her.

     One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee
     gets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his
     back.

     Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM.

     Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.

     INT. CASINO - CASHIER

     Two security guards lead Carter away from the table when:

     CRASH!

     An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. 
     In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.

     The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:

                    CARTER
          Lee!!

     The guards restrain him.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Lemme ask you something.  Any of you
          ever felt $500,000 before?

     He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying
     as the GUARDS hit the floor.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Doesn't feel so good, does it?

     INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Hu Li picks up the detonator.  WHACK!  A heeled foot kicks it
     from her grasp.  Isabella has recovered!  The detonator FLIES
     OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW.

     INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

     On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND
     DISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before
     Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the
     detonator on her rounds.

     Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a
     BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it,
     but he does see:

     ACROSS THE CASINO

     Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at
     bay with a croupier stick.

                    CARTER
          Black man gets on a hot streak and
          you're all trippin'?

     Carter and Lee see each other.  They have the same
     simultaneous though:

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
               (help!)
          Lee!

                    LEE
               (help!)
          MMMMMM!!!!

     Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. 
     But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way
     is the HIGH WAY.

     Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards. 
     Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. 
     He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --
     landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other
     side.

     Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in
     the Sky Room.  He grins.

                    CARTER
          Check it out.  Catfight!

     POW!  He socks a GUARD in the face.

     INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Isabella and Hu Li are locked in battle.  Rolling to the
     floor, they both see the gun.  They scramble over each other
     to get to it first.

     INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

     A security guard CLIMBS on the table to level Carter when Lee
     arrives.  He kicks the guard off and turns to Carter, his
     plea MUFFLED.

                    CARTER
          What the HELL are you doing with tape on
          your face?

     No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive.  Kicks
     and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!  He bobs
     and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in
     between swings.  Suddenly:

     BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.

     Everyone HITS THE DECK.  Carter and Lee dive on to the floor
     as panic ripples through the Casino.  People FLEE for the
     EXITS.

     THE WAITRESS DESERTS HER TRAY.  It gets knocked over and TIPS
     on the floor.  The DETONATOR LANDS feet away from Carter.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          This can't be good.

     Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it!  A
     high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.  He LUNGES for
     it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --

     WHAM!  He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY.  The second it hits
     the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.

     ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room.  Hu Li
     STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.  

     The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li.  As she bends to PICK
     up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time. 
     Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.

     Hu Li lifts the detonator.

     Carter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.

     Lee SPITS the grenade into the air.

                    LEE
               (diving on Carter)
          Bomb!!!

     Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.

     KABOOM!

     The table is BLOWN OFF IT'S FOUNDATION.  Chips and cash
     volcano.  Hu Li is blown backwards by the force of the blast. 
     SHEER PANDEMONIUM grips the casino.

     AS THE SMOKE CLEARS

     Carter and Lee peer out from behind a row of slot machines. 
     The place is deserted.

                    CARTER
          Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in
          your mouth?

                    LEE
          I did!

                    CARTER
          No you didn't!

                    LEE
          Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

     A hand on Carter's arm.  THIS IS SERIOUS.
               
                              LEE (CONT'D)
          Ricky Tan is alive.

                    CARTER
          What?!?!

                    LEE
          We have to get to the Penthouse.

     Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end
     of the casino.

                    CARTER
          Hold on!

     Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee. 
     But halfway up the carpet.  Carter stops.  Lee turns to see
     what is holding him up.  

     Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          You go after Ricky.  I got this.

                    LEE
          Carter...

                    CARTER
          Just GO!

     Lee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE
     TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes
     short work of them, and races toward the elevators.

     DEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF!

     Each readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her
     long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches,
     flexes, ready to sting like a bee.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          I'm not gonna hold you back this time
          just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna
          pretend you're a man.

     She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her
     undershirt.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          A very beautiful man with a perfect body
          who I'd like to take to the movies.

     She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND
     like a master.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          I may have been absent the day we went
          over this in karate class.

     Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta
     soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for
     another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him.

     INT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

     Lee's in the elevator as the doors close.  SUDDENLY, a HAND
     cuts through, parting the doors.

     It's ISABELLA!  A wound on her shoulder.

                    LEE
          Are you okay?

                    ISABELLA
          I'm fine.

     She steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and
     holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down.

                    LEE
          I didn't know which side you were on.

                    ISABELLA
          Now you know.

     DING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY
     - the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and
     steps into the elevator.

                    ISABELLA (CONT'D)
          I'll try to get backup.  Be careful.

     The elevator doors close.
               
     INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

     Steven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of
     HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a
     black bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he
     comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan.

                    RICKY TAN
          American's love to gamble.  Don't they,
          Mr. Reign?

                    STEVEN REIGN
          I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm
          leaving.

                    RICKY TAN
          And my plates?

                    STEVEN REIGN
          They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't
          have a problem with that.

     Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and
     starts to walk toward the door.

                    RICKY TAN
          I enjoyed that little story you told
          about the Dragon and the treasure.  My
          mother used to tell it to me all the
          time.  Do you know the moral of that
          story, Mr. Reign?

                    STEVEN REIGN
          Greed will imprison us all.

     Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.

                    RICKY TAN
          I hate that fortune cookie shit.

     Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls
     dead to the floor.  Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.

                    LEE
          Put the plates down.

     Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.

     INT. CASINO - NIGHT

     WHOOSH!  Another Terra Cotta fighting stick is in half in
     Carter's hands.

                    CARTER
          Will you STOP?!?!
               (picks up cocktail umbrella)
          What am I supposed to fight you with?

     No more toying.  Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE
     WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD.  She SLICES it in HALF!  He's
     got nowhere to hide.

     She JABS him with the sword.  Carter SCREAMS.  Falls back
     against the table, clutching his chest.  Hu Li WINDMILLS,
     kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --

     THWACK!

     The DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and
     she is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade.  Staring
     at Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.

     Carter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS
     HER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          When are you people gonna learn?  Don't
          mess with the brothas!

     WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He
     reaches through the slice in his jacket.  Instead of a hand
     covered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          Thank you, Benjamin!

     Carter runs for the elevator.
                              
                    INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

     Lee is walking toward Ricky Tan, the two men circling Reign's
     body.

                    RICKY TAN
          You're just like your father, Lee.  All
          these years hiding behind his badge.  I
          wanted to help him, to share with him,
          but he was too afraid of change.  When
          you think about it, I didn't really kill
          him.  I just put him out of his misery.

                    LEE
          Put the plates down.  It's over.

                    RICKY TAN
          I don't think it's over.  There are
          casinos all over this country.  Let me
          make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make
          the same mistake he did.

     Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.

                    LEE
          If you reach for that gun, I'm going to
          kill you.

                    RICKY TAN
          Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

     Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,
     taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as
     Carter bursts in the room.

                    CARTER
          Hey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's
          up, Lee?

     Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him
     like this before.

                    RICKY TAN
          Would you like me to tell you how your
          father died?

                    CARTER
          Lee, you okay?

     Lee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.

                    RICKY TAN
          He never begged for his life.  Or tried
          to make a deal.  All that he asked me,
          just seconds before I pulled the
          trigger, was that I promise not to kill
          you.

     Lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the
     trigger but can't.

                    CARTER
          Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it,
          man.  He's making you do this.

                    LEE
          It's worth it to me.

                    RICKY TAN
          Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you
          gonna spend the rest of your life hiding
          like your father?

                    CARTER
          C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You
          won, now just put the gun down.

     Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.

                    RICKY TAN
          That's what I thought.

     Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the
     plates hit him across the face and knock him down.

     THE GUN IS LOOSE

     Tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:

     Lee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM
     SQUARE IN THE CHEST.

     Tan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Lee tries to
     grab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.

     But Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the
     street below.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     A TAXI is parked out front.  Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof. 
     SMASHING THROUGH A SIGN ON TOP THAT READS: "EVERYBODY'S A
     WINNER!"

     INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

     Lee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved
     it's finally over.  Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

                    CARTER
          I don't know about you, but I need a
          wine cooler.

     As they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them,
     bleeding and half-dead.  She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. 
     This one twice the size of the one from earlier.

                    HU LI
               (in Chinese)
          We'll go together, Inspector.

                    CARTER
          Please tell me she just asked for a ride
          to the airport.

     Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn
     and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.

     EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

     Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the
     PENTHOUSE BLOWS!

     The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side
     of the hotel.

     THEY SCREAM AS THE CABLE BREAKS.

     Lee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER. 
     They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE
     SIGN.

     It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.

     Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.  A HUGE
     TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. 
     The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.

                    LEE
          I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
          miles for this shit!!

     They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips
     and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE
     STRETCH LIMO.
                              
     INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

     Lee and Carter land in the back.  Slam into their seats and
     try to catch their breath.  The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH
     when they realize they're alive!

                    CARTER
          We made it, man.

                    LEE
          No problem.

     Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR
     OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at
     them.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a
     night on the town.

                    VERSACE SALESMAN
          Well, there is a God after all.

     Lee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of
     the hotel.

                    LIMO DRIVER
          Here we are.  The Red Dragon hotel.

     In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE
     CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.

                    VERSACE SALESMAN
          We're all going gambling and then to see
          Siegried and Roy.  I hope you two are
          feeling lucky!

     INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Lee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with
     Sterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  Lee and
     Isabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane,
     Lee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.

                    CARTER
          I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? 
          You played it cool, though.  Walking
          away, never looking back.

                    LEE
          She's going home to New York.  I need
          some ice.

     Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.

                    CARTER
          That your gate down there?

                    LEE
          Yes.

                    CARTER
          I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.

                    LEE
          I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.

                    CARTER
          You take care of yourself, Lee.

     Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND
     like a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away.

                    LEE
          Carter, wait.  There's something I want
          you to have.

     Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter.

                    CARTER
          Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I
          can't take this.

                    LEE
          It's okay.  I can finally let it go.

     Carter takes the badge.  Smiles.

                    CARTER
          In that case, I got something for you. 
          I picked it up at the hotel.

     Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.

                    LEE
          What is this?

                    CARTER
          About fifty grand.  I won it at the
          tables.

                    LEE
          No, Carter.  I can't take this.

                    CARTER
          It's okay, I got lots more.

     Carter pulls out another wad of cash.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          They owe us, man.  That's the least they
          can do.

                    LEE
          This money is evidence.

                    CARTER
          Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five
          minutes and live it up.  There must be
          something you want.

     Lee looks back toward Isabella.

                    LEE
          I always wanted to go to Madison Square
          Garden.  See the Knicks play.

                    CARTER
          New York City?

                    LEE
          First class.

                    CARTER
          The Plaza Hotel?

                    LEE
          A little Mu-shu.

                    CARTER
          Some Kung-Pao?

     They look at each other, smile.

                    CARTER (CONT'D)
          I could use a little vacation.

                    LEE
          Amen to that, brother.

     As Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC
     SWELLS.  "WAR" starts to PLAY.  They dance their way through
     a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make
     their way through the airport.
