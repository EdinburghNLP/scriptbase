This portion of the screenplay is originally pages 14-26.  It is presented 
out of order to reflect the final film.  

<b>			EXT. BLACKSTONE AVE. - 2000 - NIGHT
</b>
            Dark night.  Most street lights shot out.  Just one or two of
            the eerie vapor lights left on the block.

            A MIDDLE-AGED AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN carries his single bag of
            groceries.  The man listens and watches carefully, as he
            negotiates the darkness between the few pools of light on the
            street.

            We won't see his face until he reaches the next pool of
            light, but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear.

            Moving down the block, all shops abandoned.  Broken windows. 
            Rats.  The man almost trips over a vague shadow passed out
            and crumpled in an abandoned doorway.  It's the crackhead we
            saw mumbling himself into the nod-off zone.  He's still
            faintly singing a part of the bones song as the man passes. 
            He stops in the light.

            And we see it's SHOTGUN: 20 years of fear and loathing etched
            on his face.  He freezes, listening for a second to the
            crackheads wheezing mumbles - no - it's something else he's
            listening for -- and hearing.

            From behind him a low wheezy sound, like some huge panting
            dog.  He stops.  And it stops.  He walks on and it follows:

            As he hurries to the next pool of light and safety, his ears
            strain for the nearly silent padding and wheezing steadily
            following.

            Suddenly, he hears that panting closer and closer until it's
            nearly right behind him.  He starts running, though he hasn't
            yet seen anything.  Only heard the mongrel hot on his heels.

<b>            FOLLOW WITH SHOTGUN
</b>
            As he stumbles, careens, and wheezes through the streets and
            alleys, terrified.  Winded, he eventually stops, his hand
            trembling into his shopping bag, seeking a weapon.

            And we see the building he's paused beside: Bones' place. 
            Pockmarked by age.  Like the face of some furious old man.

            Now he can almost feel the dog's breath on the back of his
            neck...Shotgun spins, whipping a bottle of milk out of the
            bag and hurling it into the darkness behind him.

            The bottle smashes against the wall of Bones' building.  For
            a second, silhouetted against the now whited wall, the tall,
            too tall, shape of the skinny black dog.

            Without waiting to see what he hit, Shotgun takes off running
            to reach his building across the street.  The sound of the
            dog's nails skittering across the street right behind him --

            -- and he just makes it --

<b>            INT. SHOTGUN'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Inside, safe, panting for breath.  Then starts running up the
            stairs...

<b>            EXT. SHOTGUN'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            From outside his third floor window, we see Shotgun run into
            his apartment, slam down his groceries on the counter, grab
            an old rifle from under his bed and hurry to his open window.

<b>            INT. SHOTGUN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            He scan/aims out his window across the street to the now
            desolate building where Bones once lived.  Finger on the
            trigger, eyes scanning the shadows for the dog.  Mumbling
            quotations from the Bible about canines, some of which are
            handwritten and taped up on his walls and mirrors:

<b>                                SHOTGUN
</b>                      "Thou shalt not bring a dog into the
                      house of the Lord thy God, for they are
                      an abomination."  Deuteronomy.

            Suddenly, something moving on the empty street catches his
            eye.

<b>            HIS ANGLE ON
</b>
            The Black Dog emerging from the shadows in the street.  Our
            first good look at the beast.  Long clawed paws, all teeth
            and tongue and a curved bony rib cage like it hasn't eaten in
            20 years.

            It's long black head seems almost to be throbbing, moving
            from within, almost subliminally we see a weirder, demonic,
            more skeletal dog face just beneath the black fur... Or is it
            just the buzzing light from the vapor lamps?

<b>                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)
</b>                          (as he aims his rifle)
                      "They return at evening: snarling like
                      dogs and prowling the city..." Psalms 59,
                      vs. 6...

            The dog stands in the pool of light, offering a perfect shot. 
            Shotgun smiles, aims, and then fires, making --

<b>            EXT. BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            -- a direct hit!  But the dog doesn't move.  Unfazed.  The
            bullet must have missed.  Or else gone right through him.

            The long-faced dog just looks up at Shotgun like it was
            laughing at the fool.  And has been for years.

            Shotgun reaches for the spilled groceries on the counter. 
            Shoving aside bread and canned goods and other edible
            necessitates, and finds a half-dozen boxes of rifle rounds.

            He calmly reloads the rifle.  And the sound of another shot
            echoes in the night over...

<b>            EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Two frat boys, JASON and PALMER, driving a too nice car in a
            too bad part of town.  Palmer at the wheel while Jason makes
            a call on the cellular.

<b>                                PALMER
</b>                      Great.  Gun shots.

<b>                                JASON
</b>                      Just a backfire.

<b>                                PALMER
</b>                      Like you'd know.  Face it.  We're lost.

<b>                                JASON
</b>                      Take a left, no, I mean a right.  Okay,
                      stop for a second.

            They stop in the middle of a block.  Jason on the phone.

<b>                                JASON (CONT'D)
</b>                      We're here.  Where the hell are you?

<b>                                STANK
</b>                          (on phone)
                      Back here.  At the end of the block.

            He turns around and sees behind them, TWO GUYS standing on
            the far corner.  One's on the phone.

<b>                                STANK (CONT'D)
</b>                          (on phone)
                      You got the cash?

<b>                                JASON
</b>                      You got the shit?

<b>                                STANK
</b>                          (on the phone)
                      Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the
                      way on foot.  Leave your car and walk
                      over here.

<b>            EXT. STREET - SAME
</b>
            They exit the car, looking all around them with more than a
            touch of paranoia.

            As they walk nervously down the block, they join the two on
            the corner.  It's STANK and WEAZE, both 17.

<b>                                JASON
</b>                      Let me see it.

<b>                                STANK
</b>                      Let me see it.

<b>                                JASON
</b>                          (hands him the money)
                      Where is it?

<b>                                STANK
</b>                      I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And
                      I can't go get it for you cause you might
                      be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up
                      yourself.

            Jason and Palmer aren't sure about this.  By the sphincteral
            look on his face, Palmer would rather forget about it.

<b>                                STANK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. 
                      Halfway down that block, you can't miss
                      it.  Top step of the front stairs,
                      there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't
                      shitting you.

<b>                                JASON
</b>                      Fuck it.  Alright.

<b>            EXT. BLACKSTONE AVE. - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            They walk around the corner and enter a bleak block with at
            least half the lots burnt out.

<b>                                PALMER
</b>                      Is it too late for me to officially
                      register my growing certainty that this
                      is an extremely bad idea?

            Farther down, in the center of one side of the street, stands
            a particularly ominous abandoned building.  Bones' building.

            Jason ignites a Zippo, and they see one loose brick.  Jason
            pulls it out and behind it sees a glint of baggy.

<b>                                JASON
</b>                      Easy as pie.  And twice as tasty.

            He opens the bag.  It's filled with rock cocaine.

<b>            ANGLE - ACROSS THE STREET
</b>
            On the third floor, Shotgun sits in his straight-backed chair
            in front of the open center window drinking coffee, cradling
            his rifle on his lap.  Sees the frat boys picking up their
            shit.  Then he looks out at Bone's 'tomb':

            Dark blank windows staring back at him; the building's front
            door covered with broken vertical boards with jagged pieces
            missing, looking almost like a jack-o-lantern's grin.

            Shotgun then looks back down at the boys below.  From behind
            them they hear their car alarm go off.

<b>                                PALMER
</b>                      Someone's screwing with the car!

            But from the other way come cops, in a plain wrap car, a hand
            reaching out and putting the spinning blue light on the roof. 
            No place to run.  No place to hide for the boys.  They reach
            for the door of the shuttered building -- and it opens!

<b>                                SHOTGUN
</b>                      Yo.  You two, get the hell away from
                      there!

            But they ignore him and disappear into the darkness inside
            the gaping maw of Bones' building.

            Shotgun shakes his head sitting back down, cradling his
            rifle.

<b>                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)
</b>                      Fools.

<b>	INT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Inside, the boys huddle in the darkness behind the door,
            waiting for the cops to pass.

            The boys look around the decayed Gothic interior lit only by
            the eerie glow of the sodium vapor lights outside.

            What we last saw as the ornate 70's luxury lobby in Bones'
            day, is now  a horror show.

            Walls torn and stained.  Mold grows in patches on the wall
            and ceiling.  Huge cobwebs hang.  The furniture's all broken.

            A gnawing tearing sound makes Palmer spin: a rat sticks its
            head up through the rotted cushions of the couch.

<b>                                PALMER
</b>                      Let's get the hell outta here.

            Jason shushes him as the room is filled with the flashing
            blue light of the cop car trawling slowly down the street.

            From inside they hear the sounds of a car door slamming and
            cop shoes walking.

<b>                                JASON
</b>                      Oh fuck, c'mon...

            He gropes his way in the darkness to a staircase.  Palmer is
            right behind him as they slip upstairs, deeper into the
            gaping darkness of the abandoned building.

            While below them the door opens and cop lights and cop voices
            penetrate the gloom.

<b>                                OLDER COP
</b>                      ...not going in there.  Waste o' time.

<b>                                YOUNGER COP
</b>                      I saw 'em go in.

            And from the boys' high vantage point up the stairs we see
            the first cop walk in with flashlight drawn.

<b>            WHILE INSIDE THE COP CAR - CLOSE ANGLE
</b>
            All we see are two meaty hands unwrapping a wax-paper covered
            pork chop sandwich.  The cop, face in shadow, brings the drip
            ping sandwich up over his huge belly towards his face.

<b>            INSIDE BONES' BUILDING
</b>
            The frat boys hold their breath while rats run across their
            feet.  Jason slamming his hand over Palmer's mouth to keep
            him from screaming.

<b>            DOWN BELOW
</b>
            The young plainsclothes cop steps deeper into the room, and
            shines his flashlight at the stairwell.

<b>            UPSTAIRS
</b>
            Jason pulls the reluctant Palmer further up the stairs, to
            the third floor as below them they hear the cop coming up.

            Jason pulls Palmer through the nearest door and into:

<b>            INT. JIMMY BONES' OLD PAD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The rotted remains of what was once Jimmy Bones' master
            bedroom.  The room he was betrayed and slaughtered in.

<b>            DOWNSTAIRS
</b>
            The cop begins to head up the stairs.  Visible behind him,
            down through the open front door, is the plain wrap car.  The
            older cop inside, mouth fulla sammich, loudly says:

<b>                                FAT OLDER COP
</b>                      Forget it!  No way they're in there. 
                      Trust me.  I've been working down here
                      twenty years.  No one goes in there.

<b>            FROM THE FAT OLDER COP'S POV
</b>
            We watch as the younger cop returns to the car, giving up. 
            And when he climbs in, we reverse and reveal who the older
            cop is: LUPOVICH, the cop who helped kill Bones.

            But he's decayed and expanded into a Hank Quinlan-like
            mountain of corrupt cop flesh.  Too many pork chop
            sandwiches.

<b>                                LUPOVICH
</b>                      Let's get the hell outta here.

<b>            INT. JIMMY'S OLD PAD - SAME
</b>
            From upstairs, the boys see the blue light of the cop car
            recede as the car pulls away down below.

            Palmer reaches for the door.  He wants out.  But in the
            darkness, he can't find the door.

<b>                                PALMER
</b>                      Gimme some light.

            Behind Jason we see a shape, a shadow, a tall silhouette, a
            man-shaped deeper darkness forming within the darkness.

            Jason lights his lighter.  And in the flickering we see
            behind him that this room now contains a portion of hell:

            It's not just the chipped paint and peeled rotted wall paper,
            or the cracks and gaps in the broken old ceiling mirror.

            All surfaces seem to be a swirling, shifting pattern in which
            we can dimly and subliminally make out faces as if people
            were trapped on the surface of things.  Exactly like the
            glimpse we had beneath the world when Jimmy died...

            The floor, the walls, the furniture, everything in it -- made
            out of the wracked and twisted devouring and devoured forms
            of dead souls.  Their faces, hollow pleading eyes and howling
            mouths visible like flowing grain in wood.

            And in the center of it all stands the dark silhouette of
            Bones, impossibly tall and thin, stretching malevolently out
            across the room like a living shadow.

            But the boys don't see this as they're finding the door.  We
            see Bones shadow arching towards them while they fumble.

            Palmer finally opens the door to the sound of a deep rumbling
            growl from the darkness on the other side.  And in the open
            door stands the black dog.

            They boys jump back.  But breathes easy.

<b>                                PALMER (CONT'D)
</b>                      Just a dog...

            And the black dog leaps up at them -- teeth flying right for
            the boys' throats.  And in the flickering ghastly light we
            see its demon face breaking through.

            The dog sinks his long teeth into Jason's arm.  He flails and
            drops his lighter, still lit, on the floor.

            As soon as he does, the dog releases Jason, and disappears as
            fast as it appeared, back into the darkness.

            The two kids panic, Jason shaking and bleeding, looking
            around, waiting for the dog or something else to attack,
            seeing back through the doorway into the room from hell.

            Behind them we see that tall man-shaped shadow.  The Bones
            shadow is oblivious to the two frantic boys, intent only on
            the small flickering flame of the lighter still burning where
            it fell against the lower wood paneling of the wall.

            A thin trail of black smoke as the flame barely begins to
            catch on the chipped lead-filled flammable paint.

<b>            THE BOYS RUN
</b>
            And stumble down the hall away from the horror, while back in
            the room the Bones-shadow watches as the lighter flickers and
            dies out.  Other than a slightly blackened spot, the wall is
            unburned.

            The black shadow shudders in rage, arches back and hooooowls
            in frustration, its mouth abnormally large.  The shadowy head
            snaps in the direction of the boys -- ready to vent it's
            wrath, and for a subliminal second we see in the head, the
            hellish face of Jimmy Bones.

            The boys round the second floor landing and fly down the last
            flight of stairs. 
            Jason's foot breaks through a rotted floorboard and for a
            second, it appears as though rotten hands are just below the
            stairs, grabbing at his foot and leg.

            He yelps in terror, pulling his foot back as they continue
            towards the front door, the Bones-thing's woofer-busting howl
            roaring down from the third floor.

<b>            THE SHEER INFINITE ADRENALINE RUSH
</b>
            Of pure horror and the desperation to survive drags the boys
            off the stairs as they tear across the floor and hurl
            themselves out the front door into the night air... Jason
            falling and lying on the stoop.

<b>            EXT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Across the street, Shotgun sees the boys in the doorway. 
            Then, as a nearly dead vapor light suddenly flickers and
            comes to life, the shadows created on Bones' building make it
            look almost like a demonic face.

            Gulping for air, laughing hysterically at their survival, the
            frat boys pause.  Jason sits back on his butt, checking his
            wound.  The doorway behind them just a black hole in space.

<b>                                PALMER
</b>                          (bumping fists together)
                      Damn, bro.  That was close!

<b>            THEN SUDDENLY
</b>
            Something - it happens so fast we're not sure just what grabs
            sucks-pulls Palmer back into the black doorway hole.

            Jason, still prone, tries to crawl away but whatever got his
            friend now sucks him in too.  His fingernails scraping along
            the stoop in frenzied desperation.

<b>            WITH SHOTGUN
</b>
            When he hears the boys pitiful screams and whimpers from
            across the street, he leaps to his feet and tries to see into
            the dark of the doorway across the street.  But he can only
            hear what is happening to the unlucky frat fellas:

            Moans and the sound of flesh torn, and swallowed, and their
            last dying screams.

<b>            UP AND DOWN THE BLOCK
</b>
            The screaming reverberates.  Faces appear in some windows. 
            While in others, shades are drawn and the lights go out...

<b>            BACK WITH SHOTGUN
</b>
            Mumbling to himself:

<b>                                SHOTGUN
</b>                      "For outside are dogs and sorcerers..."
                      Revelation 22, vs. 15.

            Tears welling in his eyes that he angrily flicks away.

<b>            LOOKING AT THE BUILDING
</b>
            It still has the shadowy look/shape of Jimmy Bones, now
            shifting again as the vapor light on the street sputters out
            again, plunging the street into near darkness.  The body of
            Palmer no longer visible below.

            When he looks back, the building seems just an old building
            again.  Then there's movement in an upper window, catching
            his eye.  Shotgun sees the tall, shadowy silhouette.

            The figure is elongated, can't tell if it is a man, or the
            distorted shadow of a man.  It beckons to Shotgun.

<b>            SHOTGUN
</b>
            Just tightens his grip on his rifle and speaks as if the
            shadowy thing across the street could hear him.

<b>                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)
</b>                      You still mad?  Still want me?  Come on
                      and get me.

<b>            THE SHADOW
</b>
            Shakes its head.  As if it can hear him.  And again mutely
            beckons to him.

<b>            ON SHOTGUN
</b>
<b>                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)
</b>                      Oh, right.  You can't.  You're trapped
                      there.  Well ain't that too bad.  Ain't
                      that just too damn bad.

<b>            EXT. SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN - 1979 - DAY

            In the ghetto.  A thriving street.  Shops and apartments. 
            Storefronts, newsstands.  Life in the hood.

            A sleek black Buick Electra 'deuce and a quarter' floats down
            the avenue, Curtis Mayfield-style...

<b>            INT. BUICK ELECTRA - DAY
</b>
            Behind the fur-covered steering wheel: SHOTGUN, a broke-nosed
            bodyguard for the man in the back seat:

            JIMMY BONES - 28.  His street.  His world.  Cool, handsome,
            respected.  Dressed very fly, but not excessive.  Long black
            coat, black silk shirt, and matching wide-brimmed hat.

            His left hand sports a big diamond ring while his right hand
            toys with a long silver razor, polished and oiled to
            perfection so that the long glinting blade can swing back and
            forth, or lock into position.

<b>            EXT. BLACKSTONE AVE. - DAY

            the block: they display a mixture of fear/love and respect.

            -- coolly taking down numbers in a notebook: soothing to the
            losers, encouraging to the wary, tough with the welchers.

            -- and handing out a rare win to an astonished old man

            building and the surroundings decay... And still the dark,
            skinny dog prowls the shadows.  Just one more reason we no
            longer see anyone walk the street at night.

            The 90's end --

            And Bones' building stands worn and naked with burnt-out lots
            on either side.  And the street feels like a ghost town.

            In the evil colored light of the gaseous street lights,
            Bones' own shadow stretches and distorts across all three

            the building and out in the ruins on either side, the black
            dog still walks.

<b>            INT. KRUSHED KLUB - NIGHT
</b>
            Two raging black screaming skulls engulfed in eye-scorching
            fluorescent green fire:

            The decals on the front panel of a Gemini Executioner, a hi
            tech mixer.  Four hands at the controls.  Throbbing, shifting
            twisted beats.  We're in a Northside dance club:

            Pull out to reveal BILL, 20, and MAURICE, aka Space Cowboy
            and Intergalactic Gangster of Love, 20.  The two boys DJ-ing. 
            They're accompanied by the crooning voice and dancing body of
            Bill's step-sister TIA, 29.  Bill's black.  Tia's white.  And
            Maurice is not of this earth.

            Bill's turntablizing: his hands dance between two competition
            style direct drive turntables tilted side by side, playing
            them like an instrument.

            While Maurice plays in and around and out of Bill's rhythm,
            with his 6 top-loaded computerized CD players, the boys hand
            the beat back and forth and up and down, building
            outrageously, till Maurice tips it over the top.

<b>                                MAURICE
</b>                      Goodness gracious grande bolas del fuego!

            The floor is jammed with underground dance scenesters,
            college students and spaced-out shoegazers tripping on
            Ketamine, dancing with their invisible friends.

            The bar's surrounded by a sea of hands waving money,
            demanding drinks.  Our boys are popular.  And the club is
            making a lot of green tonight.

            See someone checking out all the money, counting heads:
            PATRICK, 23, Bill's older brother.  The money man.

<b>            EXT. BACK ON THE SOUTH SIDE - NIGHT
</b>
            Stank and Weaze are cruising around in the frat boys BMW,
            laughing their asses off.

<b>            INT. THE KRUSHED KLUB - PRE-DAWN
</b>
            Live show's over.  And a chill mix tape plays while the boys
            pack their gear.  Across the club, Patrick's arguing with the
            club owner, MOE.  Just now handing Patrick a couple bills. 
            Patrick's not happy.

<b>            EXT. KRUSHED KLUB - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The guys and Tia stumble out with all their equipment,
            loading it and themselves into Patrick's over-sized SUV. 
            Patrick right behind them.  They gather around to split their
            fee.

<b>                                PATRICK

            Patrick hands Bill and Tia each a flyer:

            Patrick beckons them into the car.

<b>            EXT. BLACKSTONE - DAY
</b>
            Patrick pulls up to the abandoned lot next to Bones'
            building.  In broad daylight the building looks even
            stranger.  The lines don't matchup.  Weeds and broken glass,
            rusted autoparts, and empty abandoned shopping carts in
            tangled heaps like ruins in the lot beside the building.

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      Looks like a damn graveyard round here.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      I'm telling you, this neighborhood is

</b>                      Yeah.  But just where the hell has it
                      been?

            They step up to the front of the building.

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      Damn.  That is the ugliest building I
                      have ever seen.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something
                      about it just buzzes me.

<b>                                MAURICE
</b>                      That would be the after effects of that
                      Reticular inseminoid encounter you had.

            Patrick opens the door and steps inside.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Welcome to the Ill Zone.

<b>            INT. THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The darkness broken only by sunlight streaming through grimy
            windows reveals the decaying interior of the building.

            We can see now nothing's been moved since the late '70's. 
            Old furniture, carpets, pictures - late '70's Gothic.

<b>                                TIA

<b>                                MAURICE

                      Over there the bar, and in here -- the

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      Possible...maybe...could be.

            Patrick leads them to the stairwell going up and down around
            the old elevator cage/shaft.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      I got a great deal on it.  They couldn't
                      give this place away.  Just dead meat
                      stanking up their books for twenty years.

            They come to the elevator shaft, no elevator in sight.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      The last owner on the lease before the
                      bank was back in '79.  Some dude named
                      Jimmy Bones.  Empty ever since.

            Maurice looks down the elevator shaft and gets immediately
            dizzy, almost plunging to his doom - pulled back by Bill.

<b>                                MAURICE

</b>                      He was a local legend back in the '70's. 
                      There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal:
                      "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black
                      as night and hard as stone..."

<b>                                PATRICK

                      "...And this is Patrick on crack."

                      going downstairs and see if I can get the
                      furnace fired up.  Warm this place up,
                      you'll see.  It has serious potential.

            Mia, Bill and Maurice all climb the stairs as Maurice lights
            a joint with a little box of stick matches.

<b>                                BILL

                      Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. 
                      I can see it now.  The first major urban

                      Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely
                      from broken glass, hypodermic needles and

            Tia checks out the second floor while Bill and Maurice
            continue up the stairs to the third floor.  Bones' old crib.

<b>            WITH BILL AND MAURICE
</b>
            Behind them, barely subliminal glimpse - a manshaped darker
            shadow within a shadow.  Bill feels a cold wind from nowhere. 
            And hears a whispery sound seemingly carried in the breeze.

                      Something.  "Bury him" or...

</b>                      Take who where?  What you smokin'?

<b>            BELOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR
</b>
            Tia's checking out a bedroom.  Hears a light tinkling in a
            closet.  She opens it: empty except a row of rusty metal
            hangers, holding the moldy remains of Bones old suits.

<b>            DOWNSTAIRS IN THE BASEMENT - PATRICK
</b>
            Is there a flashlight, poking around.  Trying to find the
            metal knob to turn on the gas.  Eerie as hell down there.

            Out of the corner of our eyes we see a shadow moving,
            looming.  A scurrying sound and Patrick turns his flashlight
            in the other direction: we glimpse a bloated rat.

            Behind him, the shadow we glimpsed grows, elongates.  Patrick
            notes another door.  This one padlocked.  Sensing someone or
            something behind him, Patrick turns with the flashlight.

            Nothing there.  But the Bones-shadow is behind him again. 
            Again he feels something and again he turns the flashlight
            around: nothing.

            Except the Bones-shadow is again...behind him.

            Shaking it off, Patrick heads for the old heater, pulling out
            matches to light the pilot as Bones-shadow stays behind him.

<b>            BONES POV
</b>
            Bones watches as Patrick reaches around the gas heater.  When
            Patrick strikes a match head, the Bones-shadow moves even
            closer to him as Patrick reaches in and lights the pilot.

            When Patrick steps back, Bones-shadow grows and stretches,
            spreading like an ink stain, reaching across to where the
            pilot flame flickers.

            In profile, the shadow-mouth blows...but no breath comes out. 
            The flame doesn't even flicker.

            Bones tilts his head back and lets loose an eerie bellow of
            frustration in a subliminal flash we see a howling mouth,
            bigger than any human mouth, howling within the shadow-face.

            The sound echoes all through the basement rooms as Patrick
            walks back upstairs.  He slaps a nearby plumbing pipe.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Go on old pipes, groan all you like. 
                      Just please don't burst.  That I can't
                      afford.

<b>            FOLLOW WITH BONES POV
</b>
            As disappointed in whatever he hoped blowing out the furnace
            pilot would do, he steps into the rusted remains of the old
            elevator and the POV begins to levitate.

<b>            INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Bones' POV rises straight up as if still in a working
            elevator.  It rises and we follow up from the basement to the
            empty first floor, past the second floor to:

<b>            THE THIRD FLOOR
</b>
            Where we're still inside, floating in the elevator cage. 
            Then the POV moves through the metal bars and floats towards
            Bill, who's approaching the door of the room where Jimmy
            died.

            As Bill reaches to open it, Bones' POV floats closer - and
            closer - right up on Bill's back now.  Bill feeling the hairs
            on his neck suddenly rising.  Then he hears:

<b>                                HOLLOW ECHOES
</b>                      Go on.  It won't kill you.

            Bill turns around to check with Maurice.

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      You had to hear tha...

            But Maurice is gone.  And he doesn't see the shadow there
            behind him.  Bill leans in to the door, listening...

<b>                                HOLLOW ECHOES
</b>                      I ain't gonna be the only one with this
                      nigger's blood on my hands...

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      What the f--?

            A hand jolts him from behind.  He spins -- it's just Maurice.

<b>                                MAURICE
</b>                      'S up?

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be
                      buggin' from hanging with you.

            They turn to walk back down.  Maurice stops to re-light his
            joint when the Bones-shadow reaches out to grab his wrist.

            But it's no good.  The shadow hand passes right through,
            Maurice pauses for an instant as if he felt something.

            Maurice lights his roach, and the match burns closer and
            closer to his fingertips.  Then singes them and he drops the
            match.  Maurice then heads downstairs after Bill.

            The shadow remains behind, staring at the still burning match
            on the wooden floor.  He bends down, staring intently as if
            willing it to burn, his hands urging it on, the flame
            suddenly rising.  But then the match sputters harmlessly out. 
            The shadow turns back towards the boys downstairs.

<b>            WHILE ON THE SECOND FLOOR
</b>
            Tia explores the rest of the floor.  Hears a sound, like a
            whimpering, from behind another door.

            She slowly eases open the door then jumps back -- Inside, the
            dog.  It growls low and mean, the black fur on the back of
            it's neck rising.  It's eyes burning too red and bright.

            Tia freezes.

            The dog growls deeply at her.  And as he does we see the
            Bones shadow rising behind her.  It seems to lean in and over
            her, and the dog stops growling.

            Tia cautiously holds her hand outstretched with the burger
            for the dog to smell.

            Bones' shadow from lingers behind her, perhaps simply
            enjoying the first sight in hellish eons of a beautiful girl.

                      how long?  Poor baby...

            The dog leaps up - but not to rip her throat out.  Instead it
            snatches the burger and wolfs it down in one gulp.

</b><b>			EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE BLOCK - TIME CUT
</b>
            Bones is back in the car.  Shotgun rolling on down the street
            and round the corner.

            Bones sees a young black man leaning into the window of a
            police car.  It's JEREMIAH PEET, Bones' right-hand man,
            trying to do business.  And make sure his three year old son
            keeps from running into the street.  The cop in the car
            eating a sloppy sauce-drippin' pork chop sandwich, watches.

            Jeremiah speaking low and rapid to the cop who says nothing,
            just wipes his greasy lips on a handkerchief.

            Then Shotgun hits the car horn, which plays a James Brown
            style trumpet riff.  Jeremiah steps over to Jimmy's car.

<b>                                CLA
</b>                      I only met with the broker.  The
                      structure was listed almost worthless and
                      had never even had a bid, I thought you'd
                      be pleased to see it sold to someone who
                      wants to improve the neighborhood. 
                      Anything wrong?

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      No, of course not.  Good work.  Thanks a
                      lot.

            She leaves.  Lupovich is still holding the picture of
            Jeremiah's wife.

</b>                      You're right.  One of my associates sold
                      the building last month.

</b>                      Look, even if anyone found anything
                      there, it's twenty years ago.  They could
                      never connect it to us.

</b>                      You better hope not.  Cause it's like
                      they say, four can keep a secret, if
                      three are dead.

            Jeremiah advancing on Lupovich, who chuckles and walks out.

                      of there.  Just be glad I did and you can
                      start life from here instead of down

</b>                      But maybe we're the ones who should be
                      down there.  Doing something.  Making it
                      better.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      Can't be done.  That place already died
                      and gone to hell.

            Patrick's on a ladder replacing glass in the upper windows. 
            From down the block, we see Cinnabar heading out of her
            mother's house, holding her portfolio.  The corners of papers
            sticking out, splashes of color visible.

            Patrick sees Cinnabar about to walk beneath his ladder.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Careful.  That's bad luck.

</b>                      No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma
                      says.

<b>                                PATRICK

                      she is a lot of things, not all of them
                      nice, but crazy Momma's not.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Way I figure, everything our parents tell
                      us is part true and part total B.S.  And
                      our whole job is figuring out for
                      ourselves which is which.

<b>                                CINNABAR

                      Every street, two streets.  There's a
                      whole city, a whole world, kinda beside,
                      on top, just below this one.  The city of
                      the dead.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Like right now, there's actually like
                      hordes of dead people shambling around
                      us?  Fingers rotting off?

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a
                      fabric that kinda keeps things separate.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Lucky thing.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      Yeah.  But when something bad happens,
                      something really bad -- the wall breaks. 
                      The fabric tears.

<b>                                PATRICK

<b>                                PATRICK

                      yards of your door.

            She sees her bus pulling up at the corner and runs for it,
            leaving only her smile with Patrick.

            She passes Maurice and Bill, pulling up.  Bill has to pull
            Maurice's dog like attention away from the way Cinnabar's
            bottom moves as she walks down the street to focus at the
            matter at hand: unloading their shitload of equipment.

            Maurice and Bill carrying speakers and racks and lights and
            turntables while Shotgun, in his lawn chair across the
            street, glares at them.

            After the last equipment is loaded, they lock the car. 
            Shotgun still watching.  Bill pulls out a six pack of beer. 
            He offers one to Shotgun who, after a beat, accepts it.

            Maurice surreptitiously turns on his small hi-7 camera. 
            Holding it under his arm, but it's on.

                      never turned his back for a brother.

                      Bones was awrright.  He was solid.  And
                      then one day, he just wasn't around no
                      more.  Don't pay to ask too many
                      questions 'round here.

<b>            INT. THE BUILDING - THAT NIGHT
</b>
            Upstairs, inside what was once Bones' bedroom.  Beneath the
            cracked ceiling mirror, Bill lies on the airmattress.  He's
            listening with headphones to a minidisk player.

            Eyes closed, head nodding to the beat.  Around him, we see
            something strange.  The room shifts.

            It's the same room.  But changed.  It looks like it did when
            the frat boys were trapped in here.  Or in the instant after
            Jimmy's death: all surfaces seem to be a swirling, shifting
            pattern in which we can dimly make out faces, as if people
            were trapped on the surface of things.

            Then the faces and bodies begin to step out of their surfaces
            and into the room.  

            So as Bill, eyes still closed, rocks to the hypnotic beats in
            his headphones, we see the room around him begin to fill with
            figures.

            -- all twisted dead human forms emerging out of the surfaces
            of floor and walls.  We hear a low murmur of ghost voices,
            different languages.

            And as the track ends, the sound cuts through Bill's
            headphones and his eyes snap open.

            But the room is empty.  And completely normal.  Bill pulls
            off his head phones.  Ears strain to listen.

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      Tia?  Patrick?  That you?

            The sounds return, fainter, and form above.  Bill looks up,
            and for a fraction of a second in the mirror, Bill sees the
            crowded eerie hell of the other version of the room.

            Bill jolts out of bed and to the door, whips it open, and
            someone dark looms right there.  But it's just Patrick.

<b>                                BILL (CONT'D)
</b>                      Shit.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Spooked?

            Bill looks back into the room, normal now.  Glances up at the
            mirror, just a cracked reflection of the empty room.

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.

            He stops.  Both brothers look at each other, waiting for the
            other to admit he's seen or felt something's here.

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      Where's the others?

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
<b>					  
</b><b>			INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The bathroom is entirely wood lined, like some '70's hot tub
            paradise.  The room dominated by a large two person tub.

            Tia lights four small scented candles on the counter.  The
            wind through the open window blows the curtains.  She shuts
            the window and then steps gingerly into the steaming bathtub.

            She lies down in the bath, with her back to the door.  The
            four candles throwing varying shadows of her.

            Then one of the shadows becomes...the shadow of Bones.  All
            it's attention is focused on one lit candle.  The one closest
            to the curtain.

            Slowly the Bones' shadow's fingers start to caress the
            curtain to make it move, ever so slowly, closer and closer to
            the candle.  The drapery reaches out, straining, straining
            towards the candle flame.

            Tia soaks with her eyes closed, enjoying the moist heat.

            Bones' shadow fingers more and more urgently drawing the
            flame towards the curtain, the curtain towards the flame. 
            And soon the corner of the drape just reaches the little
            flickering flame.  And in an instant the drape is on fire.

<b>            INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Patrick and Bill still talking in front of the bedroom, down
            the hall from the bathroom.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      ...we just been in the damn suburbs too
                      long.

            Their conversation interrupted by screams from down the
            hall... from the bathroom!

<b>            INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The drapes are fully ablaze now, flames lick at the wooden
            walls.  Tia leaps out of the tub, screaming, trying to throw
            bathwater at the burning drapes.

            Patrick and Bill crash through the door.  Patrick rips the
            drapes from the wall and throws them into the bathtub.

<b>            INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

            Tia shivers in her bathrobe.  Bill and Patrick with her.

<b>            INT. BUILDING - DAY

            Ladders, drop-cloths and the beginnings of new paint on the
            old torn walls.  They're all eating take out burgers.

            Outside, angle on Bones' building down the block.

<b>            CLOSER
</b>
            To the building - we can hear sounds coming from inside the
            house.  Like dim drums, some kind of rhythm.

            Where the dog eats and eats...

<b>            EXT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Standing now right in front of it we hear a rhythmic
            cacophony from inside, growing louder as the dog eats and we:

<b>            INT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The sound is deafening.  It's the sound of every door in the
            empty house swinging maniacally on its hinges.  Beating the
            air like wings.  Opening and slamming shut again and again.

            Every door except ONE DOOR.  The padlocked door to the sub
            basement.

<b>            EXT. PEARL'S STOREFRONT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Some older folks, one very old man with a cane, two old black
            women, arms linked.  A middle-aged husband and wife.  All
            enter.

            Dim light.  Cloth covered table.  Everything set for a

            Cinnabar, as far too often, not understanding much of what
            her mother says to her.

</b><b>			INT. PEARL'S STOREFRONT - NIGHT
</b>
            Pearl reaches into an old bureau drawer and pulls out an old
            photo: Jimmy Bones with his arm around her.  She sits down at
            her table with a drink and just looks at the picture of
            herself and her lover when the world was innocent and young. 
            She downs her glass and wipes her tears away.

<b>            OUTSIDE - DOWN THE BLOCK
</b>
            In the upper window of the Bones Building we see his
            silhouette, staring down the block towards Pearl.

<b>            INT. JEREMIAH'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Bones the dog slinks into the kitchen.  Sniffing the air. 
            Still hungry.  Always hungry.

            His big black paw actually opens the refrigerator.  With his
            long nose he digs into the meat drawer.  Inside he finds
            plastic wrapped raw hamburger meat.

            He pulls it out and drops it on the floor.  Tears it open and
            gorges himself on the raw meat.

<b>            EXT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The house looms malevolently in the moonlight.

<b>            INT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Bones' POV again in his rusted elevator cage.  The POV floats
            down through the house into the basement.

<b>            BASEMENT
</b>
            Bones' POV looks at the padlocked door.  Then passes right
            through it.

<b>            INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            In the deeper darkness of the dirt cellar we see the Bones
            shadow hovering over a slight mound in the dirt.

<b>            INT. JEREMIAH'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The black dog wolfs down the last of the hamburger meat.

<b>            INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            And as he does, the ground seems almost to breathe, or glow. 
            Bones plunges his long shadow-hands right into the earth as
            if he could touch what was beneath and raise it up.

            He remains like that, shadow hands buried in the dirt, head
            tilting back and howling.

<b>            EXT. OUT ON THE STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Shotgun up in his window, still, holding his gun.  Hears the
            howling.  He looks around, expecting to see his nemesis, the
            black dog.  But only darkness.

<b>            EXT. JEREMIAH'S GATED COMMUNITY - NIGHT
</b>
            Jeremiah's mansion stands in the moonlight.  Its faux
            Gerogian splendor in stark contrast to Bones' building in the
            old neighborhood.

<b>            INT. PEET HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The house is dark and quiet.  All are asleep.  The dog moves
            silently through the house sniffing at doors.

<b>            INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The dog silently noses the door open and stealthily enters
            and pads softly over to Jeremiah's side of the bed.

            Where it stares intently at the sleeping Jeremiah, who begins
            to toss and turn.  He settles again on his back.  His head
            tilted back, his soft, vulnerable throat exposed.

            The dog steps closer to the bed.  We can almost feel the
            dog's hot fetid breath inches away from his throat.

            The dog stares at Jeremiah.  And for just a second the long
            doggy face wavers and changes: in shifting shades of black, a
            ragged red demonic face ripples beneath the black fur -- and
            looks for an instant as if it were about to lunge and rip out
            Jeremiah's throat!

            But at the last second it freezes.  Head cocks and ear lifts
            as if hearing something in the wind.  Its master's voice,
            perhaps.  And then the dog reverts to normal and pads out of
            the room as silently as it entered.

<b>	EXT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Cinnabar stops outside the building.  She's about to knock
            when she instinctively freezes.  We can almost see the hairs
            standing up on her neck one by one.

            She looks around -- what is it?  A sound, like a moan.  Is it
            her name?  Or just the wind.

            Suddenly, with a creak, the door swings open.

            She takes a hesitant step into the building.  Suddenly she
            jumps, as a door to her left flies open.

            It's just Patrick.  She laughs in relief.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      Just thought I'd see if you needed any
                      help.

            Patrick too surprised and tongue-tied to respond, so Tia
            helps him out.

<b>                                TIA
</b>                      Good.  We do need help.  First you can
                      help us eat lunch.

            Cinnabar follows Patrick into the room, with a last tense
            look over her shoulder -- still the feeling something's
            there.

<b>            INT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Tia's feeding the insatiable dog.  Handing quarter-pounders
            to it, the thing scarfing 'em as fast as she can unwrap them. 
            Then, for a second, it stops.  And looks up.  And just stares
            at something it knows is there -- but we humans can't see.

<b>                                TIA
</b>                      Watcha looking at, poochie?

            Cinnabar follows the dog's glance.  She sees nothing...or is
            there something for a second there in the corner?

<b>            REVERSE - BONES-VISION POV
</b>
            Is staring back at her, and at the dog.  Cinnabar pulls her
            sweater around her shoulders.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      I hate it when dogs do that.  Like
                      they're looking right out of the world.

            The dog continues scarfing down burgers, having him his way. 
            Cinnabar looks warily at the beast.  Who stares right back at
            her while wolfing down the burgers.

<b>            BONES-VISION/POV
</b>
            Steps through the rusted metal into the old elevator shaft
            and we follow it as it floats down.

<b>            INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            As the dog above eats we again see Bones' shadow form looming
            over the seeing dirt, the dirt moving ever so subtly, and for
            a subliminal second the dirt seems to be glowing.

<b>            INT. THE BUILDING - LATER
</b>
            They're all painting.  Maurice spins some tunes to accompany
            them.  It's a funky Tom Sawyer paint party.  The kids defer
            to Cinnabar, who's got a wild pallette, and a wild brush. 
            The place is coming alive with color.

<b>            INT. BONES' BUILDING - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
            In Bones' old room, Patrick rolls over the faded stained old
            shag carpet with a huge carpet cleaner.

<b>            ANGLE ON
</b>
            The transparent tubes of the cleaner fill with disgusting red
            fluid and carpet fibers.

<b>                                                            TIME CUT TO:
</b>
            Patrick stands back and surveys his work.  The carpet looks
            perfect.  Old, a little faded, but clean.  No stains. 

            With a smile of satisfaction he rolls the cleaner out of the
            room and closes the door behind him.  We remain in the room.

<b>            ANGLE ON
</b>
            The now clean carpet.  Suddenly we see glutinous red liquid
            seeping back up through the shag, until the stain is right
            where it was.  Wet and fresh.  Then we see it spread and
            move, in the shape of a body and the path by which it was
            dragged out of the room.

            The door opens again, and Patrick steps in to show off the
            freshly painted room clean rug to Cinnabar and the others. 
            He's brought up short by the sight of the stain.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Must be something seeping through.  From
                      the floor.

            They roll the carpet back, thinking there must be something
            on the floor.  The floor beneath the carpet is wet too, but
            can't tell if it's from the rug or vice-versa.

            He puts his hand down on the wood.  A low rhythmic rumbling.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Do you feel that?

            The others place their hands on the floor.

</b>                      Maybe there's a pipe underneath the
                      floor.  It leaked and stained.

            They just look at him.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      You got a better explanation

<b>            INT. BASEMENT - LATER
</b>
            Patrick and the others in the basement listening to some very
            strange sounds: groans, thumps, throbs.

<b>                                MAURICE
</b>                      Sounds like we got the Invisible Scratch
                      Piklz hiding in our pipes.

            Patrick traces the piping with the wrench, he comes to a
            triple corner, where three small pipes all come together.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      I think these bring the water down from
                      the bathroom.  Into this...

            A larger pipe that goes down the wall and disappears beneath
            the floor.  The thumping sounds emanate from here.  He puts
            his finger along the seam of the joint.  He pulls it away,
            red.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Check it out.  The same shit that was in
                      the carpet.  Told you it was from the
                      plumbing.

            He lifts the wrench to tighten the seal.  The metal groans. 
            Then snaps.  Sending a thick spray of foul smelling red
            sludge shooting out of the seam, right into Patrick's face.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Damn, I knew these pipes were wacked.

            He turns the wrench the other way, re-tightening.  The sound
            seems to move now through the piping.  Then the red sludge
            sprays out of the next three joints, smearing the others.

            The pounding, throbbing sounds begin to bounce around the
            room, as if something were actually moving through the pipes
            until it returns to the central large pipe and moves down,
            disappearing beneath their feet.

            Then a rasping bark calls their attention.  Bones the dog
            sits by the padlocked door, panting.  Grinning.

            Patrick smashes the old lock with the large wrench and opens
            the door to reveal another set of stairs leading down into a
            deeper storm cellar where the sound disappeared.

<b>            INT. STORM CELLAR STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            As they go, the temperature drops.  A cold, damp sheen
            appears on their skin.  Then comes a thick glutinous buzzing
            sound.

<b>                                TIA
</b>                      What is that?

            Flies.  The stairway walls are thick with furry black flies.

</b>                      Some flies?  I think this qualifies as

</b>                      Hey, what you expect?  Where there's
                      smoke there's fire.  And where there's
                      flies, there's shit.

            The stairs end in a dark, damp dirt cellar and the remnants
            of the terminus of the old elevator shaft.

<b>                                MAURICE (CONT'D)
</b>                      Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space
                      that was so perfect for a recording

</b>                      Yeah, well, Maurice is right.  It's gonna
                      take more work than I thought.  But we
                      can still do it.  We'll lay a real floor
                      in here.  Put damping on the walls. 
                      Totally controlled sound.  Be perfect. 
                      No one could hear shit up on the street.

            Behind them the dog is digging in the dirt.  Furiously.

<b>                                MAURICE

                      make our first record where no one can
                      hear us scream.  Be afraid.

            They're not paying any attention to the dog's incessant
            digging.  Only Cinnabar is.  She's staring at it.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      Oh god...

            And she sees, in the deepening muddy hole at the dog's paws,
            at first glimpses and then the full view, a rotted human
            corpse.  Really just a skeleton.  With something sticking out
            of its chest.  Cinnabar shrieks, while the guys try very hard
            to act real cool.

                      there's the diamond.  Don't know where
                      the deuce is parked.

            He points to one of the bony hands.  The left one.  On the
            third finger is Jimmy's big diamond ring.

<b>                                BILL

            And he's right.  Oddly for an old skeleton, there are strands
            and bands of wet, raw flesh.  Maurice lifts the hand wearing
            the ring.  He starts top pull it loose from the finger.

<b>                                TIA

</b>                      Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself
                      in the chest, then buried himself too.

            Cinnabar sees something.  Bright color beneath the body. 
            Bends down to a piece of cloth poking out from beneath the
            bones.

            The dog growls viciously as she reaches down to the scrap of
            color poking up.  Tia restrains the hound the best she can.

            The cloth is the corner of a dress...the dog suddenly lunges
            for Cinnabar's hands, ripping at them.  She pulls back.

</b>                      Yeah, we can.  Least till after this
                      weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll

                      here.

            They all start to leave except Maurice and Cinnabar.  He's
            loitering by the body, eyeing the ring.  She's staring into
            the dark corner of the sub-basement.

<b>            HER POV IN THE DIM LIGHT
</b>
            She sees something wavering, a shadow-mirage, Bones.

<b>                                PATRICK (O.S.)
</b>                      Cinn?

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.

            She follows the others upstairs.  Bones watches her form as
            she climbs the steps, and --

            -- for a second from BONES POV we see her mother, when she
            was young.

            Bones looks now at Maurice.  Who checks to see if the others
            are gone.  Then Maurice hurriedly bends down, and while
            holding his face back away from the stench attempts to pull
            Bones' ring off his finger.  But it's stuck.

            He tugs again, harder, and rips the corpse's finger off.

<b>                                MAURICE
</b>                      Oh fuck.

            Oh fuck is right.  Bones' shadow rears as it sees this
            desecration.  Maurice slips the ring off the finger stump.

<b>                                MAURICE (CONT'D)
</b>                          (to the corpse)
                      Sorry, but you wont' be needing this.

            He places the finger back by the hand.  And pockets the ring.

<b>                                MAURICE (CONT'D)

            The lock broken, the door stands ajar.  And as the dog gorges
            upstairs, something very strange is happening down here.

            Flesh is growing on the bones.  Bit by bit, red, wet strips
            of muscle and flesh appear and spread over the corpse.

            The shadow looks down at his semi-reconstituted corpse.  It
            almost looks like him, minus the skin.  But it still has a
            long ways to go.  Still, mere strips of muscle and flesh on
            the skeleton.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      He probably thinks he's saving you from
                      something.  I'm sure that's what my

                      But then do I gotta worry 'bout your
                      father?

            Suddenly their banter is dead.  Her face looks stung, like
            he'd slapped her.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      I don't know anything about my father.  I

            In Bones' old room, the temperature between Cinn and Patrick
            goes from PG to R.

            The two kiss passionately, deeply -- Cinnabar loses herself
            for a long beat -- then as if swimming up from the bottom of
            a deep pool, she pulls herself back.

<b>            INT. PEARL'S PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

            We float around the members of Pearl's circle.  See objects

            Still singing, they all glance about them in darkness as if
            they can make out the spirits around them.

            Over the low bass of their hymn-singing, her voice cuts in. 
            Uncoiling and rising like smoke in the air: it's a beautiful
            voice and it does seem to open a window in the air.

<b>            INT. BONES' ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Cinnabar gets into bed and turns off the light.  Pitch dark
            in there, can't see a thing.

            As she's drifting off to dreamland, she hears what sounds
            like the door quietly opening and someone slipping into the
            darkness of the room, we just stay on her face. 

            It's cold in the place.  And spooky.  So she doesn't mind
            when she feels what she assumes is Patrick slip in bed beside
            her.  Though we see only a shape sliding under the covers.

                      It's okay, just don't get funny on me. 
                      It's warmer this way.

<b>            INT. PEARL'S PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

            Suddenly, the curtains fly open.  And Pearl's voice suddenly
            stops... and the flame on the candle shoots up, scorching the
            ceiling before returning to normal.

<b>                                PEARL

            The flowers whither.  They retch from some smell.

                      message?

            Table rocks once.

<b>                                PEARL (CONT'D)

</b>                      Is it for miss Lillian?

            Table rocks twice -- "no."

</b>                      Is it a message for Mr. Abernathy?

            Table rocks twice -- "No" again.  She goes around the room,
            inquiring for each of them.  Each time the table says "No." 
            Until there is only her left.  An eerie pause.

<b>                                PEARL (CONT'D)
</b>                      Is the message for me?

            The table starts bucking wildly.  And suddenly Pearl's neck
            SNAPS back like it's been caught in a whip.

            Her mouth opens and a low moan escapes.  But sounds nothing
            like her voice.  A deep wind through an organ tube with
            swarming bees and squealing hogs mixed in.

            Everyone around the table just stares at her in alarm.

            As her eyes widen.  Go super close on her eyes and we see a
            reflection in her pupil, not of the room she is in, but the
            Jimmy's building twenty years ago.

<b>            INT. BONES' BUILDING - PAST/PRESENT
</b>
            INTERCUT with her face back in the seance staring wide
            mouthed in her trance.

            The sound of her heart pounds like the deepest dub track.

            Total dislocation for her as she sees Jimmy's old room, as it
            was -- but also sees it as it is now, and with her daughter,
            Cinnabar, lying underneath the covers of the big, round bed.

            And lying close beside her, another figure beneath the
            covers.

            Whoever is there snuggles closer to Cinnabar.  She responds
            as he presses against her, then wakes up.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                          (laughing low)
                      Cut it out.

            But he doesn't.  The movement beside her is undulant. 
            Strong, erotic, she almost gives into it.  And still laughs
            as she says:

<b>                                CINNABAR (CONT'D)
</b>                      No, no Patrick.  Stop.

            The figure in the bed presses urgently against her, in a
            rocking movement which catches her up in it.  She can't help
            it, she begins to respond to the urging behind her.

            Pearl's eyes widen as the whole room shifts and becomes one
            fetid Necropoliptic texture.  The bed retains its shape but
            liquefies, seems to become one with the floor and the walls,
            all made of a kind of thick, bloody-mud in which the trapped
            faces and distorted limbs of the dead twist and moan.

            Meanwhile, on that strange bed, the figure behind Cinnabar
            seems to wrap soft limbs around her, locking her in embrace.

<b>                                CINNABAR (CONT'D)
</b>                      Cut it out.

            But it doesn't cut out.  It builds.  Strong.  Erotic. 
            Insistent.  She almost gives in to it.

<b>                                CINNABAR (CONT'D)
</b>                      No, no Patrick.  Stop.

            But the movement is more insistent.  And rougher.  She starts
            to protest louder when she feels a hand, or something, steal
            across her mouth to muffle her objections.

            Pearl tires to reach across her vision to grab her daughter
            and help her, but she can't.

<b>            INT. PEARL'S PARLOR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Back at the seance, Pearl's back is arched like a bass fiddle
            string bowed, and then drops.  Released.  Back in her chair.

            The instant she's returned to herself she's out of her chair
            and out the door.

<b>            INT. BONES' PAD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Cinnabar struggles with something in the bed, the covers
            pulled tight against her face, she can't scream.  She twists
            and wrenches herself about, finally striking behind her with
            a flailing fist, twists her face free and screams:

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      Patrick!  Stop!!

            Across the room the door suddenly opens -- it's Patrick.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      What's wrong?

<b>            ANGLE - AT PATRICK'S FEET
</b>
            The black silhouette of the DOG slips out the door.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Are you alright?

            Cinnabar looks wildly around the room -- she's alone in the
            big bed.  No one attacking her.  And she sees Patrick in the
            doorway.  But then who - or what - was in the bed?

            Suddenly, her mother yells from below.

<b>                                PEARL (O.S.)
</b>                      Cinnabar!!!

            Cinnabar lurches out of the bed over to the window.  Down
            below, her mother's going nuts at the entrance, pounding on
            the door and practically running over Bill who's opening the
            door.

<b>                                PEARL (CONT'D)
</b>                      Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm

</b>                      Why don't you hang on and I'll see if
                      she's here.

<b>            INT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Cinnabar races down the stairs with Patrick, bewildered at
            her heels.

            Cinnabar runs out the door and straight into her mother's
            arms, burying her face in the protective bosom of her mom.

            Pearl wraps her frightened daughter in her arms and turns her
            to home.  Pearl looks up at the boys standing stunned in the
            doorway.

<b>                                PEARL
</b>                      You might as well just dig down six feet

                      house.

            She turns back towards her place, still holding the sobbing
            Cinnabar.  Bill and Patrick stand stunned in the doorway.

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      You sure got a way with women, bro.  What

<b>                                PATRICK

<b>            EXT. BLACKSTONE - DAY
</b>
            Up on a ladder, the boys put on the finishing touches and
            then HANG a new NEON SIGN over the door.  Looks pretty cool.

<b>                                TIA

<b>			INT. JEREMIAH'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

            Heading south on Lake Shore Drive, a tensely smiling Patrick
            in the front seat with Jeremiah.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      Where are we going?  You know I hate

</b>                      A little business move I made.  On my
                      own.  I think you're gonna approve.

<b>            EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Heading off the main road into the ghetto.  But as they head
            further and further south, Jeremiah's getting uneasy.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      What are we doing down here?

</b>                      Like you always said, Pop, look for the
                      undervalued.

            Now they are on the old street.  As they drive down the
            street, Jeremiah's getting more and more agitated.

<b>            EXT. BLACKSTONE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            They park and get out.  He looks up and down the street,
            oddly frightened.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      I bet you didn't even know your bank
                      owned the place.  I did it through a
                      broker so you wouldn't know it was me. 
                      I couldn't wait to see your face when I
                      fixed it up.

            It's the building.  Freshly painted, with the neon sign.  But
            Jeremiah's face shows nothing like what Patrick expected. 
            Nothing but a horrified, angry disgust.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      Is this some kind of sick joke?

            Jeremiah's so angry he almost smacks Patrick.

<b>                                JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
</b>                      Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my
                      life to get out of this neighborhood for
                      you to move right back in!

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying
                      to do what you did.  Take nothing and
                      make something out of it.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. 
                      Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. 
                      I'll take care of it.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      You'll take care of it?  Not this time. 
                      No way.  I bought it fair and square. 
                      And we open tonight.

<b>                                JEREMIAH

                      back!  That's an order!

            Jeremiah is furious out of all proportions.  Some of the
            others on the block have stuck their noses out to see what
            the fuss is.  Then Jeremiah comes eye to eye with Pearl,
            standing across the street, watching, worried out of her
            mind.
<b>			
</b>			Then he looks up and sees Shotgun in the window.  Feeling
            trapped, humiliated.  He wants out of this street.  Out of
            those glances.

<b>                                JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
</b>                      You all are coming back to the house,
                      now!

            Nobody moves.  Jeremiah walks back to his car and pulls away. 
            Patrick, frozen, turned to stone by rage and hurt and shame.

            Another car pulls up.  Several young people inside.  They
            look around a little dubiously.

<b>                                CLUBBER

                      where Illibent is?

            They all look at each other.  Silent.  Until Maurice answers
            by flipping a switch igniting the neon sign for the first
            time.  

            Illibent shines in brilliant blue gas letters.

            The deuce and a quarter stops in front of a storefront.  A
            young Nefertiti in platforms and dashiki picks fresh fruit
            and vegetables from the small grocery.  PEARL VAUGHN.

            Pearl's picking ripe fruit.  Jimmy steps in, catches her
            hands, and the melon in them, in his hands.

            in to her.

            ride up with him, the king in his castle.

            The elevator lets him out in his main room.  A '70's love
            pit.  Mirrored ceiling, circular bed.  Thick shag carpeting.

            Jimmy nods at Shotgun, who lowers the needle into classic
            vinyl groove of some prime Funkadelic ("Nappy Dug-out").

            Jimmy splashes cologne on his face and looks contentedly out
            the window at all his people, at his kingdom below...

<b>            EXT. BONES' BUILDING - LATER - DAY
</b>
            The cop we saw with Jeremiah, LUPOVICH, and the wannabe
            player EDDIE MACK (wearing an old Superfly suit, and sleek
            black driving gloves) pull up in front of the old stone
            building.

<b>            INT. BONES' PAD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Shotgun mixes drinks at the bar and hands them to the just
            arrived guests, Jeremiah, Officer Lupovich - looking stiff in
            plain clothes - and Eddie Mack in his purple suit.

</b>                      And Officer Lupovich.

            Bones says nothing.  Just nods at the cop.

<b>                                MACK
</b>                      You got a nice crib here.

<b>                                MACK
</b>                      But things change.  You gotta think
                      ahead.

<b>                                LUPOVICH

                      Coming here too, maybe next year.

            Bones' look sez: Bitch, don't call me that again.

</b>                      Besides, there's more money to be made in
                      the gin than the juice.  What do anybody
                      want with numbers anyway?

<b>                                BONES

<b>                                MACK
</b>                      It ain't the money - it's the high.  The
                      big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way
                      more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So
                      you never have to pay out.

</b>                      Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm
                      talking about a five-dollar kick in the
                      head that's a quick ticket to heaven. 
                      And the fools keep coming back for more.

<b>                                BONES

            Eddie pulls a little rock of crack out.  Jimmy takes it in
            his hand and sniffs it.  Then shrugs and hands it back.

<b>                                BONES

</b>                      That's cool.  Totally wide-screen sci-fi. 
                      Forward thinking.  I respect that.  But
                      that ain't my life.  I'm here and now. 
                      Comfortable as a bed bug on a cold night
                      in a warm nappy dugout.  I'm maintaining. 
                      That's what it's about for me.  And your
                      twelve and a half-minutes is up.

            Jimmy just walks away from him.  Meeting over.  Eddie and
            Lupovich and Jeremiah all look at each other, frustrated.

<b>                                MACK

                      into it.  Gonna skip the money train and
                      take the bus.  His loss.

            Lupovich turns but then spins back around with a .45 in his
            hand and it's pointed at Jimmy's forehead.  Jeremiah didn't
            expect this - or did he?

<b>                                JEREMIAH

</b>                      I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't
                      need any partners.  I don't need new

</b>                      Just try it, Jimmy.  That's all...

            He hands him the rock.  And a little pipe.

<b>                                LUPOVICH
</b>                      You heard the man.  Try it.

            Bones keeps his eye on him as he lights the lighter and takes
            a deep puff.  Then lets out a deep cloud of smoke.

            His eyes go a bit glazed.  And from his POV we see the room
            start to tilt on its axis as everything goes wobbly.

            Just then, the door opens and Pearl steps in, distracting
            Lupovich for an instant.

            In one eternal crack fueled fast-and-slo-mo second: Jimmy
            sees his chance, he pulls his razor, but too slow --

            Lupovich turns, the razor no more than lightly slices his
            arm, and he pulls the trigger on Jimmy Bones...

            Pumping three shots into Jimmy's abdomen, knocking him to the
            ground.  Shotgun grabs his gun, but too late.  He's covered.

<b>                                MACK

                      And kick it here.

            Pearl in screaming shock.  Her lover bleeding on the carpet.

<b>                                LUPOVICH
</b>                      Tell her to stop screaming.

            Bones is bleeding, and still tripping bad.

<b>                                LUPOVICH (CONT'D)
</b>                      I said stop that bitch screaming or I'll
                      spread her like butter.

            Shotgun gently puts his hand on Pearl's mouth to quiet her.  

<b>            BACK IN BONES' FUCKED-UP POV:
</b>
            Looking down he sees his own blood pouring out, a thick
            divine river of many colors.  Looking up, they all stand
            wavering above him, hungry demons, their voices distorting.

<b>                                LUPOVICH (CONT'D)
</b>                      Get his razor.  I ain't gonna be the only
                      one with this nigger's blood on my hands.

            Mack plucks Bone's silver razor right out of his hands.

<b>                                LUPOVICH (CONT'D)
</b>                      Take the gloves off.  Everybody leaves a
                      print.  We hang out together.  Or we hang
                      separately.  Cut him.  And cut him good.

            Eddie pulls his glove off and enjoys himself as he shoves the
            razor into Jimmy.

<b>                                MACK
</b>                      What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.

<b>                                LUPOVICH
</b>                      Now you.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      No way man...

</b>                      You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your
                      choice.

            Jeremiah gets down near Bones.  Bones stares right into his
            eyes, as his life blood pours freely, weakly lifts his arm to
            his best friend's face.

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      Jay bird...help me...like brothers.

            Jeremiah feels Lupovich's gun behind his head.  Hears it
            cocked.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      Sorry, my brother.

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      Since we was just grasshoppers...

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      You always told me, it's a dog eat dog
                      world.

            And he thrusts Bones' razor right between the ribs.  Bones'
            eyes tighten, but never lose their lock on Jeremiah's eyes. 
            His mouth moves as if he's trying to speak.  Instead, he
            spits a bog of blood right into Jeremiah's face.

            A shaken Jeremiah hands the bloody razor to Shotgun.

<b>                                JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
</b>                      Just do it.  He won't even feel it.

            Bones' eyes bore into Shotgun's.  Shotgun hesitates.  Eyeing
            his gun on the floor, feeling the one on the back of his neck
            -- calculating his chances.

            Then Shotgun slices him.  Bones flinches, he definitely still
            feels it.  Shotgun hands the razor back to Eddie.

<b>                                LUPOVICH
</b>                      Now you, girlie.

<b>                                PEARL

</b>                      Same deal all around.  Or die with him.

            She takes the razor and slowly kneels beside her dying lover. 
            Her hands trembling.  There's no way she can do it.  Lupovich
            brings the gun to the back of her head.

<b>                                PEARL
</b>                      I can't.  I won't.  Go ahead.  Shoot me. 
                      I'll be better off.

            Bones reaches one hand round the back of her neck, weakly
            storking her there... And with his other hand, Bones takes
            her wrists and pulls her hand towards him, burying his razor
            in his heart.  His eyes roll back and his hand falls away and
            he's gone.

            She drops her hand from the razor which remains sticking out
            of his chest, a river of blood pouring from around it.

<b>            BONES POV
</b>
            As his spirit rises and rises, up to the ceiling, looking
            down on them as they stand watching his body bleed to death.

            Pearl just stands there completely covered in his blood. 
            Then in a frantic daze tears her dress off.  Jeremiah gently
            takes her bloody dress.

            From above, Bones can hear them speaking below, but it's as
            if they were speaking far away.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      Too risky to take him outside.  Take him
                      down to the storm cellar and bury him. 
                      And get rid of this too.
                          (tosses Pearl's bloody dress)
                      Let this whole damn building be his tomb.

            Shotgun and Lupovich drag Bones' body out of the room,
            leaving behind a deep wet blood stain in the shag carpet.

<b>            BONES POV
</b>
            As he stares down in horror at all this.  Above him, it seems
            he can see right through the ceiling to the night sky, and a
            swirling light opening above his head.

<b>            NOW HIS POV
</b>
            Is floating upward towards the light, but then he looks

<b>                                                               BACK DOWN
</b>
            Staring down at the sight of his body in a deep puddle of
            blood, and his murderers removing his woman's dress covered
            with is blood.  As he sees this, his (and ours) POV changes,
            becomes darker, yet clearer; too sharp, razor sharp as some
            softness, perhaps life itself, drains out of it.  Bones sees
            his best friend Jeremiah and Lupovich together dragging his
            body out the door, leaving a thick wet stain behind him.

            We can hear Jimmy's last wail of rage twist and distorts in
            the air, becoming another deeper voice within the voice...
            And then he (and we) plunge back down to the ground, right to
            the dark, wet stain in the carpet...

            Hit it and go down through an instant's glimpse into the
            black sea beneath the foundation of the world:

            Necropolis.  Where space itself seems to be made of pale
            bloated, gnawing, writhing things.  Bodies perpetually
            devouring themselves and each other.

            We see through this dog-eat-dog nightmare, back out through
            the blood stain as through a key hole slowly closing.

            Patrick alternates between tending the crowd and throwing
            anxious glances down the block towards Cinnabar's home.

            Torn between exhilaration at seeing his dream come true and
            disappointment that Cinnabar's not there to share it.

            People chomping to get in.  Across the street Shotgun watches
            with dismay.

            Patrick hears voices down the street.  Looks up to see
            Cinnabar walking towards the club.  His smile freezes when he

            The place is unfinished.  But all the cooler for it.  The bar
            is crude.  Cheap beer and jug wine.  But the crowd don't
            mind.  The place is alive.  The boys are on fire.

            A packed floor of dancers move as sound and image break beat,
            and Maurice's voice erupts in deep dub reverb.

            Throughout the house, the video interviews the guys did and

            Bill builds, lets the record spin, then pops the kill button. 
            The tune fades in a distorted way as he start/stops/start/

            ...as Maurice twiddles dials and distorts it all further --
            it's spooky, but way funky.

            Is now in the house too.  Walking through the throbbing
            crowd, making a path right through them, most of the dancers
            paying it no mind, it's just another part of the trippy
            scene.  Or do they even see it?  We can't tell.

<b>            CLOSER ANGLE - ON THE DOG
</b>
            And it's single-minded concentration.  Staring straight ahead
            as it moves through the crowd towards Maurice, who for a
            second, notices the dog coming but making nothing of it.

<b>            REVERSE - THE DOG'S POV

            What it's staring at.  Bones' old ring on Maurice's finger.

<b>            NEW ANGLE - MAURICE'S POV
</b>
            When he looks back, he sees not a dog, but a beautiful black
            woman, a Dark Lady, who only has eyes for him.

            Dancing seductively, drawing a crowd as she moves, she stares
            straight ahead at Maurice.

            Maurice's joint droops from the corner of his mouth as he
            realizes "YES!", this world-class beauty is most definitely
            flirting with him.

            The Dark Lady's still throwing him deep looks as she dances
            off the floor and then disappears up the stairs, making
            Maurice lean into Bill.

            Maurice heads upstairs, sure that his short DJ career is
            already paying off big time.

<b>            INT. UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

            Maurice slips into the darkness of the room and closes the
            door behind him.

                      manifesto.

            In the darkness he can't see where she is.  Just hear a deep
            breathing, almost panting.

</b>                      Ahhh, tantric breathing.  I'm in love.

            He can't see her.  Or anything in the dark room.  Finally his
            eyes adapt to the dark and he sees a dark shape by the bed.

            He pulls out a lighter to light his joint (and see where she
            is) but when he does it's not her beautiful dark features he
            sees, but:

            For the blink of an eye, it's totally blank face, except for
            a HUGE MOUTH with liver lips, pink gums and wolfen teeth. 
            When it exhales, out comes a noxious cloud of tiny insects. 
            And then in the blink it's the raging black dog leaping open
            jawed at his face.

            Maurice screams and drops his light in fright.  He starts
            crawling towards the door and the overhead light switch. 
            While trying to fend himself from the wailing teeth and claws
            of the canine creature...

</b>                      Yo.  Maurice.  Where are you?

            He tries a door.  Nothing.  Then he hears noises from the
            third floor.

<b>            INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

            Patrick opens the remaining bedroom door on a nightmare
            tableaux.  Maurice lies in a pool of blood.  His body shakes
            and shudders spasmodically as the dog feasts on his liver.

            Patrick starts for Maurice but the dog growls to keep him
            back away from its precious food.  Patrick backs up a step. 
            Almost out of his mind with terror.  He really loses it when
            the dog, in SLO-MO, looks up and directly at him.  It seems
            to be wearing Maurice's face and speaks with a twisted
            version of his (Maurice's) voice:

<b>                                DOG/MAURICE
</b>                      The gangsta of love don't eat no fried
                      chicken...

            And before Patrick can even freak, the dog has returned to
            it's normal dog face, and it lunges at Patrick, taking a
            sizeable bite out of his arm.

            Patrick leaps back out the door, with only a fast glance back
            at the thing in the room --

            The dog is not following him.  It's standing.  Over Maurice's
            remains.  Growling low, it begins to shudder uncontrollably
            to bulge and ooze.

            The gore covered dog quivers and swells and bulges and
            finally explodes into a shower of pulsating maggots, flying
            all over the room and all over Patrick's eyes and in his
            mouth.

<b>            INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The body is now done.  It looks whole again.  Even strong and
            young.  If still gray and cold until Bones lies down, curls
            up into the body filling the rejuvenated corpse with the
            vital life force of his vengeful rage.

            Bones/The Body opens his eyes, stands up not tottering as
            before but filled with strength.  He looks as good as new,
            except for the tattered clothes.

<b>            ON THE DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

            The dancers can't hear Patrick screaming or running down the
            stairs.  They're just groovin' along to Ill Bill and the
            funk.

            Until the maggots start oozing and pouring through the
            ceiling onto their hair and faces and clothes, into their
            drinks at the bar and onto their pizza slices.

            Then Patrick comes into the room screaming and all hell
            breaks loose as the sight of him, plus the maggots, sends
            everyone tearing for the exits.

            Seeing his brother in terror, Bill slams the tone arm
            screeching the needle across the record, leaving only the
            psycho drum and bass playing on the other channels of the
            mix.

<b>            INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

            Meanwhile, down below, the freshly embodied Bones studies the
            gas furnace.  This time when he bends down to blow out the
            light -- wooosh, he blows it out.  He reaches under the tank
            and the gas hisses out.

            Then he eyes his old razor on the floor.  With a confident,
            strong grip, he picks it up and now, finally --

<b>            BONES IS BACK IN BUSINESS.

<b>            INT. DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

            Hell-maggots still falling onto people, maggots on the floor
            making people slip and fall as they jam the exits.  Screaming
            chaos, people trying to break windows to get out faster...

            Patrick looks across the chaotic room and sees Cinnabar and
            Tia cringing under a table.  Trapped there.  Bill in the
            doorway trying to get people out.

<b>            INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

            At the top of the stairs, leading up out of the sub basement,
            Bones smashes the bulb of the hanging light.  Then flips the
            light switch -- the spark ignites the gas behind him.  It
            causes a fiery explosion in the lower basement.

            The fire's light seems the very glow of hellfire behind Bones
            as he marches up the stairs, razor in his hand.

<b>            INT. DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Patrick, trying to stay low, crawls his way to where his
            sister and Cinnabar are trapped.

            Fire begins to burn through from the kitchen and up through
            the floor.  The room is filling with smoke.

            Bill's helping those trampled in the rush to get out.  Bill
            himself bleeds badly from his neck.

            Patrick runs with Cinnabar and Tia toward the door.  And as
            the smoke fills the room, through the haze we see:

            Bones step into the room.  His arm raised with the razor. 
            And he flings it out, like a boomerang, the razor flies
            around the room.

            It swoops down through the smoke at the remaining kids,
            hacking at them through the smoke, like some savage bird,
            though it doesn't seem intent on slaughtering them, but
            rather herding them out.  Bill and Patrick pull Cinnabar and
            Tia out the door -- they're the last in the room.

            Suddenly the razor stops, freezes in mid-air and zips back
            into Bones' waiting fist - just like a boomerang.

            Razor held high, Bones advances on them, steadily, cool as
            ice amidst the now fully burning house.

            Looking for an instant, they all see Bones as the room is
            engulfed in flames.  See him raise his fists in a rage.  Or
            is it in triumph?  Before his figure is obscured by falling
            debris.

            Sirens wail as fire trucks pull up and the men start

            He comes to what's left of Maurice.  Finds his hand bloodied

</b><b>			INT. CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
            Jeremiah drives his still shocked and silent brood back to
            safety behind the gates of Rossmore Park.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      I don't want any of you ever back down

                      you'll listen to me.  Or I'll let them
                      throw your asses in jail.  I mean it.

<b>            INT. PEARL'S STOREFRONT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Cinnabar, listening to her mother, is told what happened.

<b>                                PEARL
</b>                      You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I

                      - we - killed him, that you were already
                      alive inside me.  Life's like that. 
                      Grows right out of death.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      But if it's him.  If he's really come

                      time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and
                      all that's left is that ravening, hungry
                      spirit in the blood that soaked into the

                      again.  And you've all killed my father

            Cinnabar runs crying out of the room.

<b>            EXT. BACK ON THE STREET - PRE-DAWN
</b>
            The building is finished, just a blackened shell.  Remnants
            of the staircase lead up to fragments of the upper floors. 
            Smoke still billowing from the empty center of the ruin.

            Silhouetted in the smoke and the low light of the rising sun:
            a tall, dark figure, not of then, nor quite of now.

            It is Bones.  Taller, thinner, darker and more menacing then
            ever.  But unmistakably Bones.  He steps out of the rubble. 
            And looks across the street, up at Shotgun's lit window.

<b>            INT. SHOTGUN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Shotgun's hand shakes as he pours another shot.  Then downs
            it.  He turns to the window and freezes at what he sees.

            Bones face is just outside the window.  The second story
            window.  Smiling in at him.  Shotgun is petrified.  But then
            he picks up his gun and shoots at the face in the window.

<b>                                BONES (O.S.)
</b>                      Free at last, free at last.

            Shotgun whirls and there stands Bones behind him now.

<b>                                SHOTGUN
</b>                      It wasn't my fault.  I didn't know what
                      they'd planned.

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      Shush.  It don't matter now.

<b>                                SHOTGUN
</b>                      No.  Really, Jimmy.  Remember, man.  It's
                      me.  I was on your side.  Don't you
                      remember?

            He just walks towards the terrified Shotgun, closer and
            closer, leaning right over his shotgun, his face coming just
            inches from Shotgun's face.

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      Take a look at what I remember,
                      brother...

            His big brown eyes fill Shotgun's vision, and in what now
            seem to be the gigantic pupils in Bones' eyes, Shotgun sees
            the old apartment, and there it all is again and again.

            Shotgun sees himself hesitating, almost risking it all and
            instead giving in, stabbing Bones -- he can't look away. 
            Then Bones closes his eyes.  Shotgun sobbing now.

<b>                                SHOTGUN
</b>                      I had no choice, Jimmy.  What else could
                      I do?

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      You coulda died with me.  Died trying.

            Shotgun is cradling his weapon, hands shaking.  He points it
            at Bones and pulls the trigger.  Bones doesn't even flinch as
            the pellets rip through him.

<b>                                BONES (CONT'D)
</b>                      Feel better?

            Bones' impossibly long fingers hold his long rusty razor.  He
            waves the razor in front of Shotgun, the rusty blade swinging
            free back and forth, hypnotically, with a rasping sound.

<b>                                BONES (CONT'D)
</b>                      You gonna be free and clear, Shotgun. 
                      All debts paid...

            And then in one swift motion, on the back stroke, Bones' hand
            and razor slash across Shotgun's throat.

            Shotgun doesn't even have time to scream, we just hear his
            breath and blood escaping from the new opening across his
            neck.

            Bones bends down and cradling his old friend, whispers gently
            into his ear.  Singing, perhaps.  We can't quite hear.

<b>                                BONES (CONT'D)
</b>                      See you on the other side, brother.

            Bones gets up and moves around the room, standing before the
            window and looking down at the neighborhood he used to own.

            For a second he sees the old neighborhood, everybody hanging
            out.  Then he blinks back to reality.  He looks down the
            block and sees Pearl's reader and advisor sign.

<b>            INT. JEREMIAH'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
            Bill in a kind of shock can only lie in his bedroom, staring
            at the ceiling.

            Tia's out in the living room, sitting on the couch weeping in
            her mother's arms.

            Patrick's in the bathroom tending the bloody scratches on his
            back and arms.  He's frightened.  And angry.  He storms out
            of the bathroom, down the hall to his father's office.

<b>            INT. JEREMIAH'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            As Patrick slams the door behind him, Jeremiah hides a stack
            of papers and photos beneath a pile on his desk.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Did you do it?

</b>                      Sure, son.  I went down there and torched

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      You could have had it done.  You didn't
                      want us there.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      I wouldn't have risked killing you to get
                      you out.  I was trying to protect you.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      From what?

            Jeremiah can't answer.  But Patrick's not leaving it alone.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Why?  Why did you give a shit about the
                      building?  Why did you care that we were
                      there of all places?

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you
                      can see now.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For
                      once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came
                      from there, too.

<b>                                JEREMIAH

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      I saw your face.  You knew that place. 
                      You knew those people.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      That's the past.  It's dead.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  
                          (points to the bandages)
                      It's alive.  And it bites.

<b>            EXT. BLACKSTONE STREET - NIGHT
</b>
            That night we see a walking shadow.  The long tall black clad
            Bones.  Heading down his old block.  Alone.

            As he moves, his face changes, at times demonic and intent. 
            But periodically that shifts as if a mask slipping off to
            reveal a similar but different face below.  More human, lost,
            pained, confused, and we see why:

<b>            FROM BONES' FUCKED UP UNDEAD POV:
</b>
            The dark and desolate street he walks down keeps flashing for
            brief instants into the street of twenty years ago.

            One moment, people nodding to him, waving, blowing kisses.
            And then suddenly, it's the empty burnt block it is now.

            Bones' face shifts, cracking, one second the hungry ghost. 
            The next, he's the old Bones who once ruled this 'hood.

            He sees, down the block, the old palmistry sign.  It's
            Pearl's place.  For a second, the face of the real Jimmy
            Bones triumphs and he smiles.  Then hears voices behind him.

            Stank and Weaze.  They see a tall, thin figure in some very
            fine looking, long duster.

<b>                                STANK
</b>                      Looking to score?

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural
                      high.  A supernatural high.

<b>                                STANK

                      his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other
                      bitch's block.

<b>                                BONES
</b>                          (sorta singing)
                      Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains
                      and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...

<b>                                WEAZE
</b>                      Yeah.  But he got a baaaad coat.  Whataya
                      say, bro?  I check out your coat?

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      Sure.  Here it is.

            Suddenly, out from the depths of his shadow, flies the edge
            of Bones' razor and the blade slashes Stank in the face. 
            Cutting a sideways, smart aleck smile in his cheek.

            Weaze pulls a gun and shoots Bones.  Bones jolts a little as
            the bullet imbeds itself in his stomach.  But he takes it
            like a punch and looks up.

<b>                                BONES (CONT'D)
</b>                      Cut that shit out.

            He grabs one of the boys in each long hand and hoists them up
            to his height and pins them against the wall.

<b>                                BONES (CONT'D)

<b>            INT. PEARL'S PARLOR - NIGHT
</b>
            Pearl sits alone, drinking.  Maybe crying a little.  Her
            hands shuffle large tarot cards.  She lays her own spread. 
            First card face down.  Second card face up.

<b>            THE LOVERS.
</b>
            And across it the third is laid: the crumbling Tower.

            Then she slips the first card, the down-turned card out and
            flips it face up.  Death.  Suddenly a long black shadow falls
            over the table.

                      neither.

            His face quivers and we see from his POV:

            Pearl - then and now.  Again, then and now.

<b>                                PEARL (CONT'D)

                      years.  Maybe if I hadn'ta walked in at

            But he resists.  Pulls his arm free.

            She hurls herself at him.  Slapping him.  Slamming her fists
            against his shadowy chest.

<b>                                PEARL

                      forgive you for dying.  And for being so

            He looks down at her.  His face wavering between the true
            face of Jimmy Bones and the angry Bones ready to kill her.

            Then he wraps his arms around her and they kiss.  She faints,
            the cards in her fist fluttering to the floor.

            He lays her gently down.  When suddenly Cinnabar throws the
            door open.

            She and Bones make eye contact.  She sets eyes for the first
            time on the father she's never known.  And in the blink of
            her eye, he's gone.  She runs to where her mom lies on the
            floor.

            At the very sound of the name, Mack freezes.  Then with
            sudden coke-fueled ferocity, he whips around and starts
            smacking the shit out of Stank, breaking his nose.  The coke

            The lights are low and only the glow of the jukebox and the
            sounds of Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes as Mack and his
            manicurist get down on the pooltable, beside an ornate mirror
            laden with two gold '45s and an ounce of cocaine.  Which they
            are both doing to excess.

            Mack's wearing nothing but a black hat and black satin briefs
            (not a pretty sight).  Working now on her blouse.

<b>                                MACK

            He watches her sashay to the other room where the juke box
            is.  Then bends over the mirror to do a new line.

            From the other room, the song changes.  A deep menacing
            rolling funk number.

<b>                                MACK

            "Baby's" standing wide-eyed next to the jukebox, staring at

<b>            INT. BLACK CAT POOL CLUB - CONTINUOUS

            Mack's wondering where she is.

<b>                                MACK
</b>                      C'mon, baby!

            He walks doing a little funky Rufus Thomas shuffle to the
            music.  He steps into the club room.  It's dark, lit only by
            the jukebox.  But it's empty.

<b>                                MACK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Bitch.  Nobody walks out on Eddie Mack.

            Then he sees something.  Her legs on the floor, sticking out
            behind the jukebox.  He walks towards her, slowly...

            Then sees the deepening pool of blood pouring across the
            floor right towards him.  Whatever happened to her, she's
            beyond his help now.

<b>                                MACK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Muthafucka!

            He whips around but can't see anyone.  He strides defiantly
            back into the pool room.

<b>                                MACK (CONT'D)
</b>                      C'mon.  I take you all on.

            Mack picks up the two gold plated revolvers off the mirror
            with coke on it.  Suddenly all the coke moves on its own. 
            The many grams piled there, all merge into one pile.

<b>                                MACK (CONT'D)
</b>                      What the...?

            He bends down to check it out.  And the coke actually flies
            straight up off the mirror with the force of a punch and
            shoots like a fire hose straight up his nose.

            He reels back, choking.  Coughing.  After having probably an
            ounce fly straight up his snot-locker.  Blood pouring out his
            nose.  Wobbly now.

            He hears a low echoing laughter through the club, and the
            sound of the cue ball breaking and sending pool balls
            spinning 'round the table.

<b>                                MACK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Who's there?

            Bones stands by the pool table, under the overhanging light. 
            He pulls out his razor and with one savage slice, splinters
            the pool cue in two.

<b>                                MACK (CONT'D)

                      dead.  I killed you and I stuck your dead
                      ass in a hole in the ground wrapped in
                      nothing but your bitch's bloody rags. 
                      Now I'll count the holes in your
                      muthafuckin' chest.  And I'll add a few
                      more.

            He fires both guns at Bones, while backing away.  Bones don't
            feel a thing.  He just picks up the mirror and holds it up
            facing Mack.

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      This it?  Your big-ass tidal wave.

            Mack sees his own terrified face staring back from the
            mirror, belling hanging over his briefs, coke and blood
            clotted on his face.

<b>                                BONES (CONT'D)

                      nothing but oil scum, dead fish, and yo'
                      ugly ass left on the beach.

            Mack shoots wildly at Bones.  At the mirror - blasting it
            into shards.

            But Bones stands unscathed.  And the shards of broken mirror
            do not fall to the ground.  They remain in the air, forming a
            living room swarm of razor sharp glass.

            Mack turns and runs, waaaaay too fucking late, as the swarm
            of glass shards fly like angry wasps right at him

            Eddie's thrown forward by the sheer force of them, and is
            skewered throughout his body by all the glass fragments. 
            Pinned -- face mashed against the wall.

                      head that's a quick ticket to heaven."

            Mack pinned to the wall.  Bleeding from everywhere.  Snot
            blood-coke mess drips out his nose.  Bones pulls Mack's head
            back by his hair and slides his razor into the half inch
            between his Adam's apple and the wall.

            As the juke box changes song, we hear a liquid slice and a
            scream slip into a gurgle.

            Bones' long hands drip blood as he ties something to his
            belt.  We don't quite see what it is, not until we catch the
            sight of Eddie Mack's headless remains pinned to the wall.

            Lupovich looks around to make sure no one is watching.  Then
            slips into a passageway leading to the old slaughterhouse.

            A scary walk through inky darkness, scattered with broken
            glass and scurrying rats and lit only by the eerie red light
            spilling like blood out of the open door into the old
            slaughterhouse at the end of the way.

            Lupovich reaches the back, right next to the old loading dock
            where the still-livestock were unloaded.  He enters the door,
            disappearing into the red darkness.

<b>            INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The room, large and open, soaked in the sodium vapor that
            streams through the tall windows from the streetlights.

            There are a few blood rusted meat hooks still there, backlit,
            hanging from the ceiling.  Graffiti covers the walls with
            arcane tags and symbols.  The floors are caked with a sticky
            grime turned black in the orange haze.

            In the far corner burn three red votive candles.  Behind the
            candles lies a crumpled brown paper bag.  The stash.

            Lupovich starts over to the corner, twitching at the gross
            sound of his shoes sticking to the layers of old coagulated
            blood on the killing floor.

            Behind him, framed for an instant int he doorway - a tall,
            sharp shadow, a walking razor - Bones!

            The walk is tense.  Somehow the music has followed him here
            and is echoing and wailing in the walls around him.  He gets
            to the corner, and reaching over the candles, opens the top
            of the paper bag.  Jackpot.  Five ziplocks of the rocks.

            He hears a noise.  Lupovich fumbles for his gun and at the
            same time reaches to snatch the stash bag.  His wrist touches
            the candles flame and it burns.

<b>                                LUPOVICH
</b>                      Shit!  Fuck!

            He hears another noise, a blade scraping on concrete, right
            behind him.  Now the music blends with the echoing squeals of
            the hogs once butchered on the cutting line.

            Lupovich hears another noise, a blade scraping on concrete,
            right behind him.  Now the music blends with the echoing
            squeals of the hogs once butchered on the cutting line.

            Lupovich turns and there, towering over him, stands Bones. 
            And just as startling, there's Mack's laughing severed head
            swinging from his belt.

            Lupovich can only choke on his terror, and while his mouth is
            open, Bones shoves a glass pipe into it.

            Brandishing his razor, Bones packs a rock into the bowl and
            torches it.  He holds the razor to Lupovich's throat.

<b>                                BONES
</b>                          (in Mack's voice)
                      "Just try it...go ahead...it won't kill
                      you."

            Lupovich, trembling, takes a massive hit of the crack deep
            into his lungs.  The music and the sounds of the dying pigs
            attack him as the coke fills his lungs and then his blood and
            then his brain, his eyes starting to bug.

            Bones then knocks the pipe from his lips and seals his hand
            over Lupovich's mouth and nose.  He can't exhale.  The sounds
            get louder, the grafted walls come alive.

            Bones removes his hand revealing Lupovich's nose is fused
            shut, and his mouth is simply gone, the skin flat where the
            mouth used to be.

            Lupovich's gotta lung full of crack, and no way to exhale. 
            Severed Mack laughs insanely as he sees Lupovich's eyes bulge
            as his lungs start to strain under the agony.

            His frenzied suffocation is nothing but pure torture.  While
            he is still kicking with the fear and the drug rush, Bones
            drags Lupovich to the middle of the room.

            With one arm, Bones lifts the fat cop up and hooks him to one
            of the meat hooks above.

<b>                                BONES (CONT'D)
</b>                          (in Lupovich's voice)
                      "I ain't gonna be the only one with this
                      nigger's blood on my hands..."

            As Lupovich squirms, Bones takes his blade, and shoves it in
            just below Lupovich's sternum.  And a spray of blood paints
            Bones and Mack's hanging head.

            Thick crack smoke emerges from the wound and floats, foglike,
            out of the chest cavity.  Bones then yanks the blade
            southward and slices the cop's belly wide open.

            We hear Lupovich's guts spill out on the floor.

<b>                                MACK'S SEVERED HEAD
</b>                      Was that really necessary?  Can you wipe
                      my fucking face?  I can't see a goddamned
                      thing.

            The dope smoke wafts in the room four feet off the floor. 
            The song immolates itself.  Blood drips.  And Bones adds
            another weight to his belt.

            Just round the corner from the entrance to the gated suburb.

            Cinnabar walks up to the guard at the gate.  He picks up the

            Phone rings.  Patrick grabs it.  But his father's already on

            Cinnabar sees it's useless to argue and walks away.  Shocked
            and hurt.  Back to where her mother stands in the shadows
            outside the gates.

            As they sneak around the other side, a dark figure steps
            right up to the main gates.

            The rent-a-cop wakes up fast when he sees Bones standing in
            front of him. 
            After all, how often does he come face to face with
            everything he is there to keep out?  He hitches his belt in
            best John Wayne style.

            Jeremiah locks the door to his study.  Then he pulls out the

            photos: the old days.  His first wife.  His first life.  Back

            A car drives up to the gate.  But no guard comes out to check

            Just the aimless squawk of the radio in the booth.  Can't
            really see into the tooth.  The windows are splattered and

            High in the center, where the master bedroom once was, we see

            out of the wracked and twisted shapes of dead souls.

                      Jeremiah's gonna have the unique
                      experience of seeing his reward, tasting
                      it while he's still alive.

            Bones wraps his long arm around Jeremiah's neck in a
            brotherly choke hold.  Jeremiah terrified.

<b>            EXT. LAKE SHORE DRIVE - NIGHT

            Pearl, Cinnabar, Bill and Patrick speed south by car.

                      Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. 
                      It's the wanting that holds body and soul
                      together, and sometimes, the wanting
                      lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in
                      the house.

            Bill and Patrick look at Pearl like she might be crazy.  Then
            they see Cinnabar next to her, glaring back at them.

<b>			INT. BONES' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Bones has Jeremiah on his feet now, leading him towards the
            wall of the undead.

            Suddenly, hands shoot out of the wall, only inches away from
            Jeremiah's face!  He twists and turns to stay away from them,
            but the long nails on one of the hands claw at his cheek. 
            While hungry mouths open from the palms of hands.

                      looked after you.  You had a piece of

            Bones pushing Jeremiah's face towards the grasping hands.

</b>                      Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda

                      up for the bad?  You about to find out.

            Bones rams Jeremiah's head (his eyes closed in fear) through
            the Necropolis wall.

<b>            INT. NECROPOLIS WALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Jeremiah's head inside now.  Eyes still closed, head bobbing
            in the jelly-like base that holds what he sees when he dares
            to open his eyes.

            Hideous malformed faces, genetic anomalies, the kinds of
            faces that wound up in side-shows in less enlightened times. 
            All laughing and leering and glaring at Jeremiah.

<b>            FULL C.U. - LUPOVICH'S FACE AND HEAD
</b>
            The skin peeling away like congealed jelly.  Lupovich tries
            to talk to Jeremiah or to scream but nothing comes out. 
            Except for a hideous wobbling bubble.

            For a subliminal moment, Jeremiah sees a figure trapped
            inside the bubble.  His own figure, silently screaming to get
            out.

<b>            NEW ANGLE
</b>
            Suddenly, Jeremiah is screaming for real as Bones has just
            yanked his head back out of the wall.

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      It's a trip, ain't it?

            Bones sounding almost sympathetic to Jeremiah.  Almost.

<b>            EXT. BONES NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
</b>
            Suddenly, as they round a corner onto Blackstone, they see
            tendrils of an eerie greenish fog.  It seems to be emanating
            from the still smoking remains of Bones' house.  Or perhaps
            it is just the smoke, tinged only by the gaseous street
            lights.

<b>                                PEARL

                      the door.  They're getting out.

            Then there's a shape and a thump!  The real terror of
            thinking your car just hit a human being.

            Then a face appears in the car window.  Just a homeless guy
            shaking an angry fist at them.  Quickly, he's gone in the
            fog.

            Straining to see, Patrick stops, grabbing a flashlight from
            his glove box.  They all get out.  Making their way through
            the fog, glimpsing in darkened doorways, eerie shapes,
            perhaps more of the dead out of Necropolis.

<b>            EXT. BEHIND THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            They arrive at the back side of the ruined building.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      There was a storm door, to the cellar.

            They search frantically in the dark amongst the tall weeds
            abandoned junk and burnt rubble.

<b>            INT. BONES' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Jeremiah still with Bones, looking for a way out.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      What will it take?  What do you want? 
                      Just tell me, Jimmy!

<b>                                BONES

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      Then fuck it!!!

            In a righteous fury, Bones headlocks Jeremiah again and rams
            his head through the Necropolis wall.

<b>            OVER JEREMIAH'S SHOULDER - HIS POV
</b>
            As he's back inside face to face with living dead mutations,
            with Lupovich's head coming at him, it's mouth suddenly
            opening to ten times its normal size, swallowing Jeremiah
            whole.

<b>            BACK WITH BONES
</b>
            Watching with some pity as the rest of Jeremiah, his legs and
            feet are pulled into the wall and gone.  Accompanied by the
            disappearing screams of the last of Jeremiah.

<b>                                BONES (CONT'D)

<b>            EXT. BEHIND THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            They search for the cellar door.  The night air is shattered
            by a scream, at once very close and infinitely far.  Finally:

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      Here!

            He's found a chipped gray storm door.  Patrick easily kicks
            in the rotten wood revealing a dark tunnel of stairs leading
            down beneath the ruins of the building into the sub-basement.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      It's not safe down there.  The fire
                      started down there.  The whole thing
                      could collapse.

<b>                                PEARL
</b>                      Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy
                      Bones is gonna be around a long time.

            Patrick steps down into the darkness of the cellar, his
            flashlight on.

<b>            INT. STORM CELLAR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            The group stoops low as they descend the stairs.  Beneath
            wood supports, the dirt is reclaiming it, already a constant
            trickle of dirty falling from between the boards.

            In the dim, Patrick leads them, walking through a mass of
            spider infested webs and, just ahead, is the sub-basement
            where they originally found the body.

<b>            INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Throwing debris aside, they come next through a small door at
            the bottom of the stairs and enter the sub-basement.  Nearby
            is the elevator shaft, a gaping hole in the ruins - but
            recognizable as such.  The ceiling above them is nearly
            collapsed, and over most of the room, the accumulated debris
            and ruin from above has simply fallen through.

            And what remains of the ceiling is still shifting, groaning,
            coming apart.

            Patrick shines his flashlight down to the ground, until:

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Here.

            He's found the hole that was Bones' hastily dug grave, but
            there's nothing in it now but swarming white maggots.

<b>                                PEARL
</b>                      Is it there?

            She gets down on her hands and knees as Patrick shines the
            light, but after a few frantic moments of digging, it's
            clear:

<b>                                PEARL (CONT'D)
</b>                      It's gone.  He got it.

            Just then the sound of tremendous strain and creaking of
            wood.  And the ceiling starts to give way.  They all scramble
            for shelter, and then it gives way completely -- completely
            blocking their way out.  They're trapped.

<b>                                BILL
</b><b>                      NO!!!!!!
</b>
            They all look in every direction for some glimpse of hope -
            of a way out.  There is none.  Then they hear behind them: a
            resonant "DING!"

<b>            TURNING - THEIR POV
</b>
            Where moments before there was a gaping, ruined elevator
            shaft, there is now a fully functioning elevator just as it
            was in 1979, the doors opening to them in eerie slo-mo.

            Pearl starts towards the open car.  The others trying to hold
            her back.

<b>                                PEARL
</b>                      It's alright.  Let me.

            She walks closer, peering into the dark recesses of the
            elevator.  Maybe again a flash of visible movement inside.

            Closer ever closer, until Pearl, almost entranced, steps in. 
            And once inside, there's no one, or no thing, there.  Pearl
            is about to tell them "It's okay..." when suddenly the doors
            of the elevator slide-slam shut.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      Mama!!!!!

            Then they hear the elevator chain start to move and the
            elevator starts to rise.  Cinnabar screaming louder.

<b>            INT. THE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Pearl stands there, summoning all her courage for what she
            knows she's going to have to face.  Watching the elevator
            arrow as it climbs to the number three.

<b>            INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Patrick and Bill beat on the door and try to pry it open. 
            Then they try jamming jagged boards into the opening, but
            still to no avail.

<b>            PEARL'S POV
</b>
            As a moment later, the car stops and the doors open onto:

<b>            INT. BONES' PAD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Down to the last detail, exactly as it was 22 years ago, the
            night Bones died.  Music playing (the Delfonics "Didn't I
            Blow Your Mind This Time...")  The only new detail are the
            dozens of candles romantically burning everywhere.

            Pearl feels a soft touch on the back of her neck and spins,
            finds Jimmy right behind, almost nuzzling her.  His face
            hidden, though, in darkness.  Holding something in his hand,
            behind his back.

            She turns slowly, and we don't know what to expect. 
            Something horrible or something beautiful.

            Finally, she's face to face, and it's Jimmy just as he was,
            22 years ago.  All traces of the demonic are gone.  Pearl
            melts as the Delfonics swell, Jimmy holding her close.

            He holds it up for Pearl to see and from:

            The dress is brand new and beautiful.  She's finally

            Patrick, Bill and Cinnabar have managed now to pry open the

            ground and look up:

            The shaft goes all the way into eternity.  But along the

            they become aware of light on the first floor level just
            ahead.

<b>            BACK IN BONES' CRIB

            Pearl steps into the frame to look at herself in a floor
            length mirror on Bones' closest door.

<b>            PEARL'S POV - IN THE MIRROR

            Not only the dress, but she too looks exactly as she was 22
            years ago, skin smooth as cocoa butter, eyes free from worry
            and pain.  

            Roberta Flack's "Killing Me Softly" as Jimmy takes her in his

            first floor level, trying to force open the outer doors.

            Suddenly, an ominous sound: the chain/mechanism of the
            elevator as they see it starting to descend towards them. 
            Panicking, Bill tries with all his might.

            As the elevator inches closer and closer --

            Until Bill finally manages to get the doors open.  They all
            scramble to safety just as the elevator slides by them.

<b>            NEW ANGLE
</b>
            After they catch their breath, they look up and around to
            find themselves -- 

<b>            INT. THE NECROPOLIS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            A distorted M.C. Escher-like feel to the place.  Where up
            seems to be down, down up, and left is right.  Not helped by
            behind only lit by the eerie flickering gaseous lamps
            outside, and the moonlight falling through the skylight.

            Then, slowly through the gloom, they begin to perceive that
            the walls are clotted and congealed, teratomic masses of
            distorted flesh; faces, limbs, eyes, mouths, all trapped -
            all contorted in agony.  At first they seem to be frozen in
            the walls, like the ruins of Herculaneum.  But then we see --

            They are slowly writhing, moving.  Hands grasping, teeth and
            rotted jaws widening, and worst of all, the eyes staring out.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Is this Hell?

<b>                                BILL
</b>                          (gripping the gun)
                      Or just Hell-adjacent...

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      Ain't no Heaven.  Ain't no Hell.  There's
                      just the world of the dead, my momma
                      always talked about.  Like she said, the
                      door is open, and we're seeing right
                      through our world into this one.  We just
                      have to remember what was really here. 
                      And follow it.  Those stairs should take
                      us to the second floor.

            As they approach the stairs they can hear faintly above the
            drone/moan of the dead, the soft music playing in Bones'
            crib.

<b>            ANGLE AS
</b>
            They start up the stairs into the darkness.  Patrick first,
            Cinnabar in between him and Bill.  Patrick still holding his
            flashlight, but it's starting to flicker a little.

            More of the same horror along the stairway walls, eyes
            looking at them, hands caress Cinnabar's hair, another hand
            shooting up from the stair floor and grabbing Bill's thigh. 
            Bill stabs the hand with the knife on his belt.  And the
            hands shoot back down.

<b>            BACK IN BONES' CRIB
</b>
            The Munch-like dance of death goes on, Bones stroking the
            back of her neck.

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      Just like I told you this morning, I'd be
                      stroking your neck tonight.

            Pearl absolutely lost.

<b>            BACK ON THE STAIRS
</b>
            The three still ascending when Patrick's flashlight suddenly
            cuts out.  Total darkness.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Shit.

            A faint sound: Patrick shaking the flashlight.  Nothing but
            the sound of breathing, both human and non-human.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Thing worked fine a minute ago. 
                      Batteries were brand new -- 

            Then as suddenly as it went out, the flashlight comes back
            on, illuminating a horrible sight: Maurice.  Standing right
            there, a few feet in front of them.

<b>                                BILL
</b>                      Maurice!

            Maurice puts a finger to his lips and beckons them to follow. 
            The boys want it to be Maurice.  But Cinnabar knows better.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      That's not Maurice --

            But with the beam of the flickering flashlight, they follow
            the shadowy figure up the steps.

            Then Maurice gets a bit to far ahead, and they can't see him
            for a beat.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Maurice.  Hold up, man.

            Then after a silent beat, just Maurice's hand appears back
            out of the darkness, beckoning them onward.  Then the
            flashlight cuts out again.  They're back in the darkness.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                          (as he shakes the flashlight)
                      Okay, we're on the second floor.  I feel
                      it.  No more steps.

            The sound of Patrick cursing and shaking the batteries around
            in the torch.  Eventually it comes on again.

            Up ahead, they still barely see Maurice, his back to them,
            face in one quarter profile, leading them towards the next
            flight of stairs at the end of the hall.

            They follow.  Closer and closer to the stairs, Maurice going
            eerily in and out of their vision.  The flashlight dies
            again.

            Darkness.  Patrick shakes it and it comes back quickly.  Then
            just as quickly dies again!  A shake and it's lit again --
            just as Bill is stepping into the corner where Maurice
            disappeared.

<b>            FLICKERING HORROR
</b>
            As the dog leaps at them from the corner, all teeth and
            slavering jaws!  Everyone scrambles for their lives, and the
            flashlight falls to the floor.

<b>            LOW ANGLE FROM THE FLOOR - JUST BEHIND THE FLASHLIGHT
</b>
            We see the skewed horror: as the dog tears at Bill, as his
            gun skitters across the floor; as Patrick grabs the gun and
            fires, and we get a bit more illumination from the exploding
            gunpowder.  But it does no good.

            Bill screams in terror as he's torn to pieces, and then the
            flashlight goes out and again, we're in Stygian darkness. 
            The sound of Bill dying and a long silence.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Bill?!  Cinnabar?  Cinnabar?!

            No answer.  At first.  Finally in husky voice:

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      I'm here.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Bill!  Bill?!

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      Patrick, he's...

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Okay, okay.  Listen:

            From somewhere comes the sound of the music from Bones' crib.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right
                      near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk
                      up there.

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      I can't find you.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Here!

            Silence.  As we expect the worse, expect something else to
            take her hand.  But then:

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      Is that you?

            Pause -- the music from Bones' crib still beckons to them.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Yeah.  Come on.  Don't let go.

            We're in near total darkness as they climb the stairs, maybe
            a bit of moonlight now coming in from the roofless third
            floor they're approaching.  All we can hear is their
            footsteps and their breathing as they walk the rest of the
            way up the stairs and emerge into:

<b>            BONES' CRIB - THEIR POV
</b>
            Both amazed to see Pearl as young and beautiful as Cinnabar
            is, clinging to the dashing Jimmy dancing to the spectral
            sounds of some soul classic from back in the day.  Cinnabar
            entranced by the vision.

<b>            ANGLE AS
</b>
            Pearl opens her dreaming eyes and sees them, smiling and
            beckoning Cinnabar to come join her.  Cinnabar begins to.

            Patrick watches her until he hears something O.S. calling to
            him.  It sounds a million miles away and yet right in his
            ear.  And it sounds like Jeremiah.

<b>                                JEREMIAH

<b>            PATRICK'S POV
</b>
            He turns and looks at the wall -- subtly surging from beneath
            the surface of the wall he sees flashes of faces and hands,
            mouths twisted in torment.  He moves to the wall, drawn by
            the strange sight and the recurring sound...

<b>                                JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
</b>                          (as if a million miles away)
                      Patrick.  Help me.

            It's coming from within the wall. 

<b>            INTERCUTTING
</b>
            Now, while Cinnabar is advancing towards her mother and
            father across the room --

            Patrick, at the wall, tries to place his ear near it in order
            to hear where the voice is coming from.

            While Cinnabar is now within Bones' reach.  Pearl steps back
            to allow Jimmy to embrace Cinnabar.  They're reunited.

<b>                                BONES
</b>                      Welcome home, baby girl.

            Pearl watches as Bones caresses his daughter's cheek. 
            Patrick now close to the wall -- trying to hear the faint
            voice calling to him.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      Please...help me...

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Dad?

            Suddenly something enormous presses out from the wall. 
            Patrick stumbles back as his father's head and torso press
            out from the wall, stretched in straining effort.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help
                      me...

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      Daddy?

            Jeremiah, or what he's become embedded into the wall, his
            face stretched, mouth huge and hollow eyes dripping bloody
            tears.

<b>                                JEREMIAH
</b>                      Please.  Help me.  I'm scared.

            Patrick in anguish.

<b>                                JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
</b>                      It hurts.  I don't want to spend forever
                      like this.

            Jeremiah's arm reaches out from the wall, grasping towards
            Patrick, who reaches out to his father -- 

            When suddenly with frightening speed Jeremiah grabs it, and
            wrenches Patrick to him, pulling Patrick flush up against the
            wall, even starting to suck him in to the wall.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      No!!!

            As Patrick struggles and writhes and twists to get free from
            his father's grasp, he can see back across the room to the
            others.  He sees the room as it really is - he can see what's
            really happening.

            Pearl, not in a new dress, but in a horrible tattered, blood
            encrusted old dress, standing next to a rotting cadaver
            that's stroking Cinnabar's cheek and holding her close...

            Jeremiah pulling Patrick into the wall, into the Necropolis
            itself.  Patrick, though, just as concerned with Cinnabar as
            with himself, yelling at her across the crib.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Cinnabar!  Stop!

            But Cinnabar doesn't even turn her head.  She just steps into
            her father's embrace.  But Pearl does seem to hear something.

            She looks back at Patrick, beneath the illusion of the room
            she sees him being pulled into the awful wall, and can hear
            him more clearly now.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      No!  Cinnabar, no!!!!

            Slowly, Pearl turns and looks into the mirror and she gets a
            full-length view of herself: a woman in ruined tatters of her
            old, rotted dress.

            Then, coming into her view in the mirror is her only daughter
            -- dancing with a decayed corpse.

<b>                                PEARL
</b>                      Noooooo!

            Pearl whirls and rips Cinnabar away from Bones, who at first
            sort of chuckles to himself.  But he stops laughing when
            Pearl grabs the nearest candle and presses the flame to her
            breast.  In a terrible whoosh, the dried old dress and Pearl
            are engulfed in flames.

<b>                                BONES
</b><b>                      NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
</b>
            Bones runs to Pearl and throws his arms around her, trying to
            smother the flames any way he can.

<b>                                PEARL
</b>                          (to Patrick and Cinnabar)
                      Get out!!!  Go!!!

            Cinnabar in a shattered daze on the floor, sees her mother in
            flames.

            Patrick desperately tries to escape his father's death grip. 
            Finally, with horrible sound, Patrick wrestles free from the
            wall, and from his father.

            He lurches free from them and makes it over to Cinnabar and
            drags her out the door just as the room dissolves around
            them.  As the flames destroy the dress and the last vestiges
            of Bones' blood on it, the room begins to turn to ash.

            An eerie wind from nowhere begins to howl, blowing the ash
            and smoke from the dress and from the dissolving walls.

            Cinnabar taking one last glance at the funeral pyre that was
            her mother and Bones now, too, sees them almost lost in a
            shroud of flame and ash.

<b>            ANGLE AS
</b>
            Patrick and Cinnabar run down the corridor and back down the
            stairs, the moon overhead and the flames from Bones crib
            giving everything a flickering hellish cat.

            Everything behind and above them crumbling to dust.  The
            floor and then the stairs and all the howling bodies trapped
            inside.  

<b>            ON THE FIRST FLOOR
</b>
            They reach the open elevator shaft.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      We gotta jump!

<b>                                CINNABAR
</b>                      I can't!

            Everything around them rumbling and crumbling.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      We have to!

            Patrick jumps and lands in the muddy ashes, dazed but unhurt.

<b>            LOOKING UP
</b>
            He sees Cinnabar peering over the edge in fear.  Then, behind
            her, he can hear a low rumbling growl.  He sees Cinnabar turn
            and scream --

            Ashes and falling debris then temporarily blind hen he wipes
            his eyes and looks up, Cinnabar is gone from view.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Cinnabar!  Where are you!?

            He immediately climbs back up the shaft when he sees Cinnabar
            standing at the edge of the shaft above him.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Cinn!  Jump!!

            And she jumps, landing right next to Patrick, who quickly
            gets her to her feet.

<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Let's go!!!

            They run out of the shaft and into the sub-basement just as
            the elevator and shaft dissolve into ash.

            A hurricane wind blowing down and out of the shaft now. 
            Mixed with the sound of all the screaming, moaning souls in
            the Necropolis.

            Patrick in a fury to live tears away the boards and debris
            blocking the exit.  

            He pulls Cinnabar out with him and they walk up the cellar
            stairs, step into the dawn, weary, beaten down but not dead.

<b>            EXT. BONES' BUILDING - DAY
</b>
            They've made it out of the Inferno.  Like Dante said "Thus we
            emerged again to see the stars."  No stars here, just the
            glorious dawn.

            Patrick stops, feels the new sun on his face.  Breathes clean
            air again for the first time.

<b>                                PATRICK
</b>                      We made it...

            Then from behind or above or somewhere we can hear what might
            be a low, low chuckle.  Jimmy Bones' chuckle.

<b>                                BONES (O.S.)
</b>                      Dog eat dog, boy.  Dog eat dog...

            Patrick turns and spins in mounting horror.  There, behind
            him, right where Cinnabar was standing...

            The black dog.  It leaps right at the camera, filling the
            frame with huge teeth and bloody red tongue.  WE FREEZE.

<b>                                                          FADE TO BLACK.
