     OVER BLACK we HEAR the distant but near melodic CRY of a LOON.

     SLOWLY FADE IN TO:


     EXT. BLACK LAKE - NIGHT

     The loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts
     off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple.  The loon
     continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake,
     the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely
     call... until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under,
     silenced forever.  A lone feather surfaces and floats as:

     Credits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing "I CAN
     SEE CLEARLY NOW." Then--

     OVER BLACK

                         KEOUGH (O.S.)
               And they pay you for this?  To tag
               beaver?

                         WALT (O.S.)
               Imagine.

     As we FADE IN a face COMES INTO FOCUS from underwater.  It is
     the face of WALT LAWSON (Maine Fish And Game) looking down from
     a boat.


     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     Next to him is SHERIFF HANK KEOUGH, paunch, disposition of an
     untipped waiter.

                         KEOUGH
               Ask me, what an animal does in the
               wild is his own business so long as
               he doesn't do it to man.  I think
               Mark Twain said that.

                         WALT
                    (dry)
               I think he didn't.  But since
               you've said it, I guess we're
               covered.

     Keough holds a stare.  Walt drops overboard.  Keough pulls a
     Twinkie from his pocket.  Begins to unwrap.


     EXT. NEW YORK - MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY


     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     FIND  KELLY SCOTT, pretty, thirty, as KEVIN CAMPBELL, forties,
     approaches.

                         KEVIN
               Kelly.

                         KELLY
                    (warmly)
               Kevin, hey.

     She beams affection, he exudes a little discomfort.

                         KEVIN
               Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a
               second?

                         KELLY
                    (great idea)
               Absolutely.


     INT. KEVIN'S OFFICE - DAY

     They enter ON THE CUT, he closes the door.

                         KEVIN
               I had a great time last night.
               Again.

                         KELLY
               Me too.

     Reading his look, she suddenly smells it.  Her face drops.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
                    (deducing)
               That's not what you came to say.

                         KEVIN
               You work for me.  I'm not
               comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...

     She's a little crushed.

                         KELLY
               I was working for you when "us"
               started, what's--

                         KEVIN
               I know and I thought I could handle
               it but work and pleasure along with
               somebody else, it's a dangerous
               mix.

                         KELLY
               Kevin, as long as we...
                    (suddenly)
               What was that last part?

                         KEVIN
                    (sheepish)
               The somebody else part?

                         KELLY
               Yeah, that part.  There's...
               somebody who's um...

                         KEVIN
                    (feels terrible)
               Else.

     A beat.

                         KELLY
                    (covering)
               Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This
               uh... this probably wasn't meant to
               be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I
               gotta be ten years younger and you,
               you... you're y'know...

                         KEVIN
                    (reading her mind)
               A jerk.

                         KELLY
                    (you have no idea)
               Oh...
                    (then)
               No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm
               just thrown, I'm...
                    (checks her watch)
               I actually have an early lunch,
               so...

                         KEVIN
               It's ten after nine.

                         KELLY
               Yes, well...
                    (smiling)
               famished.

     And she rushes out of the room.  OFF Kevin, we:

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

     Walt dives down, visibility is lousy. Whether it's algae or
     dense vegetation, the water is extremely murky.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Keough unwraps the second Twinkie.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Walt continues to swim.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Not much to look at.  Then suddenly... no, just a snapping
     turtle swimming away.  Walt descends a little deeper.  He loves
     it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere
     else.  Next best thing to meditation.  Suddenly, he stops
     kicking.

     HIS EYES FOCUS

     A black water snake, it must be almost three feet in length.

     RESUME

     Walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look.  The snake
     seems unimpressed.  Then suddenly, the snake lunges at him,
     misses.  Shit.  Walt's look says "what the fuck?"  A beat.  Then
     the snake swims off.  Walt relaxes.  A beat.  But then... he
     looks around, uneasy.  He gets this feeling he's not alone down
     there.  Looks about, nothing but murky water.  But he's not
     alone, we can feel he's not alone.

     He looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering,
     looking back at him.  What's with these snakes?  Walt decides
     he'll go back to the boat.  Then... BOOM.  Something hits him...
     and it's no snake.


     EXT. BOAT - CONTINUOUS

     Keough.  Oblivious.  Waiting.  Suddenly-- Walt comes thrusting
     up with a scream!

                         WALT
               Sheriff!!

     And Walt is promptly yanked back under.

                         KEOUGH
               Hey!

     Upon which Walt surfaces.  He swims frantically for a beat
     before he's suddenly yanked under again.  Then he surfaces,
     thrashing as Keough speeds over with the boat.  He takes hold of
     him and pulls him on board.  Actually... what's left of him.
     There's nothing below the waist.  Walt is just a bleeding torso,
     though still conscious.

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
                    (going into shock)
               Jesus Christ.

     ANGLE WALT'S REMAINING HAND

     clenching around Keough's arm.

     ANGLE WALT'S FACE

     He knows he's done.  OFF Keough's continued horror, we:

                                             CUT TO:

     BLACK AND WHITE

     A DINOSAUR (T-Rex) is angry and out for blood.

     REVEAL


     INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

     We're watching an old classic creature feature.  FIND Kelly
     alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense... watching the movie.
     As the suspense builds, her hand freezes halfway between the
     popcorn bag and her mouth.

     ANGLE THE SCREEN

     The monster pursues its human victim.

     ANGLE KELLY

     fear on her face.

     ANGLE THE SCREEN

     The monster makes its final surge, capturing its prey.

     ANGLE KELLY

     as she screams with fear and delight.  Her scream is only
     partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers.

     After a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again.  Wearing
     gullibility, vulnerability all over her face.  Then from behind
     a hand appears, taps her shoulder, causing her to let loose with
     the most blood-curdling scream of all.

     All the moviegoers turn to SEE... as will WE:

     MYRA OKUBO

     Thirties, standing mortified; the woman who tapped her shoulder.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

     Kelly and Okubo emerge from the movie theater.

                         KELLY
               What do you expect, mugging me from
               behind?

                         OKUBO
               I tapped you.

                         KELLY
               Well you shouldn't have.  How did
               you even know where I was.

                         OKUBO
                    (sarcastic)
               Wild guess.

                         KELLY
               I don't like to be scared, Myra, I
               have a thing about fright, don't
               ever scare me.

                         OKUBO
               Kevin told me you were upset.

                         KELLY
               Really?  I never realized he was so
               psychic, how could he detect that,
               did he tell you there's somebody
               else?

                         OKUBO
                    (sheepish)
               Well... he didn't have to tell me
               that part.

     Kelly freezes.  Stares at her.  Then:

                         KELLY
               You?

                         OKUBO
               It started before you, Kelly, I
               never would've--

                         KELLY
               You?

                         OKUBO
               It was just a quick thing which we
               thought was over, and and...

                         KELLY
               You and Kevin.

                         OKUBO
               It wasn't suppose to happen, I
               don't know what to say...

     A beat.

                         KELLY
               You don't know what to say, lucky
               for you action speaks louder than
               words.

                         OKUBO
               Kelly--

                         KELLY
               I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just
               never thought of you as a y'know...

                         OKUBO
               Backstabber?

                         KELLY
                    (don't be silly)
               No.

                         OKUBO
               Liar?

                         KELLY
                    (c'mon)
               Myra.

                         OKUBO
               Shitbutt?

                         KELLY
               I really... I should get back.

     And Kelly peels off to go on her way.  Bumps into a Pedestrian.
     She then gives him an angry shove, under--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
                    (to the pedestrian)
               Don't fuck with me!

     And off she goes.  The Pedestrian and Okubo exchange a look.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     Coroner's ambulance.  Walt's covered body is being loaded, as
     JACK WELLS, Fish and Game, thirty, emerges from his truck.  He
     approaches the body.  Lifts up the sheet.  Stares a beat in
     disbelief.  Turns to Keough.

                         JACK
               What did this?

     OFF Keough, we:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Kelly's in her office, working at her desk.  Kevin enters.

                         KEVIN
               Hey.

                         KELLY
               Kevin.  How's it going, what's
               happenin', family good, great, nice
               to catch up, get out.

                         KEVIN
               This is business.
                    (then)
               There was an accident in Maine,
               some guy got killed by something in
               a lake.  Probably a bear, but...
               they found a tooth.

                         KELLY
               A tooth?

                         KEVIN
               A tooth they say couldn't have come
               from any bear.  They say it looks
               prehistoric.  Like maybe a
               dinosaur.

                         KELLY
                    (without looking up)
               Oh, well then I'm sure that's it,
               he got killed by a dinosaur,
               anything else?

                         KEVIN
               I want you to go there.

     Now she looks up.

                         KELLY
               Sorry?

                         KEVIN
               I'm sure it's nothing, but you're
               a paleontologist, this is what we
               do, I--

                         KELLY
               This is what we do?

                         KEVIN
               I'd like you to check out this
               lake.  See--

                         KELLY
               Are you on drugs?

                         KEVIN
               Kelly--

                         KELLY
               I'm not going to Maine, I won't
               even go west of Forty-third Street--

                         KEVIN
               Part of our research--

                         KELLY
               I'm not even a field person.

                         KEVIN
               Well on this one I'd like you to
               be.

     Kelly stares back.  The nickle drops.

                         KELLY
               This was Myra's idea, wasn't it?
               Get me out of the office for a few
               days, until--

                         KEVIN
               It has nothing to do with--

                         KELLY
               I never do field work and even if
               I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of
               a dinosaur who bit somebody,
               couldn't you dream up something--

                         KEVIN
               Kelly--

                         KELLY
               I am not going to Maine.  That's
               ridiculous.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. MAINE SKIES - DAY

     A sea helicopter is sailing up against the blue sky, nothing but
     Evergreens and lakes below.


     INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

     Kelly with the Pilot.  She looks a little white.


     INT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY

     Kelly is walking with Keough toward the morgue.

                         KEOUGH
               He just came up screaming.

                         KELLY
               Did he say anything?

                         KEOUGH
               He just kinda gurgled.  He was
               pretty much dead.

                         KELLY
               And you didn't see anything?

                         KEOUGH
               The lake was dead calm until up he
               came.  The tooth is in there.

                         KELLY
                    (seeing)
               There?  That's the morgue.

                         KEOUGH
               Yes.

                         KELLY
               Is the dead guy in there?

                         KEOUGH
               That's where they keep them.
                    (then)
               You want me to bring the tooth out
               here?

                         KELLY
               Um.
                    (bravado)
               No, no.  Let's go.


     CLOSE ON THE TOOTH

     Reveal--

     INT. MORGUE - DAY

     The Medical Examiner, STEVEN DANIELS, is there with Keough and
     kelly.  Walt's torso is covered.  Kelly is examining the tooth.

                         KELLY
               I need to get a microscopic look at
               it.

                         DANIELS
               Fine.
                    (indicating)
               There you go.

                         KELLY
               Maybe I should see...
                    (the body)

                         KEOUGH
                    (reading her)
               I wouldn't.

                         KELLY
               I'm fine, thank you.

                         KEOUGH
               Have you ever seen a dead body
               before, Ms. Scott?

                         KELLY
               Well.
                    (admits)
               At wakes.

                         KEOUGH
               This is a little different.

                         KELLY
               I can look at dead things.

     And Daniels is about to pull the sheet back--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Wait.

     She takes a breath.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Okay.

     And Daniels peels back the sheet.  Kelly strains to disguise her
     extreme horror.  Finally--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
                    (fighting off nausea)
               This... how long did this attack go
               on for?

                         KEOUGH
               Seconds.  Three, four.

                         KELLY
               And this is how he came to the
               boat?

                         KEOUGH
               Yes.

                         KELLY
               Okay.
                    (then)
               And is there a place nearby I could
               go to vomit?

     OFF this, we:

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. INDIGO MAINE - DAY

     It's a small, almost tiny town; general store, post office, fire
     station.  Kelly and Keough are in front of the general store
     loading supplies into a van, across the street in front of the
     Sheriff's Department.

                         KEOUGH
               Nobody lives within twenty-five
               miles, 'cept some old couple who
               live right on the lake.  Teenagers
               trek in every once in a while, none
               have disappeared, and none have
               spotted anything unusual.

                         KELLY
               You talk to the married couple?

                         KEOUGH
               Not yet.

                         KELLY
               What kind of backup do we have?

                         KEOUGH
               We?

     That strikes a nerve.

                         KELLY
                    (defensive)
               What?

                         KEOUGH
               Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear
               as to why the Museum of Natural
               History would send somebody here.

                         KELLY
               You have a thing against museums?

                         KEOUGH
               I got nothing against--

                         KELLY
               Ever even been in one?

     He stares back.  Then picks up a huge cannon-like gun.  As he
     loads it--

                         KELLY
               What is that?

                         KEOUGH
               Lightweight Forward Area air device
               unit.  Whatever's out there, one
               shot with this and he's dead.

                         KELLY
                    (incredulous)
               And you stock these things for
               what, to fend off Russia?

     A beat.

                         KEOUGH
               You're sort of a rude person.

                         KELLY
               It's just that--

     Suddenly, like a shot, Kelly's arm jerks up as she jet sprays a
     white fog from a can of Yard Guard.  Keough holds a look at her.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Mosquitos.  I have a thing about
               mosquitos.

     Upon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up, it's marked "Maine
     Fish And Game".  Jack Wells emerges, Kelly's eyes scan him like
     radar.

                         JACK
               We set?

                         KEOUGH
               Ready.
                    (re Kelly; dry)
               A museum in New York sent us some
               additional back up.

     Kelly shoots Keough a look.  Then:

                         KELLY
               Kelly Scott.

                         JACK
               Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?

                         KELLY
               Are we all museum bigots in Maine?

     Jack holds a look, decides to let that pass.

                         JACK
               Did you make anything of the tooth?

                         KELLY
               Yes, it did seem prehistoric but
               I'm sure he just carried the thing
               for luck.  Not that it worked,
               obviously.  It probably somehow got
               lodged into his body.

     Jack holds another look.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Why are you staring at me?
                    (to Keough)
               Do I have a smudge on my face, it
               would be so you not to have told
               me.

     Keough also lets that pass.

                         KEOUGH
                    (to Jack)
               I'm ready when you are.

                         JACK
               Let's go.

     As they start out, Kelly grabs Jack by the arm.

                         KELLY
               Excuse me.  One other thing, it's
               a small point, but... I have a
               thing about being humored, and I'm
               feeling humored, more by him, but
               you seemed quick to join in.

                         JACK
               Ma'am, your first impression isn't
               going well.

     As JANINE POST, sixteen, flirtatious little vixen, steps up.

                         JANINE
               Excuse me?  Is it true you're going
               to look for some kind of monster in
               Black Lake?

                         KEOUGH
               We're just going to investigate an
               accident.  There's no monster.

                         JANINE
               We heard a man got bit in half.

                         KEOUGH
               There was an accident, that's all.
               Nothing to worry about.

     And Janine goes into the store.  The men just watch her go.
     Sixteen going on twenty, nubile.  Kelly just looks at the men,
     gaping at the girl.

                         KELLY
               Please.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     Keough, Jack, and Kelly are in a boat motoring towards a
     farmhouse.  No other houses in sight.


     INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

     Jack, Kelly and Keough are questioning DELORES BICKERMAN, mid-
     sixties, eccentric if not slightly daffy.  She's brought out
     refreshments.

                         BICKERMAN
               Oh, my husband passed away almost
               two years ago.

                         KEOUGH
               My department doesn't have any
               record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.

                         BICKERMAN
                    (with some attitude)
               Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't
               realize you keep such a firm track
               of the dead.

                         KELLY
                    (gently)
               What was the cause of your
               husband's death, Ma'am, do you
               know?

     Off Bickerman's silence--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               We don't mean to invade your
               privacy but... was he ill, was he
               sick?

                         KEOUGH
               Was he swallowed?

                         KELLY
                    (reprimanding)
               Sheriff.

                         JACK
               Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're
               up here... a man was fatally
               attacked yesterday by some animal
               in this lake.  Do you know how your
               husband died?

                         BICKERMAN
                    (brightly)
               Oh yes.  I killed him.

     Keough clenches his eyes shut.  The old woman's a loon.

                         JACK
               You killed him.

                         BICKERMAN
                    (happily)
               Oh, yes.

                         KEOUGH
               And how would you have accomplished
               this, Ma'am?

                         BICKERMAN
                    (rattling it off quickly,
                     simply)
               Well, he was very ill and he
               refused to go see a doctor and
               well... I think he had Alzheimer's,
               he would be coherent one day,
               incoherent the next and one
               coherent day, he asked me to end
               his suffering.  I wouldn't do it
               but he kept insisting and insisting
               and deteriorating till the point
               the only cognitive thing he could
               really do was that I finish him
               off.  Finally I just gave in and
               hit him on the head with a skillet
               then buried him under the bulkhead.

     Jack, Keough, and Kelly just stare back at this crazy woman.
     Off their looks--

                         BICKERMAN (CONT'D)
                    (to Keough)
               Dig him up if you don't believe me,
               Javert.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     Keough and Kelly are in the boat slowly traveling along the
     thickly wooded shoreline.

                         KEOUGH
               Half mile up, there's a clearing.

                         JACK
               You gonna dig up that lady's
               husband?

                         KEOUGH
               I'll call the coroner.

                         KELLY
                    (looking around)
               What is with this lake?  It looks
               black and... there are no waves or
               anything.

                         KEOUGH
               They wanted to call it Lake Placid.
               But somebody said that name was
               taken.

                         KELLY
                    (to Jack)
               Gee.

     Jack smiles, gets her sarcasm.

                         KEOUGH
               The tents were sent ahead, they
               should already be set-up.

                         KELLY
                    (what?)
               We're staying in tents?

                         KEOUGH
               I told you.  Two days, we'd have to
               camp.

                         KELLY
               Yes, camp, I thought that meant
               Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents",
               will there be toilets?

                         KEOUGH
                    (seeing something)
               What the hell?

     Keough's attention has been otherwise arrested.  He sees
     something in the water.

                         KELLY
               What?

                         KEOUGH
                    (slowing the boat)
               I thought I saw...

                         KELLY
               It looks like a branch.

     He leans over to grab something floating in the water.  Looks
     like a branch.  He lifts it up, revealing it to be an antler.
     Connected to the severed head of a moose.  Keough, seeing it as
     he lifts it, screams, throwing it.

     It hits Kelly and she screams, a blood-curdling scream, as the
     HEAD hits the floor of the boat with a HEAVY THUD.  Kelly rears
     back, still screaming, and belts Keough in the shoulder.

                         KEOUGH
               Hey!!

                         KELLY
               You threw it at me!!

                         KEOUGH
                    (denying)
               I just let go of it.

                KELLY                       JACK
       You threw it at me!!       Alright.
           (to Jack)
       Did you see that?

     She belts him again.

                KEOUGH                      JACK (CONT'D)
       Stop hitting me!           Ma'am!

                         KELLY
               Don't throw heads at me,
                    (to Jack)
               and stop calling me "Ma'am"!

     ANGLE THE HEAD

     RESUME

     A beat.  This head looks ripped off the body.

                         JACK
               What is going on here?


     EXT. BEACHSIDE CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER

     A small tent camp is being set up.  People unpacking.  Two
     Deputies, BURKE and STEPHENS, present.  Kelly is with Jack.

                         KELLY
               How big do the bears get?

                         JACK
               Big but... a bear couldn't do that
               to a moose or man in water.  On
               land maybe.  But...

                         KELLY
               And they're sure he didn't get
               tangled under the outboard somehow?

                         JACK
               Hank says he's sure.

     Kelly takes in the scenic surroundings.

                         KELLY
               It really is beautiful, isn't it?

                         JACK
               Never been to Maine before?

                         KELLY
               I was told they discriminate
               against people with hygiene.
                    (off Jack)
               I never believed it.

     He measure her.  Then--

                         JACK
               Why are you here?  Really.

                         KELLY
               I told you.

                         JACK
               The Museum of Natural History
               doesn't send out investigators to--

                         KELLY
               How would you know, what--

                         JACK
               And even if they did, I doubt he or
               she would have problems with tents.

                         KELLY
               So I don't like tents, why--

                         JACK
               You don't like tents, mosquitos,
               look at your fingernails, you have
               about as much business being in the
               woods--

                 KELLY                      JACK (CONT'D)
       What's wrong with my       --as Emily Post, it doesn't
       fingernails these are      make sense--
       perfectly good--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (overriding)
               They sent you out to examine a tooth,
               why are you out here on the on the lake?

     A beat.  Might as well tell.

                         KELLY
               I am a paleontologist.
                    (throwing it out)
               I also was dating my boss he turned
               out to be involved with a co-worker
               who was also my friend and for the
               sake of comfort, theirs, I was
               shipped off to Maine.
                    (then)
               I don't feel like going back yet.

     There.  She said it.  He stares back.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               I'm not making it up.

                         JACK
               Well.  You don't have to stay out
               here, why don't--

                         KELLY
               I've come, I'm here, I'm staying.
               Unless there are ticks.

     We then HEAR the SOUND OF A DESCENDING HELICOPTER.  She looks
     up.  Then:

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Oh my God.

                         JACK
               What?

                         KELLY
               If this is who I think it is.
                    (as it gets closer)
               It is.

                         JACK
               Who?

                         KELLY
               Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook
               mythology professor.  He's done
               some work with our museum.  He also
               treks the world to swim with
               crocodiles.

                         KEOUGH
                    (arriving)
               With what?

                         KELLY
               Crocodiles.  He's an expert on
               them.  And if he's here... then he
               must think that's what's in this
               lake.

                         JACK
               In Maine?

                         KELLY
               There have been Northern sightings.
               But not this North.

     As HECTOR CYR, this giant ball of life, deboards his chopper--

                         HECTOR
                    (spotting Kelly;
                     disappointed)
               You beat me.  Balls.
                    (then)
               I need some of you to help me
               unpack.
                    (to Burke and Stevens)
               You and you.
                    (to Keough)
               Not you.
                    (to Kelly)
               Who do we have from Fish And Game?

               KEOUGH                      JACK
            (to Kelly)                 Me.
         Who is this man?

                         HECTOR
                    (rapid fire)
               I could see the algae blooms just
               coming in, how long has this lake
               been stagnant?
                    (extending his hand to
                     Keough)
               Hi, Hector Cyr.  The Earth is round
               and so should you be.

                         KEOUGH
                    (to Kelly)
               --Who is he?

                         HECTOR
               I'll need any and all topographic
               studies.

                         KEOUGH
               Wait just a second.  You don't just
               fly in here and start barking
               orders.

                         HECTOR
               I apologize, I just don't want to
               lose the light, we've got time for
               a quick scout,
                    (to Kelly)
               you've had work done.

                 KELLY                KEOUGH
            (flaring)             (frustrated)
       I have not.           Who is this man?

                         HECTOR
               Hector Cyr, I said it once, let me
               know when it sinks in,
                    (to Kelly)
               have you seen it?

                 KELLY                      KEOUGH (CONT'D)
       No.                        Mister...

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               It couldn't be a crocodile.

                         HECTOR
               They've been migrating north,
               Kelly, this lake connects to the
               ocean,--

                         KEOUGH
                    (frustrated)
               Mr. Cyr!

                         HECTOR
               C'mon, we're losing light,
                    (to Kelly)
               why does the big one heckle me?

     Kelly yanks him aside.

                         KELLY
                    (sotto)
               Hector.  The big one has no sense
               of humor.  And since he's the one
               who decides whether you get to
               play, try not to be your obnoxious
               self.

                         HECTOR
               That hurt my feelings.

     And it did a little.  Hector is a big Teddy Bear.

                         JACK
                    (arriving)
               If we're gonna go we better go.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - SUNSET

     Keough and Kelly are in one canoe, Hector and Jack are alongside
     in another.  Hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar
     devices.  The calm.  The still.  The beauty.

                         HECTOR
               If he's here, I'll find him.
                    (to Jack, re Kelly)
               Did she tell you we had sex
               together?

                         KELLY
               I never had sex with you!

                         HECTOR
               Even so, you're allowed to boast.
               You look thin by the way, I've
               mentally undressed you, I can see
               your ribcage.

                         KEOUGH
               I really don't mean to be
               discourteous.
                    (patronizing)
               But how is it a person could come
               to believe that a crocodile is in
               New England?

                         HECTOR
               They have saltwater glands, they
               can swim across oceans, it's only
               a matter of time.

                         KEOUGH
               And what would he do come winter?

                         HECTOR
               They can survive winter.  As long
               as their nostrils don't freeze,
               they survive,
                    (to Kelly)
               am I foolish to explain things, he
               had such trouble with my name?

                  KELLY                    KEOUGH
              (scolding)          Hey.
       Hector.

                         HECTOR
                    (to Keough)
               Is this where it happened?

                         KEOUGH
               Around here.  Yeah.

                         HECTOR
                    (knows his crocodiles)
               If he's eaten in the area, he
               shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang
               around the food source.

                         KELLY
               But they're nighttime hunters,
               Hector, he'd probably be on land
               now anyway.

                         HECTOR
               'Cept he wasn't before, was he?
                    (then to Keough)
               You know, when friends or family
               members say things, they tend not
               to register so sometimes it helps
               to hear it from a total stranger.
               You're fat.

                         KELLY
               Hector.

     Suddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty
     feet away.

                         JACK
               What's that?

                         KEOUGH
               White perch.

                         JACK
               Are they feeding?

                         KEOUGH
               Doesn't look like it.

                         JACK
               They look like they're jumping.

                         KELLY
               They look scared.

     Upon which something grabs the front of Kelly's canoe and with
     one crisp yank, flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table,
     sending them all flying.

     In an instant, Keough and Kelly are swimming for their lives.
     Screaming/yelling, they scramble for the canoe, climb onto it's
     flipped-over back.  Breathless, they all exchange confused
     looks.  "What the hell happened"?

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               My hair.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNDOWN

     Kelly, still in wet clothes, is talking on her portable phone.
     Keough is there as Hector approaches.  Jack is approaching as
     well.  Activity bustles in the b.g.

                         KELLY
                    (into her phone)
               None of us actually saw anything.
                    (then)
               I realize this Sir, but something
               flipped us over, I doubt very much
               it was a mink.

                         HECTOR
               What's going on?

                         KEOUGH
               They don't believe her.

                         KELLY
                    (still into phone)
               Thank you, it's so rewarding to
               imagine my tax dollar finding its
               way to you, you Fucker.
                    (she clicks off)

                         HECTOR
               Such the flirt.

                         KELLY
               U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody
               without a confirmation.

                         JACK
               Same thing from Fish And Game.

                         KELLY
               Something's in that water.

                         JACK
               Well until we see it, we're not
               gonna be convincing too many
               people.

     As DEPUTY SHARON GARE approaches--

                         GARE (O.S.)
                    (calling)
               Sheriff.

     Keough looks over.

                         GARE
                    (pointing to the ground)
               You might want to see this.

     They all walk over.

     ANGLE THE GROUND

     There's hundreds, maybe a thousand worms squirming,
     surrounding... a human toe.

                         KELLY (O.S.)
               Oh God, worms.  I got a thing about
               worms.

     RESUME

                         GARE
               It's a human toe.

     Hector studies it, picks it up.  Then--

                         HECTOR
               Some decomposition, little acidic,
               it has been swallowed.
                    (to Keough; holding the
                     toe)
               Is this the man who was killed?

     Keough deadpans back.  Then--

                         KEOUGH
               We'd only just met.

                         HECTOR
               Well, you've got a croc alright,
               they're keystone species.

                         KEOUGH
               Keystone what?

                         HECTOR
               Species, keystones affect the
               entire ecosystem, that could
               explain all these worms, the water.
               You've got a crocodile.
                    (proffering the toe)
               Bury your friend.

     Hector gives the toe to Keough, then heads off.  Keough stands
     there, holding the tow, as we:

     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     Kelly is testing a MACHINE that sends out little SQUEAKY SOUNDS,
     as Jack approaches.  He stops.  Takes a second to... well,
     admire her.  She's an attractive woman.  He then approaches.

                         JACK
               Baby crocs?

                         KELLY
               Adult males will charge hatchlings.
               If there's one out there...

                         JACK
               If one could be out there... why
               does Fish And Game tell me it's
               impossible?

                         KELLY
               Because they just consult their
               little indigenous charts.

     A beat, as she tends to her work.

                         JACK
               Listen... if you really do know
               crocs, you should know how stealth
               like they are.  I wouldn't be
               standing a foot from the water.

     She looks.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               He could be right there and you
               wouldn't see him.

                         KELLY
                    (still looking at the
                     water)
               I'd be able to see something.

     Upon which, Jack tosses a rock over her shoulder.  As it makes
     a splash, she screams and practically jumps into his arms.
     Then:

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
                    (realizing)
               Oh that's funny.  That was real
               funny.

     And she heads off.  OFF Jack, we:

     EXT. HECTOR'S TENT - NIGHT

     Two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of
     his tent.  From within we HEAR MUSIC, the SOUNDS of a PARTY.
     Keough approaches... looks at Deputy Burke, who's digging.

                         BURKE
                    (shrugs)
               He paid us.  Five hundred.

     Keough continues on toward the tent.


     INT. HECTOR'S TENT - CONTINUOUS

     His tent is on the palatial side.  Stereo, generator, he's got a
     margarita bar going.  There's a party.  Hector's dancing with
     Deputy Gare, others are enjoying the drinks and MUSIC.

                         HECTOR
               You're a beautiful woman.

                         GARE
               Thank you.

                         HECTOR
               And law enforcement, such dangerous
               work.  The idea that you could die
               suddenly with no offspring,
               disconcerting, let's mate, commit
               your genes to perpetuity.

     Upon which, Keough enters, doesn't like what he sees.

                         KEOUGH
               Hey.

     He goes, turns OFF the MUSIC.

                         KEOUGH
               We are here on official business.

                         HECTOR
               Cocktail?

                         KEOUGH
               No!!
                    (then)
               What's with digging the holes?

                         HECTOR
               They come on land and they're
               brazen.  They're also attracted to
               noise, you can see I make a lot of
               it.

                         KEOUGH
               Everybody out, back to your tents,
               now!

     They start to leave.

                         HECTOR
                    (re Gare)
               Could she stay, we've tentatively
               scheduled intercourse.

                         KEOUGH
               No!!  Out!

     And they all go, including Gare, who shrugs to Keough "he's kind
     of funny".

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
                    (to Hector)
               You listen to me.  The only reason
               I'm letting you be part of this is
               'cause you got the helicopter and
               the radar--

                         HECTOR
               And you like me.

                         KEOUGH
               I do not like you.

                         HECTOR
               Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing
               fond of you and it's liberating to
               say so.

     Keough stares back.

                         KEOUGH
               You're a whacko.

     And Keough leaves, to:


     EXT. CAMPSIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     As Keough heads off--

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
               That hurt my feelings.

     A CAMPFIRE

     REVEAL--

     EXT. BEACH CAMPSITE - NIGHT

     Kelly stands, alone, skipping stones.  After a beat, Jack
     approaches.

                         JACK
               What are you doing?

                         KELLY
               Skipping stones.  Look how flat
               that water is, you can get ten
               skips on a good one.

     A beat.

                         JACK
               Listen, uh... Hank and I think it
               best if you stay on shore.

                         KELLY
               I beg your pardon?

                         JACK
               Whatever's out there did flip over
               a canoe--

                         KELLY
               I am not staying on shore.

                         JACK
               It's too dangerous for--

                         KELLY
               I didn't fly up here to roast
               marshmallows--

                         JACK
               You flew up here because your boss--

                         KELLY
               I am going out on that boat and why
               are you picking on me, is this some
               kind of--

            KELLY (CONT'D)                  JACK
       hazing, new fingernails    I'm not picking--
       in the woods?

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (overriding)
               I'm beginning to see why you were
               shipped off.

     And her face falls.

                         KELLY
                    (wounded; quietly)
               That was an awful thing to say to
               me.

                         JACK
                    (feels bad now)
               I'm sorry but you're...

     A beat. He doesn't finish the sentence.

                         KELLY
                    (genuine)
               I do know crocodiles and I won't
               get in your way.
                    (then)
               I really do want to be a part of
               this.

     Jack reads her, he can see that she does.

                         JACK
               Okay.
                    (then)
               We're up at six.

                         KELLY
               Good.

                         JACK
                    (a beat)
               'Night.

     There's a little chemistry here, though both would probably deny
     it.  He heads off toward his tent, she sits with her book.  She
     gives one last look, watches him go.  Then she goes back to her
     book.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. LAKE - MUCH LATER

     The lake is still, the campfire is out, the tents are quiet.
     The quiet SOUNDS of NIGHT.  CRICKETS.  A LOON.  An OWL.  A
     courageous raccoon looks about, seeing what he can rummage.  By
     the water... a black bear takes a drink.

     ANGLE KEOUGH'S TENT

     He emerges, compelled by a full bladder, wearing only his
     trousers, carrying a revolver.  He walks into the nearby woods.
     He removes from his shorts his bladder's connection to the
     outside world.  Proceeds to URINATE.  Then... he hears
     something.  The SOUND of RUSTLING LEAVES.  He STOPS URINATING,
     we HEAR a HALF SECOND of MOVEMENT.  Then quiet.  Must be his
     imagination.  He RESUMES his business.

     More RUSTLING, it's not just the sound of dense urine against
     leaves, he stops... something's out there in the darkness.
     Quiet.  He starts up for a second, STOPS QUICKLY, and we HEAR it
     for sure.  Something's RUSTLING TOWARDS him.  With his free
     hand, Keough pulls out his revolver.  More RUSTLING... Keough
     points the gun.  Something on the ground is coming toward him.
     He moves slowly, gun drawn, into the darkness.  The RUSTLING is
     getting LOUDER.  It's almost upon him.  A beat.  CLOSER.
     CLOSER.  Then Keough peels away a bush revealing:

     HECTOR

     Looking into a gun barrel.  He screams.  Keough screams.  Then--

                         HECTOR
               Jesus Christ!!

                         KEOUGH
               What the hell are you doing?!!

                         HECTOR
               What are you doing?!

                         KEOUGH
               You're crawling around like a--

                         HECTOR
               I'm laying a spring trap!

                         KEOUGH
               A spring trap!

                         HECTOR
               I keep telling you, they can come
               on land, I don't wanna wake up in
               the middle of the night--

                         KEOUGH
               I coulda shot you, you--

                         HECTOR
               This could end up saving your life,--

            HECTOR (CONT'D)                  KEOUGH
       You'll be glad you didn't    Hey look, I'm sure you
       shoot me then, you'll be     finished first in your
       tongue massaging my          class but I think you need
       hemorrhoids, just before     to be retired to the big rubber
       running off to get your      room, where you can play with
       sister pregnant, who you     soft stuffed reptiles.
       probably already call mom.

     And now all the others, awakened, are charging.

                         KELLY
                    (arriving)
               Hey!  What is going on?

                   HECTOR                    KEOUGH
       This man takes a pistol     He's crawling around--
       to pee!

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
                    (escalating)
               This is an official investigation,
               and this cuckoo bird is a civilian.
               I don't care how much money he's
               got, he's a total mental.

     And Hector storms off.  A beat.

                         KELLY
               You hurt his feelings.  I think you
               should go apologize.

                         KEOUGH
               Apologize?

                   KELLY                   KEOUGH (CONT'D)
       We're a team here.  It     He's a fruitcake!
       won't kill you to get
       along.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Look.  The thing about Hector... he
               takes this crocodile business
               very...
                    (how to say it)
               he thinks they're Godly.

     A beat.

                         JACK
               He thinks they're what?

                         KELLY
               In his defense, every primitive
               culture known to man deified them.
               He's a mythology professor, he
               thinks crocs are divine conduits.

                         KEOUGH
               Is this 'spose to make me take him
               more serious?

                         KELLY
               It's to make you understand him,
               with understanding comes tolerance.
               Too bad they don't put proverbs in
               Twinkies, my load would be lighter.

                         KEOUGH
                    (befuddled)
               Why does everybody insult my
               intelligence, I have intelligence,
               intelligent people eat Twinkies.

                         KELLY
               I'm sorry.

     Keough shoots a look to Jack.

                         JACK
               Let's just all get some sleep.

     And Keough heads off, under--

                         KEOUGH
               I'm an intelligent person.

     Upon which, he disappears from Earth.  He's stepped into one of
     Hector's pit traps.  A beat.

                         KEOUGH (O.S.)
                    (calmly)
               I shall kill him.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. LAKE - SUNRISE

     The steam is lifting off the lake.


     EXT. LAKE - MORNING

     Keough, Kelly, Hector, and Deputy Burke are cruising in the
     whaler.  Hector and Jack are both in full diving gear.  Jack
     also has a stick gun for protection.  Hector does not.

                         KEOUGH
               Again, I don't mean to be annoying
               with my questions.  But if it is a
               crocodile which I don't think it
               is.  And if they do charge these
               baby hatchling sounds...
                    (to Jack)
               why exactly would you want to be
               underwater at the time?
                    (to Hector)
               With you it makes sense.

                         HECTOR
               They don't really attack underwater
               and--

                         KEOUGH
               That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--

                         HECTOR
               No crocodile has ever--

                         KELLY
                    (to Hector)
               You should take a flax pole.

                         HECTOR
               And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He
               drowns.  You think about that?

                         KELLY
               I'm just saying last resort.

                         KEOUGH
               Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do
               we have a problem with it dying?

                         HECTOR
               Crocodiles don't sever with their
               teeth, their molars are blunt.

     As if that's suppose to clear it up.  Keough stares back
     blankly.  Then:

                         KEOUGH
               Is this a trick?

                         HECTOR
               What I'm saying is if it's a
               crocodile that cut a man in half he
               would have to be over twenty feet
               which would make him well over a
               hundred years old, it would be
               unthinkable to destroy him.

                         JACK
                    (to Burke)
               Alright, let's just drop here.

     Burke lowers the anchor, as Keough just continues to stare at
     Hector.  Kelly readies the hatchling recorder.  She lowers it
     into the water.

                         KELLY
               They respond pretty quick.  I'll
               wait till you get down before I
               turn it on.

                         JACK
               Good.
                    (climbing over)
               See ya soon.

                         KELLY
               Good luck.

     There was a twinge of real concern in her voice.  He makes eye
     contact with her.  Then drops over.  Goes under.

                         HECTOR
                    (to Kelly)
               Two years married, divorced, used
               to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still
               waiting on his sperm count.

                         KELLY
               What?
                    (off Hector's look)
               Oh as if I'm interested.

                         HECTOR
               As if.
                    (as he's about to go
                     overboard; to Keough)
               Will you miss me?

                         KEOUGH
                    (to Hector)
               I brought a pork chop, maybe we
               could hang it around your neck for
               luck.

                         HECTOR
               No thank you, but maybe later you
               can chew the bark off my big fat
               log.

     And Hector drops overboard.

                         KEOUGH
                    (to Kelly)
               Was that like a homo-sexual remark?

                         KELLY
                    (strict)
               I asked you to be nice to him.

     Keough rolls his eyes.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. UNDERWATER - ANGLE ON JACK - DAY

     Jack, diving.  We HEAR the HIGH PITCH of CROCODILE HATCHLINGS.
     Visibility is again pretty limited.


     EXT. LAKE - ANGLE ON HECTOR - UNDERWATER - DAY

     Hector dives through the dark black water.  Visibility is lousy.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

     Jack dives, searched.  Looks ahead, sees something... He moves
     closer... it's the carcass of the moose, no head.


     EXT. LAKE - AN HOUR LATER

     Kelly and Keough onboard.

                         KELLY
               He may be a kook but he's also been
               all over the world with them.  He
               even swam in the Grimetti with
               killer Niles all around him, he
               never got nipped.

                         KEOUGH
               And that's why he thinks they're
               Godly?

                         KELLY
               He said he knew it when he looked
               into their eyes.

                         KEOUGH
                    (simple)
               You like Jack?

                         KELLY
                    (thrown)
               What?  I don't even know the guy.

                         KEOUGH
               Hector thinks you like him.

                         KELLY
               Well Hector's a giant cracker.

                         KEOUGH
               You think Jack's handsome?

                         KELLY
               What is this?

                         KEOUGH
               I'm just curious.  I can never tell
               what women think is handsome.  Is
               he handsome?

                         KELLY
               Well.  He's probably rugged
               handsome I guess.  Yeah.

     A beat.

                         KEOUGH
               Am I?


     EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

     Jack and Hector, diving together.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. LAKE - TWO HOURS LATER

     The boats sit still on the dead calm water.  Kelly works the
     RADAR, Keough covertly eats a Twinkie.

                         KELLY
               It shouldn't be taking so long.

     They both scan the surface.  Dead calm.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector moves about.  We can hear the HATCHLING RECORDER, but
     he's not seeing anything.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - (ANOTHER AREA) - CONTINUOUS

     Jack looks about.  He looks up.  Doesn't see much but he gets an
     eerie feeling.  Something's out there.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Keough, Kelly, and Burke, standing idly, scanning the calm
     surface.

                         KEOUGH
                    (into headset)
               Hector, Jack, we show you with
               about twelve minutes of oxygen
               left, and you're on the last tank.
               Time to go home.

                         KELLY
               That was a bust.

     A beat.  Another beat.  Then... something jerks the boat a
     little.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               What was that?

                         KEOUGH
               I don't know.  It was like a tug.
               Something tugged us.

     Upon which something really yanks the boat.  So hard... Kelly
     flips over the back, into the water.

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
               Hey!

     The boat is moving, being dragged quickly.

                         BURKE
               Something's got the anchor line!

                         KEOUGH
               Kelly!!

     But Kelly's alone in the water, the boat being pulled away.

     RESUME

                         KEOUGH
                    (into headset)
               Jack!!  Hector!  We're being
               dragged!!
                    (as he starts the motor; to
                     Burke)
               Cut the line!  Cut the fucking
               line!

     Burke goes to work on the anchor line as we ANGLE Kelly,
     treading water, in the middle of nowhere.  She's completely
     vulnerable.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector, swimming for the surface.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Kelly, treading water.  FIND Keough on the boat, he now has the
     engine running, fighting against the drag but whatever has that
     boat has a fucking strong hold.

                         KEOUGH
               Cut the Goddamn rope!

                         BURKE
                    (working away)
               I'm trying!

     And finally, as he severs the rope the boat almost goes airborne
     with a jump, Burke nearly sails out.  Keough's boat then races
     to Kelly.

     ANGLE KELLY

                         KELLY
               Hurry up!!

     Suddenly about thirty feet away... we SEE fish breaking water.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Shit!!  Hank!!

     The boat is zooming toward her.  It arrives.  As Keough and
     Burke go to pull her aboard, we see a dark shadow rising.

                         BURKE
                    (screaming)
               Look out!!

     And Jack explodes out of the water, it was his shadow.  Keough
     and Burke pull them both aboard.

                         KEOUGH
                    (back to Kelly)
               Are you alright?

                         KELLY
               I think.  My hair.
                    (then)
               Where's Hector?!
                    (to Jack)
               Where is he?

                         JACK
               We went in different directions.
               That water is thick, you can't see
               through it!


     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector is swimming toward the surface.  Suddenly... a shadow
     looms over him.  He looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     There is no boat.  We can't see it, just a big shadowy mass.

     RESUME HECTOR

     He's scared.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

                         KEOUGH
                    (into headset)
               Hector!  Hector, we got dragged off
               position, when you surface, you
               gotta yell.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector is still charging toward the surface.  The lack of
     visibility is frightening, something could be six feet away and
     he wouldn't know it.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

                         KELLY
                    (pointing)
               There's bubbles over there!  Look!

     Keough quickly maneuvers the boat to where Kelly indicated,
     under--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               There he is.  Here he comes!

     And Keough has the boat to him as Hector breaks surface.

     And they quickly pull Hector on board, all attention is on
     Hector as they lean over to rescue him.  On the far right... two
     eyes... moving closer to the oblivious rescuers.

     Slowly moving in, everybody is so preoccupied with Hector,
     Deputy Burke, at the end of the boat, is leaning way over to see
     Hector.  If only he knew what he's not seeing.  The eyes come
     closer.  They're now in the water right below Burke's head.  How
     can he not see it?  A beat.  Another beat.  Then... suddenly, a
     mouth, a dragon, teeth, something, flashes from the water--
     snap.  And Deputy Burke's head is simply gone as his limp body
     hangs over the boat.  Kelly screams in horror.

     In a microsecond, Burke's head and life are both gone.  OFF
     their stunned faces, as Kelly continues to scream we:

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNSET

     Burke's body is being loaded into an ambulance.  People move in
     silence, the wake of tragedy.  A few State Troopers are on the
     scene.

                         KEOUGH
                    (giving a statement)
               Nobody actually saw it.  It
               happened sudden.

     PAN TO FIND Kelly, staring almost blankly, as Jack, finishing a
     phone call, approaches.  He measures her expression, she's still
     in shock.

                         JACK
               You okay?
                    (nothing)
               Kelly?

                         KELLY
               Yeah.
                    (then)
               Nobody saw anything?

                         JACK
               No.
                    (then)
               U.S. Wildlife is on their way.

                         KELLY
               That's probably good.

                         JACK
               Police want to keep it quiet, if
               the press gets word... lake
               monster.  They just want us to sit
               tight.

     ANGLE KELLY

     She is visibly undone, she appears almost to be fighting off
     shock.  Jack puts his hands on her shoulder to steady her.

                         JACK
               Are you okay?

                         KELLY
               Um... y'know...
                    (swallows)
               Yeah.

     Jack can see she's willing herself to be stoic.

                         JACK
               A man died.  You don't have to be
               so tough.

     She nods, appreciatively.  Part of her would love to collapse
     into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic.

                         KELLY
               I'm fine.  I uh... I'm fine.

     PAN TO FIND Keough, walking.  Still visibly shaken.  He
     unwittingly approaches Hector.  They hold a look.

                         HECTOR
                    (genuine)
               I'm sorry.

     A beat.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
               Was he a good man?

                         KEOUGH
               Yup.

                         HECTOR
               Whenever somebody dies I consider
               it such a waste that I didn't know
               him better.

     A beat.  Then--

                         KEOUGH
                    (fighting off disbelief;
                     shock maybe)
               His head was just... bitten off.

                         HECTOR
                    (sadly)
               I used to have this recurring
               nightmare that I was headless.

     Keough turns to stare at him with incredulity.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
                    (quietly rattling it off)
               I'd be on the ground looking up at
               my body, no head, walking around
               bumping into everything.  And my
               parents wouldn't let me in the
               house 'cause they'd just bought all
               these new antique lamps and they
               were afraid I'd knock them over,
               made sense, and meanwhile, the
               neighborhood bullies would see my
               round little head on the ground
               looking like a ball, and they'd
               come rushing over to start up a
               game of soccer.  I'd actually feel
               grateful just for being allowed
               into the contest, that's esteem for
               you, what are your thoughts?

     Keough has had enough of this guy.

                         KEOUGH
                    (a powder keg)
               You know, Hector, I'm sure you're
               a fine person in your own mental
               way.  But I think it would be best
               if you and I didn't speak.

     And Keough heads off.  He takes about four steps... then SNAP.
     Up goes his upside-down body like a rocket.  He's stepped in
     Hector's spring-bow trap.  A beat.  He swings upside-down like
     a pendulum.  Another beat.

                         HECTOR
               This is a setback.

                         KEOUGH
               You don't want to cut me down.
               'Cause I'll kill you.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     Kelly and Jack.

                         KELLY
               Hard to believe there could be a
               monster under such peacefulness.

                         JACK
               I thought I might track the
               shoreline tomorrow, look for
               prints.

     She just stares out as if she didn't hear.  And he fixes his own
     stare on her.  Feeling it, she turns, catches him looking at
     her, he diverts the stare.  She feigns a non-reaction.  A beat.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               You know they say the brain
               confuses fear for passion.

                         KELLY
               Excuse me?

                         JACK
               When you get scared, the brain
               releases a chemical, same chemical
               it releases when somebody's...
                    (a beat)
               in high school, the thing to do was
               to take the girl to a scary movie.

                         KELLY
               What are you talking about?

                         JACK
               I'm saying between the moonlight,
               a beautiful lake and a monster that
               bites heads off... you look good.

                         KELLY
               Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm
               all moist.

                         JACK
               Forgive me for trying to be nice.

                         KELLY
               Nice?  Nice would be "you look
               pretty," nice is not some man-
               eating monster has tricked my brain
               into making you look good.

                         JACK
               I didn't say it like that.

                         KELLY
               You did, you--

                         JACK
               I was trying to pay you a
               compliment, I was guising it as
               science 'cause I know you're
               comfortable in that arena.
               Science.

                         KELLY
               A man just died, you're hitting on
               me with science.

                         JACK
               Just forget it.

                         HECTOR
                    (arriving)
               Beg pardon?  Sorry to intrude but
               Hank seems to have gotten himself
               stuck in a tree.


     EXT. CAMPSITE - SECONDS LATER

     Hank hangs still, upside down, from the tree, as Hector, Kelly,
     and Jack approach.

                         HECTOR
               I probably could've accomplished
               freeing him myself but he had a
               look of mayhem on his upside down
               face.

     They arrive.  Hank says nothing, he hangs there perfectly still.

                         KELLY
               Hank?

                         KEOUGH
                    (calmly)
               Yes.

     The three exchange looks.

                         KELLY
               Are you okay?

                         KEOUGH
                    (calmly; almost sweet)
               Other than feeling slightly
               embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.
                    (then)
               Could you cut me down?

                         HECTOR
               Promise you won't kill me, first.

                         KEOUGH
                    (calmly)
               I have no interest in ever looking
               at you, Hector.
                    (again)
               Could you please cut me down?

     Jack gives Kelly a knife.

                         JACK
               You cut, we'll hold him.

     Hector and Jack grab hold, Kelly cuts, they lower him to the
     ground.  He rises.

                         KEOUGH
                    (calm)
               Thank you.
                    (then)
               I lied.

     And he charges after Hector, who runs toward the beach.  Keough
     chases, Jack and Kelly pursue, trying to stop him.  And
     suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging
     GROWL.  An attack.  Screams all over, a half-second of confusion
     before we SEE it's a large BLACK BEAR jumping out of the
     darkness, right at Hector.  Hector dives out of its path.
     Screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs.
     Seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water
     the giant jaws of a crocodile.

     In a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it,
     slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water.

     The bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only
     be one outcome here.  In a matter of seconds, both bear and
     crocodile have vanished.  And the water is calm again.

     ANGLE THE FACES

     Utter catatonia.  Shock.  Whatever they expected to find in this
     expedition, they weren't remote prepared for that.  There are
     no words here.  Shock is pre-empting every other human sensory.
     What they just saw... a crocodile head measuring five feet rise
     up out of the water and gobbled a fucking bear.  A beat.  Then--

                         KEOUGH
                    (admitting)
               Okay.  It's a crocodile.  I'll
               admit it.

     A beat as they gulp air.

                         KELLY
                    (to Jack)
               You're cut.

     There is a little blood over Jack's right eye.  He dabs it.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
                    (to Hector)
               He was an Indo-pacific.

                         HECTOR
                    (daunted)
               Are you sure?

                         KELLY
               Scales were oval.  It was an Asian
               crocodile.

                         KEOUGH
               Asia?  How... how could he get
               here?

                         HECTOR
               Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong
               flushed him down a toilet.

                         KELLY
               He had to be thirty feet long.

     Another beat.

                         JACK
                    (charged)
               Hank.  The little cannon you
               brought, get it.  Guard the
               shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done.
               We made the I.D., our job is
               finished.

                         KEOUGH
               Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I
               wanna know why that monster is
               here.  You got a theory?

                         KELLY
               Why he's that big, I don't know.
               Why he's here... the wetlands are
               being developed, crocodiles are
               moving.  Australia, Fiji, the
               things have started to cross
               oceans.

                         JACK
               But why Maine and why alone?  Crocs
               are social, why's this guy on the
               move by himself?

                         HECTOR
               Maybe he doesn't play well with
               others.

                         KEOUGH
               Is everything a big fucking joke to
               you?

                         HECTOR
                    (re his groin)
               Bite my bishop.

     And Keough starts for him, but Jack intercedes.

                         KEOUGH
               I'm sick of him!

               JACK                       HECTOR
           (interceding)        Let him go!  I'm sick of you
       C'mon.                   too, let him go.
                                      (then)
                                Thing about being rich, Sheriff,
                                my parents had the added luxury of
                                being able to ditch me off at Karate
                                school, I'm a brown belt.  So go
                                ahead.  Take your best shot.

     Keough throws a haymaker, decking Hector.  Lays him out.

                         KELLY
               Hank!

                         KEOUGH
                    (who knew?)
               He said he knew Karate!

                         HECTOR
                    (shaken)
               At school they'd always say "go"
               first.

                         JACK
                    (to Keough)
               Get your big gun and guard the
               shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.

                         HECTOR
                    (muttering as he goes)
               He never said "go".

                         JACK
                    (to Keough)
               Get the gun.

                         KEOUGH
                    (muttering as he goes)
               If I fall into a hole or get
               hoisted into a tree...

     And he's gone.

                         JACK
                    (re Keough and Hector)
               Like little children.
                    (then)
               You okay?

                         KELLY
               Yeah.  I got some stuff for your
               cut.

                         JACK
               I couldn't believe... did you see
               the size of that thing's mouth?

                         KELLY
               I wonder if he's some kind of
               mutant.
                    (then)
               That bear had to be surprised.

                         JACK
                    (taking her arm; ushering)
               Let's get away from the shore.

     She looks at his hand on her arm, which suddenly makes him self-
     consious.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               Sorry.

                         KELLY
               It's okay.

     They hold a look.


     EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

     We are at a small clearing on the other side of the lake.  A
     four-wheel-drive of some sort is bumping down a fairly
     unpassable dirt road into the clearing.

                         TOM (O.S.)
               Told you I could make it.

     As the jeep comes more INTO VIEW, we REVEAL its occupants to be
     six teenagers, including Janine, and TOM, STEVE, DANNY, CAROL,
     ELLEN.  They've been drinking but they're not sloppy drunk.  As
     they climb out, Tom points to a swing rope which extends from
     the branch of a tree that overhangs the water.

                         TOM
               There it is.

                         STEVE
                    (stripping)
               Last one in's a dead man.

     Could be more like first one in.  The teenagers begin to strip
     off their clothes.  As they giggle and laugh we:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. KELLY'S TENT - NIGHT

     Kelly is butterflying Jack's wound, necessarily working very
     close to him.

                         JACK
               Ow.  Shit.

                         KELLY
               Just gotta pull it a little
               tighter.

                         JACK
               Who taught you be be a nurse?

                         KELLY
               Father's a surgeon.  I can even
               stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a
               bad idea here.

                         JACK
               No thanks.

                         KELLY
               Keep it dry.  No swimming.

                         JACK
                    (dry)
               Thank you.

     They hold a look.  Then --

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               You're having the best time of your
               life, aren't you?

                         KELLY
                    (caught)
               What?  Why... people have been
               killed, I hardly think I'm having
               a good time, why would...
                    (off his look; copping)
               Does it show?

     Jack nods slightly.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               This is the first time I've
               actually... y'know been in the 
               middle of anything.  I've never
               really even gotten dirty before,
               with me showers have always been
               preventative.

     Their eyes are locked now, making her self-conscious and
     nervous.

                         JACK
               That's why you're here.  To get in
               the middle of something?

                         KELLY
               Maybe.  I've always read about
               what's happened.  I've never... I
               know it sounds silly but, it's nice
               to be someplace while something is
               actually... y'know... happening.

     Something is happening right now.  A beat.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               We should probably go to bed.
                    (quickly)
               Get rest, get some rest.  Go to our
               separate beds, get some rest.

     The Freudian slip of her life.  They hold another look.  Then he
     starts to exit.  He stops at the door, turns back.

                         JACK
               Thanks for the... bandaid.

                         KELLY
                    (please don't go)
               Night.

     He holds another look, then leaves.  OFF her punishing herself
     for both the slip of the tongue and for cutting the moment
     short.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT.  LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

     The teenagers are now skinny-dipping, having a grand ol'
     flirtatious time.  As they splash and frolic and cop their
     feels, we ANGLE... about fifty yards away.  Two eyes pop above
     the surface... followed by the snout.  GO TO:

     THE CROC'S P.O.V.

     Six fresh delicious teenagers.  Midnight buffet.

     RESUME

     the croc as he slowly starts to move.  The teenagers start to
     take turns, swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the
     shoreline.  As they laugh and yell, Danny swings on a long
     rope... landing with a splash.  About ten feet from the croc,
     waiting stealth-like, his eyes barely above surface.  He could
     easily go for Danny... but he somehow knows the service will get
     better.  As Danny swims back to shore, Janine takes hold of the
     rope.

                         JANINE
               Here I come.  Ready or not.

     And she swings away... a better swing than Danny's... and she
     splashes down about five feet from the eyes.  Again, the eyes
     don't move.  The teenagers cheer Janine's record-setting swing
     as Tom takes hold of the rope.

                         STEVE
               All or nothing, Tom.

                         TOM
               From the jaws of defeat...

     And he flies away.  It's a leap to die for.  As he splashes
     down... gulp.  Like a seal grabbing a fish... and Tommy has
     vanished.  The kids, cheering at the leap, stop cheering when
     Tommy fails to resurface.  A beat.  They first think he's
     playing a joke.

                         STEVE
               Ha ha.

     Another beat.  Still no sign of Tommy.

                         JANINE
                    (still in the water)
               Tommy?
                    (then)
               This isn't funny, Tommy.

     And now they're concerned.  They all move down toward the shore.

                         STEVE
               Tommy?

                         DANNY
               C'mon,  Tommy.

     And now they're starting to panic.

                         JANINE
               Where is he?

                         DANNY
                    (yelling)
               This isn't funny!!

     Suddenly-- thrusting up out of the water.  The crocodile, Tommy
     in its jaws.  Bloodcurdling screams from all as we:

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

     Hector and Keough both hear the screams of the teenagers.

                         HECTOR
               What's that?

                         KEOUGH
               It came from across the lake.


     EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

     Keough, Jack, and Deputy Stevens are in the boat, zooming
     towards the teenagers.

                         JACK
                    (to Keough)
               You said nobody came in here!

                         KEOUGH
               Obviously I was wrong!

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

     Hector and Kelly are flying toward the area, the search beams
     are on.

                                             CUT TO:


     CLOSE ON JANINE

                         JANINE
               He just took him in his jaws.

     REVEAL

     EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

     The teenagers have some or most of their clothes back on.
     Hector's chopper is hovering over the area, its beams lighting
     the water.  Lying on the beach, covered... is Tommy.  Alive.
     And basically unhurt!

                         KEOUGH
               He was in his mouth?!

                         JANINE
               Yes.

                         JACK
                    (stunned; to Tommy)
               You're okay?

                         TOMMY
                    (in shock)
               I think; just cuts.

                         DANNY
               The thing just came up out of the
               water and kind of spit him at us.

                         JANINE
               You should have signs posted, for
               God's sake!

                         JACK
                    (examining him)
               You're really okay?

     Tommy nods.  Then--

                         TOMMY
               I might need a Tetanus.

     Keough and Jack exchange a look of disbelief.


     EXT. CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER

     Hector, Keough, Jack, and Kelly, looking tired, trek toward
     their tents.

                         HECTOR
               Just spit him back out.  Some shall
               live, some shall die, arbitrarily,
               sound like any higher power we
               know?

                         KEOUGH
                    (dismissive)
               He didn't eat the kid cause he'd
               just swallowed a bear.

                         HECTOR
               Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest
               God--

                         KEOUGH
               I'm tired, Hector.  I know this
               because you're beginning to not bug
               me.

                         HECTOR
               That sounds good but underneath
               it's hurtful.
                    (then)
               Nightcap?

                         KEOUGH
               Raincheck.

     They're growing on each other.  Jack and Kelly exchange a smile.
     Hector and Keough are developing an odd kinship almost.  They
     continue on as Jack and Kelly stop at her tent.

                         JACK
               Well.  Goodnight.

                         KELLY
               We seem to say goodnight a lot.

                         JACK
               We could not say it and...
                    (suddenly a coward)
               Well, that thing is ambulatory if
               you want somebody in your tent
               to...

     She smiles.  Then:

                         KELLY
               Night.

     He holds another look.  She goes into her tent.  He stands
     there.  A beat.  Waits to see if she calls him back.  She
     doesn't.  He then heads off.  Her head pops out.  Watches him
     go.  Almost calls after him.  Doesn't.


     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     We see the campsite, looking at it from the water.  All is
     still.  After a beat.  An eye blink.  We are not looking at the
     campsite.  We are CLOSE ON an EYE, REFLECTING the campsite.
     Another blink.  Still another.  We HEAR a slight SNARL.  Then:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. LAKE - SUNRISE

     Hector and Deputy Gare, inside the chopper, lifting of, to
     begin an early morning search.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. SHORE - (DIFFERENT PART OF THE LAKE) - SUNRISE

     Kelly, Jack, Keough, and Stevens searching for tracks along the
     wooded shoreline, staying a good six feet from the actual shore.
     Their senses are very heightened.  Keough has his cannon gun.

                         JACK
               Get back from the shore.  We know
               how fast he can leap out.

                         KEOUGH
               We shouldn't even really be doing
               this.

                         JACK
               They won't be here till at least
               noon.  We got a few hours to kill.

                         KEOUGH
               So does he.

                         KELLY
                    (obsessing)
               I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it.
               They're drawn to me.  I got a thing
               about ticks.

                         JACK
                    (quickly)
               Ssssh!

                         KELLY
               What?

                         JACK
               I heard something.

     He's staring at a brush thicket.  After a beat, we HEAR a slight
     RUSTLE.  The guns go up quickly.  A beat.  Nothing.  Jack bends
     down, picks up a stone.  Tosses it into the thicket.  And out it
     charges.  Kelly screams, they're all about to fire before they
     realize it's only a beaver.  It scurries into the water.

                         KELLY
                    (trying to gather herself)
               Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

                         KEOUGH
                    (suddenly)
               Look.

     ANGLE A GIANT PAW PRINT

     embedded in the mud.  It must be two feet in diameter.

     RESUME

                         JACK
                    (to Keough)
               Guard the water.

     Kelly and Jack go quickly to examine the print.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               That's pretty big.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     The chopper is descending.  Hector and Gare are inside.

                         GARE
               It seems like we're getting lower.

                         HECTOR
               It happens when I land.

                         GARE
               Why are we landing?

                         HECTOR
               'Cause this is the cove he
               obviously lives in.

                         GARE
                    (alarmed)
               So why are we landing?
                    (then)
               Hector.


     EXT. SHORE - CONTINUOUS

     Kelly and Jack are still working on the footprint.  Physical
     proximity, which they're both a little distracted by.

                         KELLY
               Thing we can lift it?

                         JACK
               Maybe.  Don't mush it.

                         KELLY
                    (annoyed)
               I'm not mushing it.

                         JACK
               You're mushing it a little around
               the--

                         KELLY
               I'm not mushing it.

     Suddenly another beaver scurries out from underfoot, scaring all
     of them, but particularly Kelly who jumps.  Her foot lands on a
     long extended branch, and even more suddenly Burke's severed
     head seesaws out of the shallow water, hitting her in the shin.
     She screams as they all jump back.

     ANGLE THE HEAD

     RESUME

     They just stare, as Kelly continues to scream.

                         JACK
                    (holding her)
               Okay.  Okay.  Okay.

                         KELLY
               That is it!!

                         JACK
               Really--

                         KELLY
               No.  I keep getting hit with heads!

                         JACK
                    (holding her shoulders)
               Calm down.

                         KELLY
               You calm down!

                         JACK
               Calm down.

     She takes a couple of calming breaths.

                         KELLY
               I'm being very calm.  I'm composed.
               This is the second time I've been
               hit with a severed head, I'm
               entitled to complain.

                         STEVENS
                    (re the head)
               Is that uh...

                         KEOUGH
               I can't recognize him from the
               back.  It looks like him.

     Keough takes a stick.  Squeamish, he tentatively pokes the head,
     trying to turn it over.

     ANGLE THE HEAD

     It is Burke.

     RESUME

     Keough leans in for a closer look.

                         KEOUGH
               That's him.
                    (re something)
               What the...?

     Something appears to be in his mouth.  Keough takes a small
     twig, pries back a cheek... the mouth is full of worms.

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
               Now I'm gonna puke.

                         JACK
                    (seeing something)
               You gotta be kidding.

                         KELLY
               What?

                         JACK
                    (pointing)
               Look.

     THEIR P.O.V.

     About a hundred yards north, Mrs. Bickerman is leading a
     blindfolded cow to the water.

     RESUME

     Kelly raises her binoculars.  So does Jack.

                         KELLY
               What is she doing now?
                    (then)
               Mother of God.

                         KEOUGH
               What?

                         KELLY
               Look ten feet into the water.

     THEIR P.O.V.

     There waiting... mouth fully open... is the fucking crocodile.

     RESUME

     Kelly, Jack, and Keough, as they lower their scopes.  They look
     at each other, then back at the foregoing.


     EXT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Bickerman, singing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" is happily leading
     the blinded cow to the shore.  The cow, tentative, just allows
     itself to be led, not knowing what the plan is.  As Mrs.
     Bickerman gets to the water, she looks out to the croc.

                         BICKERMAN
               Come and get it.

     And with that, she whips the hind of the cow causing it to jump
     forward.  Almost simultaneously, the croc makes its charge and
     the cow is dead before it has a clue.

                                             CUT TO:


     ANGLE JACK, KEOUGH, AND KELLY

     utterly agape.  After a long beat:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - DAY

     Keough, Kelly, and Jack are questioning a slightly hostile Mrs.
     Bickerman.

                         BICKERMAN
                    (indignant)
               I haven't broken any laws.

                         KEOUGH
                    (bordering on
                     condescension)
               Oh, but you have, Ma'am.  You lied
               to us, that could be obstruction of
               justice.  A man's been killed in
               part 'cause of your silence, I
               could make out a charge of reckless
               endangerment and I'm sure PETA
               would be annoyed at how you treat
               your cows.

                         BICKERMAN
               The reason I lied is if I'd told
               you the truth, you'd just hunt it
               down and kill it which seems to be
               exactly what you're doing.

                         KELLY
               How long have you been feeding this
               thing?

                         BICKERMAN
               About six years.  He first appeared
               in May of nineteen-ninety-one.
               Bernie was out fishing and it
               followed him home.  So we threw him
               some scraps and well... he didn't
               seem to bother anybody.  He became
               kind of like a pet who lived in the
               wild.

                         JACK
               He just appeared.  You have no idea
               how he arrived in this lake?

                         BICKERMAN
               No.  Do you?

                         KEOUGH
               Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You
               didn't, by any chance, lead him to
               the lake blindfolded?

                         BICKERMAN
                    (offended)
               No, I did not.
                    (then)
               The crocodile did kill him, though.
               But it was all... it was a mistake.

                         KELLY
               A mistake.

                         BICKERMAN
               One of our horses got loose two
               years ago, went to the lake to
               drink and... well the crocodile
               started coming in, Bernie went to
               intercede and... it was all a
               terrible misunderstanding.
                    (then)
               If I reported it, they would've
               sent people to kill it.

     Keough, Kelly and Jack can't quite believe what they're hearing.
     Then--

                         KEOUGH
               Ma'am, how could you not report
               this?  He puts human life at risk
               and--

                         BICKERMAN
               Nobody lives on this lake.  it's
               really his lake now.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     The chopper, free-floating, is drifting near a small cove.
     Hector, in diving gear, is about to go into the water, as Gare
     tries to dissuade.

                         GARE
                    (getting panicked)
               C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy
               but you can't--

                         HECTOR
               I need to see his habitat.

     As he drops in.

                         GARE
               Please.  I'll have sex with you,
               anything, but get out of the water.

                         HECTOR
               He's not gonna hurt me.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Kelly, Jack and Keough with Bickerman.

                         BICKERMAN
               Murders and rapes in the cities.
               People bomb planes... can the
               police stop them?  No.  But feed
               one little cow to a crocodile...

                         KEOUGH
               You're to wait right here until the
               police show, you're under full
               house arrest.

                         BICKERMAN
               Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.

                         GARE (O.S.)
                    (through walkie-talkie)
               Hank!  We got a problem with
               Hector.

                         KEOUGH
                    (into walkie-talkie)
               What problem?

                         GARE (O.S.)

                    (through walkie-talkie)
               He went swimming.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector is underwater, exploring.


     ANGLE GARE ON THE CHOPPER

     Her radar is up, she heard something.  But she doesn't see
     anything.  She scans the surface closely.


     EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     The water is slightly more visible as Hector swims.  Other than
     the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle... nothing
     extraordinary.  Then, a flash shadow looms over him.  He looks
     up, but sees nothing.  Probably just the sun ducking under a
     cloud.  It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head
     for the surface.  He swims upward.


     EXT. LAKE (SURFACE) - CONTINUOUS

     Hector breaks the top.  Lifts his mask, looks toward the
     chopper, which he sees about forty yards out.  He continues to
     breaststroke on the surface.  Suddenly... the croc's head rises
     up right behind Hector, who's oblivious.  He continues to swim.
     The croc follows.  Then... maybe divine intuition... Hector gets
     a feeling he's being followed.  He then turns to look the other
     way, upon which his face goes rigid.

     HIS P.O.V.

     About three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at
     him.

     ANGLE HECTOR

     ashen.

                         HECTOR
                    (weakly)
               Oh.... my.

     The croc doesn't move.  It just stares at him.  Then end of his
     snout is almost touching Hector.  Hector himself doesn't dare
     move, for fear of spooking the croc into action.  We get the
     idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling
     any spiritual voids.  A beat.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
               I suddenly feel a bit foolish.
                    (then)
               You're different from the others.

     The croc raises his head now to reveal the snout.  And his
     deadly smile.  Hector just tries to tread water with as little
     motion as possible.  He deathly fears a quick movement will
     cause his life to be over.  Perhaps this is what he came for.
     To be judged by this symbol of mythology.

     He backswims ever so slightly.  The croc pursues just as slowly,
     their eyes are locked.  He could snap off Hector's head in an
     instant.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
                    (terrified; trying to
                     convince himself)
               Holy spirit of Sobek.  Holy ghost.
                    (swallows)
               Holy shit.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. SEA CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

     Gare still scans the water's surface, looking for any sign of
     Hector.  And her face freezes.  Oh yes, there's the sign.

     HER P.O.V.

     Hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc
     slowly follows.

                         GARE
               Hector!!

     We can hear the quaking fear in Hector's voice.  As he continues
     to slowly backswim.

                         HECTOR
                    (to Gare; forced calm)
               Just turn the ignition, it's fuel
               injected.

     Gare turns the ignition, the ENGINE KICKS and DIES.

                         GARE
               Come on.

     She turns it again and the ENGINE TURNS OVER.

     ANGLE HECTOR

     The crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and
     closer toward the chopper.

                         HECTOR
               I know under the circumstances,
               biting off my head might seem
               viable.  It would cheapen you.

     But nothing's funny about this to Hector now.  What he's staring
     into is death.  His own.  Gare raises her rifle.

                         GARE
               I might get a shot.

                         HECTOR
                    (fear in his voice)
               No.  If you don't kill him
               instantly, I'm dead and you'll only
               kill him instantly if you get his
               brain, which is about the size of
               a cherry.  And even if you were on
               target, a bullet might not
               penetrate his hide.

     ANGLE GARE

                         GARE
                    (re the croc)
               Jesus.
                    (to Hector)
               About twelve more yards.  Keep
               coming just like that.

     ANGLE HECTOR

     craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye
     contact with the CROCODILE, it GROWLS.  Hector quickly locks
     eyes with him again.

     ANGLE GARE

                         GARE
                    (weakly)
               Oh my God.

     RESUME

     By now Hector is almost to the chopper, the croc is right there
     too.  Hector's right hand then goes slowly for his belt though
     it's impossible to discern why.  The crocodile seems poised to
     finish him.  There's a slight GROWL.

     And then suddenly, a small underwater POP, followed by an
     EXPLOSION out of the water.  it's an inflatable life vest and as
     it pop tarts out of the water, the croc lunges for it.

     As the croc goes for the vest, Hector makes his dash for the
     chopper.  In almost an instant, he's climbing on board as the
     croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater.

     Hector's up on the chopper's ski.

                         HECTOR
               Move over!!

     The crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws
     snapping shut, missing Hector by an inch, maybe two.  Hector
     dives into the chopper, screaming.

                         GARE
               Go!!

     She REVS the CHOPPER.  The croc comes up again, chomping down on
     one of the landing skis.  Both Gare and Hector scream as the
     whole helicopter is jerked mightily.

                         GARE (CONT'D)
                    (screaming)
               Go!!!

                         HECTOR
               I'm trying!!!

     The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to
     thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open.  Gare
     FIRES her REVOLVER.  It might as well shoot BB's.  The croc is 
     undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up
     and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. CAMPSITE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

     Jack is nearly manhandling Hector, pulling him by the elbow
     towards his tent.  Kelly and Keough are there too.

                         JACK
                    (livid)
               This time, I'm gonna kick your
               ass.

                         HECTOR
               Bastard bit my chopper.

                         JACK
               Hey!!

     Jack simply grabs his arm and squeezes a pressure point.  Hector
     yelps in pain.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               You wanna kill yourself, that it,
               you looking to commit some kind of
               divine suicide?

                         KELLY
               Alright, Jack!

                         JACK
               No!
                    (back to Hector)
               You might think they're Godly, you
               might get some spiritual lift
               backstrokin' with dragons but you
               just put a deputy at risk and--

                         HECTOR
                    (flaring)
               Let's not overlook he didn't eat
               me, maybe--

                         JACK
               'Cause he just ate a cow, you
               stupid--

                         KELLY
               Jack!

                         HECTOR
               I'm a civilian!  You don't have any
               authority--

                         KEOUGH
               I can arrest you!!

                         HECTOR
               Then do it!!

                         KEOUGH
               You probably do want to be killed
               by it, that was you trying to meet
               your maker.

                         HECTOR
               So profound and fat.

     Hector, feelings hurt, stomps off again.  Kelly looks at Jack.
     Then Kelly follows Hector.


     INT. HECTOR'S TENT - A MINUTE LATER

     Hector enters, sits.  A beat.  Kelly enters, goes to sit next to
     him.

                         KELLY
                    (softly)
               Did you want to be killed by it?

                         HECTOR
               You think I'm that nuts?

                         KELLY
                    (softly)
               Hector.
                    (then)
               What you just did... there was at
               least some sort of a death wish
               going on.

                         HECTOR
               Nothing's real.

                         KELLY
               Excuse me?

                         HECTOR
               Nothing's real.
                    (escalating)
               I'm rich, people are automatically
               my friends, sycophants ooze out
               like oil slicks and and and--

     He's sounding erratic.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
               With crocodiles... everything's
               even.

                         KELLY
               I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would
               think there have to be better
               places to look for autonomy, than--

                         HECTOR
                    (pained)
               I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has
               robbed me of the dream in life, I
               sit here broken, a hollow sack--

                         KELLY
               Oh, bullshit.

     And Hector drops the act.

                         HECTOR
               Didn't even sound good?

                         KELLY
               No.

                         HECTOR
                    (worth a try)
               Eh.  Fuck it.

                         KELLY
               Can I tell them you won't go back
               in the water?

                         HECTOR
               Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I
               don't know...

     He has trouble saying it.

                         KELLY
               What?

                         HECTOR
               Could we have intercourse?

     She just whacks him.  Then exits.  OFF Hector, "worth a shot",
     we:

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY

     Jack and Keough are there to meet Kelly.

                         JACK
               Just heard from Wildlife and
               Florida Fish And Game.  They should
               be here by four.

                         KELLY
               Okay.

                         JACK
               We might as well pack.

                         KELLY
               Good idea.

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
               They'll kill him.

     They turn to see, Hector is standing there.

                         HECTOR
               They're not going to be able to
               snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in
               water, he drowns.

                         KELLY
               They could try to tranq him on
               land.

                         HECTOR
                    (knowing)
               They won't.  He's taken human life,
               the mission will be to put him
               down.

                         KEOUGH
               Gee, that would really disappoint
               me.

                         HECTOR
               Forget about him being God, he's
               thirty feet long, he is a miracle
               of nature, who somehow made his way
               to Maine.  This is a grand beast.
               A grand dragon.  An attempt should
               at least be made to capture him
               alive.

                         JACK
               Well, you can try talking them into
               that, if--

                         HECTOR
               I have enough flaxedil with me to
               put him out.  And I think I know a
               way to--

                         JACK
               Forget it.

                         HECTOR
               Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when
               they come, they will kill it.  They
               have to, politically, he's too
               dangerous, if something were to go
               wrong... the odds are he will be
               destroyed,--

                 KEOUGH                    HECTOR (CONT'D)
        Which is exactly          Please, Hank, let me finish
        what...                 I'm having a sane moment, this
                                  is a window.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
               If he were neutralized when they
               got here... they might consider
               saving him.

                         KELLY
               And how would we neutralize him?

                         HECTOR
               We lure him on land and pump him
               with the drugs.

                         JACK
               No way.

                         HECTOR
               Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's
               probably a hundred and fifty years
               old, he's bigger than an elephant.

     Hector's impassioned here, he's not fooling around.

                         JACK
               So maybe Wildlife will try to save
               him, they're more equipped to--

                         HECTOR
               We both know what they'll do.

     Silence.  Admission by silence.  Then--

                         JACK
               Even if we could tranq him-- how
               would we get him on land.

                         KEOUGH
               Other than to eat us?

                         HECTOR
               He follows anything that moves.
               You guys can be in the trucks with
               tranq guns.  If he charges, drive
               off, plus Hank you've got your hand-
               held cannon.  We could do this with
               no safety risk.  If it works, we
               save a beast that should be saved.

     A beat.  They are sympathetic to the idea.

                         JACK
               And again.  How would you get him
               on land?

                         HECTOR
               That's actually the easy part.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. BICKERMAN'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER

     We HEAR the CHOPPER.

                         BICKERMAN
                    (to Keough)
               I'll sue you.

                         KEOUGH
               Go ahead.

     And up goes Hector's chopper.  And... REVEAL connected to a long
     cable... a cow.  An airborne cow, dangling from the chopper.

                         BICKERMAN
                    (to Jack)
               You can't take a cow by eminent
               domain.

                         JACK
               We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.

                         BICKERMAN
               You're all fuckers.  Vicious little
               fuckers.

     Jack turns to Kelly.

                         JACK
               Are we crazy?

                         KELLY
               Well...

                         JACK
               We've got a cow hanging from a
               helicopter.

     She shrugs.

                         KEOUGH
               Let's get back to camp.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector pilots.

                         HECTOR
               Not much drag.  As long as I can
               keep him from swinging, we're okay.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Hector's chopper is flying the befuddled animal toward the cove.
     FIND Keough, Kelly, and Jack on the water cruising back to camp.
     Keough has his gun.


     EXT. CAMPSITE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

     Two pickup trucks have been backed in for a shooting vantage.
     Kelly, Jack, Keough.  Riflemen are ready with tranq guns.

     ANGLE JACK

                         JACK
                    (into headset)
               Keep enough tension to hold him up,
               Hector, we don't know if he can
               swim.

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (through headset)
               Right.

                         JACK
               The more he thrashes, the better.

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (through headset)
               You ready on shore?

                         JACK
               We're ready.

     RESUME

     The chopper lowers the cow.  He starts to kick his legs in
     anticipation.

                         JACK (O.S.)
                    (through headset)
               If he tires, lift him out.

     And the cow goes into the water.  He swims frantically a few
     meters.  The chopper lifts him out briefly.

                         JACK
               It can't work.

                         KELLY
               He has been going after everything.
               It could work.
                    (then)
               But this is not a happy cow.

                         JACK
               He looks like a giant tea bag.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. LAKE - AN HOUR LATER

     The cow has been dipped more times than a stale donut now and he
     just hangs there like pasta.  Jack, Keough, and Kelly are poised
     with tranq guns on the beach.

                         JACK
                    (looking through
                     binoculars)
               He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is
               he swimming?

                         KELLY
                    (looking through
                     binoculars)
               He's floating.  Take it home.

                         JACK
                    (into headset)
               Hector.

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
               Hold on!


     INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

                         HECTOR
               I got something on the screen.

                         JACK (O.S.)
               You do?

     ANGLE THE SCREEN

     There's a mass... moving toward the cow.

                         HECTOR
               He's coming.


     EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

                         JACK
                    (into walkie-talkie; now
                     adrenalized)
               Where?  Where?

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (through walkie talkie)
               Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow,
               but straight toward Elsie.

                         JACK
               Can you confirm visually or just
               radar?

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (through walkie talkie)
               Radar, he's underwater.  But he's
               definitely coming.

                         JACK
               Okay.  Lead him in.
                    (to the others; barking)
               Okay, everybody up on the trucks.
               We aim for the stomach or side...
               there's little chance the darts
               will pierce his hide.  Everybody up
               on the trucks.

     They move into position.


     INT. HECTOR'S CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

                         HECTOR
                    (charged)
               On our way.  There, he's surfacing,
               there's the snout.  You little
               sucker.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Sure enough... that giant snout breaks the surface.  Ever so
     calmly... it moves toward the cow.


     EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

                         KELLY
                    (into walkie-talkie)
               If he gets close, you go up,
               Hector, don't you endanger that
               cow.

                         KEOUGH
               She's worried about the cow now.

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (through walkie-talkie)
               He's following.  Here we come.

     ANGLE THE RADAR SCREEN

     Depicting the same.


     EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

                         JACK
                    (to Hector)
               Nice and slow.
                    (to the others)
               Let's get ready.

     Hector's chopper, cow dangling, is slowly approaching the shore.
     Behind it... the snout and eyes of a giant croc.  Back on the
     shore, Keough's men ready themselves for action.  Tranq guns.
     rifles... the team is mobilized.  We HEAR a DISTRESSED CRY from
     the COW.

                         KELLY
               He's mooing.

                         JACK
               You wouldn't?

                         KEOUGH
               They're coming right in.

                         KELLY
               Such a simple idea and it's
               working.  What does that tell you?

                         KEOUGH
               That it's about to go wrong.

                         JACK
                    (into walkie talkie)
               Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget
               to lift up the cow.

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (sarcastic, through walkie
                     talkie)
               Thank you, Jack.

                         JACK
                    (to the team)
               You shoot on my order.  If he
               charges, I'll be yelling "go" which
               means drivers take off.  And drive
               fast, they can move on land.
                    (to Keough)
               You set?

                         KEOUGH
               Don't worry about me.

     Incredibly... the plan is working.  A giant dragon is following
     a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline.

     Hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore.  The
     big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank
     steak.  The time is now.


     INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

                         HECTOR
               We're in about four feet of water
               now.


     EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

                         JACK
               Little closer.  Three, two, one...

     The crocodile then suddenly thrusts up after the cow, snapping
     at air.  Hector pulls up with the chopper.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               Fire!!

     Jack, Gare, and other officers pump the beast with tranq darts.
     But Hector has taken his chopper up too fast, causing the cow to
     swing like a pendulum.  It rocks the chopper.


     INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

                         HECTOR
               Oh, shit.

     The chopper is in trouble.  The cow sways, the helicopter
     struggles to stay airborne.


     EXT. BEACH - ANGLE KELLY - CONTINUOUS

                         KELLY
                    (screaming)
               Watch out!!

                         JACK
               Keep firing!

     The men continue to pump the beast with tranquilizing darts.


     INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector's having trouble righting his chopper.

                         HECTOR
               Motherfucker.


     EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

     Suddenly the croc goes up and grabs the dangling cow, snapping
     off the cable.

                         JACK
               Shit!!

     And down comes to the chopper, Hector cannot control it.  It
     crashes into the lake.

                         KELLY
               Hector!!

                         JACK
                    (to Keough)
               Take him.

                         KEOUGH
               I can't.  I'll get Hector!!

                         JACK
               Where is he?!

                         KELLY
               We gotta get to Hector!!

                         JACK
                    (to the driver)
               Back us in a little, we need to get
               a shot!

     Hector pops his head out of the overturned chopper.  He looks
     around.

                         HECTOR
               Where is he?

                         JACK
                    (to the Deputies)
               Tranq guns down, rifles up!

     The men switch guns, under--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (yelling to Hector)
               Do not go in that water!
                    (to the driver)
               Back us in!!

     As the pick-up backs closer to the shore--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (to Keough)
               If you get a safe shot...

                         KEOUGH
               I'll take it!

                         JACK
               Hector.  Do not move.

     The water is calm again.  A beat.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (to Gare)
               You see anything?

                         GARE
                    (looking through binocs)
               Nothing.  Maybe he swam out.

     Upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging
     the truck.  Screams.

                         JACK
               Go!!  Drive!!

     The pick-up spins dirt, lurches forward, throwing Keough off
     balance.  The croc heads back for the water as Keough regains
     his balance.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               Take him!!

     And Keough blasts.  It detonates the ground near the croc
     causing him to surge airborne into the water.  And he goes
     under.  Silence.  A beat.

                         KELLY
               Did you get him?

                         KEOUGH
               I don't know.
                    (to the Driver)
               Back the truck--

                         ALL
               No!!!

                         JACK
               Hector, you see anything?

     ANGLE HECTOR

     on the pontoon of his chopper.  He's looking about, studying the
     water.

                         HECTOR
               No!

                         KEOUGH
                    (sarcastic)
               I just have this feeling
               everything's totally safe.

                         HECTOR
                    (yelling)
               I see blood.  Maybe you got him,
               Hank.

     And as Hector looks further.  Behind him... up surfaces the
     crocodile in all his stealth.  His head is two feet from Hector
     and nobody knows it.  Least of all Hector.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
               I can't see him, but this is
               definitely blood.  Maybe you got
               him.

     And as he turns back, he sees it.  The croc comes up as Hector
     screams, jumps off.  Screams.  Keough leaps off the truck and
     charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give
     Hector some cover.

     Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper.  He
     climbs in.

                         KEOUGH
               Where is he?!

                         HECTOR
               I don't know!

     No sooner said than the croc comes launching up.  As he springs
     toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other
     side.  The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin
     and he becomes wedged.  The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes
     right through the chopper.  He's not completely immobilized but
     wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him.

                         KEOUGH
               Hector!!

     But now Jack has joined, rifle in hand.  Hector surfaces again,
     swimming for shore.  Jack runs to help him onto land.

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
                    (taking aim)
               Alright.  Game over.

     But the croc looks feeble now.  He lets out this MOAN of DEATH.
     And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger.

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
                    (to Kelly)
               Should I?

                         KELLY
               Wait.

     RESUME

     The croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach.
     But there's no rage in his behavior now.  He seems desperate.
     He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two
     ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.

                         KELLY
               I think the drugs are kicking in.

     Breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to
     free himself from the mangled wreckage.  As unbelievable as that
     cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even
     more astonishing, if not preposterous, now.  A thirty foot
     exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.  And he
     just cannot go on anymore.

     Kelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back.  They approach with
     caution.  They all stare at the tired crocodile.

     ANGLE THE CROC

     He's now looking back.  Bleeding, gasping... beaten.  In his
     eyes... we can see it.  The beast is beaten.

     ANGLE THE PRINCIPLES

     There's no triumph.  In their eyes... sadness.

                         JACK
               I don't think we really want to
               wait for him to catch his breath.

     It continues to breathe heavily.

                         KELLY
               He's through fighting.  Look at
               him.

                         JACK
               I don't care.  Hank.  End it.

     Keough raises his cannon.

                         HECTOR
               No.  Look.  He's got nothing left.

                         JACK
               Yeah and every time we think
               there's no more danger--

     Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the
     water, seizing Hector.  Screams.  It death rolls Hector, flings
     him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more.
     Keough blasts his Avenger.  A direct hit.

     It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing
     into the air.  It splashes down, the first head not to hit
     Kelly.

     They all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore.  He's
     bleeding.

                         HECTOR
               I'm okay.

                         KELLY
               You're not okay, your leg's a mess.

                         JACK
               Get him onto shore.

                         KELLY
               He heeds a tourniquet.

     Keough quickly peels off his shirt.  Gives it to Kelly, who goes
     to work.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               You're gonna be okay.

                         HECTOR
               Guess I finally got bit.

                         KELLY
               Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix
               it.

     A sudden ROAR.  Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see...
     the big croc.  Maybe his final roar, he looks weak.  GASPING in
     the crashed chopper.  Jack and Keough approach.

                         KEOUGH
                    (quietly; re the big croc)
               He's done.  He's dying.

                         JACK
               Don't count on it.
                    (then)
               We better take him out.

     But something about this crocodile... his eyes looking back at
     them... nobody wants wants to take him out.

     ANGLE THE CROC

     looking back at them.  He knows he's in their hands now.  He
     knows.

     ANGLE THE HUMANS

     A beat.

                         HECTOR
                    (quiet)
               Flax him under his tail.  Two
               hundred cc's.  Under the tail,
               that'll put him to sleep.

     Upon which we HEAR the SOUND of TRUCKS.  Florida Fish And Game,
     U.S. Wildlife, arriving on the scene.

                         JACK
               Thank God.

     OFFICER COLSON, Florida Fish And Game, emerges, approaches.
     Stares with utter disbelief.

                         KELLY
               We need to get it some medical
               help.
                    (re Hector)
               And him too.

     By now the Florida army has moved in.  They all stare with the
     same suspended disbelief.

                         KEOUGH
                    (explaining)
               We trapped him with our chopper.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. BEACH - AN HOUR LATER

     A crew, including vets, are working on the sedated croc, trying
     to free it from the wreckage.  FIND the PARAMEDICS with Hector,
     on a stretcher.  Jack, Kelly, and Keough are there.

                         PARAMEDIC
               We're gonna airvac him to Portland.

                         KELLY
               Okay.
                    (to Hector)
               That's where they're taking the
               croc, Hector, they've got some big
               tank there.

                         HECTOR
               He's gonna live?

                         KELLY
               Yeah.  Thanks to you.

                         HECTOR
               And Hank.
                    (to Keough)
               I know you weren't really trying to
               hit him.

                         KEOUGH
                    (gently)
               I was aiming for you.

     Hector smiles.

                         HECTOR
               Thanks for the rescue.

     Jack leans down.

                         JACK
               You take care.

                         HECTOR
               You talk to Bickerman?

                         JACK
               She didn't tell us about the other
               croc 'cause she was afraid we'd
               blow it's head off.

                         HECTOR
               Women's intuition.  Are there
               anymore?

                         JACK
               Just those two.

                         PARAMEDIC
               We gotta take him.

                         JACK
               Okay.

                         PARAMEDIC
               We got room for one.

                         JACK
               Well... I got stuff to pack up
               and...

     He looks to Kelly, but before she can say "yes"--

                         KEOUGH
                    (grudging)
               I'll go.

     Hector smiles.  The Paramedics board Hector.  Keough turns to
     Jack.

                         KEOUGH
               Thanks for your help.

                         JACK
               You too.

     Handshake.  Respect.  That's about as much affection as you get
     from Keough.  He then extends his hand to Kelly.

                         KELLY
               I'm sure this would offend you on
               principal but... could we keep in
               touch?

                         KEOUGH
               I guess.

     And she kisses him on the cheek.  Keough fights off his blush,
     boards the chopper.  As it then lifts up, Kelly turns to Jack.

                         KELLY
               Well...

                         JACK
               You wanna ride in my truck?

                         GARE
                    (arriving)
               Your truck is jammed.  Should we
               take some stuff out?

                         KELLY
               No, no, I'll be a while anyway.
               I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake.

                         JACK
               You sure?  I don't mind...

                         KELLY
               No, I actually want to stay for a
               little while.

     They hold a look.  Then--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               I'll miss you most of all
               scarecrow.

     And she kisses his cheek.

                         JACK
               If I'm ever in New York...

                         KELLY
               Yeah.

     They hold another look.

                         JACK
               Y'know, if we didn't live in
               separate worlds and...
                    (a beat)

                         KELLY
               But we do.
                    (then)
               Hey, we'll always have Maine.

     He smiles.

                         JACK
               It was... something meeting you.

                         KELLY
               Likewise.

     He kisses her hand.  Holds a look.  Heads off.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. BEACH - DUSK

     The tents are down, everything's packed.  A couple trucks
     remain.  The croc is gone.  Things are quiet.  Kelly stands down
     by the water, staring out.

     HER P.O.V.

     Hypnotic beauty.  The lake doesn't even ripple.  She soaks it in
     as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to
     this again.  She HEARS every BIRD.  Including a DISTANT LOON.
     Serenity has returned.  Then suddenly... a stone goes skipping
     out, four, five, six skips.  Kelly turns around.  Jack stands
     there.  They hold a look.

                         JACK
               I thought I should say goodbye to
               the lake too.

     He approaches.  Takes her hand.

                         KELLY
                    (weakly)
               Different worlds, Jack.

                         JACK
               Yeah, I thought about that as I was
               driving... and... I haven't found
               somebody in my world.  You found
               anyone in yours?

                         KELLY
               No.

                         JACK
               So I was thinking... maybe if I met
               anybody in my world who was good
               for you and if you know somebody in
               New York good for me, we could fix
               each other up.

                         KELLY
               You think?

                         JACK
               Worth a try.  We don't wanna be
               alone forever, do we?

                         KELLY
               Probably not.

     They hold a look.  He kisses her softly.

                         JACK
               That was... y'know if the guy asks
               me can she kiss, now I'll be able
               to tell him if you can.

                         KELLY
               Good thinking.

     And they kiss again, this one escalates a little.  They break.
     And then he holds her.  Tightly as the CAMERA PULLS UP to an
     AERIAL VIEW of them, embracing at the water's edge.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. MAINE TURNPIKE - AERIAL SHOT - DUSK

     Police cars, lights flashing, motor down the highway.  Behind
     them... on a flatbed truck... a thirty foot giant crocodile.
     Headed down the southbound lane of the Maine turnpike.  Rolling.
     Rolling.  Rolling along.  It doesn't even look ridiculous.
     We've become accustomed to such sights.

     As we lift up higher and higher, Richie Havens' "I CAN SEE
     CLEARLY NOW" RESUMES.  Eventually, we:

     Jack and Kelly board his vehicle.  They drive off, as we:

     EXT. BICKERMAN FARM - SUNSET

     Daffy Mrs. Bickerman sits at the end of her dock, feet dangling
     in the water.  Throwing bread crumbs.

                         BICKERMAN
               Cute little Buttons.  Mommy loves
               you.  Come eat your supper little
               buttons.  Nibble Mommy's toes.

     REVEAL

     Three, maybe four, crocodile hatchlings, a foot in length, are
     swimming near her feet, eating the bread, nibbling her toes.
     OFF them, THEN happy Mrs. Bickerman, we:

                                             FADE OUT.
