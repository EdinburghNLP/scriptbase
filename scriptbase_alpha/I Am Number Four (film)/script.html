</b>


                                Written by

                       Alfred Gough &amp; Miles Millar



<b>                                                               1/08/10
</b>                         

                         

                         
          The events in this film are real.
          Names and places have been changed to protect the Lorien Six,
          who remain in hiding.

          Take this as your first warning. Other civilizations do exist.
          Some of them seek to destroy you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          A BILLION STARS
</b>          pinprick the velvet-black sky that stretches over a vast
          sleeping jungle. A fingernail moon silvers the whispering
          canopy while gentle tendrils of steam rise.

<b>          TITLE ON SCREEN: REPUBLIC OF CONGO, AFRICA.
</b>
<b>          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
</b>
          CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the eternity of treetops until it FINDS

<b>          A BUNGALOW.
</b>          It's 20x20 square, with a wraparound porch and simple wooden
          shutters. The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been
          crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness.

<b>          INT. HUT - NIGHT
</b>
          Two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the
          space. A TEEN BOY sleeps in one and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN lies
          in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat.
          The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until

<b>          THE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES.
</b>          The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks
          over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold
          their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.

<b>          ANOTHER RATTLE.
</b>          It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as
          the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow
          and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans
          in and peers through the bamboo slats.
          WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life.
          Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his
          face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of

<b>          A SERRATED METAL BLADE
</b>          protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously
          protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted
          eyes and whispers his last, desperate word...

<b>                         MIDDLE-AGED MAN
</b>          Run!

<b>          SMASH CUT TO:
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>
<b>          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
</b>
          The Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints
          through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off
          the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves
          impossibly fast. Faster than any human could.

<b>          A MONSTROUS HOWL
</b>          ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins
          thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread
          and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears.
          He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races
          up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of

<b>          A 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE!
</b>          GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He
          kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite
          lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of

<b>          A HULKING BEAST.
</b>          It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side.
          It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved,
          the Teen turns to make his escape when

<b>                         A HAND
</b>          wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a
          TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster.

<b>          THIS IS A MOGADORIAN.
</b>          He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the
          briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the
          geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted
          against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises

<b>          A SWORD.
</b>          Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps
          towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA
          ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright.

<b>          FORM CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          THE SAME SYMBOL.
</b>          It glimmers to life on the ankle of another TEEN 10,000 miles
          away. His name's DANIEL and he's in the middle of a wild jet-
          ski race with TWO BUDDIES.

<b>          TITLE ON SCREEN: BIG PINE KEY, FLORIDA, USA.
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>          The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages
          on the beach.
          Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his
          opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of
          triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels

<b>                         THE SYMBOL
</b>          searing into his skin. As he leans forward to grip his
          ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams
          across the water.

<b>          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
          LOOKING UP as Daniel crashes into view. Needles of light
          flicker from the symbol. It's cauterizing into his flesh
          like a brand.

<b>          EXT. BEACH - DAY
</b>
          Daniel stumbles through the surf and collapses onto the sand,
          clutching his ankle. He rolls onto his side as a CROWD OF
          PARTYING TEENS gathers. A BLONDE GIRL leans down to help.

<b>                         BLONDE GIRL
</b>          Daniel, what's wrong? Did you
          break your ankle?
          But as she turns him over, she sees the light leaking from
          between his fingers and reels back.

<b>                         BLONDE GIRL
</b>          Oh my God.
          He stares up into the crowd's fearful faces, then staggers to
          his feet and takes off running.

<b>          EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY
</b>
          The busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines.
          Through the trees, we CATCH THE SHUTTER IMAGE of a figure
          outrunning the hurtling vehicles.

<b>          EXT. COASTAL FOREST - DAY
</b>
          Trees whip past as Daniel sprints down a sandy track. The
          pendant that knocks against his chest was carved by the same
          hand as the African Teen's, but the symbol is unique. He
          peels off to the right and bursts out onto a long drive.

<b>          A STILT HOUSE
</b>          sits at the end. It's cake-frosting pink and is built right
          on the edge of a coral-white beach.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          4.
</b>
<b>          EXT. STILT HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          The door flies open and Daniel stands on the threshold.
          HENRI looks up from his bank of laptops that scroll with news
          feeds. He is decades older than his suntanned face betrays
          and you'd be way off if you guessed his accent was French.

<b>                         DANIEL
</b>          Number 3 is dead.
          Henri's eyes narrow with urgency. He is immediately on his
          feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on
          the teen's ankle. It has stopped glowing but is painfully
          raw. Directly below this fresh wound are

<b>          TWO OTHER GEOMETRIC BRANDS.
</b>          They are the same size, but each symbol is subtly different.
          Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars.
          Henri's penetrating eyes look up at the shell-shocked teen.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Did anybody else see this?
          OFF Daniel's panicked nod...

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. BEDROOM - STILT HOUSE - DAY
</b>

<b>                         A GECKO
</b>          skitters across the ceiling, its glossy black eyes watch as
          Daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag. The
          walls are bare. No photos, no posters, no personality.
          Henri enters, holding a crate of computer cables.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Taillights in five minutes. What
          we can't carry --

<b>                         DANIEL
</b>          -- we burn. I know the drill.

<b>          EXT. STILT HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          TIGHT ON A BOX. It's exquisitely carved and inlaid with an
          intricate geometric design.
          Henri carefully hides it under the driver's seat of an old
          Jeep Wagoneer. It's the kind with wooden trim. He looks at
          Daniel who feeds homework assignments into a roaring FIRE.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Time to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          5.
</b>          Daniel clicks the SIM card from his cell phone, snaps it in
          two and drops it into the fire. Bitter, he takes one last
          look at the glittering azure sea, then climbs into the Jeep.
          As the engine HUMS to life, CAMERA FOLLOWS

<b>          DANIEL (V.O.)
</b>          This is the part I hate the most.
          The running. But it's the only

          rest is a lie. My name. My
          birthday. Even Henri. People

          His job is to keep me alive.

          Henri's eyes scan the rear view, on constant vigil. The
          speedometer never brushes past 60. Daniel has his head
          against the window, brooding, listening to an iPod.

          Plastic flags whip overhead. Daniel leans against a silver
          SUV and watches Henri negotiate with the DEALER.

<b>          DANIEL (V.O.)
</b>          Only nine children escaped the
          genocide. We were each given a
          number and sent here to hide. I
          don't know where the others are. I

          Daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub. He gently unwraps the
          bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat
          scab that has formed over the wound.

</b>          Because of the spell our Elders

          Daniel is asleep with his earphones on. Henri glances over,

          There are 335,321 John Smiths in

          (Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John.)
          John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away.
          Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him.

          A row of ancient arcade games blinks. John angrily stabs the
          buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches.
          They are alone. John's eyes never leave the video screen.

</b>          You got lulled into a false sense
          of security. That's my fault.
          John struggles to keep his temper in check.

</b>          I liked Florida. I liked having
          friends. I liked feeling normal.

</b>          I wish that you could have a normal
          life -- but you can't.
          Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with
          frustration.

          John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice
          softens but never loses its intensity.

          They scan the faded interior. The place is in desperate need
          of a makeover. A grandfather clock pensively TICKS at the
          end of the hall. Annie remains relentlessly optimistic.

          turning on the lights.

          SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes.
          Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently
          signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of
          an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek

          relieved to see Henri.

</b>          Game's changed. You're in the
          crosshairs now. You have to be
          ready to leave at a moment's
          notice. With or without me.
          John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He
          pushes the plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out
          the door. Henri stares at the omelette, tastes a pinch of
          hash browns, then puts the plate on the floor on his way out.
          It takes Bernie 2.5 seconds to race over and start to eat.

          Jack-o'-lanterns stare out from the â€œHALLOWEEN BLOCK PARTYâ€�
          banner strung across the red brick facade. Henri drives
          away. John slides the red backpack onto his shoulder when he
          hears a FAMILIAR BARK. He turns and is surprised to find

<b>          BERNIE KOSAR.
</b>          The little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white-
          tipped tail. John crosses to him, baffled.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Bernie, what the hell... were you
          hiding in the car?
          He scoops the dog into his arms.

<b>          FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Hey, I was about to take a picture
          of the little guy.
          John turns and finds

<b>          SARAH HARTE.
</b>          She's his age and is holding an old 35mm Nikon. There is
          something about her unforced beauty that is instantly
          enchanting. John shuffles, uncharacteristically nervous.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          He's not supposed to be here.

<b>                         (TO BERNIE)
</b>          Go home. Now.
          Bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs towards home.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          He's really well-trained. How long
          have you had him?
          John turns away.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Sorry about your shot.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          No worries.
          He begins walking towards the entrance.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          You just moved into the house on

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Don't worry, I'm not stalking you.
          My mom said she rented it to a guy
          with a son my age. Since I know
          every other face on this quad, that
          had to be you.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          I'm Sarah.
          He nods.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Where are you from?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Someplace warmer.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          I don't think that qualifies as an
          actual answer.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          I need to register.
          She raises her camera to snap a shot of him.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Whoa. What are you doing?

          late.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Please don't point that at me.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Afraid the camera's going to steal
          your soul?
          She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus. Annoyed,
          he covers the lens with his hand.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          What's your problem? I said no.

<b>                         SARAH

          John regains his composure.

          As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO
          REVEAL MARK JAYNE monitoring the encounter. He's the star
          quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy.

          Loaded with textbooks, John instinctively bows his head as he
          passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a
          locker. He reaches for the combination lock when

<b>                         A BACKPACK
</b>          viciously sideswipes him. The textbooks scatter across the
          checkerboard linoleum. John sees the culprit is Mark Jayne,
          who offers him a taunting grin. John fights his urge to
          react and watches as Mark struts over to his POSSE OF JOCKS.

<b>          VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Welcome to Paradise, irony not

          John looks at the teen standing two lockers down. He's got a
          battered skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an
          Army surplus jacket. This is SAM GOODE -- genius by birth,
          slacker by choice. He nods after Mark.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          His name's Mark Jayne.

</b>          If there's another guy in her

</b>          Maybe I'll fire back next time.

          It's an impressive structure with wraparound bleachers. The
          Junior gym class jogs around the track. John hangs in the
          middle of the pack, with his hoodie up, blending in.
          They pass the GIRLS who are stretching on the pristine field.
          Sarah's eyes drift towards John. The COACH blows a whistle.

</b>          Okay, half court, three on three.

          notice Mark Jayne enter and approach her.

</b>          New kid, you're up. Show me what

          John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his
          way. He steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing. A
          blur of orange. John swings back and catches the ball.
          Just as he shoots, he's distracted by Sarah's upset voice.

<b>                         THE SHOT

          rain down. All eyes turn to John, who's annoyed at his

          inspecting a photographic contact sheet. His view is blocked
          by Sam. John rubs his hands which are oddly sweaty.

          John steps out of the darkroom wearing Henri's heavy coat.
          His hands are balled and stuffed into the pockets. Henri
          leads him quickly down the hall.

          John fearfully studies his hands which have returned to

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Okay, start talking. What the
          hell's going on?

<b>                         HENRI

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          An extraordinary ability. Yours is
          called Lumen. They start a lot
          sooner on Lorien. I was beginning
          to fear yours would never emerge.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          You knew this was going to happen?
          Why didn't you say anything?

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          I didn't want to worry you. You

<b>                         (SINCERE)
</b>          I'm sorry.
          John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him, suspicious.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          The curtains are drawn. Bernie Kosar dozes on the couch
          while John and Henri sit at the table, staring at the Box.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          This couldn't be opened until your
          first Legacy appeared. Ready?
          John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips of his
          right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid.
          John cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the
          â€œpetalsâ€� fanned across the opposite side.

<b>                         THE DISCS
</b>          momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes from within. John
          and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box
          miraculously comes to life. Fissures of light sweep across
          the lines of inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections
          that begin to twist and reform like high-tech origami.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Whoa.
          PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold.
          Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup,
          creating a new pattern on the lid. It's a familiar geometric
          symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his
          neck -- the symbols are an exact match.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Open it.
          John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat
          assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks.
          They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          What are they?

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Crystals from Lorien's core.
          They'll guide us in your training.
          John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Place your hand over them.
          John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut-
          sized crystal floats up from the Box. It slowly begins to
          spin and project

<b>          A SWIRLING HOLOGRAPHIC GALAXY.
</b>
<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Our solar system.
          Henri points to a planet. Its oceans are dark with pollution
          and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          That's what Lorien looked like
          thousands of years ago. We had all
          the problems that Earth has today.
          The planet was dying until our
          people made a collective decision
          to change and slowly Lorien began
          to heal itself -- that's when the
          Legacies started.
          John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his
          eyes. Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land
          masses become a lush emerald green.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Only a select few developed these
          abilities. They became known as
          the Garde.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          That's what I am?

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Like your parents and grandparents.
          John considers this new information.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          The other children in the ship...
          Henri finishes John's thought.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          They're Garde as well. Once you've
          mastered your Legacies, we'll find
          them and face the Mogadorians
          together.
          John looks at Henri, curious.

</b>          I don't have any and never will.
          I'm your Cepan -- a teacher. My
          job is not just to protect you but
          to train you.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Give me your hand.
          Henri takes one of John's hands and pulls a cigarette lighter
          from his pocket. John flinches, unsure.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Trust me.
          Henri flicks a flame to life and sweeps it under John's
          outstretched palm.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          You feel that?
          Amazingly, the flame harmlessly licks the skin. But when
          Henri moves the lighter further up John's arm --

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Ouch.
          John jerks his hand away. Henri kills the flame, shrugs.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          When we're done, your entire body
          will be shielded against fire.
          John rubs his singed wrist.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          You'll get other Legacies too.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Flying would be cool.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          You don't get to pick them off a

          KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. As John spins to the door, the
          shimmering galaxy fades and the crystal drops to the floor.

</b>          Mogs don't knock.

          installed around the property.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          How'd you do it?
          Her accusation startles him.

</b>          Do what?

</b>          I was in the darkroom before lunch
          and they were hanging on the line
          smiling and looking forward to the

          15 rolls of negatives wiped clean.
          John shrugs innocently.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          So you weren't in the darkroom
          today?

</b>          Here's a tip. If you're going to
          lie, don't leave a big red backpack
          at the scene of the crime.
          She swings his backpack into view. John is mortified. He
          struggles to find a plausible answer and silently tries to
          quell the feeling welling in his chest.

</b>          Digital sucks. Film tells the

          He watches as she angrily heads down the steps and climbs
          into her car. John glances at his palms and is surprised to
          find they are dimly luminescent.

          of John's face. He tentatively reaches out. When he grips

<b>          EXT. LORIEN - NIGHT

          EXPLOSIONS rock and the SCREAMS of the dying echo. AN OLD
          MAN hustles A TERRIFIED BOY through the murderous
          bombardment. The air is choked with ash and smoke.
          The boy is 7-year-old John. The man is his grandfather.
          Young John glances up and sees

<b>          AN ARMADA OF BATTLESHIPS
</b>          eclipsing Lorien's two moons. The angular hulls of the craft
          are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash
          an endless crisscrossing FRENZY OF MISSILES.

          It wouldn't look out of place in ancient Rome. Young John
          and his grandfather race up the steps.

<b>          INT. SANCTUARY - TEMPLE - NIGHT
</b>
          A statue of Lorien's most famous warrior, Pittacus Lore,
          towers in the middle of the chamber. His noble face is
          illuminated in a shaft of flame-tainted moonlight.

<b>          FOOTSTEPS ECHO!
</b>          Young John and his grandfather scramble across the space and
          straight into the path of

<b>          TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS.
</b>          The Soldiers' pallid faces flash with smiles. Swords drawn,
          they move in for the kill when one is skewered in the throat
          by a crystal-handled dagger.

</b>          spurts from the wound. The Soldier's body fractures like
          glass and DISINTEGRATES in a shower of embers as he drops to
          the floor. The other Mogadorian spins and trades SPARKING
          sword strokes with

<b>          A CLOAKED FIGURE.
</b>          It's a violent battle of wills which ends when the Cloaked
          Figure kicks up the dead Soldier's sword and impales it into
          the Mogadorian's chest. The Soldier EVISCERATES in a cloud
          of HISSING cinders.
          Young John watches in awed terror as the Cloaked Figure steps
          towards him and pulls back his hood.

<b>          IT'S HENRI.
</b>          He looks younger, the years of hiding have aged him. John's
          grandfather lifts a familiar crystal pendant from his neck
          and places it over Young John's head.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>          This is your Cepan. Go with him.

          A BLAST scorches across the space. Henri spots

<b>          A MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
</b>          hunkered behind a column, his red coat billows behind him
          like a curse.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>          They are already hunting you! Go!
          Henri plucks a crystal ankle-dagger from his boot, grabs
          young John and charges up. As the Commander breaks cover,
          Henri hurls the dagger.

          across his right cheek like a hot poker.

          Henri yanks Young John by the hand. They take off in one
          direction while John's grandfather heads off in the other.

<b>          A MOGADORIAN TRANSPORT CRAFT
</b>          suddenly swoops between them. The HOWLS of its occupants
          ricochet through the night. The heat from its engines washes
          the ground, warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as
          two bay doors open. Young John looks back through the heat-
          haze and catches a impressionistic view as

<b>                         TWO PIKEN
</b>          leap out. Their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and
          their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws. The Piken
          mercilessly rip into John's grandfather. Young John races to
          help, but Henri wrenches him back. CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT ON
          YOUNG JOHN'S FACE as he screams...

          He drops the crystal and stumbles back. The experience has
          left him traumatized. Henri steps towards him, but John is
          too overwhelmed and runs out.

<b>          EXT. STREAM - WOODS - DAY
</b>
          A stone angrily SKIPS across the water. John is about to
          toss another when Bernie Kosar trots into view. He ruffles
          the dog's fur but doesn't turn when Henri steps out of the
          woods and crosses to his side.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          I saw my grandfather. I saw what
          you did to the Mogadorians -- you

</b>          He said I must survive.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          The Elders had a plan. You weren't
          on that ship by chance. The nine
          of you were chosen for a reason.
          Even if only two of you live,
          together you'll pose a grave threat
          to our enemy.
          Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          You saw what they did to Lorien.
          How can nine or six or two of us
          take on that army? It's hopeless.
          Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          I never thought we'd get off Lorien
          alive -- but we did. I didn't know
          how we could survive on a strange
          planet -- but we have. I gave us
          six months before the Mogs found us
          -- it's been 10 years. Don't give
          up now.
          Henri grips John's shoulders.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          You have the potential to do great
          things. Even if you don't see it --
          I do.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          How can you put so much faith in
          me?

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Because your life is my life. If
          you quit, then everything I've
          worked for and sacrificed is
          meaningless.

          The fragile SILENCE is broken when John's cell phone BLEATS.
          He scans a text.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          No... go.
          John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture.

          A Halloween parade drifts past the CROWDS packing the
          sidewalks. Icicle lights twinkle in the trees. EXCITED KIDS
          in costume zigzag past John. It's small-town Americana at
          its best. ET waddles by holding a JEDI's hand.

<b>          A SLAP ON GLASS.

          mannequins in the display window of a sporting goods store.

<b>          INT. ED'S SPORTING GOODS STORE - NIGHT
</b>
          An annoying CHIME plays as the door opens and John enters.
          The store is deserted. The stock needs to be updated and the
          shelves could use a dust. Sam approaches wearing an apron.

<b>                         JOHN

          candy apples and kettle corn,
          they'll suddenly have the urge to
          buy sporting goods.
          John plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I put those on special tonight for

          Sam pulls off his apron, revealing a T-shirt emblazoned with
          the words â€œFuture Supervillainâ€�.

          He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          What about your stepdad?

<b>                         SAM
</b>          He hit the tavern at 6:00. He's
          already hammered by now. I'll
          probably find him passed out on the

<b>          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          John and Sam wander past the parade floats lined up along the
          road bordering the woods. Stalls sell hot dogs and cotton
          candy. John subtly scans the crowd.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          She's over there.
          John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some
          KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the camera from her eye,
          sees John and smiles as he approaches.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          You made it.

</b>          What do you think of Halloween in

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Give me a sec.
          She steps to the face-painting booth. It's sponsored by the
          local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie. Sarah hands Annie
          her camera. Sam whispers to John.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I'm impressed.
          Before John can respond, Sarah steps back.

          He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement. John
          and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam head away.

          It's like a flickering scene from a demented silent movie.
          The Zombies have almost caught up when the strobe abruptly
          ends. The SOUND of the chainsaws FADES and John and Sarah
          stop, panting and LAUGHING with relief.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          That was insane.

<b>          IT'S PITCH BLACK.
</b>          A werewolf HOWLS somewhere in the darkness. Something
          brushes past John's leg. He spins, suddenly unsure.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          What was that?

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Just part of the ride.
          He turns, sees a flash of purple light and hears the rustle
          of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS on all sides.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Are you sure?
          As he steps forward,

<b>          A THICK BRANCH
</b>          cuts through the dark and viciously SMACKS John on the back.
          He drops to the ground like a sack. Figures emerge from the
          shadows and he hears a DESPERATE STRUGGLE behind him.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Let go! Stop it!
          John tries to stand, but a boot CRACKS him in the ribs.
          Another strikes the side of his face. He is surrounded. His
          attackers are brutal and unrelenting. Over the LOOPING
          SOUNDTRACK OF B-MOVIE NOISES, Sarah's muffled SCREAMS DIM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          48.
</b>
<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Sarah! Sa-
          His voice is cut off as a fist SMASHES into his jaw and the
          steel cap of a combat boot SLAMS his groin. John staggers up
          but is viciously kicked back to the ground.
          PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as it hardens with blind rage. In a
          blur of motion he reaches up, grabs two of his attackers by
          their coats and hammers their skulls together. As they drop,
          John spins to meet his other two foes with

<b>          BLINDING PALMS OF LIGHT.
</b>          The assailants are illuminated in the phosphorescent glare.
          They're not Mogadorians but rather

<b>          FOOTBALL JOCKS.
</b>          One is Mark Jayne's buddy Kevin. They're wearing zombie
          makeup and military fatigues and have night-vision goggles
          strapped to their faces.
          John angrily strides forward, palm outstretched.
          NIGHT-VISION POV: Everything is an overexposed blur until --

<b>          WHAAAAM!!!
</b>          John brutally clotheslines one, then pummel-rams Kevin in the
          chest, sending him flying back 10 feet into a tree. Kevin
          slumps, out for the count. John arcs a glowing hand through
          the darkness.

<b>          SARAH IS GONE.
</b>          He plucks up the Jocks' fallen goggles and heads off with
          Terminator-like determination.

<b>          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
          Sarah is carried through the woods by TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS in
          camouflage fatigues and night-vision goggles. She SCREAMS.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Let go of me!
          She futilely tries to wrestle free.

<b>          SARAH (O.S.)

          Something about her terrified tone alerts Sam.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Sarah?
          She doesn't answer. He hesitates a moment, then charges into
          the woods.

<b>          INT. WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
          Freaky shadows crisscross as John uses his luminescent palms
          to navigate his way through the labyrinth of trees.

<b>          INT. CLEARING - WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
          Sam scrambles blindly through the darkness.

<b>          JOHN (O.S.)
</b>
<b>          SARAH!
</b>          Sam turns in the direction of JOHN'S VOICE. He's about to
          head towards it when

<b>          TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS
</b>          trudge into view. Sam darts behind a tree. Suddenly, the
          area is flooded with preternatural white light. He can hear
          the sounds of a SCUFFLE and one of the Jocks flies past and
          CRASHES in a heap while the other SCREAMS.

<b>          JOCK (O.S.)
</b>          You're blinding me! Stop!
          Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand.
          WHAT HE SEES: John pins the Jock to a tree and holds a
          luminous palm up to the lenses of the teen's goggles.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Where's Sarah? Tell me!!

<b>                         JOCK
</b>          Shepherd Falls. Now turn off that
          damn flashlight!
          John rips off the Jock's goggles, then pile-slides him 15
          feet into a rotten stump and takes off in a blur of speed.
          CAMERA STAYS ON SAM. OFF his stunned reaction...

<b>          EXT. SHEPHERD FALLS - WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
          A rocky promontory overlooks a crescent-shaped waterfall
          which drops into a swimming hole below. The Zombie Jocks
          carry Sarah into view and dump her in front of Mark. She's
          wild-cat angry when she sees him.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Are you crazy! Where's John?
          Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Relax. It's a practical joke.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          I swear if you hurt him --

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Get out of my face, Mark, you're

</b>          I'm the best thing that ever
          happened to you and I'm giving you
          one more chance.
          Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns to leave.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Don't walk away from me!
          Mark grabs her. Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance
          and falls back on the ground. Mark's rage is transplanted by
          concern. He steps towards her to help when --

<b>          JOHN (O.S.)
</b>          Back off!
          Mark watches John step out. Blood trickles from a cut above
          John's right eye.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          John! Are you okay?
          He nods. Mark looks past him, confused.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Where the hell are Kevin and Joe?
          John holds up a clutch of night-vision goggles.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Hey, those are police property!
          John flings them over Mark's head into the water.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          I'm going to kill you!
          With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him,
          pinning him to a tree. Blinded by rage, John jerks Mark's
          arm up behind his back.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          John! Stop!
          Mark is in real pain. Transfixed with anger, John keeps
          twisting. Sarah looks at him, pleading.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          That's his throwing arm!
          But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps
          him across the face. Startled, John lets go.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Football's all he's got.
          John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah
          offers Mark a look of disgust and follows after John.

          John charges into view.

<b>                         SARAH

          Sarah catches up.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          I'm sorry, I didn't want you to
          break his arm.

</b>          I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at
          myself.
          She stops, faces him.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          The guy's in love with you. Wants
          you back.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          That's not love.
          Their eyes meet in the moonlight.

<b>                         SARAH

          It's a picture-book perfect neighborhood. Most of the houses
          are festively decorated with front-yard graveyards and cobweb-
          festooned trees. John walks with Sarah. They come to the
          prettiest house on the block.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          This is me.
          John stares at the dozen jack-o'-lanterns arranged on the
          porch. They glare back with flickering bucktooth grins.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          I know. Wait until the Christmas
          decorations go up. My mom decks
          the halls with so many lights, you
          can see our house from space.
          Stray TRICK-OR-TREATERS race past. She motions to the cut
          above his eye, concerned.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          You should see a doctor.

</b>          For this? Wouldn't waste their

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          I really don't get you.
          She steps closer.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          But I feel like I can trust you.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          You can.
          The air is charged.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Good night.
          Sarah swings open the white picket gate.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Wait.
          As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her.
          Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to his
          passion. However, as their kiss intensifies,

<b>          THE JACK-O'-LANTERNS
</b>          rise and hover in midair. Sarah has her back to them, but
          when John's eyes momentarily flicker open, he sees the orbs
          grinning back. Startled, he pulls away from her.

<b>                         THE PUMPKINS
</b>          instantly drop and SMASH onto the porch, their candles
          blowing out on impact. Sarah spins and stares at the jack-o'-
          lanterns, pulp oozes through their cracked shells.
          Suspicious, she slowly turns, looks at John for an
          explanation. He does his best to cover his stunned reaction.
          Fat drops of RAIN begin to fall. John puts up his hood.

<b>                         JOHN

          Henri turns on a light, nursing a mug of coffee. Bernie
          wakes. John pulls off his hood. Henri looks at the cuts and
          bruises on John's face.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          They won't talk.

</b>          They attacked me. If I hadn't

          accidentally causing the mug to telekinetically

<b>          EXPLODE.
</b>          Coffee and shards splatter across the floor. Henri looks at
          John, stunned. John shrugs sheepishly.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          I was getting to that. I got a new
          Legacy.
          Henri absorbs that revelation.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Telekinesis. That's a big step.
          Must have been triggered by the

<b>                         HENRI

          from Sam. He CLICKS it open.

          off the garage door which is partially concertinaed open.

          John slides into view. It takes a second for his eyes to
          adjust. A pickup sits under a white tarp. There's no sign
          of Sam until he Boo Radley's out of the shadows behind him.

</b>          I looked at her the way you look at
          Sarah.

</b>          She can't come with us when we
          leave -- and we always have to
          leave, you know that.
          John nods, not wanting to deal with that reality.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          I was hoping to protect you from
          that pain.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          You can't protect me from

          OFF Henri's sad smile of acknowledgement...

          The Halloween decorations have been replaced by a
          Thanksgiving display.
          Wearing khakis and a pale blue Oxford, John tentatively walks
          up the front path. The warm sound of LAUGHTER drifts from
          inside. He takes a breath and rings the doorbell.

</b>
          It's like a Norman Rockwell cover come to life. Every inch
          of counter space is filled with platters of food.
          John watches Sarah, Annie, and a boisterous ASSORTMENT OF
          RELATIVES put the finishing touches to the Thanksgiving
          feast. KIDS rush in and out in a manic game of tag.
          John is captivated by the sense of family and celebration --
          things he's never known in his own life. Sarah steps over.
          She's wearing a funky-cool vintage dress.

<b>          INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          The table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an
          elaborate pine cone centerpiece. Sarah places the last
          turkey-shaped gravy boat onto the table. She smiles at John.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          You look dazed.

<b>                         JOHN

          She crosses.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          I'm glad you came.
          They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming
          bowl of mashed potatoes.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          Don't mind me.
          She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          Let's get a picture of you two
          lovebirds.
          Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye.

</b>          Mom. No. John really doesn't like
          having his --

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          It's okay. Let her take it.
          The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around
          her. Sarah nestles her face against his. As the flash WIPES

          turkey. Everybody is at the table. John sits next to Sarah.
          She holds his hand under the table. It's Hallmark worthy
          until the carriage clock on the mantel CHIMES.

          John speed dials as he steps out into the cold. He holds the

          CLICK. John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it,
          panicked. He paces, desperate and unsure, then gets an idea
          and punches another number.

          Sarah steps out just in time to see John climb into a pickup
          truck. It's the one from Sam's garage.

          It's a dilapidated Victorian. Mist shrouds the yard which is

          palm and uses it like a flashlight to sweep the interior.
          WHAT HE SEES: Take-out boxes litter the filthy counter. The
          sink is swamped with dirty dishes. The light washes across a
          semiautomatic sitting by a packet of Lucky Strikes.

<b>          SAM (O.S.)

          Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him.

          John realizes Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back
          over the kitchen door. His palm illuminates a familiar

<b>          CRYSTAL-HANDLED DAGGER.
</b>          It's lying on the counter by the fridge.

          But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light
          suddenly turns on and a MAN enters. He's built like a
          wrestler and goes by the name of FRANK.

          With a Lucky Strike clenched between his lips, Frank picks up

          between his fingers. Once Frank's safely around the corner,
          John releases his hand.
          The duo silently climbs onto the porch. John squats in front
          of the door. His hand shakes as he holds it out towards the
          lock and concentrates.

          Everything is filmed with dust. It's freezing and John's

          His heart thumps as he waits for something to react to the
          noise. But nothing does. As his eyes adjust to the dark, he
          notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door
          that leads down into...

<b>          INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          The ancient stairs sag as John slowly descends. The space is
          illuminated by a single naked bulb. The sound of DRIPPING
          WATER hammers the silence. John scans the rabbit warren of
          rooms and sees a figure chained to a chair in the corner.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Henri!
          He races over. But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a YOUNG
          MAN steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat. John
          turns too late and the bat strikes his left side. He drops
          the dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing. The
          man, BRET, raises the bat again. John focuses his mind.

<b>                         THE BAT
</b>          whips out of Bret's grip and torpedoes towards John -- who
          ducks out of the way as the bat flies past. Confused, Bret
          lurches forward. John scrambles for the bat, clenches it in
          his hand, and swings it into the young man's legs.

<b>                         BRET
</b>          knocks the light as he topples into a column and CRASHES onto
          the cement, out cold. It's over in a violent blur. John
          sits stunned for a moment. The swinging bulb casts surreal
          shadows as he spins back to Henri, telekinetically â€œunlocksâ€�
          the padlock securing the chains, and rips off the gag.
          Henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          You shouldn't be here.

<b>                         JOHN

          Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          I talked my way in. Thought the
          big guy was buying it.
          He rubs a wound on his neck.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          We have to leave!
          John helps Henri up, they race for the stairs when Bret's
          hand grabs John's ankle, tripping him to the floor.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Henri!
          Henri smashes his boot into Bret's face, knocking him out for
          good. John staggers up, they spin for the stairs just as

<b>          SAM AND FRANK

          John and Henri put up their hands. John focuses on the gun,
          but as the light bulb sweeps past, he causes it to EXPLODE.

<b>          THE ROOM PLUNGES INTO DARKNESS.
</b>          Henri body-slams Frank, sending the revolver skittering. But
          as he wrenches Sam to safety,

</b>          to the pickup fly out of Sam's pocket and slide under the
          stairs. John flashes on his palm, casting everything in
          eerie blue light.
          On all fours, Frank scrambles for the fallen weapon. It's
          almost within reach when he is lifted right off the ground by
          an invisible force.

          With tremendous telekinetic effort, John slams Frank against
          the ceiling.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Tell me what you know!
          Franks says nothing. John trains his palm light on the big
          man's face. It's like a blinding interrogation lamp.

          kill me if I didn't do what he
          wanted.
          This revelation stuns Henri.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          He told me to call if anyone came
          asking about the video.
          Sweat beads John's face from the mental exertion.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Did you?

          until they got here.
          Henri urgently retrieves Sam's gun and his dagger.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          We need to go! Now!
          John â€œreleasesâ€� Frank, who drops onto the floor like a whale
          and is knocked out. At that moment, a razor-thin line of
          dust drops from the floorboards above.

          CREAK above them. They are definitely not alone.

<b>          INT. HALL - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          FOUR MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS stalk through the house. Their long
          black coats SILENTLY sweep. One sniffs the air like a
          bloodhound and motions towards the basement door...

          there's no sign of John, Henri or Sam.
          Pissed, one of the Mogadorians strides towards a small
          blacked-out window. He punches out the glass with his fist
          and catches sight of Sam clambering over the back fence!

          pockets.

</b>          I must have dropped the keys!
          Henri keeps his cool, looks at John.

</b>          Start the engine.

          Henri's calm eyes never leave him.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Yes, you can.
          John nods, puts his hand on the dash and closes his eyes.
          The engine TURNS OVER but doesn't start. Sam looks up the
          street, panicked, as

          John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog
          unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a superhuman leap, he
          lands on the hood -- TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin out of
          the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in
          the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair.
          As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri
          sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck.

<b>          VRRRROOMMM!
</b>          The engine ROARS to life. The Mogadorian tumbles off the
          hood, magenta light spurting from his wound. John turns to
          Sam, who is petrified, and SCREAMS...

</b>

</b>          Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas. The
          Mogadorian EVISCERATES in a frenzy of embers. The truck
          bursts through the blizzard of sparks and STREAK-PEELS away.

          slowly descends the stairs, PANS UP PAST his right hand,
          which methodically twists two meditation balls, TO REVEAL

<b>          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.

          part as he steps into view and crosses to Frank and Bret who
          are chained to chairs. A Soldier stands behind each one.
          Frank looks at the Commander in terror.

          The Commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through the

          scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same
          Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien. His skin
          is deathly pale and his eyes have a cold purple tint.

          Bret is too freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the
          Soldiers. They grab Frank and Bret by the heads and yank
          open their mouths. Frank watches in confused terror as the
          Commander holds one of the meditation balls.

          In a flash of pent-up anger, John holds up his hand and

          John touches down on the other side and doesn't slow as he
          powers down the hall, which is a SHRIEKING tunnel of fire.

<b>          A BURNING BEAM

          at your party.
          He holds up a netbook which flashes with the FlipVideo
          footage of John's rescue of Sarah. It's posted on YouTube.

<b>                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
</b>          Do you know this boy?

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Yeah, John Smith. But I didn't
          invite him.

<b>                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
</b>          He's a fugitive. We've been

          Mark smirks, vindicated.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          I'll help you find him.
          He points to Sarah's image on the screen.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          He's not at Sarah's, I already
          checked. And one of my dad's
          deputies drove by his house --
          nada.

<b>                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
</b>          He poses a great threat to us.
          Where else could he be?
          Mark pulls out his cell phone.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          I've got Sarah's cell number, maybe
          you guys can trace it?
          The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men
          in the front. He looks back at Mark.

          Sam steps out and reacts in surprise as Henri emerges through

          At that moment, all the POWER in the school DIES and the
          headlights of an SUV flash across the window. Fear registers
          in John's eyes as he realizes...

</b>          Too late... they're here.

          The Commander climbs out. Mark follows but is distracted as
          a trio of black SUVs speeds into the lot followed by a
          tractor trailer from which inhuman GROWLS echo.

          He backs away in fearful realization.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          You guys aren't FBI.
          Before he can run, a Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck
          and constrains him. The Commander pulls

<b>                         TWO BANDOLIERS
</b>          over his broad shoulders. The cartridges are made of crystal
          and swirl with purple light. Finally, he slips on his

          Girl. She swings up an awesome hand-cannon and FIRES right
          at them. THE BLAST scorches the air between John and Sarah
          but takes out the

<b>                         MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
</b>          who was stalking up the hall behind them! John watches in
          shock as the Mogadorian keels over and SHATTERS into embers.
          John swings back to the Teen Girl as she strides forward.

<b>          SHE IS NUMBER 6.

</b>          Dead. The Mogs got her four months
          ago. We had been tracking them.
          She heads past. John and Sarah follow after her.

          The revelation hits John like a wrecking ball.

<b>                         SIX
</b>          You know what that means?

          stage.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          It'll take us out to the stadium.
          Six acknowledges that info with a curt nod. FOOTSTEPS. Six
          grabs John and Sarah by their arms and yanks them back
          against the wall.
          They hold their breath as one of the Mogadorian Soldiers
          prowls straight past. He stops for a moment, then turns the
          corner. Sarah looks across at the mirrored trophy case and
          sees there's no reflection.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          We're invisible.
          John realizes, turns to Six.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          You got any other Legacies?

<b>                         SIX
</b>          I can control the elements. You?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Lumen and telekinesis.
          More FOOTSTEPS. John turns and watches in horror as the
          Mogadorian Commander and a trio of Mogadorian Soldiers sweeps
          into view. The Commander is holding

<b>          MARK.
</b>          He is ashen with fear. Sarah has to catch herself from
          screaming. John makes a move, but Six holds him in place.

<b>                         SIX
</b>          Stay put. They want to draw you
          out.

<b>          94.
</b>          ANGLE ON THE SOLDIERS AND MARK. They're heading past the
          trophy case when JOHN'S VOICE booms out of nowhere.

<b>          JOHN (O.S.)
</b>          Mark! Linoleum! Now!
          Mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy
          case EXPLODES. Shards of glass rip into the Mogadorians and
          trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the aliens
          against the far wall. The Mogadorians SCREAM as they flail.
          John, Sarah and Six break cover. John wrenches Mark to his
          feet and they take off running. They dash around the next
          corner and find

<b>          HENRI, SAM AND BERNIE
</b>          sprinting towards them, followed by two Mogadorians! Six
          raises her hand-cannon, BLOWS one of the Mogs away, while
          John safely leads everybody into...

          John telekinetically uproots a trio of bookcases that fly
          across the space and block the door. Sarah turns to Mark who
          is totally shell-shocked.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          What are you doing with them?

          Mark turns to John, guilt-wracked.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          I didn't know they were trying to
          kill you.

          He offers Mark his hand. Mark shakes it. Suddenly, Bernie
          begins to GROWL.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          What is it, boy?
          Henri sees where Bernie is staring and realizes...

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          He's telling us to run!
          They take off a second before

<b>                         A PIKEN
</b>          PUMMEL-RAMS through the wall in a shower of bricks, books and
          paper. It utters a glass-shattering ROAR. John looks back
          and sees Bernie bravely holding his ground.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Bernie!
          He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself
          at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck. He's
          hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken
          tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens --

<b>          BERNIE BEGINS TO MORPH.
</b>          He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing. His features
          become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur turns to spines and in
          a matter of moments Bernie has transformed into a hulking

<b>          ALIEN CREATURE.
</b>          John looks to Henri as the truth of Bernie's origin dawns.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Bernie's a Chimera. He came with
          us from Lorien.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Guess I wasn't the only one keeping

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Somebody had to watch you when I

          They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          The gym's this way.
          A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of
          lockers -- BOOOOOM! -- it's like an incendiary grenade. The
          paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by FIRE.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that
          use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts. One
          FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off
          its hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES.
          John spins back and SCREAMS --

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Go! Go! Go!
          They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to
          fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the
          fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a
          projectile SMACKS him in the back. It's like being hit by
          napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on

<b>          THE SPRINKLER HEADS
</b>          that run the length of the hall. A deluge sprays, dousing
          the fire. With his clothes smoking, John tears around the
          corner. The Mogadorians charge after him, but find

<b>          SIX IS WAITING.
</b>          BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them at point-blank range.
          Magenta light gushes from their wounds. Like rain hitting
          hot coals, their bodies HISS as they crack and cinder.

<b>                         SIX
</b>          Keep moving!
          Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view. Then John sees
          something emerge through the smoky, water-choked haze.

<b>          IT'S THE SECOND PIKEN!
</b>          It utters a low, predatory GROWL and launches itself forward.
          Oddly, Six doesn't move. She closes her eyes and lays one
          hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to

<b>          ICE!
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          97.
</b>          In a matter of moments, the hall has been transformed into an
          icy tunnel. The sprinklers spray snow. The Piken struggles
          to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip-
          slides after John and Six, who disappear into...

<b>          INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
          CRAAAAACK! The doors are DEMOLISHED as the Piken flails off
          the ice. It takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids
          to a stop. It ROARS in humiliated FURY, and its red eyes
          scan for John and Six who are nowhere to be seen.
          The Piken prowls behind the serving counter. Snow beads off
          its back. Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing
          something. It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans
          that are stored below.
          REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's
          arm. They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes.
          Threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the Piken
          pokes its head further. Its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare
          right at them. With a final frustrated SNORT, it carries on.

<b>          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
          Henri, Sarah, Sam and Mark race into view. Sarah stops,
          panicked and afraid.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Where's John?

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Right behind us.
          He offers her his hand. She's about to take it when

<b>          A MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
</b>          steps out of the shadows. There is nowhere and no time for
          Henri and the others to run. But as the Mogadorian squeezes
          the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his right

<b>          ERUPTS!
</b>          Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall. They are
          still at each other's throats and don't even notice as they
          steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug.
          The creatures SMASH through the opposite wall and out of
          sight. It's over in a violent blink.

<b>          INT. KITCHEN - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
          John and Six sneak through the shadows. She steps to the
          door, but it won't budge.

          friends.

<b>                         SIX
</b>          Don't you mean the girl?
          John ignores the jibe and turns back. Six grabs his arm.

<b>                         SIX
</b>          I broke the Elders' spell to find
          you. The Mogs can kill me now. We
          have to go.

</b>          We stay and fight.
          OFF his determination...

<b>          INT. HOME ECONOMICS ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
          Henri and Sam crouch behind one station while Sarah and Mark
          hide in the one opposite. Henri pulls a selection of weapons
          from the backpack. He hands one to Sam, looks over at Mark.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          You know how to use one of these?

<b>                         MARK
</b>          My dad's the sheriff.
          He slides two across the floor. The door opens. They swing
          up to fire but find -- John and Six.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Save it for the Mogs. Let's go!

<b>          INT. LOCKER ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
          Bernie and the Piken pummel the rows of lockers which
          COLLAPSE like dominos. Gashed and exhausted, the battling
          duo SHATTER-SMASHES into

<b>          THE SHOWER STALLS.
</b>          Water SPURTS from a broken pipe. The Piken slips on the
          slick tiles. As it struggles to right itself, Bernie seizes
          the moment and sinks his fangs into the monster's neck.

<b>                         THE PIKEN
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          99.
</b>          desperately thrashes. Its talons viciously rip into Bernie's
          side. Ignoring the pain, Bernie doesn't let go until his foe
          finally jerks to stillness. As Bernie sinks to the floor, he
          MORPHS back into a beagle and lies spent and bleeding...

<b>          INT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
          John leads the group past the bleachers and points to the
          side of the stage.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          The door's over here. The tunnel
          leads out to the stadium.
          Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of
          metal doors. John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and
          whips the chain free. The doors fly open,

<b>                         TWO MOGADORIANS
</b>          spring out of the dark. One tackles Henri while the other
          blindsides John. Henri struggles until

<b>          BOOOOOM!
</b>          The BLAST cinders the Mog's head clean off. Henri looks over
          and sees Mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods his thanks.
          The second has John pinned when it suddenly ROARS in agony
          and disintegrates into a shower of sparks, revealing

<b>          SIX.
</b>          She sheathes her dagger and helps John up.

<b>                         SIX
</b>          Saving your life. My new hobby.
          Sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between John and
          Six. PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! -- three Mogadorian
          knives razor the air. One impales Six in the shoulder. She
          slumps at John's feet. Henri opens FIRE on the

<b>          THE COMMANDER AND TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS
</b>          who storm towards them. John SCREAMS to Sam and Mark.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>
<b>                         (RE: SIX)
</b>          Get her down the tunnel!
          They grab Six by the arms and drag her into the tunnel.
          Sarah glances back at John and follows after them. Henri
          takes out a Soldier. John sweeps up his hand and

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          100.
</b>
<b>          THE WOODEN FLOOR OPENS LIKE A ZIPPER!
</b>          The Commander and the other Soldier are sent flying as the
          planks rip free of their nails. John and Henri charge into
          the tunnel. The doors fly shut behind them and the bleacher
          stand rolls forward to seal the entrance.

<b>          INT. TUNNEL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
          Sarah is in the lead. Sam and Mark follow, holding the
          wounded Six. They've almost reached the end when

<b>                         A MOGADORIAN
</b>          lurches into the mouth of the tunnel. Without a second's
          hesitation, Sam swings up his gun and BLASTS it. Mark looks
          at him in shock as they race through the embers. Sam shrugs.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I play a lot of Xbox.

<b>          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
          Sam, Mark, Six and Sarah hurtle across the field. When they
          reach the track, Sarah looks back and smiles with relief when
          John and Henri burst out of the tunnel.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Don't stop! Get to the woods!
          She nods and exits with the others.
          John and Henri head onto the field after them when

<b>          THE SECOND PIKEN
</b>          leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them. It's
          seriously pissed. It bounds straight towards John. Its
          fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards
          him. At the last second,

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the
          Piken's jaws. The creature shakes him like a rag doll and
          flings him 50 feet down the field. John watches, anguished,
          as Henri lands in a heap.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
          The Piken pivots, turns its crimson eyes on John. It almost
          seems to smirk. Its fangs are stained with Henri's blood.
          John's face hardens into a mask of rage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          101.
</b>          He makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges. As it
          springboards into the air...
          ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench.
          ANGLE ON THE GOALPOSTS -- as they're SNAPPED clean off their
          bases and fly skyward.
          ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him.
          ANGLE ON THE PIKEN -- as it arcs towards John with its mouth
          open and teeth bared. Suddenly, the goalposts spear its
          flanks, impaling it like supersize BBQ forks.
          The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks
          onto the 20-yard line. John watches impassively as the red
          life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side.

<b>          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
          The stadium looms in the distance. Sam wrenches the dagger
          from Six's shoulder while Sarah and Mark anxiously watch.

<b>          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
          John sinks by Henri's side.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Henri.
          Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked
          with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to
          drag him to his feet.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Come on, taillights in five.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          I won't be coming with you this
          time. Save yourself.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          We go together!
          Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment

<b>          THE COMMANDER'S SWORD
</b>          flies past John and impales Henri in the chest. Henri utters
          a GROAN and his dying eyes meet John's.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Find the others.
          His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          102.
</b>
<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Your life is my life... always.
          His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip.
          Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily
          flicker with a radiant blue light. He angrily spins to face

<b>          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
</b>          But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps
          his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air.
          He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John's feet kick
          uselessly as he's lifted face to face.

<b>                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
</b>          Number 4.
          Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like
          mocking trophies.

<b>                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
</b>          Your Cepan saved you on Lorien.
          The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty. He
          wrenches his sword from Henri's corpse.

<b>                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
</b>          But this moment was inevitable.
          The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it.
          John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is
          the moment his adolescence officially ends. This is the
          moment when a warrior is born.
          ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which
          flutter to the ground like glittering confetti.
          John stares at the alien with calm confidence.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Nothing is inevitable.

<b>          ANGLE ON JOHN'S HAND AS IT IGNITES.
</b>          The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene
          torches. He grips one of the Commander's bandoliers.
          TIGHT ON THE MOGADORIAN'S FACE as he realizes it's over.
          The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction.

<b>          IT'S LIKE A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION!
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          103.
</b>          John, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every
          goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the

<b>          SUPERNOVA OF FIRE
</b>          that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell.

<b>          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
          Sarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the
          night sky. Her breath catches in her throat.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Oh my God... John.
          Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting
          for the stadium.

<b>          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
          It's a smoking ruin. The seats have melted into puddles.
          Sarah bursts into view. She looks across the devastated
          field. The grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet
          of stubble. Nothing remains of Henri or the Mogadorians.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          John!
          She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope.
          Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes
          completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her
          mouth to stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          John!
          Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap
          each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever let go.

          The sky is cracked with the first light of day. Sarah is
          dressing Six's wound at a table. Six winces.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't

</b>          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          104.
</b>          As the two teens size each other up, CAMERA FINDS Mark. He
          hangs up his cell and crosses to John and Sam, who are
          talking intently by the motorcycles. John is now wearing a
          pair of old jeans and a faded denim jacket.

<b>                         MARK

</b>          You good to go?

<b>                         SIX

</b>          Sam, ride with Six.

<b>                         SIX

          Sam steps in front of her, determined.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I have to find out if the Mogs took
          my dad.
          Six turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam.

<b>                         SIX
</b>          You slow us down, I'll shoot you
          myself.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          I want to come too.

<b>                         JOHN

</b>          When it's safe.
          She bows her head, anguished. He gently lifts her chin.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Where I'm from, we only give our

</b>          I love you, Sarah.
          Their lips meet and they kiss. It only ends when John hears
          an URGENT RUSTLE in the woods. They turn and watch as

<b>                         BERNIE KOSAR
</b>          limps into view. Blood mats his fur and his face is
          scratched but he's alive. OFF John's relief...

          Sam sits behind Six on her motorcycle. John holds Bernie as
          he straddles his Harley. Bernie morphs into a gecko and
          darts into his pocket. Sarah studies John and Six, unsure.
          John THROTTLES the bike to life, then looks back at Sarah.
          He fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at
          Mark's side. RAIN spits as the motorcycles start off.

<b>          JOHN (V.O.)

          John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to
          brand the image of their faces onto their memories.

<b>          EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b>
          The bikes blur past the â€œWelcome to Paradiseâ€� sign.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          106.
</b>
<b>          JOHN (V.O.)
</b>          He warned me the pain would be
          unbearable if I left her. He was
          right.

<b>          EXT. TEXAS PLAINS - DAY
</b>
          A straight stretch of blacktop bisects the sunbaked flatness.

<b>          JOHN (V.O.)
</b>          But I don't regret it. The pain
          reminds me what's at stake.
          A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view.

<b>          JOHN (V.O.)
</b>          We must find the others and face
          our enemy together. I'm not sure
          how we can stop them. But nothing
          is inevitable. I know that now.
          Thunderheads darken the horizon.

<b>          JOHN (V.O.)
</b>          I am Number 4.
          His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the
          battles yet to be fought. He's ready to face a future
          unmapped and uncharted. Ready.

<b>          FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>                         THE END
</b>
