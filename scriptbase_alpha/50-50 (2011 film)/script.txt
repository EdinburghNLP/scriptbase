          OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE
                         
                         
          EXT. SAN DIEGO - DAY
                         
          It's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches,
          golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of
          rapturous citizens.
                         
                         
          EXT. BUS STOP - DAY
                         
          A BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers.
                         
          We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered,
          pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old
          man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches
          MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL.
                         
                         
          INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Adam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one
          would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked
          away behind the sterile and monochrome walls.
                         
          Adam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is
          engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores
          Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do.
                         
          Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The
          Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Can I help you?
                         
                          ADAM
           I have an appointment.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Name?
                         
                          ADAM
           Adam Schwartz.
                         
          The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not
          knowing what to do. He coughs again.
                         
          Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing.
           2.
                         
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (CONFUSED)
           Um, am I supposed to go somewhere?
                         
          With her eyes the Receptionist points to the waiting area.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Oh, should I go sit?
                         
          The Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine.
                         
          Adam looks around the empty waiting room. He takes a seat and
          browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time,
          Life, Modern Maternity, etc. Only moments later, as though he
          hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out:
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Adam Schwartz.
                         
          Adam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else
          there. Again the receptionist calls out again -
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
           Adam Schwartz.
                         
                          ADAM
           Yeah, that's me.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Follow me.
                         
          The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and
          hands him a hospital gown.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
           Put this on.
                         
                          ADAM
           Do I need to take off all my
           clothes?
                         
          The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           I'll figure it out.
                         
          The Receptionist leaves. Adam awkwardly undresses and slips
          on the hospital gown. Unsure which end of the gown is the
          front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides
          he has it right.
                         
          Adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find
          JOANNE, an overly cheery nurse.
           3.
                         
                         
                          NURSE JOANNE
           Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice
           to meet you.
                         
          Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to
          irritate his skin.
                         
                          ADAM
           You don't happen to have anything
           in a cotton blend?
                         
                          NURSE JOANNE
                          (LAUGHS)
           Cotton. You're funny.
                         
          Joanne hands Adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick
          yellow line.
                         
           NURSE JOANNE (CONT'D)
           Now I'm going to need you to fill
           this cup with urine. You think you
           can do that?
                         
                          ADAM
           You want me to fill this entire
           cup.
                         
                          JOANNE
           Yup.
                         
          Adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's gonna take me at least a week
           to fill this. Can I take it home?
                         
                          JOANNE
                          (LAUGHS)
           Take it home. You're so funny.
                         
          The CAMERA PANS to reveal a group of MEDICAL STUDENTS taking
          diligent notes in the background. WE PAN AGAIN this time to
          the next room:
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. BATHROOM
                         
          Adam struggles to fill the cup. After a few beats, there's a
          knock on the door.
                         
           JOANNE (O.S.)
           You okay in there Adam?
           4.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           Just another minute.
                         
          Adam looks down at the empty cup in frustration. The CAMERA
          PANS to the next room:
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. X-RAY ROOM
                         
          Adam stands in front of an X-Ray machine. The APATHETIC
          TECHNICIAN has him stand in a dozen uncomfortable positions
          for long periods of time: sideways, one arm in the air, then
          the other arm, on one leg, then the other, one leg in the
          air, then the other, and so on.
                         
          Again we see the group of Medical Students taking notes. The
          CAMERA PANS to the next room:
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. EXAMINING ROOM
                         
          Joanne pulls out a giant needle.
                         
                          JOANNE
           Here comes the choo-choo!
                         
          In the back we see the Med Students still taking notes. The
          CAMERA PANS to the next room:
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM
                         
          Adam is lying on the gurney of an MRI machine. He is slowly
          drawn into the enclosed body scanner.
                         
                          TECHNICIAN
                          (AUTHORITATIVELY)
           Now make sure you lie completely
           still. Otherwise we'll have to do
           it all over again. Which we're not
           going to have to do, right?
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM - LATER
                         
          Adam lies perfectly still in the enclosed body scanner.
                         
                          ADAM
           Hello? Is anybody out there?
                         
          There's no one there. He's been left unattended. The MRI
          Technician is watching the Laker game in the next room.
           5.
                         
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           I have to pee.
                         
          The Med Students continue to take notes.
                         
          END OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE
                         
                         
          EXT. SAN DIEGO - EVENING
                         
          Through the window of the hospital the CAMERA PULLS OUT and
          PANS across the San Diego skyline. We watch as the Sun sets
          to night, then rises to morning...
                         
                         
          EXT. SAN DIEGO BEACH - MORNING
                         
                         SUPER: JUNE
                         
          It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to
          lift. With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard
          is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then
          rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean.
                         
          About a mile inland, we come upon:
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND VIEW GATED COMMUNITY - DAY
                         
          Rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with
          lawns groomed to perfection fill the community. This is
          Southern California Suburbia.
                         
          The sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and
          louder as we PUSH IN ON:
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The interior of Adam's house is spotless. Pictures on the
          walls: Adam and his dad sailing. Adam and his parents at his
          Bar Mitzvah. Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School
          Graduation. A University of Berkeley hat. A National Academic
          Achievement Award in the Sciences.
                         
          Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to
          RACHEL (25), his loving girlfriend. Cute, charming, and
          artsy, Rachel is "Winnie Cooper" all grown up.
                         
          The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. A loud
          obnoxious alarm clock goes off. Startled, Adam jumps up.
          Drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks
          around in confusion.
           6.
                         
                         
          After a moment, Adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and
          turns off the alarm. The sound of the crashing waves turns
          back on. Adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the
          sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm
          returns. He pushes the clock again. The alarm turns off but
          now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. Again Adam pushes
          a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder/rain
          storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound
          of loud clanging church bells. Rachel rolls over -
                         
                          RACHEL
           (asleep and incoherent)
           Make it stop.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (WHISPERS)
           It won't turn off.
                         
          Frustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons. This only
          makes it worse. We hear ALL of the previous sounds
          simultaneously sound off. Rachel rolls over and moans as she
          puts a pillow over her head.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERS)
           Sorry.
                         
          Adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an
          end to the noise. He sits for a moment at the edge of the
          bed, collects himself.
                         
          Adam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Mmmmm.
                         
          Rachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair.
          Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair.
          She holds it up.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           Oh my god.
                         
                          ADAM
           What?
                         
                          RACHEL
           I think you have a gray hair.
                         
                          ADAM
           Really?
                         
                          RACHEL
           I'm gonna pull it out.
           7.

           No! Don't touch it.
                         
          Adam jumps from bed. He rushes into the bathroom. Rachel
          rolls back to sleep.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Adam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray
          hair. Once he finds it, he holds it out for a closer look. It
          is in fact a gray hair. He smiles.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          As Adam showers, he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand,
          but the bottle is empty. He looks over at Rachel's large
          assortment of shower products, finds one that smells
          pleasant, Fructis by L'Oreal, and squirts some into his hair.
          He then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product.
                         
                         
          INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Adam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror. His outfit is
          well put together, but not what you would expect of someone
          his age - more of a Mr. Rogers look. He pulls out a LINT
          BRUSH and meticulously combs his cardigan.
                         
                         
          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER
                         
          SETH (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white
          Neon and HONKS the horn. On the bumper is a sticker: "Let's
          put the Christ back in Christmas."
                         
          Overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence,
          Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit.
                         
          Just then Seth looks over at 3 YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN and
          their MOTHER waiting for the school bus. The mother's jaw is
          on the ground in shock. Seth hides the joint and smiles in
          embarrassment.
                         
                          SETH
           Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it?
                         
          The mother quickly moves her kids out of sight.
                         
          Adam approaches Seth's car. He spots his neighbors ANDREW and
          MISSY DONNELLY (late 40's) getting into their car. They wave
          to Adam.

           Sorry about the noise last night.
                         
          Adam shrugs as if to say "what the fuck?" Andrew and Missy
          giggle as they get into their car.

           No.
                         
                          SETH
           Well, you smell like the cast of
           Steel Magnolias.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SMELLS HIMSELF)
           I ran out of shampoo. I had to use
           Rachel's.
                         
                          SETH

           you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis.
                         
          Adam tries to close his window. The child safety lock is on.
                         
                          ADAM
           Can you unlock my window? There's a
           lot of pollen in the air.
                         
          Seth ignores Adam and turns up the music.

           up. It feels like my nasal cavities
           are on fire.
                         
          Adam begins to clear his throat, Seth turns the music even
          louder.
                         
                          SETH
           Sorry music's too loud, it's making

          We see the morning bustle as BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN stand in
          line waiting for their morning coffee. Adam and Seth stand at
          the end of that line watching the YOUNG COUPLE in front of
          them who can't keep their hands off of each other.

           I don't get it, that guy is clearly

           Rachel and I used to be like that;
           like two wild animals in heat...
                          (THINKS)
           I guess it is only natural though,
           as we get older, more mature,
           things begin to slow down.

                          SETH
           What the fuck are you talking
           about? I don't think she's waiting
           for you to ask anything. You're
           using her shampoo. Next thing
           you'll be using her tampons.

           yet she spends every night with
           you, in your bed, but she won't
           sleep with you?

           It's not that big a deal.
                         
                          SETH
           So when does it become a big deal?
           Five weeks? Six weeks? A year? My

           begin to worry.

           maybe half a million.
                         
                          ADAM
           But they're not Rachel. I don't
           know how to explain it, but being
           with her just feels right. And I'm
           not going to overlook that just
           cause we're in a lull.

           My parents are in a lull, which is
           what happens after 35 years of
           marriage. You've only been dating
           her four months. At our age sex is
           all we have. Every time she refuses
           to sleep with you a small piece of
           every man's soul dies. She's
           killing us Adam...You're a semi-
           smart, semi-successful, semi-
           average looking dude. Just based on
           that you could get with at least
           one third of the female population.
                         
          Adam and Seth step up to the counter. They're greeted by the
          SUPER GAY BARISTA, who loves his job way too much.

          Demetri examines Adam. He's not impressed with what he sees.
                         
                          DEMETRI
           I'd let you blow me.

          The Barista hands Seth and Adam two cups of coffee, they each
          leave a dollar.

           Yeah?
                         
                          ADAM
           I should probably get to work.
                         
                          PHIL
           That's probably a good idea.
                         
          Phil looks at the clock - 10 a.m.
                         
                          PHIL (CONT'D)
           I think I'm gonna go to lunch.
                         
          Phil wanders off.
                         
                         
          INT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - LATER
                         
          Adam and GREG (45), Adam's slightly moronic co-worker, place
          the finishing touches on the CRO MAGNON exhibit - it's an
          elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family
          of four Cro Magnons. Outside their hut it's snowing, but
          inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on
          the walls. The MAN instructs his SON to paint as the WOMAN
          teaches her DAUGHTER to sew. We see Greg positioning the
          fossil of a VELOCIRAPTOR next to the mother and daughter. The
          dinosaur looks poised to pounce. Adam notices.
                         
                          ADAM
           Greg. What are you doing?
                         
                          GREG
           It's a velociraptor.
                         
                          ADAM
           Where did it come from?
                         
                          GREG
           The dinosaur exhibit.
           (off Adam's look)
           Why can't we just say it was the
           first domesticated pet?...People
           love dinosaurs.
           14.
                         
                         
          Adam cringes in frustration.
                         
                          ADAM
           Greg you can't just...that's a 75
           million year old fossil...just
           please, put it away before someone
           sees it.
                         
          Greg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away. He flaps the
          dinosaur's arm in the air - waving goodbye to Adam.

          Adam gives a reluctant wave.
                         
                          ADAM

          steps in and moves Kid 1's hand off.

                          ADAM
           This is Homo Neanderthalensis - the
           Neanderthal Man. For over 150,000
           years his ancestors dominated all
           of Europe. But then about 30,000
           years ago, Neanderthals began to
           disappear, until one day, their
           entire civilization was gone.

                          ADAM
           Well no one knows for sure. But
           it's suspected that because
           Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman,
           he roamed the land, only fending
           for himself - never learning to
           cohabitate with others. So as Cro
           Magnon families settled into
           Europe, they took over the land.
           One by one, Neanderthal was pushed
           out...and never seen, or heard from
           again.
                         
                          SETH

           (to the kids)
           But you never know, just cause they
           vanished doesn't mean they're gone.
           For all we know, there could be a
           Neanderthal walking among us right
           now. And by the looks of this guy
                          HERE -
           (points at Neanderthal)
           I'd say he probably plays defense
           for the Raiders.
                         
          Adam's joke gets a small laugh from the teacher, but zero
          response from the kids.

          Adam and Seth look at each other in shock...Seth chimes in -
                         
                          SETH
           I see dinosaurs.
                         
          Seth runs down the hall towards the dinosaur exhibit. The
          kids follow in excitement. The teacher barely bats an eye as
          she takes her time slowly trailing after the group.

          The pedantic DR. ROSS enters and completely ignores Adam.
          Instead, he looks over Adam's chart, examines his MRI scans,
          and pulls out a DICTAPHONE -
                         
           DR. ROSS
           (into the dictaphone)
           Patient has been complaining of
           excessive urination, back pain, and
           night sweats. Blood tests and urine
           analysis are normal. MRI indicates

          We see Adam's face gradually look more and more confused, he
          slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question.

           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
           That is a massive schwannoma

           DR. ROSS
           It's a malignant tumor.
                         
                          ADAM

           How is that possible?...I don't
           smoke. I don't drink. I eat
           healthy...I even recycle.
                         
           DR. ROSS
           Well Adam it's actually quite
           fascinating. Your cancer is the
           result of an incredibly rare gene
           mutation in chromosome 17p in the
           p53 Gene that causes the growth of
           malignant cells in tissue around
           the nerves. In your case it's grown
           along the nerves in your lower
           spine.
                         
          Adam looks at himself in the mirror.
                         
                          ADAM
           (still in denial)
           But, look at me. I don't look sick.
                         
           DR. ROSS
           Cancer often has no specific
           symptoms. People can go years with
           out knowing they're sick. We're
           lucky we caught it before it
           metastasizes.

           I'm going to put you on a 4 month
           regimen of chemotherapy. It's an
           aggressive dosage so you might want
           to think about taking some time off
           from work.
                         
          This is real. Adam walks to the window and presses his face
          against the glass. He looks down at the city below. From 15
          stories up, the people on the street look like miniature
          figurines.
                         
          Adam turns back to Dr. Ross.
                         
                          ADAM
           Can't you just cut it out of me?
                         
           DR. ROSS
           Yes, that is an option. But because
           the tumor has spread to a such
           significant size. Cutting it out
           now would be risky.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well what are my chances of beating
           this?
                         
          Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are
          seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but.
                         
           DR. Ross
           Listen, you're in good hands. The
           best thing for you to do right now
           is to not worry...Let me do the
           worrying. Alright?
                         
          Dr. Ross takes a long look at Adam's devastated face.
                         
           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
           Maybe you should talk to someone.
                         
          Dr. Ross hands Adam a business card for the "Mount Sinai
          Psychology Group".
                         
           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
           We have a whole department of
           psychologists here in the hospital.
           They specialize in cases...in
           these...sort of matters. They'll be
           able to help you.
                         
          Not knowing what else to say, Dr. Ross looks at his watch,
          looks back to Adam, and moves to the door.
           20.
                         
                         
           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
           Hang in there champ.
                         
                         
          INT. SAN DIEGO PUBLIC LIBRARY - EVENING
                         
          CLOSE ON a computer screen:
                         
          "Neurofibrosarcoma Schwannoma. Treatment Forms: Chemotherapy
          and Radiation offer negligible success rates. Surgical
          resection proven to be most effective. Risks of surgery:
          Amputation of limbs. Paralysis. Death. 2 Year survival rate:
          50%. If tumor metastasizes systemically, 2 year survival
          rate: 0%."
                         
          Adam sits staring at the screen. This is not good.
                         
          The LIBRARIAN, a tall blond surfer type, taps Adam on the
          shoulder.
                         
                          LIBRARIAN
           Hey bro, time's up.
                         
          Startled. Adam looks up at the librarian.
                         
                          ADAM
           Can I have just a few more minutes?
                         
                          LIBRARIAN
           Sorry bro. Twenty minute limit.
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Rules.
                         
          The librarian motions to the LONG LINE of mostly HOMELESS
          CUSTOMERS waiting to use the computer.
                         
                         
          INT. BUS - EVENING
                         
          Adam sits deep in thought.
                         
                         
          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          The bus stops. Adam gets off, walks to his house, and takes a
          deep breath...
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Adam enters the living room - it's empty. NPR News is on the
          radio. Fresh paint dries on a canvas resting on an easel. The
          sound of someone cooking comes from the kitchen.
           21.
                         
                         
           RACHEL (O.S.)
           Adam? Is that you?
                         
          Adam walks into the kitchen. Rachel is at the stove cooking
          in her underwear. Adam stands in the doorway watching her.
          God she looks sexy. Rachel turns -
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           (in a Hungarian accent)
           Welcome home Mr. Adam. I made
           vegetarian goulash.
                         
          Like a ballerina, Rachel crosses to Adam on her tip toes
          holding out a spoon of her goulash. She holds up the offering
          to Adam's mouth. He takes a small bite and smiles, trying to
          hide his internal distress. His sad eyes tell Rachel another
          story.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           (still using accent)
           What is wrong?
                         
                          ADAM
           Nothing.
                         
                          RACHEL
           (still using accent)
           Liar.
                         
          This is not going to be easy.
                         
                          ADAM
           We need to talk.
                         
          Rachel drops the accent. This seems serious.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Why? What's going on?
                         
                          ADAM
           I had a doctor's appointment today.
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (WORRIED)
           What kind of doctor's appointment?
                         
          Adam has no idea what to say.
                         
                          ADAM
           Have you ever seen the movie
           "Beaches"?
                         
                          RACHEL
           You mean with Bette Midler?
           22.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           Yeah that one.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Not as good as "The Rose", but
           good.
                         
                          ADAM
           Remember the end of "Beaches"?
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (CONFUSED)
           Yeah. Sad....What does that have to
           do with you?
                         
          Adam just looks her in the eyes...Rachel gets it.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           Oh. Oh my god.
                         
          In total shock, Rachel covers her mouth.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           What kind?
                         
                          ADAM
           I don't know.
                         
                          RACHEL
           You don't know?
                         
                          ADAM
           Well I do know, but I can't
           pronounce it. Neuroscharnoma or
           something.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Well how bad is it?
                         
                          ADAM
           It's not good.
                         
          Rachel hugs Adam. Soaking in the comfort, Adam rests his head
          on her shoulder. She gently strokes his hair. Adam's hand
          slowly moves down Rachel's back. He starts kissing her neck.
          He knows it's wrong, but can't help it, the only thing
          running through his mind is sex.
                         
          After a beat Rachel pulls away.
                         
                          RACHEL
           (begins to cry)
           You have cancer.
           23.
                         
                         
          Heart racing, Rachel opens the top pantry. She reaches back
          as far as she can and pulls out a cookie jar. She sticks her
          hand in the jar and pulls out an old pack of American
          Spirits. Adam looks at Rachel disapprovingly.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           Not now.
                         
                          ADAM
           I just think it's an interesting
           time to take up smoking again.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Adam I'm 24 years old!
                          (CATCHES HERSELF)
           You're 25.
                         
          Rachel puts one of the cigarettes to her mouth, lights it on
          the stove and takes a drag.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           What are we going to do? I don't
           know what to do.
                         
          Rachel begins compulsively pulling drags from the cigarette.
          Adam takes the cigarette out of her hand. He goes to put it
          out, but takes a drag instead. He then hugs Rachel with one
          hand and opens the window with the other; he proceeds to
          discreetly fan out the cigarette smoke.
                         
                          ADAM
           Sshhhh. Everything's going to be
           alright Yammy. I'm going to start
           chemo in a few days.
                          (POSITIVE)
           We're going to get through this.
                         
          They embrace in total silence...A beat. And then Adam groans
          with the realization -
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Ugh...and my parents are coming
           over for dinner.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Do they know?
                         
          Adam is clearly not in the mood to see his parents.
                         
                          ADAM
           No.
           24.

          INT. FOYER - ADAM'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Rachel and Adam stand in front of the door.
                         
                          ADAM
           3...2...1...
                         
          Rachel opens the door.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (BIG SMILE)
           Hey.
                         
          Adam's mother, EDITH SCHWARTZ (55) enters. Edith is a short,
          portly woman with thick glasses and a bright red sweatshirt
          bearing a cross-stitched cat on it. If the borough of Queens
          and the city of Milwaukee had a child, it would be Edith.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (EXCITED)
           There they are!
                         
          Edith gives Rachel a big hug, and grabs for her left hand.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           I can't wait to hear the big news.
                         
                          ADAM
           Where's dad?
                         
          ART SCHWARTZ(58) enters the house carrying a CAT. Due to a
          stroke 10 years prior, he carries a limp and is a little out
          of it.
                         
                          ART
           I found your cat playing in the
           neighbors yard.
                         
                          ADAM
           Dad, I don't have a cat.
                         
          Art drops the cat and it bolts out the door.
                         
                          EDITH
           So what's for dinner?
           25.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S DINING ROOM - LATER
                         
          Everyone sits around the table. Edith pokes at her plate of
          vegetarian goulash, confused as to what she's looking at.
                         
                          RACHEL
           If I had known you were coming I
           would have made something else.
                         
                          EDITH
           I'm just glad to finally be sharing
           a shabbat dinner with my son...
           (looks at her plate)
           So this isn't meat?
                         
                          RACHEL
           No it's called sei-tan.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's made of wheat gluten.
                         
          Edith looks more confused.
                         
                          EDITH
           But it's not meat.
                         
                          RACHEL
           No, but it has a texture just like
           meat.
                         
          Edith reluctantly takes a small bite of the goulash.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (INSINCERE)
           Mmmmm. It's Good.
                         
          Edith puts her spoon down. She pulls a handful of pills out
          her fanny-pack and puts them in front of Art.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           Art, take your pills.
                         
          Art picks up the pills and puts them in his mouth, but
          doesn't swallow.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           Swallow.
                         
          As Art swallows, Edith eagerly turns her attention to Rachel.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           So? Did you set a date?
           26.
                         
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (CONFUSED)
           A date?
                         
                          EDITH
                          (TO ADAM)
           Do not do summer like your cousin,
           remember how awful that was?
           Schlepping around in the heat like
           that. Plus the bugs and the gnats.
                         
                          ADAM
           (whispers to Rachel)
           What is she talking about?
                         
                          EDITH
           And now Rachel. I know we haven't
           discussed this, but are you going
           to convert?
                         
                          RACHEL
           (whispers to Adam)
           She thinks we're getting married.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom. We're not getting married.
                         
                          EDITH
           Oh thank god.
                          (TO RACHEL)
           No offense.
                          (TO ADAM)
           So then what's the big news that
           you made us rush all the way over
           here.
                         
          Not knowing how to tell his mother the upsetting news...
                         
                          ADAM
           Have you ever seen "Terms of
           Endearment"?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Oh jesus Adam, just tell her.
                         
                          EDITH
           Tell me what?
                         
                          ADAM
           Alright fine. But, before I tell
           you, you have to promise me you're
           going to stay calm.
           27.
                         
                         
                          EDITH
           Oh Adam, don't be so overdramatic.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom, just promise me. Okay?
                         
                          EDITH
           I promise...You make me out to be
           some kind of irrational loon.
                         
          Here goes nothing.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (MUMBLES)
           I have cancer.
                         
                          EDITH
           What?
                         
                          ADAM
                          (MUMBLES)
           I have cancer.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (TO RACHEL)
           What is he saying?
                         
                          ADAM
           (takes a deep breath)
           I have cancer.
                         
                          EDITH
           Cancer? What do you mean you have
           cancer?
                         
                          ADAM
           I - HAVE - CANCER.
                         
                          EDITH
           I don't understand.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom, I have a giant tumor in my
           spine.
                         
          Edith sits motionless for what seems an eternity. The only
          indication that she's not dead is the movement of her index
          finger, which twitches uncontrollably. Adam sits uneasy,
          tying to anticipate his mother's next move.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Mom?
           28.
                         
                         
          Edith calmly rises from of her seat and heads to the kitchen.
          Adam follows after her.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Mom, what are you doing?
                         
          Edith lights the stove, and puts up a kettle of Tea.
                         
                          EDITH
           I'm making you green tea.
                         
                          ADAM
           Please, will you come sit down.
                         
          Edith holds up the package of Green Tea.
                         
                          EDITH
           I saw on the Today Show that it
           reduces your risk of getting cancer
           by fifteen percent.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom, I already have cancer.
                         
          Refusing to look at her son, Edith frantically rifles through
          her fanny pack.
                         
                          EDITH
           Here take these.
                         
          Her hands now shaking uncontrollably, Edith hands Adam a
          large number of prescription pills.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           Aspirin, Zoloft, Lexapro, Lipitor,
           Flagel, Ditropan, Alka Seltzer.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom, please, stop. I don't need
           these.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (YELLS)
           Just take the god-damn pills.
                         
          Adam take Edith's hand.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom.
                         
          Edith's a nervous wreck, frantic and hysterical.
                         
                          EDITH
           How could this happen?
           29.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           It's genetic.
                         
                          EDITH
           Genetic? It must be from your
           father's side of the family,
           they're always getting sick. Your
           uncle Bobby just got Crohns.
                         
          Adam's father looks up from his plate of goulash...
                         
                          ART
           That's a disorder of the bowels,
           son. How are your bowels?
                         
                          ADAM
           The problem is not with my bowels.
                         
                          ART
           You're a lucky man.
                         
                          ADAM
           Thanks dad.
                         
                          EDITH
           I'm moving in.
                         
                          ADAM
           What? No. Absolutely not.
                         
                          EDITH
           Adam, I'm your mother, and I need
           to be close to you in your time of
           need.
                         
                          ADAM
           That's a terrible idea.
                         
                          EDITH
           Well who's going to take care of
           you?
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom, I'm fine.
                         
                          EDITH
           I think I have a right to take care
           of my son with cancer.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's nothing. Really.
           30.
                         
                         
                          EDITH
           Nothing! You tell me you have
           cancer of the spine and now you
           tell me it's nothing.
                         
          Adam looks to Rachel for support.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Edith, I can't even imagine how
           hard this must be for you. But I
           promise, there's nothing for you to
           worry about. I'm going to be here
           every step of the way, to help take
           good care of your son.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (TO ADAM)
           You're a very lucky boy to be with
           such a good girl. You know that?
           You don't deserve her.
                         
          Adam looks at Rachel and smiles.
                         
                          ADAM
           I know.
                         
                         
          INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
                         
          Adam and Seth stand on an endless line of BUSINESS MEN and
          WOMEN waiting for their morning coffee. Greg is at the front
          of that line - he's taking forever to decide what he wants.
          Adam impatiently looks at his watch.
                         
                          ADAM
           What's taking him so long? How hard
           is it to buy a cup of coffee?
                         
          Seth ignores Adam as he stares at the cleavage on the WOMAN
          behind him.
                         
                          SETH
           (quietly to Adam)
           Look at how tight that shirt is.
           She's totally aware of how large
           her breasts look too. This morning
           when she got dressed, she said to
           herself - "I have these things and
           I want the world to see them."
                         
          Greg looks up at the menu of endless options.
           31.
                         
                         
                          GREG
           What about that frozen drink,
           what's that like?
                         
                          BARISTA
                          (ENTHUSIASTIC)
           The Bavarian Blender. It's absolute
           heaven.
                         
                          GREG
           I don't know. Does it have a lot of
           sugar?
                         
                          ADAM
           We've been here 20 minutes. What's
           he shopping for a car?
                         
          Seth's eyes are still fixed on the woman's breasts.
                         
                          SETH
           Why are you in such a rush?
                         
          Adam looks around at all the stodgy business men all having
          menial conversations.
                         
                          ADAM
           Is this really how you want to
           spend the rest of your life?
           Wasting away in this place?
                         
          Greg still hasn't made up his mind. Adam snaps.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           I don't believe it. Why can't he
           just get a latte like he does every
           morning.
                         
                          SETH
           Relax. We have plenty of time.
                         
                          ADAM
           No we don't have plenty of time!
           Life is finite.
                         
                          SETH
           What the fuck is wrong with you?
                         
                          ADAM
                          (QUIETLY)
           I have cancer.
                         
                          SETH
                          (LAUGHS)
           Yeah right.
           32.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm serious.
                         
                          SETH
           Get the fuck out of here. You have
           cancer?
                         
          People in line look at Seth.

           Maybe a little louder, you can make
           a special announcement.

           When did this happen?
                         
                          ADAM
           Yesterday. They found a tumor in my
           spine.
                         
                          SETH
           Who?
                         
                          ADAM
           What do you mean who?
                         
                          SETH
           Who found the tumor?
                         
                          ADAM
           Lewis and Clark...The doctors found
           it.
                         
                          SETH
           When were you going to tell me?
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm telling you now.
                         
                          SETH
           If I had cancer I'd tell you right
           away.

           What do you want the Better Friend

           Holy shit!
                         
          Seth takes a deep breath. A look of panic sweeps across his
          face...he quickly shakes it off.

          EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Rachel pulls her car up to the front of the hospital. Adam
          kisses her goodbye and gets out of the car. He takes a few
          steps and then turns back. He gives her a nervous smile and
          then continues into the hospital.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Adam walks down the hospital corridor passing dozens of
          patients, none of whom are under the age of 40. In Adam's
          hand is the business card with "Mount Sinai Psychology Group"
          written on it. He finds the office and knocks on the half
          opened door.
                         
          The office is small, cold and emotionless - with stacks of
          psychology books and files strewn about.
                         
          An attractive young woman, KATIE (26), sits behind a desk
          reading a file while she eats a rather messy sandwich. Katie
          takes her job very seriously, but has not quite mastered the
          art of speaking without sounding like a rigid grad student.
                         
          Kate looks up as she takes a bite of her sandwich.
                         
                          KATIE
           (mouth full of food)
           Can I help you?
                         
                          ADAM
           I have an appointment with Dr.
           McRae.
           34.
                         
                         
          Katie puts down the sandwich, rises from her seat and puts
          her hand out to shake Adam's.
                         
                          KATIE
           Please call me Katie.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (CONFUSED)
           You're Dr. McRae?
                         
                          KATIE
           You were expecting someone else?
                         
          Katie wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away.
                         
                          ADAM
           Aren't you supposed to be like

           sweaters?

           Why? Did someone say that's what I
           look like?
                         
                          ADAM
           No, no, no. I was just expecting
           someone older.
                         
                          KATIE
           Sorry to disappoint you.
                         
                          ADAM
           No believe me, you're fine. Better
           than fine, you're Dr.
           McRae...you're a doctor? How old
           are you?

                          KATIE
           Does he work here?
                         
                          ADAM
           No. Nevermind...but aren't you
           young to be a doctor?
                         
                          KATIE
           I'm actually in my final semester
           of medical school.
           (off Adam's look)
           This is a training hospital.
                         
                          ADAM
           So have you had many patients?
                         
                          KATIE
           You're actually my first.
                         
          That did not help to ease Adam's anxiety.
                         
                          ADAM
           Oh.
                         
                          KATIE
           Please sit.
                         
          Adam notices a dark stain on the couch. He sits as far from
          it as possible.
                         
          Katie pulls out Adam's file and sits in a chair across from
          him. Adam looks anxious, this is his first time in therapy.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           Dr. Ross filled me in on your
           situation. Tell me, how have you
           been feeling?
                         
                          ADAM
           Honestly. I feel fine.
                         
                          KATIE
           I think that's great considering
           what you're going through.
                         
                          ADAM
           Yeah, but I tend to internalize
           everything so, who knows.
           36.
                         
                         
                          KATIE
          You mean you repress as a coping
          mechanism.
                         
                          ADAM
          Is that what I do?
                         
                          KATIE
          That's what you just said.
                         
                          ADAM
          The way I say it sounds cute in a
          neurotic way. When you say it, it's
          like an indictment. The word
          "repress" - sounds so harsh.
                         
                          KATIE
          It's actually quite common.
                         
                          ADAM
          Oh good, I'd hate to think I'm
          anything but an emotional sheep.
                         
                          KATIE
          Don't think of it in those terms.
          It's not like it's been a conscious
          decision on your part. What's
          important now is for you to be
          aware of the way you treat your
          emotions and for me to help you
          make adjustments.
                         
                          ADAM
          So how do we do that?
                         
                          KATIE
          The first thing I want you to do is
          to stop looking at cancer as a
          burden. Cancer has come into your
          life to show you that your
          emotional and physical bodies are
          out of balance. This is your chance
          to correct that.
                         
                          ADAM
          You're not in a cult are you?
                         
                          KATIE
          Now, why do you say that?
                         
                          ADAM
          I don't know, it was a bad joke.
           37.
                         
                         
                          KATIE
           But there's a reason. You chose to
           use humor rather than express how
           you really feel.
                         
          Katie is losing Adam.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           In order to heal the body, you must
           heal the mind. It's imperative that
           you free yourself from stress and
           anger. Get rid of all those
           negative emotions stored deep
           inside.
                         
          Adam's mind drifts away from Katie. He focuses on all the
          clutter. The slanted clock. The wilting plant. The crumbled
          paper on the floor. The mess is driving him crazy.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           So today what I want to do is start
           you on some very simple relaxation
           therapy.
                         
          Katie presses play on her iPod. We hear the soothing sounds
          of new agey flute music. Adam looks up in confusion.
                         
                          ADAM
           Huh?
                         
                          KATIE
           I want you to lay back and close
           your eyes.
                         
          Adam looks down at the coffee stained couch.
                         
                          ADAM
           Lay here?
                         
                          KATIE
           Yes, I want you to just lay back,
           and let go.
                         
                          ADAM
           Shouldn't we be analyzing my
           childhood? Or my days as a call
           girl?
                         
                          KATIE
           Another joke?
           38.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SHRUGS)
           Oh come on. Nothing? That was
           funny.
                         
                          KATIE
           Ssshhhhh...
                         
          Katie stands behind Adam and places her hands on his
          shoulders. Despite the fact that this is all too strange, he
          doesn't mind, in a weird way, Adam is enjoying the attention.
                         
          He finally lies down, contorting his body so as to avoid the
          stain.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           Close your eyes and relax. Find a
           place inside yourself where you can
           escape the cancer.
                         
          Adam closes his eyes.

           You know how I feel about
           surprises. Last surprise I got my
           parents told me I was adopted.

           Yeah, but sometimes I wish I was.
                         
          Rachel crosses into the room and stands over Adam.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Okay. Open your eyes.
                         
          Adam opens his eyes to see Rachel holding a tiny SHIH-TZU

           living, breathing, needy, thing in

                          RACHEL
           No, you're right, it's not a good
           idea. Tomorrow I'll take him back
           where he'll be kept in a tiny cage
           with 10 other dogs who will bully
           him, and rape him, and then he'll
           eventually be euthanized.
                         
          The dog looks at Adam. It's hopeless, there's no way Adam's
          going to win this one.
                         
                          ADAM
           Alright. Fine, we can keep the dog.

          It's Adam's going away party. Draped across the entrance is a
          "Bon Voyage" banner with an image of a Cruise Ship.

          Adam, Rachel and Seth enter to find a crowd of mostly
          unfamiliar faces. Phil, who has had one too many vodka
          tonics, approaches Adam - drink in hand.

           No thanks.
                         
          Phil puts his arm around Adam and gestures wildly - causing
          his drink to splash on Adam.

           Well I'm his best friend, so
           talking to me in a way is kind of
           like talking to him.
                         
                          JENNY
           Oh what does it matter? It's too
           late.
                         
          Jenny walks away crying. Seth follows after her.
                         
                          SETH
           Wait. It's not too late.

          Adam makes himself a drink at the bar. Greg approaches.
           45.
                         
                         
                          GREG
           Hey Adam.
                         
                          ADAM
           (less than excited)
           Hey Greg.
                         
                          GREG
           My uncle had what you have.
                         
                          ADAM
           Really?
                         
                          GREG
           Man that was the worst.
                         
                          ADAM
           Your uncle had Schwannoma
           Neurofibrosarcomas.
                         
                          GREG
           Yeah, I think so. It's the thing
           with the toe and the screaming, and
           everything tastes like olives?
           Right?
                         
          Adam looks perplexed.
                         
                         
          INT. RACHEL'S CAR - LATER THE SAME NIGHT
                         
          Rachel and Adam drive home from the party. They're in
          completely different moods.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well that was a nightmare.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Adam, those people just threw you a
           party...They love you.
                         
                          ADAM
           Half those people don't even know
           me.
                         
          The car stops at a red light. Rachel looks at Adam. She finds
          his pouting adorable. He sees her staring,
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           What?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Nothing.

           I love you.
                         
                          ADAM
           I love you.
                         
          Rachel takes Adam's hand.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Everything's going to be okay.
                         
          They look intensely into each others eyes and then kiss.

          They make their way into the bedroom and clumsily undress one
          another. Adam looks at Rachel's naked body.
                         
                          ADAM
           You are so unbelievably sexy.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I'm totally yours,
                         
          Suddenly there's a loud scratching at the bedroom door,
          followed by a loud whimpering. Rachel stops.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           Noodle.

          Adam continues to kiss Rachel.
                         
                          ADAM
           Ignore him.

           I think he needs to go out.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'll do it after.
                         
          The two continue making out. The dog starts to bark.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I can't do this with him barking.
                         
                         
          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Adam stands on the sidewalk impatiently waiting for the dog
          to do his business.
                         
                          ADAM
           (to the dog)
           Come on. Today...If I don't get
           laid tonight because of you, I'm
           going to take your little bow and
           make a noose...
                         
          The dog sniffs around, trying to find the perfect spot.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)

           Please! I need this.
                         
          ADAM'S NEIGHBOR walks by with A GIANT MASTIFF. He sees Adam
          yelling at the little Shi Tzu in ribbons. Adam looks up...
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (EMBARRASSED)

                          NEIGHBOR
           Nice dog.
                         
          Once the neighbor is out of sight-
                         
                          ADAM
           Will you please just finish.
                         
          The dog finally finishes. Adam runs back into the house.
          After a minute, he realizes he left the dog in the street. He
          runs back after the dog, scoops him up and then runs back
          inside.

          Adam fumbles around in the dark as he tears off his clothes.
          He then climbs back into bed, spoons Rachel, and begins
          seductively kissing her neck. He slowly moves his hand
          downwards. Rachel takes Adam's hand, pulls it up, and clasps
          it tight against her chest.
                         
                          RACHEL

          The two lay silently with Adam's arms wrapped around Rachel's
          body. A beat.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)

           Do you want me to?

           I was thinking it might be nice,
           now that I'm not going to work
           anymore. And with my chemo
           starting...
                         
          Rachel turns to Adam.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           You're here all the time anyway.

          Rachel kisses Adam and lays her head on his chest.

          Edith's car whizzes down the street and peels into the Beth
          Israel Synagogue parking lot. The car comes to an abrupt stop
          as it parks in the last empty space.
                         
          Edith and Adam step out of the car and walk 20 feet before
          they realize Art is still in the car.
                         
                          EDITH
           Art come on.
                         
                          ART
           I'm coming.
                         
          Art, still in the car, doesn't move. Edith looks at her watch
          and walks back to the car.
                         
                          EDITH
           We're late.
                         
          Edith grabs Art's hand. He slowly gets out of the car.
                         
                         
          INT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Edith, Art and Adam enter into the 600 seat synagogue. The
          service led by RABBI JACOBS (75) has already begun.
                         
          Edith spots three empty seats all the way in the left corner
          of the first row. Prime seats, but a bitch to get to since
          the service has begun - getting there would mean wading
          through a row of two dozen people. The USHER approaches.
                         
                          USHER
           Please take your seats.
                         
          The Usher motions for Edith and company to sit in the back.
                         
                          EDITH
           What about those seats up there in
           the front?
                         
                          USHER
           The service has begun.
                         
                          EDITH
           Please. My son has cancer.
                         
          Adam's jaw tightens, he can't believe his mother just did
          that. The Usher looks at Adam, sizing up the situation. Adam
          couldn't be more uncomfortable.
           50.

           Please, follow me.
                         
          The usher leads the group to the front and directs the people
          in the front row to let them pass through.
                         
          Edith apologizes as each person they pass has to stand to let
          them by.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (QUIETLY)
           Sorry, my son has cancer.
                         
          Adam smiles in embarrassment as he steps past.

          INT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE. ATRIUM - LATER
                         
          Edith and Art stand in a crowd of 600 congregants socializing
          and conversing after the service. ROSE (60) approaches.
                         
                          ROSE
                          (CONCERNED)
           Edith. How are you?
                         
                          EDITH
                          (OVERDRAMATIC)
           Oh Rose. Things are not well.
                         
                          ROSE
           I heard about the
                          (WHISPERS)
           cancer.
                         
                          EDITH
           I can't tell you how hard it's been
           on me. My only child. God only
           knows what terrible thing I did to
           deserve this. I've got a catatonic
           husband and a son with cancer. Not
           to mention my arthritis. I don't
           know how I'll ever get through it.
                         
          As Adam walks through the atrium, he notices everyone
          whispering and pointing at him.
                         
          Rabbi Jacobs (75) exits the bathroom, pulls up his fly and

                          RABBI
           How are you son?
                         
                          ADAM
           Oh you know, just trying to live by
           the Covenant.
                         
                          RABBI
           Don't bullshit me. You were the
           worst student I ever had. I bet
           you haven't even spoken a word of
           Hebrew since your Bar Mitzvah.
                         
                          ADAM
           I don't like to brag, but I
           couldn't speak it then.
                         
                          RABBI
           Your mother told me about your
           situation.
                         
          Adam looks over to see his mother surrounded by a dozen
          sympathetic listeners as she tells them her horror story of
          having a son with cancer.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm sure she did.
                         
                          RABBI
           It's not easy for a mother to see
           her son go through something like
           this,
                         
                          ADAM
           Nothing is easy for my mother.
                         
                          RABBI
           Have you thought about trying to
           reconnect with the Torah?
                         
                          ADAM
           Honestly, I'm just here to make my
           mother happy. It was either this or
           I had to go see my cousin perform
           in his high school theatre's

           So you've been told you have
           cancer. Well, you're not alone. 1
           in every 3 people living today will
           experience some form of the

           You may be wondering what is
           cancer? Well, cancer is a group of
           more than 100 different diseases
           characterized by the abnormal
           growth of cells. These cells form a
           lump or mass called a "tumor".

           Cancer is treated through the use
           of a revolutionizing medicine
           called Che-mo-therapy.

           It's important that you talk openly
           with your health care providers.

          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          A small group of patients, including Adam, have been watching
          the video. The people in the room applaud, Adam looks around
          baffled by both the video and the clapping.
                         
          GEORGE, a tall male nurse of Bahamian descent, enters the
          room.
                         
                          GEORGE
           Adam Schwartz.
                         
          Adam stands.
                         
                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           Come with me my baby.
                         
          Adam follows George into the elevator where they ride down
          into the bowel of the hospital: The Cancer Ward.
                         
          Walking through the long ominous halls of the hospital
          basement, Adam passes dozens of sick patients who are being
          shuttled into Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy and other
          various treatment rooms.
                         
          A sick, fat, BALD ELDERLY WOMAN coughs as she passes. Adam
          winces in disgust.
                         
                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           This way my baby.
                         
          George leads Adam into a Chemotherapy Treatment room.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - LATER
                         
          Adam is seated in a plush leather chair where he's hooked
          into a chemo drip. He's surrounded by a dozen gaunt, hairless
          patients. He is the youngest patient by at least 20 years.
          Completely overwhelmed, Adam spots A BALD WOMAN sitting
          quietly knitting. She's at peace with herself. Her Zen like
          state helps Adam relax.
                         
          Adam skims through a catalogue of clothing intended for
          cancer patients until he notices HENRY (50), a very small man
          sitting in a wheel chair which is attached to a respirator.
          Despite the fact that every breath Henry takes looks like it
          might kill him, he barks derogatory statements at the wall.
          Adam looks on in terror. The genial MITCH(85) notices.
                         
                          MITCH
           That's Henry.

                          ADAM
           Is he okay?
                         
                          MITCH
           He's always like that.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (TERRIFIED)
           Is that going to happen to me?
                         
                          MITCH
           Best not worry about these things.
                         
          ALAN (84), the contentious old man sitting next to Mitch
          chimes in.
                         
                          ALAN
                          (TO ADAM)
           Want a hit?
                         
          Adam looks down to see that Alan is holding a ONE HITTER full
          of weed.
                         
                          MITCH
           It makes it all a little easier to
           handle.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (PARANOID)
           What if someone sees us?
                         
                          ALAN
           Don't be such an old man. Look at
           this place, it's like Death Row in
           here, they don't give a shit what
           we do.
                         
          Adam reluctantly takes a hit.
                         
                          MITCH

           Then, to top it all off, your kids
           will one day stop talking to you
           because their therapist, who you
           pay for, tells them you're the
           reason they're so fucked up.

          Adam is standing on line for a Roller Coaster. He gets to the
          front of the line when the CARNIE stops him.
                         
                          CARNIE
           Hey you! What do you think you're
           doing?
                         
          Everything Adam says is in German and subtitled in English.
                         
                          ADAM
           I want to ride.
                         
                          CARNIE
           Read the sign.
                         
          The Carnies points to a sign that reads "No Cancer."
                         
                          ADAM
           I don't have cancer.
                         
                          CARNIE
           Then what's that?
                         
          The Carnie points out Adam's T-shirt, it reads "I'M WITH
          CANCER."
           58.
                         
                         
          Adam turns around to see a GIANT BALD FAT MAN eating cotton
          candy, his shirt reads "CANCER".
                         
          Adam tries to run away, but he's attached to the Giant Fat
          Bald Guy via an umbilical cord. The Giant Fat Bald Guy
          reaches out, picks Adam up, and swallows him.

          INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Adam jolts out of bed. His clothes are drenched in sweat. He
          looks down to see Rachel sleeping peacefully next to him. He
          quickly gets out of bed and runs into the bathroom. And by
          the sound of it, throws up. A lot. Rachel mutters something
          incoherent and then sprawls out, consuming the entire bed.

          Adam looks worn and exhausted from the chemo. He's never felt
          worse.
                         
                          KATIE
           So how do you feel after your first
           treatment?
                         
                          ADAM
           I feel like I was just gang raped
           by the Buena Vista Social Club.
                         
                          KATIE
           Is everything with you going to be
           a joke?
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm serious. Have you heard their
           horn section?
                         
                          KATIE
           Adam, you have a responsibility to
           your mind and body.
                         
                          ADAM
           I was just injected with three
           pints of kryptonite. Can we please
           hold off on the new agey stuff.
                         
                          KATIE
           You can't just sit there and ignore
           what's happening to you...You need
           to stop bottling everything up.
           59.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           What I need is for people to stop
           telling me what I need.
                         
                          KATIE
           Have you considered that this
           cancer is nature's way of telling
           you to change the way you live your
           life?
           (off Adam's look)
           ...There's an old saying - you
           can't change the wind, but you can
           adjust the sails.
                         
                          ADAM
           They teach you that in medical
           school?
                         
          Katie's patience is waning.
                         
                          KATIE
           I know you don't like to talk about
           your feelings, but you have to
           learn to find an outlet.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (FRUSTRATED)
           An outlet for what? I have cancer.
                         
                          KATIE
           And how is your body ever going to
           fight the stress of that cancer if
           you can't even handle your own
           emotions?
                         
          Adam snaps, rasing his voice.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well excuse me. You'll have to
           forgive me for not having a firm
           handle on my emotions at this
           particular juncture of my life.
                         
          Katie's a little shaken by Adam's outburst. She stays firm.
                         
                          KATIE
           You don't have to be here.
                         
          Adam knows he went too far. Plus, that little outburst lifted
          a little wight off his shoulders, and he knows it.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm sorry, I know you're only
           trying to help.

                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           This is all too much for me. I
           don't know what to do. Just tell me
           what to do and I'll do it.
                         
          Katie looks at Adam, is he being for real? She's skeptical.
                         
                          KATIE
           I want you to do some homework.
           Here's a list of books on mind-body
           therapy. They should help you get
           started.
                         
          Katie hands Adam a sheet of paper with a list of books
          scribbled on it.

          Adam and Seth browse through shelves of books. Seth is
          reading the author's bio from one of the books on Katie's
          list.

           I'm not going anywhere.
                         
          From across the store, Seth notices, CLAIRE (30), an
          attractive employee stacking books.

                          ADAM
           It's medicinal.
                         
          Rachel's shocked, this is way out of character for Adam.
                         
                          RACHEL
           You got a prescription for
           medicinal marijuana?
                         
                          SETH
           No, I did.
                         
                          RACHEL
           What's wrong with you?
                         
                          SETH
           Night blindness. Rods and cones are
           off.
                         
          Rachel rolls her eyes. Seth is ridiculous. Then she notices
          the new flat screen TV on the wall and just like that, her
          demeanor switches. She looks pissed.

                          ADAM
           The store.
           (off Rachel's furious
                          LOOK)
           It's medicinal?
                         
                          RACHEL
           I thought we already agreed that my
           painting was going there.
                         
                          ADAM
           (trying to reason)
           Why can't we put up both?
                         
                          RACHEL
           You want me to put my painting next
           to a television?
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SHRUGS)
           Yes?

           Art needs to breathe Adam!...Do
           whatever you want. I'm taking your
           dog to the park!...And open a
           window. This isn't a dorm room.
                         
          Rachel walks to the door, scoops the dog up in one arm and a
          bag of garbage in the other.
                         
                          ADAM
           (calls out to Rachel)
           Love you.
                         
          The door slams.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           I don't get it, they spend all day
           at the dog park.
                         
                          SETH
           Great. Maybe she'll move there.
                         
                          ADAM
           Can you not talk about her like
           that?
                         
          Seth nearly chokes as he inhales.

                          SETH
           Are you joking? Do you see the way
           she treats you?
                         
                          ADAM
           She's got some kind of creative
           block...It's her process.
                         
                          SETH
           You have cancer for fuck's sake! If
           I was your girlfriend, I'd be
           baking you cookies and blowing you
           every thirty minutes. Instead,
           she's yelling at you over some
           fucking painting. Her art sucks.
           You don't want to put that on your
           wall. It looks like someone threw
           up a shrimp cocktail and then used
           it to spackle the Berlin Wall.
                         
                          ADAM
           We're going through a rough patch.
           That's what happens in
           relationships.
                         
                          SETH
                          (SERIOUS)
           Bullshit. She's fucking you in the
           ass Adam. This is the one time in
           your life you can do whatever you
           want. If you want to smoke weed,
           then smoke. You want a 50 inch flat
           screen TV, then get the fucking TV!
           And if you want to go to Mardi
           Gras, then LET'S GO TO MARDI GRAS!
                         
                          ADAM
           We're not going to Mardi Gras.
                         
          Seth takes a hit from the joint and hands it back to Adam.
                         
                          SETH
           (as he exhales)
           You're totally missing my point.

           I'm not gonna lie, I don't really
           get the "Dark Night of the Soul"
           stuff. But I get it, years of

           I'm blocked...emotionally.

           Adam! This is fantastic.
                         
          Adam is slightly taken aback by Katie's response.

           there are some more advanced forms

           Sure, if you think it'll help.
                         
                         
          INT. LAUGHTER THERAPY - DAY
                         
          Adam and Seth are seated in a semi-circle with a half dozen
          middle aged men and women. At the front of the group is the
          LAUGHTER THERAPIST (50) - a short man with a long greying
          pony tail and a thick beard. All eyes are closed except for
          Seth and Adam's. Adam's hair is noticeably thin.
                         
                          LAUGHTER THERAPIST
           Good morning class. Before we begin
           I'd like to introduce Adam and
           Seth, our two newest giggle gurus.
                         
          The class laughs. Adam and Seth look around paranoid.
                         
                          SETH
           (quietly to Adam)
           What are they laughing at?
                         
                          ADAM
           (quietly to Seth)
           Just go with it.
                         
          Seth and Adam laugh along with the others.
                         
                          LAUGHTER THERAPIST
           (to Adam and Seth)
           Now what you'll soon discover is
           the true miracle and gift of
           laughter.

           LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D)
           Learning to laugh at ourselves and
           others through non- judgemental
           means is far more effective than
           any prescription drug, or,
           rehabilitation center.
           You see, when we laugh, our bodies
           release endorphins that not only
           support the immune system, but also
           release deeply stored emotional
           pain, and give us a fresh new
           outlook on life.
                         
          The Laugh Therapist opens his eyes and stares intensely at
          Adam and then Seth.
                         
           LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D)
           We don't tell jokes here, we tell
           the truth - and we laugh at that
           truth.
                         
          The Laughter Therapist closes his eyes.
                         
           LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D)
           So let us share. Adam, why don't
           you tell us what brings you here?
                         
          Adam looks around in fear of saying the wrong thing.
                         
           LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D)
           We're all friends here in the
           Laughter Pagoda.

           I, ah, have cancer.
                         
          The entire class laughs hysterically.
                         
                          LAUGHTER THERAPIST
           Ah cancer yes. Yes. Laugh.

           used it to masturbate 6 times.
                         
          The class laughs.

           Listen to me Adam, I've been
           married 40 years and it's my
           Margaret who keeps me going.
                         
          Mitch pulls out his wallet. He holds out a picture of his

           going to spend my last days on this
           miserable planet pining over a

           the best day of my life.
                         
          Adam let's this soak in.

          As Katie walks to her car, she sees Adam pacing and mumbling
          to himself.

                          ADAM

          Adam is seated in the front seat as Katie drives. The car is
          filthy - it's littered with papers, magazines, food wrappers,
          etc. Katie's body is pressed all the way up against the
          steering wheel with her eyes fixed on the road.
           72.

          Adam picks up a copy of "Organizing Your Way to Success,"
          which is lying on the floor.
                         
                          ADAM
           I think you should ask for a
           refund.
                         
                          KATIE
           I know, I know. What can I say? I'm
           not good at getting rid of things.
           I get easily attached.
                         
                          ADAM
           Yeah, I can see.
                         
          Changing the subject.

                          ADAM
           Nope.

           I actually failed my test.

                          ADAM
           Eh. Let's just say, that the state
           of California felt it was best I
           didn't.
                         
          Katie stares at Adam in shock.
                         
                          KATIE
           What did you do?

                          ADAM
           I kind of backed my mom's car down
           an embankment...Into the Balboa
           cactus garden.
                         
                          KATIE
           The garden with all the endangered

                          ADAM
           They didn't want to tow it out in
           fear of destroying more of the
           vegetation, so they had to use a
           giant crane.
                         
          Katie lets out a tiny chuckle, but quickly contains herself.
                         
                          KATIE
           I'm sorry. That's terrible.
                         
          Unable to hold back, Katie continues laughing. This is the
          first time we've seen Katie let go of her rigid nature.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (ABRUPT)
           Stop the car.
                         
          Katie looks at Adam nervously.
                         
                          KATIE
           Why what's wrong?
                         
                          ADAM
           Just stop the car.
                         
          Katie stops the car. Adam grabs a handful of Katie's garbage
          and gets out.
                         
                          KATIE
           What are you doing?
                         
                          ADAM
           I can't handle all this mess.
                         
          Adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the
          car for more. Katie starts laughing, she can't believe Adam
          is cleaning her car.
                         
                          KATIE
           Wait, no, not that, that's my
           dinner.
                         
          Adam leaves Katie's dinner and throws out the rest of the
          garbage. He gets back in the car and takes a deep breath.

                          ADAM
           Thanks for the ride...
                         
          Adam looks at his house. The lights are out. He's really not
          in the mood to be alone. He looks back at Katie.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)

                          KATIE
           It probably wouldn't be very
           professional of me.

          Katie is hesitant, but she also feels in a strange way that
          Adam is more than a patient.
                         
                          KATIE
           Uh, okay. But I can't stay long.

          Adam and Katie sit on the couch playing an ultra-violent
          video game. Katie is destroying Adam.
                         
                          KATIE
           You know you are terrible at this?
                         
          Adam is totally lost. He has zero sense of how to play.
                         
                          ADAM
           I've never played before.

                          ADAM
           Doesn't mean I play it. Games these

                          (LAUGHS)
           Perhaps you'd prefer something a
           little more simple. Maybe a nice
           game of Connect Four or Bingo.
                         
                          ADAM
           She has a sense of humor.
                         
          Katie's face lights up. She's proud of herself for that one.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Duck Hunt, now that was a game.
           You know why? One button.
                         
          Katie laughs.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           You think I'm kidding. My dad and I
           used to have Duck Hunt tournaments.
           He was actually really good.
                          (BEAT)
           Until he had his stroke.
                         
                          KATIE
           That must have been hard, seeing
           him lose his cognitive skills like
           that.
                         
          This is the most emotionally honest we've ever seen Adam.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well the funny thing is that the
           stroke actually made him a better
           player, he just lost interest.
                         
          Katie feels for Adam.
                         
                          KATIE
           You've never talked about your dad.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well whose fault is that? Doctor?
                         
                          KATIE
           Hey!
                         
          The two continue to play. Adam wildly pushes every button as
          Katie's character pins Adam's character and repeatedly slams
          his head into the ground.
           76.
                         
                         
          Game over.
                         
          Katie pats Adam on the shoulder.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           Rematch?
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
                         
          Adam holds out a tray of wheat grass as he prepares to blend
          wheat grass shots.
                         
                          ADAM
           You ever had this stuff.
                         
                          KATIE
           No, but it's supposed to be really
           good for you.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well it smells like my grandmother.
                         
                          KATIE
           You complain a lot.
                         
                          ADAM
           You haven't met my mother.
           It's a miracle I do anything but
           complain.
                         
                          KATIE
           I try not to look at the world like
           that.
                         
                          ADAM
           The world would be a boring place
           if we didn't complain. Come on.
           There's got to be something. One
           thing, just one thing, that drives
           you nuts.
                         
                          KATIE
           Hmmm.
                          (FISHING)
           I really don't like it when people
           at work finish all the coffee and
           don't refill the pot.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's infuriating right?
           77.
                         
                         
                          KATIE
           I wouldn't say infuriating. It's
           just not good work place etiquette.
                         
          Adam is far more excited by this revelation. He hands Katie a
          shot of wheat grass and takes one last sniff of the awful
          smelling drink. He raises his glass to make a toast.
                         
                          ADAM
           To complaining.
                         
          Adam downs the drink and cringes at the taste. Katie follows,
          and in total disgust, she spits her wheat grass all over
          Adam's face.
                         
                          KATIE
           Oh god, that's disgusting. I'm so
           sorry.
                         
          Katie grabs a towel as Adam stands speechless.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           Hold on. I'm so sorry.
                         
          Adam keeps his eyes closed as Katie wipes his face.
                         
                          ADAM
           Is it all gone?
                         
          For the first time, Katie notices how cute Adam is. Adam
          opens his eyes to catch Katie staring at him. They lock eyes
          for a moment. Uncomfortable, Adam averts his look.
                         
          Suddenly, Rachel walks through the front door.
                         
           RACHEL (O.C.)
           Adam?
                         
          Feeling a little foolish, Katie motions to leave.
                         
                          KATIE
           I should probably be going.
                         
          Rachel enters the kitchen.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Adam?
                         
                          ADAM
           Finally. Where have you been?
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (MAD)
           I hope I'm not interrupting.
           78.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           Oh, this is Dr. McRae, my
           therapist.
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (SUSPICIOUS)
           This is your therapist?
                         
                          KATIE
           Please, call me Katie.
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (SUSPICIOUS)
           OK. Katie. What are you doing here?
                         
                          ADAM
           She drove me home. Ring a bell?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Ugh. Shit.
                          (SWEET/NERVOUS)
           Thank you so much for doing that.
           Life's been a little crazy lately,
           which I'm sure Adam has told you
           all about. I love those shoes.
                         
                          KATIE
           Thanks...
                         
          Awkward silence. The tension is thick.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           I'm going to go. I'll see you at
           our next session Adam.
                         
          Katie leaves.
                         
                          ADAM
           Where have you been?
                         
                          RACHEL
           I was at the gallery.

           You were supposed to pick me up. 8
           hours ago.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I know. I'm sorry. I totally
           spaced. With the opening only three
           months away my head's just all over
           the place.

                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           Don't look at me like that. You
           know this is a hard time for me.
                         
                          ADAM
           You're right. Let me go back and
           talk to the doctor - see if maybe
           they can diagnose me with something
           that better suits your needs.

           I'm not just some car service here
           to shuttle you around!
                         
                          ADAM
           And my house isn't a summer camp.
           You can't just come and go as you
           please and not take some
           responsibility.
                         
                          RACHEL
           And what is it that I'm not taking
           responsibility for?
                         
                          ADAM
           This. Us.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I can't handle this! You make it
           sound like I'm your wife.
                         
                          ADAM
           You know what I thought the other
           day? That I might actually die
           without ever having sex again.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I'm sorry if your cancer isn't
           turning me on.
                         
          Rachel begins to cry.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           You think this is easy for me
           seeing you sick like this? The past
           few months have been hard on me
           too. It's not always about you.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (RELENTS)
           I know.
                         
          Adam tenderly wraps his arms around Rachel.

           Why are you so good?

           You're my Yam.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME NIGHT
                         
          Rachel stares at Adam as he sleeps next to her in bed. She
          slowly moves her index finger along Adam's arm and then
          seductively kisses his neck. Adam firmly grabs hold of Rachel
          and the two begin to go through the motions. Clothes come
          off. Adam gets on top of Rachel...And then stops.
                         
                          RACHEL
           What's wrong?
                         
                          ADAM
           I can't.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Why?
                         
          Adam looks down.
                         
                          ADAM
           I don't know what's wrong.
                          (DEFEATED)
           It won't work.
                         
          Adam rolls over onto his back. He and Rachel lay silent -
          neither making contact with the other.

           Where's Alan?
                         
          Speechless, Mitch looks up at Adam and slowly shakes his
          head. Tears roll down Mitch's cheek. Adam's face goes white.

          A healthy Adam is surrounded by dozens of energetic elderly
          people who are swimming, playing bocci ball, shuffle board,
          bridge, etc. Adam looks on in confusion as an OLD MAN wearing
          an official looking badge drives by on a golf cart.
                         
                          ADAM
           Excuse me.
                         
          The old man stops his cart.

           a frozen yogurt machine.
                         
          The old man points to a long line of excited seniors awaiting
          their turn at a massive Frozen Yogurt Sundae Bar. A sign in
          front reads "WAIT: 45 MINUTES".

          INT. SYNAGOGUE. RABBI JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Adam is seated in the Rabbi's office, he looks despondent.
                         
                          RABBI
           So you want to know what's going to
           happen when you die?
                         
                          ADAM
           I think it's a fair question.
                         
                          RABBI
           Fair yes, but impossible for me to
           answer. Our deaths, like our lives,
           have meaning and are all part of
           God's plan. How should I know what
           God has planned for you. Maybe if
           you came to service once in a
           while...
                         
                          ADAM
           Well am I going to go to Heaven?
                         
                          RABBI
           Probably.
                         
                          ADAM
           What if I want to just die? That's
           it. No Heaven.
                         
                          RABBI
           That's like buying a ticket for a
           cruise and then not going. The
           Afterlife is where the fun begins.
                         
                          ADAM
           How can being stuck in some
           nonexistent void with my
           grandparents be fun. I spent my
           entire life trying to get away from
           my family, now I'm going to have to
           spend an eternity with them.
                         
                          RABBI
           Adam, you can not look at death as
           a curse. Even in death we are all
           still part of God. Life on Earth is
           just the beginning.
           83.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           But that's not what I want.
                         
                          RABBI
                          (FRUSTRATED)
           Oy. Then find another religion. I
           don't make the rules.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. KATIE'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Adam is lying on the couch staring at the ceiling. There is
          total silence.
                         
                          KATIE
           You're being awfully quiet today.
           Is everything okay?
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm going to die aren't I?
                         
                          KATIE
           What are you talking about?
                         
                          ADAM
           It's true.
                         
                          KATIE
           We don't know that.
                         
          Adam sits up and looks at Katie.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm not getting any better.
                         
                          KATIE
           Don't say that, you're doing so
           well.
                         
                          ADAM
           Did you know that they found a
           Quasar 7 billion light years away?
           7 billion light years! It's more
           than 3 billion years older than our
           planet, and we're just seeing it
           now; and you think I'm going to
           live?
                         
                          KATIE
                          (TOTALLY BAFFLED)
           What are you talking about?
           84.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           Cancer is an epidemic! It killed
           Alan, it's going to kill me, and
           it's going to kill millions more
           after me. There's nothing anybody
           can do.
                         
                          KATIE
           This is really good Adam. Let it
           out.
                         
                          ADAM
           Will you stop!
                          (BEAT)
           I can't do this anymore. It doesn't
           matter. None of it. I'm going to
           die and with nothing to show for my
           life. 100 years from now my legacy
           be will be that of just another
           person dead of cancer. That's it.
                         
                          KATIE
           This helplessness you're feeling is
           normal. These emotions you're
           holding onto are what make you
           human. But it doesn't mean you can
           just stop living your life.
                          (BEAT)
           Look at how you've grown over the
           past few months, you can't just
           throw it all away...Talk to me.
                         
                          ADAM
           I know you're only trying to help,
           but this isn't working for me
           anymore.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Adam leaves. Katie is left feeling as though she failed.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Adam lies on the bed of an MRI machine. His body is slowly
          drawn into the enclosed body scanner.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - MORNING
                         
          TIME LAPSE: Adam's stares at himself in the mirror. His
          health deteriorates even more.
                         
                         SUPER: NOVEMBER
           85.
                         
                         
          Looking at himself in the mirror, Adam takes note of his
          hollow cheeks and worn eyes. He looks awful, like an old man.
          There isn't any youth left. He's not getting any better, and
          he knows it.
                         
          Noticing a few renegade hairs sticking up, Adam pulls out a
          lint brush and combs his head.
                         
          Rachel enters and steps up on the scale. She examines herself
          in the mirror.
                         
                          ADAM
           I need a new lint brush.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Okay, I'll pick one up.
                         
                          ADAM
           And I have a doctor's appointment
           next Thursday...The big one.
                         
          Rachel continues to examines her waist.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Am I getting fat?
                         
          Adam stares at Rachel.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           What?
                         
                          ADAM
           Are you listening to me?
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (ANNOYED)
           Yes.
                         
                          ADAM
           So you'll take me?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Of course.
                         
          Rachel leaves. In frustration Adam weakly picks up the scale
          and throws it against the wall, smashing it.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Adam sits alone in his empty house. It's a mess. He looks
          unhinged.
           86.
                         
                         
          He slowly pulls a hit from a joint as he watches Matlock on
          his flat screen TV, which has been moved to the floor to make
          room for Rachel's painting.
                         
          Adam flips the channel to Martha Stewart, then to I Love
          Lucy, then to General Hospital, then to Body Building on
          ESPN. He turns the TV off. He's bored.
                         
          Adam crosses to the answering machine. It reads "10
          Messages." He presses play. All the messages are from his
          mother. He hits delete.
                         
                         
          Adam reads through a stack of unopened letters. He comes
          across a postcard from the Museum advertising "Mountain Dew
          Presents: The Origins of Man".

          CLOSE ON: the "Mountain Dew Presents: The Origins of Man"
          poster in the Museum's main entrance.
                         
          Adam enters the museum and walks up to the sign. People stop
          and stare, stunned by Adam's gaunt appearance - like a ghost
          haunting the grounds. Adam carries a wide smile, he's
          overcome with a sense of nostalgia for his old job.

           Are you sure that's a good idea?
                         
          Phil is treading a fine line...
                         
                          PHIL (CONT'D)

                          PHIL
           Yeah for a guy with cancer.
                         
          Adam looks dejected. Phil feels bad, he went too far.
                         
                          PHIL (CONT'D)
           Alright, what the hell? I'd love to
           have you back. Let's be honest this
           place is falling apart without you.

           Oh it's really good. We've come to
           an understanding. It takes whatever
           it wants and depletes me of my

           And if you look over on your left
           you'll see our newest exhibit "The
           Last Days Pompeii." Buried in 79 AD
           by the catastrophic eruption of Mt.
           Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden
           and forgotten until 1748 when
           archeologists began to excavate the
           site. Here we see exquisitely
           preserved objects that offer a
           glimpse into the day-to-day life of
           this ancient city.
                         
          Seth comes upon Adam who is working closely on a diorama.
                         
                          SETH (CONT'D)
           This here is Adam, one of our
           curators. Adam do you want to tell
           us what you're working on?
                         
                          ADAM
                          (UPBEAT)
           Gladly. This here is a depiction of
           what Pompeii's final 19 hours
           probably looked like.
                         
          Adam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of Pompeii's
          final hours. The scene is total chaos. Ash flies through the
          air. Hot molten lava engulfs the town. Miniature men, women,
          and children run through the streets in horror. People are
          sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods. There's a wild
          orgy in the streets. And a giant TYRANNOSAURS REX model
          devours a villager.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           According to Pliny the Younger -
           "You could hear women lamenting,
           children crying, men shouting.
           There were some so afraid of death
           that they prayed for death. Many
           raised their hands to the gods, and
           even more believed that there were
           no gods any longer, and that this
           was one unending night for the
           world."
                         
          The tourists take pictures. In shock, Seth quickly shuttles
          the group away.
                         
                          SETH
           Ok. Moving along we see the
           beautiful watercolor paintings of
           John James Audobon.
           89.
                         
                         
          Seth looks back at Adam like he's lost his mind.
                         
                         
          INT. MUSEUM. HALL - LATER
                         
          The sound of someone vomiting can be heard booming from the
          men's bathroom. A crowd of Museum guests walk past in horror.
          They look at each other in fear. The toilet flushes. Adam
          walks out. Everyone stares. Adam smiles in embarrassment.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (AWKWARD)
           I'll be in Pompeii if anyone needs
           me.
                         
          Adam walks back to the Pompeii exhibit. Phil approaches.
                         
                          PHIL
           You feeling okay? You don't look so
           good.
                         
                          ADAM
           Could be worse. Right?
                         
          Phil notices the Pompeii exhibit.
                         
                          PHIL
                          (STARTLED)
           Jesus!
                         
          Phil feels terrible about what he's going to say next.
                         
                          PHIL (CONT'D)
           Listen Adam...I don't know how to
           say this...
                         
          Phil places a comforting hand on Adam's shoulder.
                         
                          ADAM
           Don't worry...I get it. You're a
           good guy.
                         
                          PHIL
           Come back when you're better. You
           know you'll always have a home
           here.
                         
                         
          INT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Distraught, Adam walks down the Hall of Evolution. Slouched
          in defeat, he passes the various dioramas depicting human
          evolution. He begins at MODERN HUMANS and walks backwards in
          time.
           90.
                         
                         
          He comes to the family of Cro Magnons, then Neanderthal man.
          He stops and looks at Neanderthal - their slumped profiles
          match. He continues down the hall towards the exit.
                         
                         
          EXT. SAN DIEGO BOARDWALK - AFTERNOON
                         
          Adam walks along the boardwalk. He's surrounded by
          perfection. The beach. The water. The blue sky. Hundreds of
          beautiful men and women in their 20's and 30's: jogging,
          biking, surfing, skate boarding, playing volleyball, etc. He
          looks like a raisin among grapes.
                         
                         
          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Adam stands impatiently on his porch. He looks at his watch
          and then dials his phone.
                         
           RACHEL (V.O.)
           Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing
           something really important. I'll
           give you a call when I'm
           done...yay!
                         
          Adam's face is red with fury. He does his best to hold back.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SWEET)
           Hey, it's Adam. Where are you?
           Maybe you forgot, but my
           appointment is today. So call me
           back.
                         
          Enraged, Adam hangs up.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Fuck!
                         
          Adam picks up his phone and dials again.
                         
           SETH (V.O.)
           Yoooooo.
                         
                          ADAM
           Hey man, I need you to do me -
                         
           SETH (V.O.)
           Not around. Leave a message.
                         
          Adam hangs up and dials again.
           91.
                         
                         
           EDITH (O.S.)
                          (YELLING)
           Hello,
                         
          Adam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes. A pang of
          regret runs through his body.
                         
                          ADAM
           Hi mom.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER
                         
          Edith, Art and Adam sit in the exam room, each reading their
          respective magazines - minus Art who is lost somewhere in his
          own world. The tension is thick. Edith looks at her watch and
          shivers. There's a knock at the door. A CUTE NURSE enters.
                         
                          CUTE NURSE
           The Doctor wanted me to apologize
           for running late, he's just in with
           another patient, but should be out
           in a few minutes. You guys holding
           up alright?
                         
                          EDITH
           It's very cold in here. Is there
           anyway you can turn down the Air
           Conditioning?
                         
                          CUTE NURSE
           Unfortunately the temperature is
           controlled by a central thermostat.
                         
                          EDITH
           My son has cancer.
                         
                          CUTE NURSE
                          (FEELS BAD)
           I'm sorry, really, if I could I
           would, but there's nothing I can
           do.
                         
          Adam's pissed that his mother has just involved him.
                         
                          ADAM
           (smiles to the Nurse)
           Don't worry about it.
           (Scowls at Edith)
           I'm fine.
                         
                          CUTE NURSE
           Are you sure? I could get you a
           blanket.
           92.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           No, really, I'm okay. But thank
           you.
                         
                          EDITH
           I'd love a blanket.
                         
                          ADAM
           (to the Cute Nurse)
           We're fine.
                         
                          CUTE NURSE
           Okay, but you let me know if you
           need anything.
                         
          The Nurse smiles at Adam in sympathy, he smiles back. The
          Cute Nurse exits.
                         
                          EDITH
           (Re: the cute nurse)
           I don't like her.
                         
          Edith puts her hand on Adam's forehead. He looks at her hand
          and then picks up a magazine in an attempt to ignore her.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           You feel warm.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm fine.
                         
          Edith pulls some pills out her fanny pack.
                         
                          EDITH
           Take these.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (ANNOYED)
           You're like some kind of deranged
           pusher.
                         
                          EDITH
           Do you know what it's like to fear
           losing your son? No. You don't.
           When you have children of your own
           we can discuss it. Now take the
           pills.
                         
          Adam puts the pills in his mouth and pretends to swallow.
          Edith gets up from her chair. As soon as his mother turns
          away, Adam spits the pills into his hand.
                         
          Edith paces around the room looking at the Doctor's various
          degrees on the wall.
           93.
                         
                         
          Adam looks on, annoyed at every step his mother takes. Edith
          closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading
          glasses for further examination.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
                          (DISAPPROVING)
           Huh.
                         
                          ADAM
           What?
                         
                          EDITH
           Oh nothing.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (ANNOYED)
           What?
                         
                          EDITH
           It's nothing, he went to a state
           college.
                         
                          ADAM
           You're unbelievable.
                         
                          EDITH
           I just worry that you're not
           getting the best care possible.
                         
          Adam can't take it anymore.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well who needs a doctor when
           they've got you and your fanny
           pack?
                         
                          EDITH
           You can be a little shit sometimes,
           you know that? You think I don't
           know what's best for you? I birthed
           you. You came out of me. I am your
           mother, for better or for worse, so
           accept it.
           (Re: fanny pack)
           You don't like this, well I'm
           sorry. It's my own way of caring.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SNAPS)
           Well stop! You're driving me crazy.
           With the comments and the pills
           every five minutes. Just stop. I'm
           not dad. I can take care of myself.
           94.
                         
                         
          Edith turns away, Adam's words hurt.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
                         
          Edith blows her nose as tears rolls down her cheek.
                         
                          EDITH
           Yes you did. I drive you crazy.
                         
          Adam gently puts his hand on Edith's shoulder.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom.
                         
          Edith turns to Adam helpless and scared.
                         
                          EDITH
           You're all I've got. Look at your
           father.
                         
          We see Art sitting in the chair picking his nose.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           I've lost him. My true love, gone.
           I'm never going see him again, at
           least not in this life.
                          (BEAT)
           He spent his whole life priding
           himself on his independence, always
           too stubborn to ask for help and
           now look at the son of a bitch.
                          (TO ART)
           You happy? You like shitting
           yourself?
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom!
                         
                          EDITH
           He was the greatest thing to ever
           happen to me. And then I had you,
           and that was even greater. So if I
           hover and threaten your
           independence, so what? You have a
           mother who loves you more than
           anything. Is that so awful?
                         
                          ADAM
           No. It's not.
                         
          Adam and Edith share a moment...Dr. Ross storms in the room
          carrying a stack of MRI films. He seems rushed.
           95.
                         
                         
           DR. ROSS
           Sorry to keep you folks waiting.
           It's been one of those days...car
           got towed. Wife double parked it.
                         
          Adam and Edith look at Dr Ross with blank stares.
                         
           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
           Anyway I'll cut to the chase. The
           cancer's not responding to the
           chemo.
                         
          Dr. Ross places the MRI into the light box.
                         
           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
           As you can see...The tumor is
           continuing to grow here, along the
           nerve.
                         
          Adam and Edith squint to see what Ross is talking about, but
          see nothing.
                         
                          ADAM
           So what do we do?
                         
           DR. ROSS
           We need to operate. If we don't
           remove it soon we risk metastasis.
                         
                          ADAM
           But you said surgery was too risky.
                         
           DR. ROSS
           We're out of options.
                         
          Tears roll down Edith's cheek. Adam grabs hold of her hand.
                         
                          EDITH
           But he's going to be okay, right?
           You're going to fix it.
                         
          Dr. Ross sits, he knows this can't be easy for a mother.
                         
           DR. ROSS
           This surgery is no guarantee. The
           risks are tremendous. And, even if
           we're able to remove the tumor
           there's still the chance that Adam,
           you'll never be able to walk again.
                         
          Adam looks at his mother. He firmly grabs hold of her hand.
           96.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           Does that mean...I can get handicap
           parking?
                         
          Adam's line breaks the tension forcing a slight smile across
          Edith's face.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
                         
          Distraught and emotionally worn, Adam enters to discover the
          smell of a home cooked meal. He walks through the house.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          He stands in the doorway of the kitchen staring at Rachel
          cooking. Rachel turns around. She's in high spirits.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Hey you.
                         
          Rachel gleefully skips over and gives Adam a sweet kiss on
          the cheek.
                         
                          ADAM
           Smells good.
                         
                          RACHEL
           The girls and I are having a movie
           night. I somehow got suckered into
           cooking.
           (off Adam's look)
           Don't worry I left you some.
                         
          Adam feigns a smile, hiding the pain of his heart breaking in
          a thousand pieces.
                         
          Suddenly Rachel's iPhone VIBRATES. She picks it up, and reads
          her text message. Her face lights up as she reads. She
          quickly types a reply.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SUSPICIOUS)
           Who's that?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Susan. She wants to know what time
           I'm coming over.
                         
                          ADAM
           (even more suspicious)
           That's what she just texted?
                          (MORE)
           97.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           She wants to know what time you're
           going over to her house?
                         
          Rachel puts the phone down on the counter and returns to her
          cooking.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Uh huh.
                         
                          ADAM
           Alright, well I'm gonna go lie
           down.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I might be out late so don't wait
           up.
                         
          Adam walks to the bedroom. After a beat he moves back to the
          doorway and pops his head around the corner. He quietly
          watches Rachel cross from the kitchen into the living room.
                         
          He stealthily steps into the kitchen, picks Rachel's iPhone
          off the counter and scrolls through her text messages.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (TO SELF)
           What the fuck?
                         
          Rachel enters the kitchen.
                         
                          RACHEL
           What are you doing?

           He wants to know if you're still
           coming over tonight. Should I tell
           him you're having a girls night?
                          (CONTINUES READING)
           Oh wait, you already told him to
           bring the wine.
                          (LOOKS UP)
           That's funny. It seems as though
           you've double booked yourself.
                         
                          RACHEL

          Rachel reaches for the phone. Adam pulls away.

           He seems sweet.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Adam, it's not what you think.

           Don't be like that. I didn't do
           anything wrong.

                          (SERIOUS)
           You've been cheating on me.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Adam you're being ridiculous.
                         
                          ADAM
           Am I?
                         
          Adam holds up Rachel's phone to display a photo of Rachel
          naked, covered in red paint.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           What's this?
                         
          Adam scrolls through an entire series of nude photos of
          Rachel - all ridiculously artistic.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           And this? And this? And this? There
           are over a dozen naked photos of

          Suddenly the back door swings open. Oblivious, Seth enters.
                         
                          SETH
           Hey guys.
                         
          Adam and Rachel say nothing. Seth can tell he just walked
          into some major shit.
                         
                          SETH (CONT'D)
           Bad time?
                         
          Adam and Rachel say nothing. Seth takes a peak at Rachel's
          iPhone.
                         
                          SETH (CONT'D)

           I can see you're in the middle of
           something. I'll just be in the
           other room.
                         
          Seth crosses to the living room. Rachel picks up the
          conversation where they left off.
                         
                          RACHEL
           It's a portrait series, commenting
           on post-colonial patriarchy in the
           Congo.
           (off Adam's look)
           ...That's it. Nothing more.
                         
                          ADAM
           Have you lost your mind? I had the
           most important appointment of my
           life today and you missed it
           because you were off with your "art

           know about Africa?
                         
          Rachel totally forgot about his appointment. The guilt runs
          through her body.
                         
                          RACHEL

           You know, you have a pretty fucked
           up way of showing your commitment.

           I told you I couldn't handle this!
                         
          Rachel stares at Adam with her adorable green eyes. She takes
          his hand.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry...I love you.
                         
          They embrace. A beat. Adam lets go. He looks Rachel in the
          eyes.
                         
                          ADAM

          Adam walks out the back door.
                         
          Seth enters the kitchen and gets in Rachel's face. He stares
          her down.
                         
                          SETH

                          (COY)
           That's what you think.
                         
          Suddenly Adam passes out. His head slams into the steering
          wheel. The Horn blares.

          Seth and Adam stagger into the building.
                         
                         
          INT. SETH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Adam and Seth enter the dingy studio apartment - it looks
          like it hasn't been cleaned in years. Adam scoops up some
          dust with his finger.
                         
          Seth is unusually quiet. Both guys are being distant. Seth
          pulls down the Murphy Bed and the two awkwardly avoid eye
          contact as they undress. Adam climbs into bed. He notices a
          book called "Coping with Your Loved One's Cancer" on Seth's
          bedside table. The book is worn and has multiple book marks -
          indicating it's been read. Adam looks at Seth, he had him
          pegged all wrong.
                         
          Seth claps his hands. The lights turn off.
                         
                          ADAM
           Good night.

          Lying in bed, Adam hears a strange noise, he tilts his head
          to the side to see Seth breathing heavily and staring at him.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (UNCOMFORTABLE)
           What are you doing?

           I know. I can't help it.
                         
          Seth lays back on his pillow and holds onto Adam's hand. They
          both stare up at the ceiling - terrified about the future.

          A MORTICIAN, stout and dignified, with a slight British
          accent leads Adam and Seth on a tour of the cemetery grounds.
                         
                          MORTICIAN
           Here at Linden we're more than just
           a stopping ground for the deceased.
           We understand that life is
           different for everyone, and helping
           families to see their loved ones
           off to the hereafter means
           approaching every funeral and
           burial with it's own dignity and
           care...A funeral is a representation
           of the individuals time spent on
           earth, so I ask you to reflect on
           your inevitable interment and think
           carefully in choosing the service
           and tomb that best befits you.

           and...branches...whatever you can
           find. We push it out...into the
           sea...or the ocean...and then shoot
           flaming arrows, boom! It catches on
           fire...And that's it. It's awesome.

          Adam and Seth look at the rows of Schwartz family tombstones.

          Adam lies on a gurney. DR. LAMB, the neurosurgeon performing
          Adam's surgery enters. He's wired on Espresso. Behind him is
          NURSE WONG who looks like she'd rather be anywhere else.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           Good morning Adam, how are you
           feeling? Good. Good. Good. Good.
                         
          Despite Dr. Lamb's already thick glasses, he holds Adam's
          medical chart right up to his to his face.
                         
           DR. LAMB (CONT'D)
           So we're going to be removing your
           kidney? Right? Or is it the left?
           Just kidding. That's doctor humor.
                         
          Adam forces a small chuckle. He's completely terrified.
                         
           DR. LAMB (CONT'D)
           Nurse Wong here needs you to sign a
           few papers, so I'm going to leave
           her to do her job, and I'll see you
           after the surgery.
                         
          Dr. Lamb exits. Nurse Wong hands Adam a giant pile of
          disclaimers to sign.

           Hospital liability and disclaimer
           forms...in case they need to fuse
           your spine or remove any organs.
           You know, the usual.

           Glad to hear there's nothing
           unusual about removing organs.
                         
          Adam signs the documents and hands them back to Nurse Wong.
                         
                          NURSE WONG
           You have some visitors.
                         
          As Nurse Wong exits, Edith and Art enter.
                         
                          EDITH
           There he is.
                         
          Edith pulls a strip of pills out of her fanny pack. She hands
          them to Adam like she's slipping him illegal drugs.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           Here take these. They're special. I
           got them from Canada.
                         
          Adam looks closely at the pills - they read "NUPRIN."
                         
                          ADAM
                          (PERPLEXED)

           I know isn't it great?
                         
          Adam looks at his mother, perplexed by her logic.

           What the hell.
                         
          Adam downs the pills. Art whispers closely into his ear.
                         
                          ART
           I gotta new coat.

          Art grabs hold of Adam's hand and stares at his son. A beat.
                         
                          ART

           I love you too dad.
                         
          Katie knocks on the door.
                         
                          KATIE
           Hello?
                         
          Katie slowly enters holding a bouquet of flowers. Edith
          examines her. This is too awkward.
                         
                          ADAM
           Egh em. Mom. Mom.
                         
          Adam nods for his mother to leave.
                         
                          EDITH
           Alright. Come on Art, let's go to
           the waiting room.
                         
          On her way out, Edith turns to Katie and notices a CROSS
          around her neck.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
                          (DISPLEASED)
           Hmmm.
                         
          Edith and Art exit. Adam is left alone with Katie. They're
          both nervous.
                         
                          KATIE
           I brought you flowers. Not sure
           why, I didn't know what else-

           They're great, thank you.
                         
          Katie sits on the bed next to Adam.
                         
                          KATIE

           Will you be here when I wake up?
                         
                          KATIE
           I'm not going anywhere.
                         
                          ANESTHESIOLOGIST
           Now relax, this will take a few
           minutes to feel the effect.
                         
          The Anesthesiologist injects the drugs into Adam's IV.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (TERRIFIED)
           About how long?
                         
                          ANESTHESIOLOGIST
           Relax, you will soon begin the
           sleeping.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well what if it doesn't work. How
           do you know I won't wake in the
           middle of the surgery? What if I-
                         
          Just like that, Adam's out cold.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL SURGICAL AMPHITHEATER - LATER
                         
          Adam is face down on the operating table. Two Neurosurgeons,
          Dr. Lamb and DR. HENRY are in mid surgery. Alongside the two
          doctors are Nurse Wong and NURSE SCOTT.
                         
           DR. HENRY
           I'm telling you Sir Francis Drake
           was a Buccaneer.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           No he was a privateer.
                         
                          NURSE SCOTT
           I thought he was a pirate.
           114.
                         
                         
           DR. LAMB
           A pirate works for no one but
           himself. A privateer has a mandate
           from a government.
                         
           DR. HENRY
           I thought that was a buccaneer.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           No, a buccaneer is a butcher turned
           pirate.
                         
           DR. HENRY
           Then what's a mercenary?
                         
           DR. LAMB
                          (FRUSTRATED)
           Nurse Wong. Will you Google it?
                         
          Standing to the side of the operating table is the group of
          Med Students from earlier. They're still taking notes.

          Edith, Art and Seth sit impatiently watching the clock. Katie
          paces up and down the hall. Hours go by. Time can't seem to
          go by quick enough.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          Dr. Lamb finds Edith, Katie and Seth in the waiting room.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           We were successful in the
           extraction of the tumor. However,
           as you can imagine, with something
           of this magnitude...there were some
           unforeseen complications. The bone
           corrosion was much greater than
           initially anticipated. We had to
           remove part of the hip and pelvis,
           as well as most of the psoas
           muscle. We also had to remove a
           good amount of sheath tissue around
           the sciatic nerve, the damage to
           that nerve is considerable, which
           is going to hinder his ability to
           walk...He's in stable condition
           right now, but it's touch and go.

          INT. HOSPITAL ICU - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Adam's in his hospital bed - still asleep from the surgery. A
          NURSE comes in to change his IV. Adam slowly awakens. He is
          high on morphine. He stares, mesmerized by the nurse.
                         
                          ADAM
           That is the most beautiful dresses.
           Where did you get it?
                         
          Dr. Lamb enters.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           Adam, I see you're awake.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm here.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           How are you feeling?
                         
                          ADAM
           I feel wonderful.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           That would be the morphine.
                         
          Dr. Lamb picks up a handle that's attached to the morphine
          drip and sticks it in Adam's hand.
                         
           DR. LAMB (CONT'D)
           I want you to push this little
           button any time you feel pain.
           It'll trigger the morphine. You
           think you can do that?
                         
          Adam moves his hands really slowly in the air -
                         
                          ADAM
           Magic!
                         
          Art and Edith enter the room. Adam reacts like a little kid
          being picked up from pre-school.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Mommy! Daddy!
                         
                          EDITH
                          (CRYING)
           My little boy.
           116.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           Remember the time you walked in on
           me masturbating?...That was so
           awkward...What hotel is this? We
           need to go on more vacations.
                         
          Katie pops her head out from behind Adam's parents.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           You're here too! You're soooooo
           awesome...
                          (SING SONG)
           Katie McRae, Katie McRae, Katie
           McRae. Mic-Rae, Dr. Awesome Mic-
           Rae...I'd love to make you pancakes
           sometime.
                         
          Suddenly the most excruciating pain runs through Adam's body
          causing him to scream in agony.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN!
           PAIN! PAIN!
                         
                          KATIE
           Squeeze the morphine trigger!
                         
          Adam squeezes the trigger. The morphine offers immediate
          relief. He lays back in total bliss, and then...
                         
                         
          FADE OUT TO WHITE LIGHT.
                         
                         
          EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY
                         
                         SUPER: NOVEMBER
                         
          A door bell. A hand reaches out. A finger on that hand pushes
          the door bell. The other hand holds a bouquet of flowers.
                         
          The hand belongs to Mitch's wife, MARGARET (80). She stands
          on the porch of a small beach bungalow.
                         
          The front door opens. Margaret looks straight ahead. Nothing.
          She then looks down, startled by Adam in a wheelchair.
                         
                          MARGARET
                          (STARTLED)
           Oh, hello, I didn't see you, ah
           down there.
                         
          There's a glow in Adam's face - he looks younger and more
          jovial than we've ever seen.
           117.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           You must be Margaret.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Yes, I'm looking for Adam Schwartz.
                         
                          ADAM
           That's me.
                         
                          MARGARET
           (face lights up)
           You're Adam? The way Mitch
           described you, I always assumed you
           to be much older. About 50 years
           older. But, you're just a baby...
                         
          Adam blushes.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm so glad you could make it.
                          (SOLEMN)
           I'm really sorry about Mitch.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Me too.
                         
                          ADAM
           Please come inside. You're just in
           time.
                         
          Adam leads Margaret inside, past a dozen oversized boxes.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Sorry about the mess. I just moved
           in...The ocean air is supposed to
           be good for my recovery.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Adam and Margaret enter the living room. Everyone's there:
          Edith, Art, Katie and Seth.
                         
          Seth and Katie are playing a video game: DUCK HUNT. Edith
          sets food on the table.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (TO MARGARET)
           We're having a Duck Hunt
           tournament. You play?
           118.
                         
                         
                          MARGARET
                          (LAUGHS)
           Me? Oh I don't know how to play
           video games.
                         
          Adam holds up the controller - an old Nintendo Gun.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's really easy. One button does
           everything.
                         
          Edith chimes in from across the room.
                         
                          EDITH
           This food's not going to eat
           itself.
                         
          Everyone makes their way to the table. Visibly weak, Adam
          slowly lifts himself out of the wheelchair. He yelps in pain.
          Katie starts to help when Seth intervenes.
                         
                          SETH
           I got it.
                         
          Seth grabs hold of Adam, and with his help, Adam takes a
          small step and then lowers himself into his seat at the
          table. Katie places a pillow behind Adam's back.
                         
          Adam takes Katie's hand, she looks down at him, they exchange
          a smile.
                         
          Adam notices and open window.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (TO SETH)
           You mind?
                         
          Seth ignores Adam as he fills both their plates with food.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Please. I think there's a red tide
           or something. My eyes are all
           itchy. It feels like someone is
           rubbing sandpaper on my corneas.
                         
                          SETH
           (as he serves Adam)
           Nope. You don't have cancer
           anymore. No more special treatment.
                         
                          ADAM
           I am still in remission.
           119.
                         
                         
                          EDITH
           You gonna spend the rest of your
           life complaining?
                         
                          ADAM
                          (PROUD)
           I like complaining.
                         
          We FREEZE on the family sitting around the dinner table.
                         
          We hear the song "That's the Way The World Goes Round" by
          John Prine as we:
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                          THE END
