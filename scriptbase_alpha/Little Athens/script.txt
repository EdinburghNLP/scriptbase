          FADE IN:
          
          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
          
          The room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about
          eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t-
          shirt. He has not quite woken up yet.
          
          Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and
          tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING
          from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase.
          
          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Jerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and
          not much cleaner. Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and
          jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can
          of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else.
          
          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Jerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the
          sink.
          
          He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he
          is not very attractive. He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and
          exits the bathroom.
          
          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          The room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a
          naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, an old
          POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot
          of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. Jerry tosses his
          Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE
          and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III.
          He has pitifully few belongings. He shuts the Suitcase.
          
          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          The living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a
          house full of bachelors. Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but
          still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his
          Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to
          look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it.
          
          He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with
          handle until the screen door opens. He exits, letting the screen
          door slam shut behind him.

                                                                                 2
          EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- MORNING
          
          The old building is badly in need of a fresh paint job.   A faded
          sign reading "ATHENS RESCUE SQUAD" stands in front.
          
                                 HEATHER (O.S.)
                    You hear about your ex?
          
                                 ALLISON (O.S.)
                    Jerry?
          
          INT. RESCUE SQUAD, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
          
          The kitchen is empty except for HEATHER and ALLISON, both about
          nineteen and dressed in EMS uniforms with "EMS" stitched
          conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden
          table. Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9" and built like a lingerie
          model. Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than
          Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than
          Heather. Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of
          her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine.
          Allison has a BAGEL and a PEACH, which remain hardly touched - she
          has a lot on her mind.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Yeah, asshole Jerry. He's moving to
                    Middletown. He left this morning.
          
                                  ALLISON
                    No way.   How do you know?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Carter said. He got some job at some
                    company, giving his uncle hand-jobs.
          
          Having put away the last of her food, Heather lights a CIGARETTE and
          stands near the open window, careful to blow the smoke out the
          window.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Doesn't sound so bad.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    I don't want to go to a baseball game.
                    You're going with Derek anyway.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Ally, I don't want to go either, but Derek
                    told Adam he'd go, and I'm not going by
                    myself.
          
                                                                                 3
                                 ALLISON
                    I thought Adam was hurt.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I wish.
          
          Heather takes a drag of her Cigarette and exhales out the window.
          
          EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
          
          BRAD, in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder, is
          standing in front of the door, waiting. MEGAN, in shorts, a t-shirt
          and a baseball cap, and AMY, in a sunskirt, look on. All in their
          late teens, they are unmade and worn-out, as if they hadn't slept
          last night.
          
          Brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. Brad walks over
          to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through
          the shades. Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy's MAIL out of
          the mailbox that hangs next to the door.
          
                                 BRAD
                         (banging on the window
                         pane)
                    Hey! Jimmy!
          
          The door opens and JIMMY answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4"
          and thin, dressed in boxers, a t-shirt and bedroom slippers.
          Jimmy's tired, but Brad's a friendly face.
          
                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                    Finally!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Office hours are nine to five.
          
                                 MEGAN
                    You have a lot of credit card bills in
                    there, Jimmy.
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (holding his hand out for
                         the Mail)
                    I know.
          
          Megan hands Jimmy the Mail.
          
                                 MEGAN
                    You're not mad that we're stopping by like
                    this?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    It's no big deal, but let's hurry up.    I
                    gotta go to work.
          
                                                                                4
                                 MEGAN
                         (explaining to Amy)
                    Jimmy's got like, six jobs.
          
          Jimmy stands aside, allowing Megan and Amy into his apartment.
          Megan and Amy step inside, but Brad holds back. He needs to talk to
          Jimmy, and the girls do not need to hear.
          
                                 BRAD
                    Hey Jimmy, hold up a sec. Look, not for
                    nothin', but you know Buggerin' Bobby
                    Bales is askin' about you?
          
                                  JIMMY
                    Askin'?   Like how?
          
                                 BRAD
                    Like how you owe him money on the Dallas
                    fiasco, those chokin' motherfuckers, and
                    you haven't been returnin' his calls.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    How you hear this?
          
                                 BRAD
                    Yesterday. I was puttin' a twenty-timer
                    on Indiana for tonight, and he up and out-
                    of-the-blue asks about you. Jimmy, man.
                    Goddam.
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (unconvincing)
                    It ain't nothin'. He's just makin'
                    conversation.
          
                                 BRAD
                    It ain't nothin'? That faggot juicehead's
                    gonna make a playground outta your asshole
                    like he's back in the joint, and it ain't
                    nothin'? And you heard all the stories I
                    heard, about that horse-cock, and how he
                    can't stop shootin' his mouth off about it
                    too, like when he whipped it out at
                    Tomlinson's party...
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Alright Brad! Christ Jesus, I owe a
                    little, shit, but I'll pay. Believe me,
                    that guy wants his juice, his e, he comes
                    to me. It's fine.
          
                                 BRAD
                    Put some cash on Indy tonight, Jimmy.
          
                                                                                 5
                                JIMMY
                    Yeah. Alright, come inside and let's do
                    this thing. I got work.
          
          Brad steps past Jimmy into the apartment, and Jimmy shuts the door
          after them.
          
          EXT. POOL -- MORNING
          
          The slender white board extends majestically over the glistening
          blue water. PEDRO, an unshowered, pot-bellied Hispanic, about
          twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts, is
          standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as
          if expecting an invitation. COREY, a late teenager covered with
          tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard
          concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many
          pool skimmer drains. Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up,
          down, up, down. Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to
          him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic.
          Instead, Pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful.
          
                                 COREY
                    Nice.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Fuck you, conjo. This is my shower.
          
                                 COREY
                    Maybe back in Mexico that's a shower, in
                    Athens that's just dirty.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Clean the pool, conjo, clean the pool.
          
                                 COREY
                    At least I'm paid to be here.
          
          Pedro smiles as he paddles away from Corey, starting to enjoy his
          morning swim. A PAYPHONE hanging on the pool house starts ringing.
          Corey drops the Vacuum and runs toward the Payphone. In the
          background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly.
          
                                 COREY (CONT'D)
                    Wynwood Pool House, Corey speaking.
          
          EMILY, the voice on the other end, is hushed and uncertain.
          
                                 EMILY'S VOICE
                    It's me.
          
                                 COREY
                    Emily?
          
                                 EMILY'S VOICE
                    Some other girl would be calling you?
          
                                                                               6
          
                                 COREY
                    How'd you get this number?
          
                                 EMILY'S VOICE
                    Don't you work there?
          
                                 COREY
                    What do you want?
          
                                 EMILY'S VOICE
                    I need you to come pick me up.
          
                                 COREY
                    Are you kidding? Where are you?
          
                                 EMILY'S VOICE
                    At home.
          
                                 COREY
                    What for?
          
                                 EMILY'S VOICE
                    Just because. I need to stay with you for
                    a couple days.
          
                                 COREY
                    Emily, our place is tiny, we got no water.
                    Our phone just got shut off, too. You'd
                    be miserable like us. What for anyway?
          
                                 EMILY'S VOICE
                    It's no big deal. Just come pick me up.

                    Fine, forget it then.

                    Corey, come on! How many times have I
                    called you since you left? I wouldn't
                    ask, except I don't have anywhere to go.
                    Please.
          
                                 COREY
                    Fine. Alright, fine. If you wanna stay
                    in our little dump, fine.
          
                                  EMILY'S VOICE
                    Fine.   Thanks, then.
          
          INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
          
          JESSICA, about eighteen, wire-thin and plain, yet attractive in an
          unkept sort of way, with dirty-blond hair past her shoulders, lies
          on a couch sleeping. Her chokingly small living room is in a
          
                                                                                 7
          devastating state of disarray, with clothes and empty food
          containers flung in every direction.
          
          An ALARM on a table next to the couch begins blaring, and Jessica
          stretches out her arm to silence it.
          
          INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Jessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself, still
          half asleep. The bathroom is tiny like the living room - pathetic
          rather than endearing. She puts TOOTHPASTE on her TOOTHBRUSH.
          
          INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          JINA, Jessica's mother, opens the front door and enters the living
          room wearing a grocery checkout clerk's uniform. Jina drops her
          old, worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway.
          She opens the bathroom door and enters.
          
          INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jessica is brushing her teeth when Jina enters.
          
                                 JINA
                    Aren't you supposed to be watching Katie
                    right now?
          
          Jina reaches around Jessica and opens the medicine cabinet, grabs a
          bottle of ASPIRIN, and shuts it. Jessica continues brushing as if
          her mother were not there.
          
                                 JINA (CONT'D)
                    Did you get my message?
          
          Jessica shakes her head in the negative sense. Jina exits the
          bathroom and Jessica follows, still brushing her teeth.
          
          INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jessica walks over to the ANSWERING MACHINE and hits a button. The
          Answering Machine clicks on as Jessica brushes unenthusiastically.
          
                                 ANSWERING MACHINE
                         (electronic voice)
                    You have one new message.
                         (Jina's voice)
                    Hi Jess, it's your mother, calling to say
                    happy birthday, since you'll be gone when
                    I get home. I'm driving your sister to
                    school and I'm leaving the car for her, so
                    I'll be taking the train back.
          
          Jessica starts up as if she'd been struck. She spins around to an
          open window near the couch, leans out, and spits out the toothpaste
          
                                                                             8
          to the concrete sidewalk below. Her mother's voice continues to
          pour forth from the Answering Machine.
          
          
                                 ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)
                    By the way, you should call your sister
                    and stop this not-talking nonsense.
          
          Jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back
          towards the Answering Machine.
          
                                 ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)
                    Anyway, I know how you hate long messages,
                    so I'll see you tomorrow...
          
          Suddenly wide awake, Jessica turns to her mother.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    That's fucking bullshit.
          
                                 JINA
                    Here we go again.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    What about my car?!
          
                                 JINA
                    Jessica, your sister got into beauty
                    school, and she's going. Now I've got
                    about two hours sleep before I have to
                    drive her all the way the hell up there.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Yeah, I heard that.
          
                                 JINA
                    Jess, you're still living here for free.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    On the couch!
          
                                 JINA
                    Jessica, it's still my car, and she needs
                    it. Can't you be happy for your sister?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Oh yeah, I'm real happy. She gets my car,
                    and I get shit. Thanks, Jina. Do me a
                    favor and tell her how fucking happy I am
                    for her.
          
                                 JINA
                    If you're going to be like this, I'm just
                    going to bed.
          
                                                                                9
          Jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with
          water.
          
          Jessica returns to the living room wearing a t-shirt that reads
          "Athens Youth Group" in large letters along the front. Jina is
          gone. Jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it
          haphazardly. She grabs a pair of large SUNGLASSES off of the coffee
          table and places them over her eyes.
          
          She opens the door and exits the apartment.
          
          EXT. RON'S GYM -- MORNING
          
          Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT hatchback is parked in front of the small
          bare-bones gym.
          
          INT. RON'S GYM, LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jimmy now dressed in worn-out heavily-frayed khaki shorts and a
          short-sleeve button down shirt with a "Ron's Gym" emblem on the
          pocket, stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with
          one hand while rotating steel CHINESE STRESS BALLS with his other
          hand. He opens the locker and pulls out a large brown LUNCH BAG
          propped prominently at the base.
          
                                  RON (O.S.)
                    Hey Jimmy.   You fix the lat machine?
          
          RON, the tall, well-built, forty-something owner of the gym,
          approaches. Jimmy turns toward Ron. The row of lockers serves as a
          backdrop.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Yeah.
          
                                 RON
                    Jimmy, I'm just gonna say this, alright?
                    I gotta let you go. I can't afford two
                    employees.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    So you're keeping Melinda?
          
                                 RON
                    Yeah.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Ron, that is totally fucked!   I been here
                    way longer than her!

                    she works here.

                                 JIMMY
                    But she doesn't do anything! She just
                    sits at the front desk all day.

                    I know that.

                    she'll look at you cross-eyed.
          
                                 RON
                    I can't afford two employees, and she
                    attracts business. That's it.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Fucking great. Thanks.
          
                                 RON
                    Jimmy, don't take it personal. If you
                    were built like her I'd keep you.
          
          Ron exits and Jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker,
          defeated. BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, a.k.a. Bobby the Bookie, an
          enormous juicehead built like an old-school NFL linebacker, naked
          except for a towel around his neck, having just taken a shower, is
          leaning against the end of a row of lockers, waiting for his chance
          at Jimmy. Jimmy would rather that Ron stay.
          
                                   RON (CONT'D)
                    Bales.
          
          Bobby nods in response as Ron passes by on his way out. With the
          locker room empty, Bobby unconsciously changes demeanor. He's
          tender, frighteningly tender, it's so entirely genuine. Jimmy would
          prefer a beating - simple and final. Jimmy pulls his BACKPACK out
          of his locker and begins clearing his STUFF.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    So where you been?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    What are you talkin' about?   Nowhere.   I
                    been working.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    So you just don't return my phone calls.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Look, they lost, I owe you some more, so
                    what? I'll pay you. I want to put it on
                    Indy tonight.
          
                                                                                11
                                 BOBBY
                    I can't take any more of your bets.   I
                    look like a spineless fucking fag.
          
          Bobby shuts Jimmy's locker and steps up to Jimmy so that Jimmy is
          now face to face with Bobby's enormous organ - a terrifying sight
          for mortal men and reputable women. Jimmy is struck silent,
          savagely clenching his Chinese Stress Balls as he struggles for
          thought.
          
                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)

                    my apartment tonight, we'll figure this
                    out.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I ain't like that.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    Ain't like what?
          
                                    JIMMY
                    Nothin'.

                                 JIMMY
                    I'm working tonight.

                    Jimmy, I ain't about beggin'. I'm lookin'
                    like a fool all on account 'a you. You
                    owe me. You owe me. I'm gettin' sick of
                    it.
          
          Bobby moves on to his own locker.
          
          EXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUS
          
          WIDE across the width of the pool. COREY, wet, with GOGGLES on his
          head, holding a WRENCH and SCREW DRIVER, and BYSTANDER #1, stand
          over a young twenty-ish female VICTIM who lies passed out on the
          cement. A young female LIFEGUARD is kneeling beside the Victim,
          checking her pulse and breathing. The two SWIMMERS left in the pool
          are climbing out. PETE, a no-nonsense grounds-keeper in his late
          thirties, wearing cut-off shorts, a faded t-shirt and a tool belt,
          approaches to have a word with Corey.

                    out of the pool.
          
          The Lifeguard stands and runs off toward the PAYPHONE.
          
                                 PETE

                    Jerry moved to Middletown.
          
                                   COREY
                    He quit?
          
                                 PETE
                    He left a message. You gotta take care of
                    all his stuff now, too.
          
                                 COREY
                    Aw, come on, Pete! I need off tomorrow!
                    I told you I got community service!
          
                                 PETE
                    So you're gonna have to get everything
                    done today then. Get going.
          
          Corey tears the Goggles off his head, throws them into the pool, and
          about-faces toward the pool-house. As Corey leaves, a RED-HEADED
          IDIOT does a sloppy can-opener off the side of the pool.
          
                                 LIFEGUARD (O.S.)
                    Keith, I told you to clear the pool!
          
          EXT. EMPTY PARK -- MORNING
          
          Though the park is in a poor neighborhood, it is relatively clean.
          The park is quiet and unused this morning except for two young GIRLS
          making their way across it. Prominent in the background sits an old
          run-down yellow CAR that Jessica drove to the park.
          
                                                                             13
          JESSICA is carrying KATIE, a plain, tiny seven-year-old girl, in
          piggy-back fashion, with Katie's legs dangling out in front of
          Jessica. Katie holds Jessica tight around the collarbone.
          
                                 KATIE
                    Doesn't Carlos want his car back?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    He's letting me borrow it.
          
                                 KATIE
                    Well then why were you late if you had his
                    car?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I slept late.
          
                                 KATIE
                    Were you drinking last night?
          
                                  JESSICA
                    No.   But thanks for asking.
          
                                 KATIE
                    Were you doing drugs?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Katie, I told you, drugs are for losers.
          
                                 KATIE
                    And you're not a loser.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    And neither are you.
          
                                 KATIE
                    But it's okay to drink.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    When you're older it'll be okay.
          
                                 KATIE
                    How old are you?
          
                                  JESSICA
                    Old enough.
          
                                 KATIE
                    But you're not twenty-one yet. The law
                    says you have to be twenty-one.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Katie, can you not ask so many questions
                    today? I've got too much to think about.
          
                                                                                14
                                 KATIE
                    Cause it's your birthday?
          
                                    JESSICA
                    Yes.
          
                                 KATIE
                    Happy Birthday!
          
                                    JESSICA
                    Thank you.
          
          Jessica begins walking faster, soon breaking into a crippled run,
          the weight of Katie bearing down on her. They reach their
          destination - a rickety old merry-go-round. Jessica turns her back
          to the merry-go-round, allowing Katie to step onto it.
          
                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    Hold on tight or you'll get hurt.
          
                                    KATIE
                    I will.
          
          Katie grabs a handle as Jessica begins to spin the machine. Katie
          sails around happily as Jessica steps back to watch, Katie's
          youthful enthusiasm lulling Jessica into a nostalgic gloom.
          
          INT. AMBULANCE -- MORNING
          
          HEATHER is driving the AMBULANCE, sirens blaring, a CIGARETTE
          hanging out of her mouth, with ALLISON riding shotgun. HARRY, mild-
          mannered, rotund, middle-aged and slightly balding, is in the back
          sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance,
          adjacent to a stretcher. Harry sits expressionless, adjusting his
          spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving.
          
                                 ALLISON
                         (pointing)
                    Turn left at the light.
          
          EXT. ROAD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          WIDE on the ambulance tearing through town, lights flashing.
          Heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation,
          recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary
          vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass, on her way to
          running through a red light. In the rear of the ambulance, Harry
          whips back and forth on the bench, yet remains calm, as if unaware
          of Heather's reckless driving.
          
          EXT. POOL, PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Within the parking lot, the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in
          front of a large picket fence encircling the pool. At the gate
          stands the LIFEGUARD.
          
                                                                                 15
          
          All three climb out of the ambulance.    Harry rushes toward the
          Lifeguard. Heather takes a final puff    of her Cigarette and flicks
          it aside before continuing in the same   direction as Harry. Allison
          lags behind, pulling a BACKBOARD and a   large FIRST AID KIT out of
          the ambulance.
          
                                 LIFEGUARD
                    She's in here.
          
          They enter the gate.
          
          EXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Heather and Harry follow the Lifeguard into the pool area, where
          several BYSTANDERS have gathered around the VICTIM, BYSTANDER #1 and
          PETE among them. Heather gets to the Victim first, but stops short
          - she recognizes the Victim. Harry brushes past Heather.
          
                                 HARRY
                         (to Bystanders)
                    Can you give us some room, please?
          
          The crowd backs up a bit, and Harry checks for vitals.
          
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                         (looking up to Heather)
                    She's breathing.
          
          Harry looks the Victim over a bit.
          
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                         (to Lifeguard)
                    What happened?
          
                                 LIFEGUARD
                    I'm not sure. She just passed out, right
                    where you see her.
          
                                 HARRY
                    Did you see her eat anything?
          
                                    LIFEGUARD
                    Uh-uh.
          
          Heather turns and walks back toward Allison coming through the gate
          carrying the Backboard and First Aid Kit - she wants a word with
          Allison. They talk in hushed tones.
          
                                    HEATHER
                    I know her.
          
                                    ALLISON
                    Yeah?    How?
          
                                                                               16
          Allison hands Heather the First Aid Kit as they move back toward
          Harry.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    When I was dating Steve, that slut fucked
                    him.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    How do you know?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    She started dating Steve right after we
                    broke up. I mean right after. I asked
                    him if there was another girl, and he
                    never answered. He couldn't answer,
                    because he was fucking that slut.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    That doesn't mean they fucked.
          
          Heather gives Allison a disapproving look, as if to say "don't be
          stupid, stupid."
          
          As Heather and Allison approach the Victim, Harry looks up.
          
                                 HARRY
                    Alright, she ain't comin' around.
          
          Allison lays the Backboard adjacent to the Victim, and the three
          place her on the Backboard. Heather is a bit rough.
          
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                         (instinctively)
                    Whoa, easy.
          
                                 HEATHER
                         (without looking up)
                    I know what I'm doing.
          
          Harry gives a concerned look to Allison, who returns the look, but
          the two say nothing. They place the Victim into the back of the
          Ambulance as Heather looks on.
          
          EXT. ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          The Ambulance is moving along a near-empty single-lane road at a
          patient pace, with two CARS tailgating behind it.
          
          INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Allison and Harry are in the back with the Victim, and Heather is
          again behind the wheel, moving her head ever so slightly, as if to
          music playing in her head. Heather's moderate driving speed is in
          sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene.
          At the same red light that Heather recklessly ran earlier, Heather
          
                                                                                 17
          stops and looks in all directions before proceeding, even though
          there are no cars at the intersection.
          
                                 HARRY
                    Uh, Heather, you want to step on it?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    We'll get there.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    You don't even know for sure if she slept
                    with Steve!
          
          Heather turns around in the driver seat, taking her eyes off the
          road.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Listen, fuck that slut, okay?! She can
                    fucking rot in hell! I'm not rushing for
                    her slut ass!
          
                                 ALLISON
                         (pleading)
                    Heather, c'mon, she's out cold!   We gotta
                    hurry!
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I-don't-fucking-care!! That slut can kiss
                    my ass!
                         (to Victim)
                    You hear me, you fucking bitch?!
          
          As Heather spins forward to look at the road, the Ambulance jumps as
          it hits a pothole.
          
          EXT. COREY AND PEDRO'S HOUSE -- MORNING
          
          The Tow Truck has just pulled up into the driveway. Pedro climbs
          out and makes his way up the sidewalk to his front door, carrying a
          gallon of MILK. Emily climbs out and trails behind him, carrying
          her LAUNDRY BAG and PURSE. The house is very small, with a front
          yard that is not much bigger than the sidewalk, and neighboring
          houses not much more than a body length apart from each other.
          Pedro notices an EVICTION NOTICE on the front door, and that a
          brand-new lock has been placed on the otherwise run-down door. He
          tries unsuccessfully to open the door.
          
          He walks over and looks through the front window into his kitchen
          and sees his DOG. Pedro taps on the window. The Dog looks up at
          Pedro, wagging its tail. Pedro tries to open the window, but it's
          locked.
          
          Pedro walks around to the side of the house. Emily throws her
          Laundry Bag over her shoulder and follows him, frustrated with the
          wait. He looks in the window on the pantry door. He backs up and
          
                                                                                 18
          looks toward Emily, blank. He looks back up at the house,
          frustrated. He about-faces, steps over to the side of the
          neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure
          the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing. Emily shakes her
          head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole
          situation.
          
          EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- MORNING
          
          Jimmy parks his PIECE-OF-SHIT in front of a mom-and-pop pizza shop
          and exits. A sign that reads "Poppy's Pizzeria" hangs above the
          pizza shop. He enters.
          
          INT. PIZZA SHOP -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jimmy walks past a few tables where patrons are eating. PIZZA POP,
          a sixty-ish pot-bellied man standing behind the counter making a
          PIZZA, sees him.
          
                                 PIZZA POP
                         (heavy Italian accent)
                    Hey-a, Jimmy, you don't hafta be here
                    'till 2:00! What's up, eh? You hungry?
          
                                JIMMY
                    Nah. I'm gonna start early, if that's
                    alright. I could use the cash.
          
                                 PIZZA POP
                    Still paying offa those credit cards, eh
                    Jimmy? I told you them things are-a
                    trouble.
                         (calling into the back)
                    Sweetheart! Don't a worry about that!
                    Jimmy's a here and he's a gonna take care
                    of it!
          
          In an arched entranceway to the back room we see PIZZA MOM back into
          view holding several PIZZA BOXES in insulated CARRYING BAGS.
          
                                 PIZZA MOM
                         (smiling)
                    Hey-a Jimmy!
          
          INT. CARLOS' CAR -- MORNING
          
          Jessica is driving the old run-down yellow CAR we saw earlier in the
          parking lot of the park, the window down and the radio blasting.
          Her CELL PHONE rings and she picks it up.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Hello?
          
                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                    Where the hell are you?
          
                                                                                19
          
                                   JESSICA
                    Carlos?
          
          EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          CARLOS, a skinny Hispanic teenager, is walking out of the
          convenience store with a tray of NACHOS, talking on a CELL PHONE.
          We cut back and forth between Jessica and Carlos.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Why weren't you answering your phone?!
                    You were supposed to bring my car back
                    last night!
          
                                    JESSICA'S VOICE
                    Yeah.     Sorry.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    You bringing it or what?        I need it for
                    work!
          
                                 JESSICA'S VOICE
                    Not 'til this afternoon.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    What the hell, Jess?!        You said I'd have
                    it last night!
          
                                 JESSICA'S VOICE
                    Alright, relax, I'll bring it.
          
                                    CARLOS
                    Dammit!     Where are you?
          
                                 JESSICA'S VOICE
                    I'm getting on the Parkway.
          
          The old run-down yellow Car passes Carlos and continues down the
          street. Carlos is dumbfounded.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    What the hell?!
          
          Carlos runs into the street and stands staring down the road at his
          Car speeding away from him.
          
                                 JESSICA'S VOICE
                    What's the matter?
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Jess, you just passed me!        In my car!
          
          Carlos continues to look as his Car makes a right turn and
          disappears from view.
          
                                                                                 20
          
                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                    Jess, this is bullshit! Bring back my
                    car!
          
          A horn honks, and Carlos steps toward the side of the road as a
          STATION WAGON passes right by him. He continues to stand in the
          street, although to the side.
          
                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                    Jess, I know you're coming back here. I
                    know you're not leaving me standing here.
          
          Carlos waits impatiently. Jessica pulls up in the Car and comes to
          a stop alongside him - she had gone around the block to pick him up.
          He gets in the passenger-side door.
          
                                  JESSICA
                    Sorry.
          
          The Car pulls away.
          
          INT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Carlos has a look of disgust on his face.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I would have brought the car back, but I
                    need it.
          
                                  CARLOS
                    So you ask.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I said I'm sorry.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Yeah right. And why the hell are you
                    still driving?
          
                                  JESSICA
                    Fine.
          
          The Car stops, Carlos and Jessica climb out of the Car and pass in
          back of it without a word. Carlos climbs into the driver seat, and
          Jessica the passenger seat. Jessica grabs Carlos's Nachos and
          starts munching them down, dipping each one into the CHEESE SAUCE
          that is on the side.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Where's the squirt?
          
          
                                 JESSICA
                    At my place watching TV.
          
                                                                                21
          
                                 CARLOS
                    You left her alone?
          
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Just for a minute. I left my novel at
                    Aaron's.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    You need it now? Aren't you supposed to
                    be watching her?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Yeah, I'm stuck with her all weekend. I'm
                    just gonna get through these last few
                    weeks like I promised, and I'm done, I did
                    a good thing, and some other moron can
                    take a turn being her big sister.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Don't know why you wanted another sister
                    when you hate the one you got.
          
          Jessica needs to change the subject.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    What're you up to?
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Guess who stopped by.
          
                                   JESSICA
                    Who?
          
                                   CARLOS
                    Guess.
          
                                   JESSICA
                    Mary Lynn.
          
                                    CARLOS
                    Yes.     Gigantic beast of a woman that she
                    is.
          
          Jessica is obviously delighting in this. She enjoys Carlos fighting
          off the affections of this very unattractive girl.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Aw Carlos, I think you should give her a
                    shot. She's probably one of those
                    personality girls.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Yeah, what you know about personality?
          
                                                                                22
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I bet she'll give it up right away.
          
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Now that's something you know about.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    You should go for it.   Drain them pipes.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
          
          Carlos reaches down and blasts the radio as the Car speeds down the
          road.
          
          EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- MORNING
          
          Jimmy is carrying several full insulated pizza CARRYING BAGS, with
          several brown LUNCH BAGS full of food on top. Although the pile
          looks unwieldy, Jimmy has no trouble with it. He places the pile on
          the roof of his PIECE-OF-SHIT, opens the passenger door, and places
          the pile on the passenger seat.
          
          He closes the door, and pulls a DELIVERY LIST out of his pocket to
          examine while walking around to the driver's side. Jimmy gets into
          the driver's seat and pulls out his CELL PHONE.
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (into his cell phone)
                    Hey, Car, it's me. I got a delivery in
                    the area so I'm stopping by a little
                    early. See you in a little while.
          
          Jimmy hangs up, starts his Piece-of-Shit, and pulls out of the
          parking lot.
          
          EXT. COUNTY ROAD -- MORNING
          
          A POLICE CAR is sitting off the road, positioned to surprise
          unsuspecting speeders. The lone occupant, DEREK, twenty, about 6'
          tall with athletic build, in his police-officer uniform, is reading
          the SPORTS SECTION of a newspaper.
          
          INT. DEREK'S POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          
          OTS on Derek as he turns the page and continues reading the sports
          section. A young preppy high school PUNK speeds by in a CORVETTE -
          the RADAR GUN reads 93 m.p.h. As he passes, the punk looks straight
          at Derek, mouth open, clearly surprised by Derek's presence. Derek
          picks up his head and returns the stare of the surprised Punk as he
          passes.
          
                                                                                23
                                   DEREK
                    Whoa.
                         (returning to the Sports
                         Section)
                    Slow down, there, buddy.
          
          Derek's CELL PHONE rings.    He reaches down, fumbles around, and
          brings it to his ear.
          
                                   DEREK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah?
          
          EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          ALLISON is seated on a small wooden bench in the yard in front of
          the rescue squad. HEATHER is pacing back and forth in front of her,
          CELL PHONE to her ear. Both are smoking CIGARETTES. Heather is
          still heated from seeing Steve's girl, and Allison is uncomfortable
          being around Heather, who may lash out at anything. We cut back and
          forth between Derek and Heather.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Are you seeing anybody else?
          
                                   DEREK
                    Hello?
          
                                 HEATHER
                         (louder)
                    Hello?! Are you seeing anybody else?!
          
                                   DEREK
                    No.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    You're not cheating on me?
          
                                   DEREK
                    No.
          
                                   HEATHER
                    Be honest.
          
                                 DEREK
                    You're startin' to annoy me.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    You're fucking annoying me!
          
                                    DEREK
                            (dismissive)
                    Fine.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Don't you hang up!
          
                                                                                 24
          
                                 DEREK
                    Then calm down. You told me to tell you
                    when you're in one of your moods? Well
                    guess what?
          
          DEREK hears a click, hangs up, puts his Cell Phone down and goes
          back to reading the Sports Section.
          
                                    HEATHER
                    See?     That asshole's cheating.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Just because he won't move in with you
                    doesn't mean he's cheating.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Ally, he's a cheater. That's what he does
                    - he cheats. Now it's my turn just like
                    all the others.
          
          Heather grabs her PURSE off the bench, replaces her Cell Phone, and
          pulls out her KEYS.
          
                                   HEATHER (CONT'D)
                    Let's go.
          
                                   ALLISON
                    Where?
          
          Allison gets up and follows Heather toward the parking lot.
          
          EXT. AARON'S HOUSE -- MORNING
          
          CARLOS has parked in front of an old house, which is in a high state
          of disrepair. JESSICA gets out of the CAR with Carlos' NACHOS.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    You coming in?
          
                                 CARLOS
                    No, but tell asshole I said hello.
          
                                   JESSICA
                    See ya.
          
          Jessica shuts the door. As she walks away, Carlos cannot take his
          eyes off of her - he is obsessed.
          
          Jessica walks up the steps and bangs on the screen door. PITT,
          African-American, medium build, in his late teens, with thick-framed
          glasses, walks up behind the screen door and holds it open for
          Jessica to walk in.
          
                                                                    25
                                   JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    Aaron here?
          
                                 PITT
                    No, he went to yer place lookin' fer you.
          
          
          INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jessica walks in.    Pitt let's the door slam shut.
          
                                    JESSICA
                    Shit.     I left my novel here.
          
                                 PITT
                    You got no idea why he's lookin' for you,
                    do you?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    What're you talkin' about?
          
                                 PITT
                    You been fuckin' around.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    No I haven't.
          
                                 PITT
                    Well, someone did somethin', cause Aaron
                    caught somethin' an' he ain't happy about
                    it.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    He caught somethin'?     What the hell did he
                    catch?
          
                                 PITT
                    Wouldn't say. Just said that he ain't
                    been with anyone, so it musta been you.
          
                                   JESSICA
                    Shit.
          
                                 PITT
                    You humped someone, didn't you?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I didn't do shit.
          
                                 PITT
                    Well it musta been the immaculate
                    infection, 'cuz he got somethin'.     He's
                    lookin' fer you.
          
                                                                                 26
          Jessica throws the Nachos on the coffee table and sits on the couch,
          head in her hands, on the verge of tears.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Shit, shit...
          
                                 PITT
                    Yeah, you did it.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Fuck you, Pitt.
          
          INT. POOL, MEN'S BATHROOM -- MORNING
          
          COREY is MOPPING the floor. He glances up as Pedro steps over to
          him. Corey and Pedro talk and argue like two kids on a playground.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Hey, mehn.
          
                                 COREY
                    What're you doing back?
          
                                 PEDRO
                    I got your sister.
                         (forming breasts with his
                         hands)
                    She got big.
          
                                 COREY
                    That's my little sister.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    She's hot, mehn. Esta buenisima.
          
                                 COREY
                    Just take her back to our place!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    I can't because we got no place.   We got
                    thrown out.
          
                                 COREY
                    He threw us out?!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Si! And all our shit's still in there!
                    And Pancho, too!
          
                                 COREY
                    That's illegal, isn't it?!   He can't just
                    lock us out!
          
                                                                                  27
                                 PEDRO
                    Si, he sucks cock. I mean, I gotta go
                    find a job, I smell like shit, I'm fucked!
          
                                 COREY
                    Maybe you should talk to your boss.    Like,
                    ask him to take you back.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    No, fuck him, mehn! Just gimme Mr.
                    Cocksucker's address.
          
                                    COREY
                    What for?
          
                                 PEDRO
                    I take care of this.
          
                                 COREY
                    Don't do anything that'll get us into
                    trouble.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Do you think I'm stupid, mehn? Don't
                    worry about this. I talk to him. But
                    first I take care of business.
          
          Pedro bangs on a stall door, with no response.    Pedro pushes the
          door to the stall open.
          
                                    PEDRO (CONT'D)
                    Okay, mehn.     Good. Voy a cagar.
          
          Pedro disappears behind the door of the stall.    Corey leans his Mop
          against the wall and exits.
          
          EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
          JIMMY pulls his PIECE-OF-SHIT into the driveway of what appears to
          be a one-story house, next to a RANGE ROVER. He climbs out with the
          strap of his BACKPACK hanging over one shoulder and walks around the
          house to the back yard.
          
          The yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard,
          and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories. As Jimmy
          turns the corner, he spots a black CAT walking up to him. He grabs
          the Cat.
          
          INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          WIDE on Jimmy holding the Cat behind a set of sliding glass doors,
          one door partially open. He enters and shuts the door behind him.
          Music is playing through stereo speakers, and a black-and-white
          movie is playing on the TV with the sound shut off. CAR, an Asian-
          American late-twenty-something, is sitting back on the couch facing
          
                                                                                 28
          the TV. Magazines, junk food, remote controls and a CORDLESS PHONE
          are spread out on the coffee table. If Car notices Jimmy enter the
          room, he shows no sign of it.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Saw your cat outside.
          
          Jimmy tosses the Cat on the floor, and it scurries off to another
          part of the house. Jimmy sits in a recliner beside the couch, glad
          to take a load off. Jimmy takes a peak at the TV.
          
                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    I gotta get back to work. I got more pies
                    in the car.
          
          No response. The Cordless Phone starts ringing.    Car remains
          perfectly still.
          
                                  JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    Car?
          
          No response.   The Cordless Phone continues to ring.
          
          Jimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of Car.
          Nothing. Jimmy jumps up from his recliner. He stares at Car. He
          steps over, takes two fingers and checks Car's pulse. He stands
          back, unsure of what to do.
          
          Hesitant, Jimmy walks over to a closet, opens the door, and slides a
          GYM BAG out into the room. He opens the Gym Bag and pulls out a
          large bag of MARIJUANA and a few jars of K. He throws them into his
          Backpack, zips up the Gym Bag, and puts it back into the closet.
          
          Jimmy exits through the sliding glass doors.
          
          EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jimmy shuts the doors behind him. He stops in his tracks just
          outside the doors, thoughts running through his mind.
          
          INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          WIDE on Jimmy through the doors as he about faces and stares into
          the house. He slides the doors open and re-enters.
          
          He picks up the Gym Bag and carries it to the front of the couch.
          He sets down Gym Bag and drops to his knees, all while noticing that
          Car appears to be staring at him. He unloads the remaining contents
          of the Gym Bag into his Backpack, including a few bags of PILLS, a
          few more jars of K, and two large bags of WHITE POWDER.
          
          He throws one strap of his Backpack over his shoulder and stands in
          front of Car. Jimmy stares at Car.
          
                                                                                29
          EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          WIDE on Jimmy as he throws his Backpack into his trunk, climbs into
          his Piece-of-Shit, and sits, reflecting.
          
          INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- LATER
          
          Jimmy is driving through semi-busy traffic. Music is blaring from
          the radio, and the driver-side window is open, making the noise in
          the cockpit quite loud. Jimmy's left hand is simultaneously wrapped
          around the steering wheel and the DELIVERY LIST, which is hanging
          down over the steering wheel so that he can read it. Jimmy's CELL
          PHONE rings.
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (over the wind and music)
                    Yeah, it's Jimmy!
          
                                 MATT (O.S.)
                         (barely audible)
                    Hey Jimmy, it's Matt. I need some K.
          
          Jimmy turns off the radio and begins rolling up the driver-side
          window.
          
                                  JIMMY
                    Matt?!   Speak up, man, I can barely hear
                    you!
          
          INT. MATT'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          MATT, in his late teens, has a very short buzz-cut. He's wearing an
          old t-shirt and faded cargo-shorts, and he's sitting up on the edge
          of his unmade bed. Matt's bedroom is a shithole, with dirty clothes
          piled everywhere. He's talking into a CORDLESS PHONE, using his
          free hand to rub the back of his neck nervously.
          
                                 MATT
                         (semi-whispering)
                    I need some K, dude. I need it for
                    tonight.
          
          We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt.
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (still rolling up the
                         window)
                    What?!
          
                                 MATT
                         (semi-whispering)
                    Jesus Christ, Jimmy! My folks are home!
                    I need some K, dude!
          
                                                                                30
                                 JIMMY
                    Alright, alright! I got it, man,      got
                    plenty! I'll see you tonight!
          
          Jimmy hangs up and begins to roll down the window. The cell phone
          begins ringing again. Jimmy reverses himself and begins rolling the
          window back up.
          
                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, it's Jimmy!
          
          We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt. Matt is now pacing
          back and forth in his shithole room. His voice is hushed, although
          the sense of urgency in it is obvious. Jimmy's still talking loud,
          as his Piece-of-Shit does not provide a quiet ride.
          
                                 MATT
                    Jimmy! Jesus, man! Listen to me! I need
                    one a' your special deliveries - I won't
                    be around tonight!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Alright, man, when do you need it?!
          
                                 MATT
                    Like, now, dude! For tonight!     I'm taking
                    off!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Matt, you're way out of the way, man!
                    Wait for another delivery.
          
                                 MATT
                    Look, I need it now, man!     Now now now!
                    I'm takin' off!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    What's the rush?!
          
                                 MATT
                         (finally confiding)
                    Look, dude, I'm takin' out this girl - a
                    friend of Setzer's. He said I could bang
                    her easy if I had some K.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Really?!
          
                                 MATT
                    Easy, dude, easy.    Setzer's words - it's
                    in the bag.
          
          Jimmy's eyes get very wide.
          
                                                                                 31
                                 JIMMY
                    Jesus!
          
          Jimmy slams on the breaks and cuts the wheel to the left. Too late.
          Jimmy rocks forward as the stress balls that were sitting on the
          passenger seat fly to the floor.
          
          EXT. TRAFFIC INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit has just rear-ended another CAR of equal value
          parked in front of a STOP SIGN in an otherwise empty intersection.
          The DRIVER of the forward Car stirs.
          
          INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jimmy has his right arm draped over the Pizza Boxes in the passenger
          seat, protecting them from flying forward as a parent would have
          instinctively reached to hold back a child. His Cell Phone starts
          ringing again. He slowly begins to stir.
          
          EXT. TRAFFIC INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS
          
          The driver, DAVE, a large, ripped, soft-spoken juicehead, gets out
          of the forward car holding the back of his neck. He slams the door
          shut with his free hand, pissed, and staggers towards Jimmy's car.
          A twenty-something FEMALE PASSENGER is sitting motionless in the
          passenger seat. Dave glances up and sees Jimmy.
          
                                 DAVE
                    Jimmy?
                         (still dazed, but
                         immediately friendly)
                    Hey, what's up, man?
          
          Jimmy turns off the ringer on his Cell Phone and gets out of his
          vehicle.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Shit, Dave, sorry 'bout that. I was
                    talkin' on the phone. I didn't see the
                    stop sign, I guess.
          
                                 DAVE
                    Don't sweat it.
                         (regarding his Car)
                    I could give a shit about this thing. I
                    was hopin' some rich doctor or lawyer or
                    somethin' hit me.
          
          Jimmy notices the Female Passenger in the passenger seat and walks
          toward her, with Dave following.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Holy shit, man, is she alright?
          
                                                                                  32
          Jimmy and Dave both stand near the passenger side of the car. The
          window is completely open. The Female Passenger lies motionless,
          bleeding noticeably from the forehead.
          
                                 DAVE
                    She'll be alright. You didn't hit us that
                    hard - it's gotta look worse than it is.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    What're you, a fuckin' doctor?    We need ta
                    get her to a hospital.
          
                                 DAVE
                    Fuck that, you'll have all kinds 'a
                    problems if we do that. Cops, insurance
                    and whatnot. You probably got drugs on
                    you...
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Dave, look at her fuckin' head!     She's
                    bleedin' all over the place!
          
                                 DAVE
                    Just give her a minute, she'll snap out of
                    it. She's a stripper, for god-sake.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    That's retarded.
          
          The Female Passenger begins to slowly stir.    It is clear she is out
          of it - still very woozy.
          
                                  DAVE
                    See?   I told ya.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Dave, you're a sick fuck.   I'm calling
                    911. Look at the blood!
          
          Jimmy reaches for his Cell Phone, but Dave again objects.
          
                                 DAVE
                    Put that shit away. I'll take her home
                    and give her some K, she'll be fine.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    She needs a doctor.   What the hell's K
                    gonna do?
          
                                 DAVE
                    Jimmy, listen, she's gonna be fine. A guy
                    like you should be avoidin' that kinda'
                    attention.
          
                                                                 33
                                 JIMMY
                    You should take better care of your girl.
          
          
                                 DAVE
                    Bro, she ain't my girl. She plows through
                    all my drugs, and I fuck her like a goddam
                    whore. She's a whore.
          
                                 FEMALE PASSENGER (O.S.)
                    Fuck you, Dave, you asshole!
          
                                 DAVE
                    See, she's fine.
          
          Dave lights a CIGARETTE.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Holy shit. You're fucked up.
                         (seeing an opportunity)
                    Hey, you need any juice or anythin'?
          
                                 DAVE
                    No, man, I'm good.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    You sure? Look, man, I just got a buncha'
                    stuff. Coke, e, K. I gotta sell it fast,
                    you can sell it to your crackhead friends
                    whenever.
          
                                 DAVE
                    You been placin' bets with Bobby the
                    Bookie again?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    No. I'm just, I'm payin', like, twenty
                    percent on my cards and shit, and it
                    drives me fuckin' nuts, pissin' all my
                    money away.
          
                                 DAVE
                    Sellin' drugs ta pay off the plastic, huh?
          
                                   JIMMY
                    You want it?
          
                                 DAVE
                    Look, I'm definitely interested in a
                    little bit for myself, definitely, but I
                    ain't no dealer like you. Lemme think
                    about it.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Hey, your nose is bleedin'.
          
                                                                                34
          
          Dave reflexively puts a finger to his nostril and examines it for
          blood.
          
                                   DAVE
                    Seriously?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    No, just horsin' around.
          
                                 DAVE
                    Listen, I gotta get going.    Patch her head
                    up and shit.
          
                                   JIMMY
                    Yeah.
                         (regarding Dave's Car)
                    Sorry, man.
          
                                 DAVE
                    Don't even sweat it, man, I told ya.
          
          Jimmy and Dave get in their respective cars and drive off.
          
          EXT. POOL, SWINGS -- DAY
          
          EMILY is seated on a swing off to the side of the gated pool area,
          smoking a CIGARETTE, looking in through the gate at the pool. She's
          wearing an old, yet barely worn, BASEBALL CAP.
          
                                   COREY (O.S.)
                    You smoke?!
          
                                    EMILY
                    Yeah, so?     You do drugs.
          
          Corey enters the frame, grabs the Cigarette and stomps it out, but
          Emily's nonchalant demeanor remains.
          
                                 COREY
                    How would you know?
          
                                 EMILY
                    Everybody knows my brother does drugs.
          
                                 COREY
                    So you heard about that thing that
                    happened?
          
                                  EMILY
                    Yeah.   Everybody knows about that, too.
          
                                 COREY
                    If you think so highly of me, what the
                    hell are you doing here?
          
                                                                               35
          
                                 EMILY
                    I'm just saying. Why'd you try to put
                    everything back in the house?
          
                                 COREY
                    We ran outta of gas. We were right
                    outside his house - what the hell else
                    were we supposed to do? He wasn't
                    supposed to be home for another hour. At
                    least he took it easy on us.
          
                                 EMILY
                         (changing the subject)
                    Here, I brought this.
          
          Emily hands Corey the Baseball Cap.     Corey is caught off-guard.
          
                                   COREY
                    What for?
          
                                 EMILY
                    Dad gave it to you, remember?     You left
                    it. I brought it for you.
          
                                    COREY
                    Keep it.     I don't wear hats.
          
                                 EMILY
                    I don't want it.
          
          Corey has no desire to wear it, so he holds it.
          
                                 COREY
                    You go to see him at all?
          
                                    EMILY
                    In prison?     No, not lately.
          
                                 COREY
                    So what's the problem?     Vincent hitting
                    you?
          
                                   EMILY
                    Vincent?    Vincent's gone.   She's on Victor
                    now.
          
                                 COREY
                    What happened to Vincent?
          
                                 EMILY
                    He found out about Victor.
          
                                                                                 36
                                 PEDRO (O.S.)
                         (to Corey)
                    Vamos, I need the address!     I have a pen
                    in the truck!
          
          Pedro is standing at the gate.
          
                                 COREY
                    So is Victor hitting you or what?
          
                                  EMILY
                    No.
          
                                  COREY
                    What then?
          
                                 EMILY
                    I don't wanna talk about it.     Forget it.
          
                                 PEDRO
                         (to Corey)
                    Hurry up, mehn!
          
                                 EMILY
                    You know he has porno magazines all over
                    his truck.
          
                                  COREY
                    So?
          
          Corey heads toward the gate and spots KEVIN, a young boy of about
          ten, sitting on the MOPED that was leaning up along the interior of
          the pool-area fence.
          
                                 COREY (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Kevin, get off my bike, alright?
          
                                 KEVIN
                    It's a moped.
          
                                 COREY
                    Just lay off it.
          
          Kevin gets off.   Corey continues toward the gate.
          
          EXT. POOL - PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          The driver-side door of a TOW TRUCK is swung wide open, with "ATHENS
          TOWING SERVICE" written on side. Pedro is leaning one hand on the
          rolled down window and his other hand on the roof of the Tow Truck,
          watching Corey, who is leaning over the Tow Truck's hood, writing
          Mr. Carson's address on a piece of PAPER with a PEN.
          
                                  PEDRO
                    Gracias.
          
                                                                               37
          
          Pedro throws the Paper and Pen into the Tow Truck.
          
                                 PEDRO (CONT'D)
                    Oye, don't get mad, but would you be mad
                    if I try to fuck your sister?
          
                                 COREY
                    If you think you can.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Maybe you think you can talk to her for
                    me?
          
                                 COREY
                    Pedro, she's fifteen!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    No way, mehn.
                         (forming breasts with his
                         hands)
                    No con esas tetas.
          
                                 COREY
                    I'll have you sent to jail, man.     I'm
                    serious.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    No way she is fifteen.     She looks way
                    older.
          
                                 COREY
                    She'll look a lot younger on the witness
                    stand, with my mom sitting in the
                    courtroom.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Bueno, tell her I say good-bye.     I call
                    you soon.
          
          Pedro climbs behind the wheel as Corey holds the door open to talk
          to him.
          
                                 COREY
                    So what're you gonna do?
          
                                 PEDRO
                    I'm gonna find Mr. Cocksucker and say,
                    "Look, mehn, let us into our fucking
                    home."
          
          Corey steps aside as Pedro shuts his door and turns the ignition.
          
                                                                                 38
                                 COREY
                    Wait a second... Why are you still
                    driving this thing? I thought you got
                    fired.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Si, si, but I need it. How am I gonna
                    drive without my truck. They fired me,
                    mehn.
          
          Corey watches as Pedro pulls out.
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION -- DAY
          
          ESTABLISHING SHOT on the police station with a number of POLICE CARS
          parked neatly in front. Two middle-age MALE POLICE OFFICERS are
          standing in front of the entrance, talking. Heather and Allison's
          AMBULANCE is parked in the lot across the street, facing the police
          station.
          
          INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          The engine is off. HEATHER is behind the wheel and ALLISON is
          slouched back on the passenger seat, both watching the two Male
          Police Officers standing in front of the building.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    I hate this job.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I should pick up one of them assholes.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Don't you have an appointment with Dr.
                    Cook?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Five-thirty, and I'm not missing it.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Derek probably thinks you're sleeping with
                    your doctor. There's nothing wrong with
                    you.
          
                                 HEATHER
                         (holding the lower
                         portion of her right
                         ribcage)
                    Ally, I have a pain right here that has
                    nothing to do with my head. My dad died
                    of heart disease, and if that asshole
                    taught me anything, it's better to be
                    paranoid than dead.
          
                                                                                   39
          A FEMALE POLICE OFFICER, a prim-and-proper plain-jane 5'5" woman in
          her early twenties, exits the building and walks over to talk with
          the two Male Police Officers.
          
                                  HEATHER (CONT'D)
                    That's her.   Tess.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    You're just guessing.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Ally, I know that's her.     That's his type,
                    too. That little slut.
          
          Both Heather's and Allison's BEEPERS go off.    They both look down at
          their Beepers and sit up in their seats.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Harry's waiting.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Sorry if I snapped.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    You didn't snap.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I mean this morning.
          
                                  ALLISON
                    Oh.   That's okay.
          
          Heather starts the Ambulance and starts to pull out of the lot.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I'm just afraid its gonna be the whole
                    thing all over again with Derek, and then
                    I've got to find some other asshole, and
                    do it all again. I'm sick of the whole
                    cycle.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    So do something different.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I'm trying, but he's fucking it all up.
          
          As they pull out of the lot, the two Male Police Officers head
          toward their Police Cars and the Female Police Officer heads back
          inside the station.
          
          INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          JESSICA is on a PHONE, holding a bookmarked trash NOVEL in her hand.
          PITT is sitting on the couch watching TV.
          
                                                                                 40
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Yeah, where are you?
          
                                 CARLOS' VOICE
                    Right down the street, gettin' some more
                    nachos.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Can you just come back and get me?     Hurry
                    up.
          
          Jessica looks up to see TROY entering the house with AARON behind
          him. TROY is a shaggy, 5'10" pothead slacker in his late teens,
          wearing beat-up jeans, a t-shirt with a faded logo on it, and light
          hair above his lip and on his chin. AARON, a burly mutt, about the
          same age and only slightly shorter, wearing cut-off cargo pants with
          one of the thigh pockets ripped off, a sleeveless shirt and a tattoo
          on his left shoulder. Troy notices Jessica immediately.
          
                                 TROY
                    Holy shit.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Aaron, I don't know how the hell you
                    got...
          
                                 AARON
                         (interrupting)
                    Fucking bitch!
          
          Aaron shoves Troy roughly out of the way as Jessica bolts out of the
          room.
          
                                 PITT
                         (to Jessica)
                    Use the back door, yo!
          
          Jessica runs out the back door and around the front of the house.
          Aaron sees her turn the corner of the house, and he turns around to
          cut her off.
          
                                 AARON
                         (to Pitt)
                    Man, don't be helpin' that bitch!
          
                                 PITT
                    I don't want to see you be hittin' no
                    girl. Just calm your ass down.
          
                                 AARON
                    Fuck you!
          
          Aaron runs out the front door after Jessica.
          
                                                                                 41
                                 TROY
                    He's gonna kill her.
          
          EXT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Aaron is out the front door, yelling at Jessica who is further down
          the street.
          
                                 AARON
                     Where you goin', bitch?!
          
          Jessica runs to Carlos's CAR, opens the door, throws the Novel in
          and jumps in after it. She throws on her seatbelt and rifles
          through her purse, looking for her pepper spray.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Drive!
          
                                 CARLOS
                         (starting the Car)
                    What's the deal?
          
          Aaron, holding a ROCK slightly bigger than his fist, smashes the
          passenger-side window.
          
                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Fucking drive!
          
          Aaron reaches in and grabs Jessica's hair and begins to rip her out
          of the car, cutting his own arm while doing so. Aaron growls, more
          in anger than pain, as he yanks with all his might. Jessica is
          holding onto the inside of the passenger door with one hand, and is
          scratching and clawing at Aaron to get Aaron to release her with her
          other hand. Jessica's seat belt clearly is the only thing keeping
          her in the car. Carlos is pulling away slowly. Aaron releases one
          hand from Jessica's hair and punches at the top of her head.
          
                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    Fuck you!
          
                                 AARON
                    Fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore!
          
          Aaron repeatedly tries to hit Jessica with his free hand as Carlos
          pulls into the street. Aaron runs along with the car. Jessica
          reaches toward Aaron with a closed fist, where she is holding her
          PEPPER SPRAY. She sprays at Aaron but misses. Aaron grabs at her
          fist with his free hand and rips the Pepper Spray from Jessica.
          Jessica screams in pain as Aaron sprays away.
          
                                 AARON (CONT'D)
                    You like that, bitch?! Huh?!
          
                                                                                 42
          
          Carlos swerves violently to the side towards a parked CAR along the
          side of the road. Aaron is plowed along toward the Car, but
          releases Jessica at the last possible second, just avoiding a
          collision with the Car. Carlos was not fooling around.
          
          Aaron watches them tear down the street before he about-faces and
          walks briskly back toward the house, where Troy is standing on the
          front porch watching the action.
          
          INT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jessica is still reeling from the pepper spray.   She can barely
          stammer out her words.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Oh my God, my fucking eyes!
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Jesus, look at my car, Jess!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    That fucking... asshole!
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Now I'm screwed too.
          
          Carlos turns to look through the rear window of his car - all clear.
          
                                 JESSICA
                         (practically sobbing)
                    I'm so sorry.
          
          An otherwise believable apology, except that Carlos knows Jessica
          too well. Jessica does not want to be in this alone. Carlos cuts
          the wheel to the right and tears down a side street.
          
          EXT. LANDLORD'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
          Pedro pulls his TOW TRUCK and parallel parks on the street in front
          of the house.
          
          Pedro gets out of his Tow Truck and walks up to the front door. He
          rings the doorbell. There is no answer, so he rings the doorbell
          again, then knocks on the door. Again no answer, so he bangs on the
          door vigorously. He leans over and peers inside the window. As he
          does so, MR. CARSON opens the front door, apparently having just
          woken up.
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    Pedro? What're you doing here?    Get the
                    hell off my porch.
          
                                                                               43
                                 PEDRO
                    Hey, mehn, let me into my fucking
                    apartment.
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    Either pay me or get off my porch.
          
          Mr. Carson shuts the door. Pedro turns around and eyes the gray
          FORD TAURUS parked behind his Tow Truck. He walks back to his Tow
          Truck and grabs some tools. He begins hitching up the Ford Taurus
          to his Tow Truck.
          
          Mr. Carson parts the curtain behind his front window, eyes wide as
          he watches Pedro. The front door opens, and Mr. Carson comes
          storming out.
          
                                  MR. CARSON (CONT'D)
                    Pedro!   What the hell are you doing?!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    I'm hitching up your car to my tow truck.
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    Let it down right now you psychotic
                    sonuvabitch!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Let me in my fucking apartment, mehn!
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    Pay the damn rent!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    I'm gonna pay, mehn!   I got fired!
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    Bullshit! You never pay rent, and I know
                    you've had a job! I'm sicka' this shit!
                    Put down my car, or I'm callin' the cops
                    to haul your ass outta here!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Listen, don't be a cocksucker.   It's not
                    needed.
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    I'm done with it. Let my car down.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    I need a job, mehn, then I pay you.
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    Margaret wants you out of the house
                    anyway. Now let my car down.
          
                                                                                44
                                 PEDRO
                    You need some balls, mehn!     Why do you let
                    her slap you around?!
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    Nobody slaps nobody around.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Hay, por favor! I come by here to pay
                    rent, I always hear her slapping your ass
                    around.
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    I'm going inside to get the phone. If
                    you're still here when I come back out I'm
                    gonna dial the police with you standing
                    right here next to me.
          
          Mr. Carson proceeds inside. Pedro watches Mr. Carson proceed back
          into the house as he releases the Ford Taurus back down to the
          ground.
          
          EXT. BASEBALL FIELD, PARKING LOT-- DAY
          
          The baseball field is empty. MATT is leaning against the driver-
          side door of his CAR, which is parked all by itself near a dumpster
          at the edge of the lot. JIMMY pulls his PIECE-OF-SHIT up and parks
          next to the driver-side door of Matt's Car.
          
          Jimmy climbs out of his Piece-of-Shit.
          
                                 MATT
                    Dude, what the hell?! I'm ready to go
                    here! Where the hell were you?!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I got into a freakin' accident!
          
          Matt starts walking to meet Jimmy at the rear of the cars.
          
                                 MATT
                    Bullshit, man, fucking bullshit! You make
                    me come all the way out here! I been
                    waitin'!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Look, you're pissin' me off now! Remember
                    who's doin' fuckin' who the favor! I got
                    shit I gotta do!
          
          Matt pulls his WALLET out of his back pocket.
          
                                                                                 45
                                 MATT
                         (about to blow, then
                         controls himself)
                    Fine, fine! Just give it to me.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I didn't want to bring my bag to your
                    house, with your fuckin' parents home.
          
          Jimmy opens his trunk and pulls his BACKPACK out.
          
                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    Where's my Grand Theft Auto?
          
                                 MATT
                    I lent it to Jerry.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    What'd you do that for?    Get it back.
          
                                 MATT
                    He moved down the shore.    This morning.
          
          Rushed, Jimmy blows it off and pulls a jar of K out of his Backpack.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Alright, sixty bucks.
          
                                  MATT
                    What?   Fer one freakin' jar?!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Dude, stop your bitchin' and pay up.      I
                    told you this shit, I told you.
          
                                 MATT
                    You said extra, I thought you meant, like,
                    fifty!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Asshole, fifty is the regular fuckin'
                    price!
          
                                 MATT
                    This is fuckin' extortion! Knowin' I'm
                    meetin' this chick, so you jack up the
                    price!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Look! This is a pain in my ass, comin'
                    way out here, and I said I'd charge you
                    extra. I don't give a shit if its ten
                    over the regular price, or twenty-five
                    over your fuckin' "discount price," but
                    you're payin' sixty bucks for this jar.
          
                                                                               46
          
                                 MATT
                         (weakly)
                    Man, what the hell.
                         (looks in his Wallet)
                    I need some cash for food and drinks, man!
                    I'm takin' this girl out!
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (considering)
                    Gimme fifty even.
          
                                MATT
                    C'mon, man! I need as much cash as I can
                    get! What if she wants to go somewhere?!
                    And gas! Dude, just take forty-five!
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (breaking)
                    Fine, you cheap-ass fuckin' bastard.
          
          Jimmy accepts the Forty-Five Dollars, and gives Matt the jar of K.
          Jimmy is pissed.
          
                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    Here, man, go fuckin' get high.
          
                                 MATT
                         (almost apologetic)
                    See ya.
          
          Jimmy throws his Backpack back in the trunk and slams it shut.
          
          EXT. POOL, CLUBHOUSE -- DAY
          
          COREY is on a PAYPHONE outside the restrooms, talking to PEDRO.
          
                                 PEDRO'S VOICE
                    He said "no," mehn. The cocksucker won't
                    let us back in.
          
          EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Pedro is on a PAYPHONE.   We cut back and forth between Pedro and
          Corey.
          
                                 COREY
                    That's great.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Hey, this isn't my fault, mehn.
          
          A short beat as Corey thinks.
          
                                                                               47
                                   PEDRO (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
          Corey hangs up and puts more coins into the Payphone.   Pete
          approaches, looking for Corey.
          
                                   PETE
                    Corey.
          
          Corey tries to phase out Pete's voice.
          
                                 PETE (CONT'D)
                    The Blandinos just called again.   The
                    broken glass is still there.

                         (hurriedly to Pete)
                    Okay, I'll take care of it.
          
                                 PETE
                         (sarcastic)
                    Don't forget to put gas in it.
          
          Pete exits.

                    Hey.
          
                                 COREY
                    You got any spare cash?
          
          EXT. POOL -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          EMILY is laying back in a lounge chair. Corey enters the pool area
          from clubhouse carrying the BASEBALL CAP. He walks over to his
          MOPED chained to the gate, throws on his Baseball Cap, unlocks his
          Moped, and pushes it through the gate where resident KIDS are
          gathered around a ping pong table. Emily watches as he hops on the
          Moped and throws on his HELMET. KID #1, one of the younger kids at
          the table, spot Corey in the distance.
          
                                    KID #1
                    Corey!     Hey Corey!
          
          Corey looks over as he starts his Moped.
          
                                                                                48

                    Gorski says he can beat you!
          
                                 COREY
                    Maybe he can.
          
                                 KID #1
                    Yeah right! Get over here and whip his
                    ass real quick!
          
          Corey kicks the stand up on his Moped and rides off.
          
                                 KID #1 (CONT'D)
                         (shouting after him)
                    Aw, c'mon! Corey!

          ESTABLISHING SHOT. The small wooden bench on which Heather and
          Allison were sitting earlier is empty.
          
          INT. RESCUE SQUAD, LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          HEATHER and ALLISON are changing back into their civies and putting
          away their EMS gear into their lockers.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Are you comin' with me to register
                    tomorrow?
          
                                 ALLISON
                    I dunno.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Why not?
          
                                 ALLISON
                    My brother spent six thousand on tech
                    courses and he's still painting houses.
          
                                 HEATHER
                         (looking at her watch)
                    I'm gonna be late.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Why don't you just reschedule?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    You know how booked he always is. I don't
                    wanna be referred to that quack Hengis. I
                    don't trust women doctors.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Dr. Hengis is fine. You're the quack.
          
                                                                                49
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Ally, I'm really feeling something. A
                    deep ache, like someone's crushing me.
                    This can't wait.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    You still feel like going out?
          
                                  HEATHER
                    Hell yes.
          
          Heather shuts her locker.
          
          EXT. ROAD -- DAY
          
          JIMMY is driving his PIECE-OF-SHIT with a clear look of anger and
          frustration in his face. The windows are down, but the radio is no
          longer playing.
          
          INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jimmy's CELL PHONE rings.   He answers.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Yeah, its Jimmy.
          
                                 PIZZA POP'S VOICE
                    Hey-a Jimmy! Where are you?! We got two
                    calls from 45 Smith Street wondering where
                    their food is!
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (over the wind noise)
                    I got into an accident!
          
                                 PIZZA POP'S VOICE
                    An accident?! Are you okay, Jimmy?!
          
                                   JIMMY
                    I'm fine!    My car's banged up, but I'm on
                    my way!
          
                                   PIZZA POP'S VOICE
                    Okay!    Drive careful!
          
                                  JIMMY
                    Yeah!
          
          Jimmy hits a button to hang up and shuts the Cell Phone, but the
          cell phone immediately rings again. Jimmy flips the cell phone open
          again. His eyes grow wide as he stares at the caller ID, which
          reads "CAR LEE." Jimmy stares at the Cell Phone as it continues
          ringing and ringing.
          
                                                                                50
          He hits a button and replaces the Cell Phone to his ear.
          
                                   JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
                                   KWON'S VOICE
                    Jimmy?
          
                                   JIMMY
                    Who is this?
          
          INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          KWON, an Asian-American in his early twenties, holding to his ear
          the CORDLESS PHONE that was on the coffee table, is pacing in front
          of CAR, who is still seated on the couch in the exact position we
          saw him last. The GYM BAG that Jimmy emptied earlier is on the
          floor at his feet. We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Kwon.
          
                                 KWON
                    You don't have caller ID?
          
                                   JIMMY
                    I'm driving.    Who is this?
          
                                   KWON
                    Kwon.
          
                                    JIMMY
                    Hey, Kwon.     What's up?   Where are you?
          
                                 KWON
                    I'm on my cousin's phone.
          
                                   JIMMY
                    Where's Car?
          
                                 KWON
                    He's right here. He said you guys were
                    supposed to meet.
          
          Jimmy runs a yellow light that turns red while he's still crossing
          the intersection.
          
                                JIMMY
                    He did? Well, yeah, I stopped by this
                    morning. Nobody was there.
          
                                 KWON
                    You didn't come in?
          
                                    JIMMY
                    No.     Nobody answered the door.
          
                                                                                51
                                 KWON
                    Well, you want to come by now? I'll be
                    here. You can make your pick-up.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Can't do it now. I'm delivering on the
                    other side of town.
          
                                 KWON
                    Deliveries? Jimmy, fuck the pizza.     Stop
                    by and get your shit.
          
                                  JIMMY
                    I can't.   What's the big deal?
          
          Jimmy, very anxious, runs a red light.    A CAR going the other way
          stops and honks.
          
                                 KWON
                    Jimmy, my cousin's dead, and there's a
                    shitload 'a shit missing from our house.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Car?
          
                                 KWON
                    What do you think?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I don't know.
          
          The TRAFFIC in front of Jimmy slows, and Jimmy coasts to a
          standstill at the tail of the traffic and in the middle of a busy
          intersection.
          
                                 KWON
                    I want you to come over here and tell me
                    everything that happened when you stopped
                    by.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Nothing happened, Kwon.   I knocked and no
                    one answered.
          
                                 KWON
                    You didn't ring the doorbell?
          
          Jimmy's light turns yellow while he is still at a standstill in the
          middle of the intersection.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    That's what I meant.
          
                                 KWON
                    And no one answered.
          
                                                                                 52
          
                                    JIMMY
                    No.     No one answered.
          
                                 KWON
                    You left a message on our house phone this
                    morning. Why didn't you call our cells
                    when you got here?
          
          Jimmy's light turns red, and he is still at a standstill in the
          middle of the intersection. A CAR at the head of the cross traffic
          inches up to Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit and honks, but Jimmy does not
          seem to notice.
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (stumped)
                    Why didn't I call.     Good question.
          
                                 KWON
                    What the fuck do I care, you think it's a
                    good question?! Are you fucking kidding
                    me?!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Look, I didn't think of it.    I got a lotta
                    shit on my mind right now.
          
                                 KWON
                    Jimmy, do you have my drugs?
          
                                   JIMMY
                    No.
          
          The cross traffic honking grows louder, even though there is nowhere
          for Jimmy to go.
          
                                    KWON
                    Alright.     If you hear anything, you call
                    me.
          
                                    JIMMY
                    I will.     Sorry about Car.
          
                                 KWON
                    Thanks, Jimmy.
          
          Jimmy hangs up.
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Cars are still honking at Jimmy as he continues to sit at a
          standstill in the intersection.

                         (generally to the other
                         drivers)
                    Fuck off!
          
          Jimmy throws his Piece-of-Shit in reverse, then cuts left, through
          and out of the intersection.
          
          EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- DAY
          
          JIMMY parallel parks his PIECE-OF-SHIT in front of his apartment and
          exits carrying his BACKPACK. He unlocks the door to his apartment,
          opens it, and steps one foot inside.
          
          INT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jimmy slides the Backpack into his apartment. TIGHT on the backpack
          as it slides across the hardwood floor, straight towards the camera,
          to a halt immediately in front of the camera. Jimmy steps back
          outside and shuts the door.
          
          EXT. ROB'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
          COREY is standing in the middle of an unkept lawn, watching ROB,
          about eighteen and wearing Corey's HELMET, ride Corey's MOPED in
          circles around him on the lawn. He's treating the Moped rather
          roughly, pulling wheelies and kicking the tail end out repeatedly.
          Corey is watching impatiently, holding the BASEBALL CAP at his side.
          
          Rob jumps the Moped over the curb into the street, then turns up the
          driveway and pulls up alongside Corey. Rob removes the Helmet.
          
                                 ROB
                    I'll take it.
          
          INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
          AARON returns from the kitchen drinking from a can of SODA. TROY
          and PITT are on the couch, VIDEO GAME CONTROLLERS in their hands,
          waiting for the VIDEO GAME to load. Troy is lighting a CIGARETTE.
          
                                 AARON
                         (to Troy)
                    C'mon, let's go find her.
          
                                 TROY
                    I'm not gonna go scouring the countryside
                    lookin' fer her.
          
                                 AARON
                    Gimme yer keys.
          
                                 PITT
                         (to Troy)
                    Don't give him your keys.
          
                                                                                    54
          
                                 AARON
                         (to Pitt)
                    You want a smack? I am seriously gonna
                    smack yer ass.
          
                                 PITT
                    Don't give me no attitude, just cause you
                    got mushrooms growin' on your balls.
          
                                 AARON
                         (to Troy)
                    Let's go, man.
                         (re Pitt)
                    Fuck this asshole.
          
                                 TROY
                    No, man, I don't wanna see you hittin'
                    Jess neither.
          
          The PHONE on the coffee table rings.     Pitt picks it up.
          
                                 PITT
                    Dominoes.
                         (a beat, then to Aaron)
                    It's her.
          
          Pitt tosses the Phone to Aaron.
          
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- CONTINUOUS
          
          CARLOS has parked his CAR along the side of the street.      JESSICA is
          in the passenger seat on her CELL PHONE.
          
                                 AARON'S VOICE
                    Jess, come back here.
          
                                  JESSICA
                    Yeah right.
          
          INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Aaron is walking into the kitchen, and although he is furious, he is
          keeping his voice down so that Pitt and Troy do not hear. Cut back
          and forth between Aaron in his house and Jessica in Carlos' Car.
          
                                 AARON
                    Jess, I'm serious.      We need to talk about
                    this.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Isn't that what we're doing?
          
                                  AARON
                    Fine!   Who'd you fuck?
          
                                                                   55
          
                                   JESSICA
                    Nobody.
          
                                 AARON
                    Bull-fuckin'-shit! I got bumps on my
                    dick, and I never cheated!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Maybe its just a rash, 'cause I don't have
                    anything.
          
                                 AARON
                    Why don't we go to the doctor and get you
                    checked out?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I can go to the doctor by myself.     And if
                    I have it, I got it from you!
          
                                 AARON
                    You're fuckin' fulla shit!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Whatever. If you come after me again, I'm
                    gonna find someone to kick your ass. I
                    mean it.
          
                                 AARON
                    I believe it, you fuckin' whore! 'Cause
                    it's probably the same dude you been
                    bangin' behind my back!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I never cheated.
          
                                 AARON
                    Tell Carlos I'm gonna kick his ass.
          
          Aaron hangs up.
          
          INT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Back to Jessica and Carlos in Carlos' parked Car.
          
                                 CARLOS
                         (anxious)
                    What's up?
          
                                   JESSICA
                    He's pissed.    Says he's gonna kick our
                    asses.
          
                                   CARLOS
                    Great.    I got a baseball bat in the trunk.
          
                                                                                 56
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Good.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    I gotta go to work in an hour.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Call in sick.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Yeah, maybe. You mean it when you said
                    you were gonna find someone to kick his
                    ass?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Yeah.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Who?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    You don't know him. He graduated before
                    us.
          
          Jessica notices something, turning to look out the broken passenger-
          side window. She's stares, interested.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    He a big dude?
          
                                 JESSICA
                         (still staring out the
                         window)
                    Not really, but he gets into fights all
                    the time, at parties and stuff. And he
                    knows a lot of people.
          
          Through the window, we see that Carlos' Car is parked across the
          street from Car's house, and that a POLICE CAR and a CORONER'S VAN
          are parked in front of it. Kwon is standing with a POLICE OFFICER,
          more distraught than the last time we saw him, answering questions.
          He's oblivious to Jessica and Carlos.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Call him.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I'd rather go over in person.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Why?
          
          Jessica turns back to Carlos.
          
                                                                                 57
                                 JESSICA
                         (not exactly confident)
                    I can be more... persuasive in person.
          
          Jessica punches another number into her Cell Phone.
          
                                 CARLOS
                         (disappointed)
                    Swell.

                                 JESSICA
                    Have you eaten?
          
                                 KATIE'S VOICE
                    I'm starving!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Okay, I'm going to be home in a little
                    bit, okay?
          
                                   KATIE'S VOICE
                    Alright.
          
          Jessica hangs up and throws her Cell Phone on top of the dashboard.
          
                                   JESSICA
                    Drive.

          ESTABLISHING SHOT on the Car pulling back out onto the street as
          Kwon continues talking to the Police Officer in the background.
          
          EXT. LANDLORD'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
          ROB is riding his newly-acquired MOPED, with COREY on the back.
          Corey is holding Rob with one hand, his BASEBALL CAP with the other.
          He drops Corey off in front of Mr. Carson's house.
          
          As Rob pulls a wheelie and exits the frame, Corey walks up to the
          front door of the house. He rings the doorbell, reaching into his
          pocket and pulling out a wad of BILLS as he waits. Mr. Carson opens
          the door.
          
                                                                             58
                                 COREY
                    Hey Mr. Carson. I got the rent.
          
          Mr. Carson opens the screen door, and Corey hands him the Bills.
          Mr. Carson begins counting them.
          
                                 COREY (CONT'D)
                    Can you let us back into our apartment
                    now?
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    This is only one month.   You boys owe
                    three.
          
                                 COREY
                    That's all we have. We'll give you the
                    rest later, as soon as we can.
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    When you get me the rest, I'll let you
                    back in.
          
                                 COREY
                    Mr. Carson, c'mon! This is just
                    temporary. Pedro lost his job.
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    Bullshit. You're always late. You should
                    spend less time trying to rob houses, and
                    more time working.
          
                                 COREY
                    Aren't you supposed to take us to court
                    before you throw us out?
          
                                 MRS. CARSON (O.S.)
                    Holy fuck, Shelby! Shut the goddam door
                    already you stupid bastard! You're
                    letting the cold air out!
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                         (suddenly in a hurry)
                    Tell it to my lawyer.
          
                                 COREY
                    Aw, c'mon! Don't be like that! We're
                    doin' our best! We're gonna be homeless!
          
                                 MRS. CARSON (O.S.)
                    Shut the goddam door!
          
          
                                 MR. CARSON
                    Three months!
          
                                                                                 59
          Mr. Carson slams the door.
          
                                 COREY
                         (banging on the door)
                    C'mon!
          
          Corey stands and stares at the door a moment.   He turns and leaves,
          resigned to a long walk back to the pool.
          
          EXT. DINER, BACK-LOT -- DAY
          
          PEDRO is driving nonchalantly toward the back-lot.     A song is
          playing on the car radio.
          
          WIDE on a parked MUSTANG, a couple empty parking spaces on the
          passenger side of it. Pedro's TOW TRUCK backs up into the frame so
          that it's back end is almost touching the front end of the Mustang.
          
          Pedro climbs out of his Tow Truck, leaving it on, and starts walking
          around to the back of it. Suddenly remembering, he doubles back and
          sticks his head in through the driver-side window, checking the gas
          gage. It's more than 3/4 full.
          
          Satisfied, Pedro proceeds toward the rear of the tow truck and
          hitches the Mustang to the back of it. An older couple pulls into
          the parking lot and parks one car length from the Mustang. OLDER
          MAN and OLDER WOMAN climb out of their CAR. The Older Man has taken
          an interest in what Pedro is doing.
          
                                 OLDER MAN
                    Hey, can I park here?
          
                                 PEDRO
                         (very friendly)
                    Si, si, of course.
                         (motioning toward the
                         Mustang)
                    The transmission is broke.   Transmissions
                    on these cars suck.
          
          Older Woman notices that the front passenger-side tire is flat.
          
                                 OLDER WOMAN
                         (pointing)
                    Oh, and the tire's flat, too.
          
          Pedro steps around to the passenger side of the Mustang, surprised
          to see the FLAT TIRE.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Ah, si, but that's no big deal.   That's
                    fine, believe me.
          
          Older Man and Older Woman begin walking toward the entrance to the
          diner.
          
                                                                               60
          
          
                                   OLDER MAN
                    Good luck.
          
                                   PEDRO
                    Gracias!
          
          As Older Man and Older Woman proceed toward the diner, Pedro opens
          the door to his Tow Truck, and reaches in to hit the control which
          lifts the Mustang.
          
          EXT. DINER -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Through the window we see PATRONS eating. Pedro drives by in his
          Tow Truck with the Mustang hitched to the back.
          
          INT. DR. COOK'S OFFICE, EXAMINING ROOM -- DAY
          
          HEATHER is sitting on the examining table, topless, holding her
          breath as DR. COOK runs a STETHOSCOPE on different areas of her
          back. Heather's BLOUSE and PURSE are lying on the examining table
          beside her.
          
                                   DR. COOK
                    Breathe out.
          
          Heather lets her breath out.
          
                                 DR. COOK (CONT'D)
                    It's official. You're as healthy as you
                    were last week, and last week you were as
                    healthy as an ox.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Are you sure you're using that thing
                    right? I feel this ache
                         (indicating her chest)
                    Right here, like I'm being crushed between
                    two boards.
          
                                 DR. COOK
                    Nobody's crushing you.     Honest. I'm sure.
                    It's all in your head.     I know a couple
                    quacks...
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I don't need a head doctor!
          
                                 DR. COOK
                    I was just kidding there.
          
          Heather reaches into her PURSE and lights a CIGARETTE. Dr. Cook
          sighs - they've had a discussion about Heather's smoking before.
          
                                                                                61
                                 DR. COOK (CONT'D)
                    Heather, if you're going to insist on
                    ignoring my rules, at least put your
                    blouse on before you light up.
          
          Heather hops off the bench and makes a sudden about-face. She is
          gesturing wildly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she is half-
          naked.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Can't I be concerned about my health?!   Is
                    that so outrageous?!
          
          Dr. Cook is clearly uncomfortable conversing with Heather while her
          breasts are exposed.
          
                                 DR. COOK
                    Heather...
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I just don't want to be walking around
                    tomorrow and drop dead because my heart
                    collapses, and so that makes me weird or
                    paranoid...
          
                                 DR. COOK
                    Heather, there's nothing wrong with being
                    concerned about your health. Please put
                    your blouse back on.
          
          Heather grabs her Blouse from the table and puts it back on.
          
                                 DR. COOK (CONT'D)
                    So I'll see you next week then.
          
                                 HEATHER
                         (suddenly friendly again)
                    Okay, yeah, see you next week.
          
          Heather leaves and shuts the door behind her.
          
          EXT. DEREK'S HOUSE -- DAY
          
          The sound of panting can be heard. Two people are having sex.
          There are no words, although the girl regularly lets out high-
          pitched groans, indicative of at least a little pain.
          
          INT. DEREK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          LOW ANGLE MEDIUM on ALLISON bent over the bed, mouth agape. She
          buries her face in the mattress, revealing DEREK thrusting from
          behind. Derek climaxes. Allison pops up from below.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    I'm two pounds heavier I think.
          
                                                                  62
          
          Derek lies back to put his head on the pillow.
          
                                   DEREK
                    Sorry.
          
          Allison lies on top, nestling her head in his chest.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    It hurt. I knew it would hurt, but that
                    was kinda worse than I thought. Does
                    Heather... like it?
          
                                 DEREK
                    She never let's me do it.
          
                                   ALLISON
                    She doesn't?    Why not?
          
                                 DEREK
                    I don't know. She does shave though.    How
                    come you don't shave?
          
                                 ALLISON
                    I don't know. I don't want to.     Do you
                    love her?
          
                                 DEREK
                    I don't know.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    How can you not know?
          
                                 DEREK
                    She's got problems.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    I don't understand you. Why do you even
                    cheat on her with me? She's so pretty.
                    So much prettier than me.
          
                                   DEREK
                    She's   a nutcase. I'll tell you what, I
                    don't   know why you do it. You should have
                    a man   of your own - we say it all the
                    time,   me and Heather.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Yeah, who? That slob you and Heather
                    introduced me to last time?
          
                                 DEREK
                    He outranks me. He's a good guy.
          
                                                                                63
                                 ALLISON
                    Like me, I'm a good girl, and the best I
                    can do is a guy that looks like that?
          
                                   DEREK
                    No.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    You must think so. You tried to set me up
                    with him.
          
                                 DEREK
                    I thought it was a bad match.     It was
                    Heather's idea.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    So she thinks I can't do better.
          
                                 DEREK
                    You know what she thinks better than me.
          
          Allison climbs out of bed, and her mood changes from thoughtful to
          business-like. She begins putting her CLOTHES on.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Let's get dressed, she'll be here.
          
          Derek looks calmly over at the ALARM CLOCK on the nightstand.
          
                                 DEREK
                    Let's let her walk in on us, and look
                    surprised.
          
                                   ALLISON
                    Hurry up.
          
          Allison opens the door and walks out, a little bow-legged.
          
          INT. PIZZA SHOP -- DAY
          
          JIMMY walks through the front door. PIZZA POP spots him immediately
          from behind the counter. The PHONE rings, but Pizza Pop ignores it.
          
                                   PIZZA POP
                    Hey-a Jimmy.    Where you been?
          
                                    JIMMY
                    Around.     Deliverin'.
          
                                 PIZZA POP
                    Hurry - sit down Anna eat something.       We
                    got more deliveries for you.
          
          Jimmy walks around the counter, grabs a couple of SLICES and throws
          them in the oven. Pizza Pop picks up the Phone.
          
                                                                                 64

                         (into the Phone)
                    Poppy's!
          
          INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- DAY
          
          The door bursts open and JESSICA enters, followed by CARLOS.   KATIE
          is watching TV.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Did your parents call?
          
                                   KATIE
                    Nope!    Where were you?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Out with Carlos.
          
          Jessica disappears into the kitchen.
          
                                 KATIE
                    The VCR is broken.
          
          INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jessica tosses a FROZEN DINNER into the microwave.
          
                                 JESSICA

                                   CARLOS (O.S.)
                    I guess.

          Jessica places two Frozen Dinners, complete with a FORK apiece, down
          on the coffee table. Katie grabs her Fork.
          
                                 KATIE
                    Are we going to have TV dinners all
                    weekend?
          
                                    JESSICA
                    No.     I promise. You want some milk?
          
                                 KATIE
                    Can I have ice-tea?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Of course.
                         (to Carlos)
                    Can you make her some ice-tea?
          
                                                                                  65
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Aren't you gonna eat?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I'm gonna take a shower.
          
          Carlos is disappointed that Jessica wants to fix herself up to see
          Carter. Katie is already eating.

          We're behind JESSICA as she removes her SHORTS and her SHIRT.
          
          INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Katie now has a glass of ICE-TEA in front of her.    Carlos is behind
          the TV and VCR, fiddling with the wires.
          
                                 KATIE
                    Are you Jessica's new boyfriend?
          
                                 CARLOS
                    No.
          
                                 KATIE
                    I wish you were. I don't like Aaron.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Neither do I.
          
                                 KATIE
                    Don't you like Jessica?
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Kind of, I guess. She's nice.

          INT. DEREK'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- DAY
          
          HEATHER, ALLISON and DEREK are seated at the table with CHINESE
          TAKE-OUT in front of them. A NEWSPAPER opened to the classifieds
          lies near Derek's place at the table. Derek and Allison are chowing
          down while Heather sits watching Derek. Derek is using a FORK.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Take a look at that paper. There's at
                    least a half dozen apartments I circled
                    that would be perfect.
          
          Derek continues chowing down, not responding.   Derek's CELL PHONE
          rings, and he answers it.
          
                                                                                 66
          
                                 DEREK
                    Yeah?
                         (beat)
                    You're joking.
                         (beat)
                    Alright, ten minutes.
          
          Derek hangs up, stands up, and puts the Cell Phone in his pocket.
          
                                 HEATHER
                         (guessing at the purpose
                         of the call, completely
                         frustrated)
                    Great.
          
                                 DEREK
                    That was Tess. Said I had to come back
                    in.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Are you fucking Tess?
          
                                 DEREK
                    What? No. Look, I gotta go. I'll see
                    you at Carter's when I get off.
          
          Derek takes another bite, gets up and heads for the door.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I'm not dropping this!
          
                                 DEREK
                    Since when do you drop anything?
          
          Derek exits as Heather's eyes hang on him.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    You see that? He practically said yes.
          
          Heather gets up and walks in the direction of Derek's bedroom.
          Allison instinctively rises and follows.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    What're you doing?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I'm gonna look through his shit.
          
          INT. DEREK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Heather walks over to the bed and starts rifling through the mess on
          the nightstand. She picks up a tube of ASTROGLIDE and nonchalantly
          throws it on the bed.
          
                                                                                67
                                 ALLISON
                    You're finally flipping, I think.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    You're a lot of help, Ally.        Really.
                    Thanks.
          
          Heather opens the nightstand drawer and immediately pulls out a box
          of CONDOMS, showing them to Allison.
          
                                    HEATHER (CONT'D)
                    See?!   See?!
          
                                  ALLISON
                    So what.   Condoms.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Ally, I'm on the fucking pill. He hasn't
                    used condoms with me for weeks.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    So maybe those are left-overs.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Ally, these are not left-overs.        He never
                    used regular condoms with me.
          
                                 ALLISON
                         (caught off guard)
                    Why not?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Because if he did, he took two fucking
                    days to come. I always made him wear
                    ultra-thin, ribbed, anything but this
                    shit.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    He took too long for you?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Ally, I'd be done, and I'd have to lie
                    there like another hour 'till he got off.
                    I couldn't fucking stand it. Why the hell
                    do you think I started on the pill, Ally?
                    Me. Putting that hormone shit in my body.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    How would I know?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Well that's why.
                         (remembering)
                    Anyway, that's neither here nor fucking
                    there. That asshole is using
          
                                                                                 68
                         (re Condoms)
                    these things, and not on me.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Just call him and ask him.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    No, no, fuck that. We're going to go to
                    the party, have some fun. When he's all
                    good and drunk, you're going to ask him
                    when I'm not around.
          
                                   ALLISON
                    Yeah right.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Ally, I'm serious. If he's drunk and
                    having fun, and you just work it in on him
                    real casual, he may slip. He'll never
                    admit shit to me.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    He won't to me either.
          
                                  HEATHER
                    Ally!   Just fucking try it!
          
                                 ALLISON
                    I don't wanna spy on him for you!
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Ally, look, he's cheating on me, I know it
                    in my heart, but I want him to admit it,
                    alright? Before I fucking flush what's
                    left of this shithole relationship down
                    the toilet, I want him to admit it.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Fine, I'll see.
          
                                   HEATHER
                    Fine.
          
          EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- DAY
          
          Jimmy is sitting in an alley behind the pizza shop, finishing a COKE
          with plenty of ice. Kwon emerges from the back door of the pizza
          shop. Jimmy sees Kwon, and hides his displeasure as best he can.
          
                                   KWON
                    Hey, Jimmy.
          
                                   JIMMY
                    What's up.

                                 KWON
                    I'm just looking for my stuff.   Let's take
                    a ride.
          
                                  JIMMY
                    Where?
          
                                  KWON
                    Your place.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Can't do it 'til after work.
          
                                 KWON
                    You're sitting here on your ass!
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I gotta eat. I'm going back to work now.
                    My boss needs me - I'm the only delivery
                    guy.
          
                                 KWON
                    Is that your piece-of-shit out front?
          
                                  JIMMY
                    Yeah.
          
                                 KWON
                    Let's check that out.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I told you, I ain't got your shit.
          
                                KWON
                    Hey! Until I find the drugs, everyone is
                    a suspect!
          
          Jimmy's Cell Phone rings.
          
                                 KWON (CONT'D)
                         (regarding the call)
                    Fuck that. Let's look in your car.
          
          Jimmy reaches into his pocket, but instead of a cell phone, he pulls
          out his car KEYS, which he tosses at Kwon. Kwon storms off, and
          Jimmy grabs his CELL PHONE out of his other pocket and answers it.
          
                                 JIMMY

                    You want the juice?
          
                                 DAVE

                    other stuff, I been thinkin' 'bout your

                    you out. Buy a lot a' your shit all at
                    once.
          
                                  JIMMY
                    The juice?
          
                                DAVE
                    No, no. I'm talkin' 'bout the coke an'
                    shit. I might know somebody.
          
                                   JIMMY
                           (lowering his voice in
                           case Kwon comes back)
                    Who?
          
                                 DAVE
                    This spear-chucker from Manville. Sold me
                    some fake D-ball once. I tied his
                    brother's dog to my front bumper and we
                    talked it out. Turned out to be an okay
                    guy. I gave him a call and he's
                    definitely lookin'.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    For how much?
          
          Dave, having walked into the living room, takes a seat on the couch
          next to the FEMALE PASSENGER we saw earlier, her head now bandaged.
          She is snorting a line of COKE off of the coffee table.
          
                                 DAVE
                    Well, he's pretty small time, but he's
                    itchin' to move up a few notches.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    He's got money?
          
                                 DAVE
                    He talks so much shit it's hard to tell.
                    You need to talk to him.
          
          Jimmy considers, then pulls a PEN and his DELIVERY LIST out of his
          pocket. He turns the Delivery List over to write on the back.
          
                                                                                  71
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Gimme his number, man.
          
          EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- CONTINUOUS
          
          The doors of Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT are flung wide open.    Kwon is
          hauling Jimmy's spare TIRE out of the trunk.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Kwon, what the hell are you doing?
          
          Kwon dumps the Tire on the ground and, seeing nowhere to hide
          anything, stands straight up and looks at Jimmy.
          
                                 KWON
                    When you off work?
          
                                    JIMMY
                    Don't know.     Maybe nine or nine-thirty.
          
          Kwon tosses Jimmy his KEYS back, jumps in his BMW, and takes off.
          Jimmy becomes increasingly resolved as he watches him leave. Jimmy
          pulls out his Delivery List and his Cell Phone. He turns the
          Delivery List over to the number on the back and punches it into his
          Cell Phone. He paces as he talks.
          
                                    SINJIN'S VOICE
                    Hello?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Is this Sinjin?
          
                                 SINJIN'S VOICE
                    Yeah, who's this?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    This is Jimmy. Juicehead Dave's friend.
          
                                     SINJIN'S VOICE
                    Yeah, I know.
          
          EXT. POOL -- DAY
          
          PETE is on a ride-on LAWN MOWER.    He spots COREY walking toward the
          gate to the pool area.
          
                                     PETE
                             (over the noise of the
                             lawn mower)
                    Hey!
          
          Pete shuts off the blade and steers the Lawn Mower over to Corey,
          stopping just short of him.
          
                                                                                 72
                                 PETE (CONT'D)
                    Where the hell have you been!
          
                                 COREY
                    I know, Pete. I'm real real sorry. I got
                    things going on, you wouldn't believe it.
                    My life is crazy right now.
          
                                 PETE
                    You have a job here, Corey!     You can't
                    just go taking off!
          
                                COREY
                    I know. I'm sorry. I mean, I know, the
                    Blandino's. I'm going now.
          
                                 PETE
                    I already took care of that!
                         (hopping off the Lawn
                         Mower)
                    Just finish up what I'm doing, then take
                    care of the fertilizer spill in the
                    utility room.
          
                                 COREY
                    Okay, alright, I will.
          
          Corey hops on the Lawn Mower, turns on the blade, and picks up where
          Pete left off. Pete shakes his head in disgust and heads into the
          garage.
          
          Corey is wide-eyed as he turns the corner entering the last leg of
          his first lawn lap and spots PEDRO approaching in his TOW TRUCK with
          the MUSTANG hitched to the back of it. He shuts the blade off and
          steers the Lawn Mower over to the tow truck. Pedro parks as Corey
          hops off the Lawn Mower.
          
                                 COREY (CONT'D)
                    You got your job back?
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Que?
          
                                 COREY
                         (pointing at the Mustang)
                    What the hell is that?!
          
                                 PEDRO
                         (looking back at the
                         Mustang)
                    Ah, el Mustang?
          
                                 COREY
                    Yeah!
          
                                                                                73
                                 PEDRO
                    That's our rent, mehn.    We stole it.
          
                                 COREY
                    Hey, uh-uh, no way!    I didn't steal
                    anything!
          
                                   PEDRO
                    Don't worry.    We're going to sell it,
                    mehn.
          
                                 COREY
                    Seriously, are you out of your mind?      To
                    who?!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    This guy I know.
          
                                 COREY
                    How do ya know he'll even buy it?
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Don't worry. He likes Mustangs, mehn.
                    Vamos, I got a place for us to stay.
          
                                 COREY
                    Jesus, Pedro! I told you I wanna stay out
                    of trouble! I mean, this is big trouble!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    No jodas, don't worry about it. I stole
                    it. But we need rent, mehn. I lost my
                    job.
          
          Corey looks over at Emily, laying down in a lounge chair.
          
                                 PEDRO (CONT'D)
                    So you in or out?
          
                                   COREY
                    Hey, Emily!    Get your stuff!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Asi me gusta, now you're being smart.
          
                                 EMILY
                    Where are we going?!
          
                                 COREY
                    Just get in the truck!
          
          Corey heads toward the garage. Emily looks over at Pedro sitting in
          the Tow Truck. Pedro sticks his hand up to say hello to Emily,
          awkward. She ignores him and begins gathering her stuff.
          
                                                                                 74
          INT. POOL, GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Pete is sitting on the floor repairing a WEED-WACKER.
          
                                 PETE
                    You done already?
          
          Corey hops off the Lawn Mower.
          
                                 COREY
                    I got an emergency, Pete. I'll come in
                    early tomorrow and finish.
          
          He runs out the door.
          
                                  PETE
                    Hey!
          
                                 COREY
                         (running out the door)
                    Sorry!
          
          The door slams shut behind Corey.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- EVENING
          
          Music is audible from inside the house. Carter's house is an old
          dilapidated house, with a tiny front yard and huge back yard
          surrounded by trees, with rusty old cars scattered throughout. Just
          about everybody enters the house from the back. BERUBI, in his
          early twenties, very large and athletic, wearing mesh shorts and a
          beat-up t-shirt, and a MALE FRIEND, of a similar age with an average
          build and dressed lazily in khakis and an un-tucked shirt, are
          unloading a KEG from the bed of a PICK-UP TRUCK onto a dolly.
          HEATHER and ALLISON are standing on the back porch. Heather is
          holding a bottle of VODKA in her hand. Heather bangs on the screen
          door. CARTER approaches. In his early twenties, Carter is tough,
          with a modestly athletic build and a gruff voice, and possessing an
          appetite for greasy food and cheap beer. He's a guy's guy.
          
                                  CARTER
                    What's up.
          
          Heather tries to open the screen door - it's stuck.
          
                                  ALLISON
                    Hey Carter.
          
          Carter slams the handle from the inside - the door opens.
          
                                  CARTER
                    What's up.
          
                                                                                 75
                                 HEATHER
                         (busting Carter's chops
                         with a mocking tone)
                    What's up.
          
          As Heather passes, Carter mockingly shows Heather the back of his
          hand as if to smack her. Heather and Allison pass, and Carter holds
          the door open with his foot as he looks for something to prop it
          open.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
          
          From the inside we can see that Carter's house is the same house
          that Jerry moved out of this morning - Jerry was Carter's housemate.
          Heather and Allison walk in as if they know their way around.
          Carter spots a large clay LAWN DWARF on the back porch. He reaches
          for it.
          
                                 CARTER
                    Stay outta my room.
          
          Heather holds out the vodka.
          
                                  HEATHER
                    Wanna shot?
          
                                  CARTER
                    Later.   I wanna see how crazy it gets.
          
                                  HEATHER
                    Skirt.
          
          Carter props the screen door open with the Lawn Dwarf.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- EVENING
          
          PEDRO, EMILY and COREY, now wearing the BASEBALL CAP, are parked in
          the TOW TRUCK across the street from the front of Carter's house.
          Porno magazines lie on the dashboard and the floor. BERUBI, walking
          along the side of the house from the back yard, spots Pedro behind
          the wheel. He approaches.
          
                                 EMILY
                         (to Corey, disapproving)
                    I can't believe you're doing this.
          
                                 COREY
                         (aside to Pedro)
                    Ya think it's a good idea we leave it out
                    here on the street like this?
          
                                 PEDRO
                         (aside to Corey)
                    Forget about that, mehn.
                         (referring to Berubi)
          
                                                                           76
                    I'll talk to Berubi. I know what to say
                    to this guy. Don't worry.
          
                                 BERUBI
                    Hey, Pedro, what's up with the Mustang?
          
          Berubi motions to the MUSTANG hitched to the back of it.
          
                                   PEDRO
                    Que?    Ah, el Mustang?
          
          Pedro starts to climb out of the Tow Truck.
          
                                   BERUBI
                    Yeah.
          
                                   PEDRO
                    Nada.    I'm doing a favor for a friend.
          
                                 BERUBI
                    So you're driving around with his car
                    hitched to your tow truck?
          
          Pedro shuts the door to his Tow Truck and pulls up his shorts.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Bueno, he's a good friend.
          
                                   BERUBI
                    Sounds good.    Come on an' grab a beer.
          
                                 PEDRO
                         (to Berubi)
                    Hey, listen, can I sleep on your couch?
          
                                 BERUBI
                    Kimmock's got couch.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Come on, mehn, we're in trouble here.      We
                    got thrown out of our home.
          
                                 BERUBI
                    You got evicted?
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Si. I went out to get a gallon of milk
                    for my dog, I come back, my keys don't
                    work, and the cocksucker put an eviction
                    notice on the door. He didn't even tell
                    us! Now my milk's spoiling in my truck,
                    Pancho's probably pissing all over the
                    place, I'm fucked.
          
                                                                                 77
                                 BERUBI
                    Hey, listen, if you want, you can crash in
                    Jerry's room. He moved out.
          
                                   PEDRO
                    He did?
          
                                 BERUBI
                    Don't park there. Park in back.
          
                                    PEDRO
                    Si, si.     No problem, mehn.
          
                                 BERUBI
                         (to Corey)
                    What's up, Becker.
          
          Corey sticks his hand up to say hello.
          
          INT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Carlos's CAR is parked in street in front of Carter's house, just
          down the street from where Pedro has parked, but on the opposite
          side of the street and facing in the opposite direction. Through
          the windshield, we see Berubi head back toward the house as Pedro
          glances at Jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank-top,
          before climbing back into the Tow Truck and pulling back out onto
          the road. Carlos has noticed Pedro, but Jessica, silent as she
          stares at the house, has not.
          
          Finally, Carlos speaks up.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Did you know he was having a party?
          
          Jessica grabs the rear view mirror and aims it toward herself.   She
          begins fixing her hair in the mirror.
          
          She pulls her LIPSTICK out of her PURSE and begins to apply it as
          Carlos watches. She puts her Lipstick away and stares at Carter's
          house another moment. She checks to see that her SUNGLASSES are
          still hanging on the front of her shirt.
          
                                   JESSICA
                    Let's go.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jessica climbs out of the car and shuts the door. Carlos follows
          suit. They move around the side of the house toward the back porch.
          Jessica stops in her tracks and turns to face Carlos.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Wait here a second and let me talk to him.
          
                                                                                  78
          Without waiting for a response, Jessica turns around and climbs onto
          the back porch, walking its length toward Carter, who is kneeling
          with his back to us as he puts a TAP on the KEG. Carlos stands
          watching, not sure what to do.
          
                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    What're you doing?
          
          Carter turns around, and seems disappointed to see her.
          
                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    You need a hand?
          
                                 CARTER
                    I'm done.
          
          Carter climbs to his feet and heads toward the back door, shaking
          off his hands, passing right by Jessica. Jessica pulls her
          Sunglasses from her shirt.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Carter, I brought your sunglasses back.
          
          Carter turns and grabs the Sunglasses.
          
                                 CARTER
                    Those were Jerry's anyway.
          
          Carter heads into the house.    Jessica follows Carter, and we follow
          Jessica.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
          
                                JESSICA
                    Oh. You didn't tell me that.     Is he
                    pissed?
          
                                 CARTER
                    Who gives a shit? He moved out.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Carter, I gotta talk to you for a sec.
          
                                 CARTER
                    I gotta wash my hands.
          
          Carter is just not interested in talking with Jessica, even if he
          didn't have other things on his mind. Carter enters bathroom, but
          Jessica follows persistently.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Carter turns on the sink and washes his hands.
          
                                                                      79
                                 JESSICA
                    I got a problem.
          
                                  CARTER
                    Yeah.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    It's Aaron, that asshole.   He's pissed at
                    me.
          
                                 CARTER
                    So what am I, a goddam marriage counselor?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    No, but Aaron hit me, and he's gonna do it
                    again.
          
                                  CARTER
                    He hit you?
          
          Jessica sees that Carter has finally shown some interest.
          
                                  JESSICA
                    Yes.
          
                                 CARTER
                    Like, he slapped you?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    No, he punched me. With his fist, a bunch
                    'a times.
          
                                   CARTER
                    Why?    What'd you do?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I didn't do shit.
          
                                 CARTER
                    Look, I ain't gonna sit here all night.
                    Tell me what happened. None 'a your
                    bullshit.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Aaron thinks I cheated on him.
          
          This strikes Carter.
          
                                 CARTER
                    Why's he think that?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    It doesn't matter.
          
                                                                                80
                                 CARTER
                    Fine.
          
          Carter starts to walk out, but Jessica stops him.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Alright, alright. He caught something -
                    he got a rash or something. He says I
                    gave it to him.
          
                                 CARTER
                    He's got a rash?! Are you fuckin' kiddin'
                    me?! What the hell'd he catch?! Fuckin'
                    herpes?!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Carter!
          
          Carter notices that the door to the bathroom is still open.
          Although music is blasting outside, and it is unlikely that anyone
          could hear their conversation, Carter closes the door and locks it.
          
                                 CARTER
                    What the hell'd you give him?!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Nothing! He's fulla shit!    I did not
                    cheat on him!
          
                                  CARTER
                    Fuckin' A!   You slept with me, like, three
                    weeks ago!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    That was the only time, that once, and
                    there's no way he knows.
          
                                 CARTER
                    And you have something?!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    No! Are you fucking listening to me?!
                    And you wore a condom anyway! What the
                    fuck do you care!
          
                                 CARTER
                    Whatever, Jess, what-the-fuck-ever.      And
                    I'm sure I'm the only one.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Look, don't even get into the cheating
                    thing, 'cause you're seein' Rachel still.
                    Don't call me the slut.
          
                                                                                81
                                 CARTER
                    Look, I'm not gettin' into it with you.
                    I'm through with that bullshit.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Fine. Just, I need your help with Aaron.
                    Just help me this one last time, that's
                    it.
          
                                 CARTER
                    He's probably gonna be here tonight,
                    Aaron.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    You're kidding. You barely even know who
                    he is!
          
                                 CARTER
                    No, but I know Troy real good. He said
                    he'd be bringin' him. I ain't got nothin'
                    against Aaron, so I said "what the hell."
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Look, can you just kick his ass for me?
                    Please?
          
                                 CARTER
                    Shit, Jess, I don't wanna be fightin' no
                    friend 'a Troy's. Can't you just work
                    this shit out?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Carter, he hit me! And sprayed me with
                    pepper spray!
          
                                 CARTER
                    What the hell.
          
          Carter contemplates, and Jessica realizes that the best thing to do
          is keep silent and let Carter's good side take over.
          
                                 CARTER (CONT'D)
                    Look, if he tries anything tonight, I'll
                    do something.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    What'll you do?
          
                                 CARTER
                    Whadda you mean what'll I do?!
                         (facetious)
                    I'm gonna dance with him! Fuckin' I'll
                    beat his ass! I don't wanna, but if he
                    shows up tonight and makes like he's gonna
                    hit you, I'll beat his ass.
          
                                                                              82
          
                                 JESSICA
                    What if he doesn't come?
          
                                 CARTER
                    Troy said he was bringin' him. If he
                    doesn't, call him or somethin'. But I'm
                    not a fuckin' bounty hunter whose gonna
                    chase Aaron across the goddam country.
          
          Jessica is not completely satisfied, but Carter has decided what
          he's going to do, and that's that.
          
                                 CARTER (CONT'D)
                    Alright?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Alright, fine.
          
                                 CARTER
                    You're welcome.
          
          Carter exits, leaving the door open, but Jessica doesn't follow.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT
          
          JIMMY has parked his PIECE-OF-SHIT in the rear of the back yard
          behind all of the other CARS that have pulled in. He climbs out,
          slides his CHINESE STRESS BALLS into his pocket, and walks toward
          the house, his BACKPACK strapped over both shoulders like a
          schoolboy.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Jimmy steps through the open screen door into the kitchen.
          
                                 HEATHER (O.S.)
                    Hey, there he is! Jimmy!
          
          HEATHER and ALLISON are playing CARDS at the kitchen table with a
          male PARTYGOER. They jump up from the table and approach Jimmy.
          
          Jimmy pulls three small bags of MARIJUANA out of his BACKPACK.
          Allison pulls out some BILLS.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Thirty bucks.
          
                                 ALLISON
                         (counting Bills)
                    I only got ten.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I don't believe this shit.
          
                                                                                 83
                                    ALLISON
                            (finishing counting)
                    Nine.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    You got nine! Jesus Christ!      You knew
                    what you asked for!
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Jimmy, relax. My God.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    No, this is fuckin' ridiculous. What'd
                    you call me for? I ain't runnin' a goddam
                    soup kitchen here.
          
                                 HEATHER
                         (mock seductive)
                    Can't you just take care of us for
                    tonight?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Yes, for thirty bucks.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Here then, take nine for one.
          
                                   JIMMY
                    It's ten.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    You know what? You need to get laid,
                    Jimmy. Maybe you'd relax a little.
          
                                    JIMMY
                    Fine.     Enjoy your night.
          
          Jimmy as he stuffs the Marijuana back in his Backpack and heads into
          the hallway.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Well I'm not going to drop to my knees for
                    a lousy dimebag, so fuck him.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- NIGHT
          
          The door is shut.    JESSICA is talking on her CELL PHONE.
          
                                 JESSICA
                         (trying to muster a sweet
                         voice)
                    What are you doing?
          
                                   KATIE'S VOICE
                    Watching TV.
          
                                                                                 84
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Did your parents call?
          
                                  KATIE'S VOICE
                    Yeah.   I told them you were in the shower.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Okay... good. Thanks.     Are you okay?
          
                                   KATIE'S VOICE
                    Oh, hold on!    This is my favorite part!
          
          A cartoon becomes audible through Jessica's Cell Phone - KATIE has
          put her phone up to the TV. Jessica listens impatiently.
          
                                 KATIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    Can you hear it?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Yeah, I can hear it.
                         (hurriedly)
                    Katie?
          
          But Katie has already put her phone up to the TV again. Jessica
          waits, turning to face the door, wondering what's going on the other
          side of it.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          PEDRO and EMILY grab CUPS off the rusted washing machine that sits
          on the back porch. Corey takes notice of a ping pong table set up
          in the back yard, where BARNES is playing PING PONG PLAYER 1.
          Barnes is skinny but attractive, and has an even more attractive
          BARNES' GIRLFRIEND watching him play, along with PING PONG PLAYER 2
          and various PARTYGOERS.
          
                                 COREY
                         (turning to grab a Cup
                         for himself)
                    I don't know about leaving the car out
                    there in the open like that. You think we
                    should, like, hide it somewhere?
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Coño ya! Don't take this the wrong way,
                    mehn, but you're like a girl. Bitch,
                    bitch, bitch.
          
          Pedro begins dispensing beer from the KEG.
          
                                 COREY
                    Somebody could see it out there!
          
                                                                              85
                                  PEDRO
                    Si, si.   Does your pussy hurt?
          
                                 COREY
                    I'm serious, Pedro!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Who's gonna see it out there by the woods?
          
                                 EMILY
                    Everybody who reads tomorrow's paper.
          
                                 COREY
                    Shut up Emily.
          
                                 EMILY
                    No, you shut up! Do you know how
                    embarrassing you are?!
          
                                 COREY
                    Look, it was bad luck as usual.    So what?
          
                                 EMILY
                    The car ran out of gas in the driveway!
          
                                 COREY
                    The gage was busted!
          
                                 EMILY
                    Everybody at school makes fun of me!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    And it was way down the block anyway.
          
                                 EMILY
                         (to Corey)
                    And then you try to put everything back!
                    I mean, God, how stupid can you be?!
          
                                 COREY
                    Just shut up, alright?! 'Cause you don't
                    know shit about anything!
          
                                 EMILY
                    The Herald had a picture of the owner
                    laughing at you!
          
          Corey drops his BEER and moves in aggressively, grabbing Emily by
          the wrists.
          
                                 COREY
                    Listen, I'm sick of your shit!
          
                                                                                 86
                                 EMILY
                         (struggling to break
                         free)
                    Get off me! You fucking loser!
          
          Emily falls on her ass.
          
                                 COREY
                    No wonder Victor tried to fuck you.
          
          Emily stands up, turns around and heads toward the back door leading
          into the kitchen, storming past a TEENAGE BOY and TEENAGE GIRL
          passionately kissing each other against a tree in the back yard. We
          hang on the couple as Emily walks out of frame. As the boy works
          his way down to her neck, the girl's eyes open for a moment and
          catch someone watching her.
          
          JIMMY is standing in the kitchen in front of the door looking out
          onto the back porch, staring at the couple making out, momentarily
          transfixed. Jimmy's hand is in his pocket, turning his CHINESE
          STRESS BALLS over and over and over. The girl closes her eyes
          again, and Jimmy is forgotten, the moment lost. Jimmy is alone
          again, still, as usual.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jimmy scans the cramped kitchen. Partygoers are talking, laughing,
          carrying on, making out in the way that Partygoers will. Jimmy's
          gaze wanders mechanically to anther part of the kitchen falls upon
          the entrance to the living room. The terribly familiar figure,
          BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, stands tall, proud, talking to several
          Partygoers, the light behind him adding a regal air to his menacing
          frame - a transcendent silhouette for a hellish vision. Bobby
          towers easily over his peers. In his powerful hands he holds a tiny
          notepad on which he scribbles as his clients eagerly place their
          bets.
          
          RJ, a young African-American early-twenty-something, easily six feet
          tall, built like a powerlifter, his worn-out t-shirt doing little to
          hide his powerful frame, appears behind Jimmy.
          
                                 RJ
                    You're Jimmy?
          
          Jimmy turns around to face RJ.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    You're Sinjin?
          
                                RJ
                    RJ. Sinjin said you'd be wearin' a
                    bookbag. They're back here.
          
                                                                                 87
          JESSICA moves past RJ and Jimmy toward the back door. As RJ about-
          faces to lead Jimmy out of the kitchen and deeper into the house, we
          follow Jessica outside.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jessica sees CARLOS standing against a post on the back porch
          drinking his BEER. He is surrounded by several PARTYGOERS, but
          isn't talking to any of them.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Hey.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Where you been?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Talking to Carter.

                    Is he gonna help?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    He said he would.
          
          Carlos pulls a pint of WHISKEY out of his back pocket.
          
                                  CARLOS
                    Look.   Wanna shot?
          
          Jessica accepts the Whiskey and takes a long pull. She holds onto
          the Whiskey without saying anything, and Carlos does not object.
          She begins to take in the sights and sounds of the party, and
          notices COREY leaning against a rusty old washing machine near the
          KEG as PEDRO hands him another BEER.
          
          Jessica's POV as Corey spots her standing next to Carlos. He
          continues to stare at Jessica, clearly taken by the sight of her,
          his eyes locking onto hers. The desperation of their individual
          struggles is lost for a moment.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    You want me to talk to her?
          
          The moment quickly passes as Corey turns his attention back to
          Pedro.
          
                                 COREY
                    No.
          
                                PEDRO
                    Si. So let's go fix the tire on the
                    Mustang.
          
                                                                               88
          Corey attention is again drawn to the ping pong game, and Jessica
          takes note.
          
                                 CARLOS
                         (to Jessica)
                    You wanna play?
          
          Carlos motions toward the large kitchen window.   Jessica turns to
          look through it.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jessica and Carlos are staring through the window at the CARD game
          taking place at the kitchen table. HEATHER and ALLISON are back at
          it with the male PARTYGOER they were playing with earlier, as well
          as CARD PLAYER, who has recently joined them. Heather is smoking a
          CIGARETTE. Card Player is dealing a round of asshole. All are
          visibly drunk.
          
                                 HEATHER
                         (examining her Cards)
                    What's dickhead doing? I knew he was
                    lying.
          
          Jessica turns toward the steps leading out onto the back yard, and
          Carlos follows. Heather and Card Player each place one card face-
          down on the table, exchanging one for the other.
          
                                 HEATHER (CONT'D)
                         (to Card Player)
                    This is your best card?
          
                                 CARD PLAYER
                    I ain't happy about it.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Shut up and drink, asshole.
                         (to Allison)
                    I should call him.
          
          Card Player obeys and drinks.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    He said he'll be here.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    He's probably got that Tess on all fours,
                    fucking the shit out of her like the skank
                    she is.
                         (thinking about it)
                    No, you're right, fuck him.
                         (throwing three fours
                         down on the table face-
                         up)
                    Drink. Fucking everyone drink.
          
                                                                                 89
          
          All obey Heather.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          We recognize the room as Jerry's old bedroom, empty except for a bed
          stripped of it's sheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a
          small TV on top of it, and a few posters and scraps of trash that
          have been left behind. JIMMY and RJ are looking across the room at
          SINJIN, a young African-American male about RJ's age, with an
          average build, sharply dressed in a button-down, and sport coat.
          Sinjin has his back to Jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty
          old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his
          stylish threads. LOUIE, an overweight, slobbish Caucasian male a
          few years older than Sinjin, sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that
          might creak even more than Sinjin's pogo stick - in Louie's lap
          rests a BOWLING BALL BAG. Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie, Jimmy
          fondles his WATER BOTTLE nervously. He turns around to watch RJ
          closing the door behind them.
          
                                 LOUIE
                    Sinjin!
          
          Sinjin spins on the Pogo Stick and spots RJ and Jimmy standing at
          the entrance. Sinjin loses his balance and places a foot on the
          ground. He steps off the Pogo Stick and composes himself after his
          exhaustive venture.
          
                                 SINJIN
                    Mr. Pizzaman! What's up?
                         (referring to Jimmy's
                         BACKPACK)
                    Got any calzones in there?
          
          Sinjin tosses the Pogo Stick aside.
          
                                 SINJIN (CONT'D)
                         (re the Pogo Stick)
                    It's harder than it looks.
          
          Sinjin turns the GARBAGE CAN over and sits on it while motioning to
          the bed.
          
                                 SINJIN (CONT'D)
                         (comfortably, to Jimmy)
                    Sit down, man, sit down.
          
          RJ walks over to lock the door as Jimmy inches closer into the room.
          
                                 RJ
                    Yo, door don't lock.
          
                                                                                 90
                                 SINJIN
                    Well you got to stand your big
                    muthafuckin' ass outside then, 'cause
                    ain't nobody comin' in here.
          
          Everybody looks at RJ.
          
                                 RJ
                    I don't give a shit.
          
          RJ steps out and shuts the door behind him.
          
                                    SINJIN
                    Alright.     Jimmy, sit down, sit down.
          
          Jimmy is clearly uncomfortable at the sight of these two.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I like to stand usually.
          
                                SINJIN
                    Alright. I'm Sinjin.      That legless waste
                    is Louie.
          
                                 LOUIE
                    I got legs little Massey muthafucka.
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (to Sinjin)
                    I thought it was gonna be just me an' you.
          
                                 SINJIN
                    It is. Don't be worryin' Louie - he's
                    just here to have a good time.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT
          
          EMILY is standing on the front steps, wondering whether to continue
          outside or head back inside. She's completely out of place here
          among the older crowd. FEMALE PARTYGOER 1 and a PARTYGOER appear
          behind her in the doorway behind her.
          
                                   FEMALE PARTYGOER 1
                    Excuse me.
          
          Emily politely moves down to the bottom of the stairs and steps
          aside. She watches as Female Partygoer 1 and the Partygoer pass by
          her into the front yard.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT
          
          COREY and PEDRO climb off the back porch toward the ping pong table.
          BARNES and PING PONG PLAYER 1 are just finishing a point, which
          Barnes takes easily, as PING PONG PLAYER 2 waits his turn. Barnes
          
                                                                                 91
          is skinny but attractive, and has an even more attractive BARNES'
          GIRLFRIEND watching him play.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    What the hell are you doing?     We got shit
                    to do mehn, important shit.
          
          Ping Pong Player 1 steps back and notes Corey approaching.
          
                                  PING PONG PLAYER 1
                    Corey!   Hey, come beat this asshole!
          
                                 BARNES
                    Hey, nineteen-ten, let's go.
          
                                 PING PONG PLAYER 1
                    Screw it, you won again. Play Corey.
          
                                  BARNES
                    C'mon.   Becker can't beat me.
          
                                 PING PONG PLAYER 1
                         (to Barnes' Girlfriend,
                         handing Corey his paddle)
                    Watch this.
          
          Corey steps to the table opposite Barnes, confident, but
          unenthusiastic. Corey is not playing for the fun of it - somewhere
          deep down Corey wants to remind himself that he's good at something.
          
          Barnes tosses the PING PONG BALL to Corey.
          
                                 BARNES
                    You serve, Becker.
          
          Corey's first serve is wicked - fast and spinning wildly.    Barnes
          has no chance.
          
                                 BARNES' GIRLFRIEND
                    Not too good, baby.
          
          Pedro stands alongside and watches silently, pensive, his mind
          distraught over their larger dilemma.
          
                                 COREY
                    Go find Mitch.
          
          Pedro leaves obediently.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT
          
          JESSICA takes another pull from the WHISKEY.    CARLOS is watches
          attentively.
          
                                                                                92
                                 CARLOS
                    Take it easy. You got to go back and
                    watch Katie.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Don't remind me. Please.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    You signed up for it.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    It seemed like a good idea then! Give
                    some crappy advice every once in a while.
                    I didn't think it'd be this constant
                    torture, always wanting to do something,
                    go somewhere. I'm so sick of it.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Some big sister.
          
          Jessica takes another drink and looks toward the ping pong table,
          where Corey is manhandling Barnes, as Ping Pong Player 1, Ping Pong
          Player 2, Barnes' Girlfriend and various Partygoers look on.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
          
          JIMMY walks in from living room looking for Bobby. He continues on
          toward the back door leading out onto the back porch.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, CARTER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
          
          A dense gathering of PARTYGOERS is packed tight within the confines
          of Carter's room, rather small despite being the largest bedroom in
          the house. The collection of Partygoers are watching with religious
          fervor the basketball game playing from the modest TV in the room.
          CARTER, BERUBI, AARON and TROY are among the crowd. All those
          gathered here have an interest in the game, but none as much as
          BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, who stands back against the far wall though
          the nobody in the congregation dares venture into his sightline of
          the television. Partygoers yell in unison at various events
          displayed on the screen. The door opens, and Pedro peeks into the
          room.
          
                                 BERUBI
                    Shut the door!
          
          Pedro shuts the door.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          HEATHER and ALLISON are sitting on a couch facing each other, very
          drunk and extremely happy. The coffee table in front of them is
          filled with plastic CUPS and LIQUOR BOTTLES, many of which are
          empty.
          
                                                                                 93
                                  ALLISON
                    Hey!   Fuck... you! I would never!
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Alright, alright! You little slut! I got
                    one for you!
                         (pointing to someone off
                         camera)
                    Right over there in front of the door!
          
          Looking down the hallway outside Jerry's bedroom we see RJ standing
          against the door. He does not notice the girls looking at him from
          the living room.
          
                                 ALLISON
                         (thoughtfully)
                    Well, he's got a nice body. He's a little
                    scary looking ... he scares me.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    You like it, too, you little slut!
          
                                    ALLISON
                    Whatever!     You're the slut!
          
                                 HEATHER
                    No!  No! Alright, okay, yeah!    Maybe!
                         (grabbing a bottle of
                         VODKA and a Cup)
                    Bring him a drink!
          
          Allison grabs for the Vodka, but Heather does not let go.
          
                                 HEATHER (CONT'D)
                         (motherly tone)
                    No, Ally, this one is for me. You take
                    that handsome boy one of these other...
                         (picking up and putting
                         down various empty Liquor
                         Bottles before finally
                         grabbing a bottle of
                         TEQUILA with a bit left)
                    ... take him this!
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Do we have any yogurt left?
          
                                   HEATHER
                    I think so.
          
          Heather takes another hit of Vodka.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, SIDE YARD -- NIGHT
          
          JIMMY has his CELL PHONE to his ear, waiting for voicemail, anxious.
          
                                                                                 94
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Bobby, where the hell are you? I gotta
                    talk to you. Call me back right away.
          
          Jimmy hangs up and takes a moment to think about his options.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT
          
          COREY and BARNES are continue to play as PING PONG PLAYER 1, PING
          PONG PLAYER 2, BARNES' GIRLFRIEND and various PARTYGOERS continue to
          watch. In the background, JESSICA paces back and forth as CARLOS
          sits on the ground indian-style watching the Partygoers on the back
          porch. Carlos takes a shot of WHISKEY.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT
          
          EMILY stands against the garage door, keeping to herself.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          ALLISON has her head back on the couch as HEATHER lights a
          CIGARETTE. MITCH approaches the ladies with a BEER in his hand.
          Mitch is a staunch thirty-something mechanic with a beer-gut,
          dressed in Levis overalls, and wearing a backwards baseball cap and
          a beard that together hide much of his head.
          
                                 MITCH
                         (primarily to Heather)
                    Hey girls, what're you drinking?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Vodka.
          
                                 MITCH
                    What're you mixing it with?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Vodka.
          
                                 MITCH
                    Really? A little girl like you. You
                    think I might get you to share a little of
                    that?
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I don't know. There's not much left.
          
                                 MITCH
                    If you do something nice for me, I might
                    do something nice for you.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I'm not that kind of girl.
          
                                                                               95
                                 MITCH
                    No?
                         (regarding Allison)
                    How about your friend here?
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Oh, now you want to talk to me?
          
          While Mitch is searching for an answer, a familiar voice cuts over
          the background noise.
          
                                  PEDRO (O.S.)
                    Mitch!   There you are!
          
          PEDRO is approaching from the kitchen carrying a nearly-full BEER.
          Mitch seems a bit disappointed to see him.
          
                                 MITCH
                    Hey.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    We're outside by the woods. We got the
                    Mustang, mehn. It's beautiful.
          
                                 MITCH
                    Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    I feel nauseous.
          
                                 MITCH
                         (to Heather and Allison,
                         regarding Pedro)
                    This is Pedro. We worked together 'til
                    last week.
          
                                 PEDRO
                         (to Mitch)
                    Vamos, these girls aren't interested in
                    you.
          
                                 MITCH
                         (dumbfounded)
                    Pedro... what the fuck...
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Come on, mehn. Come check out the
                    Mustang.
          
          Pedro leaves and Mitch follows.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Oh shit, I think I'm gonna be sick.
          
                                                                                96
          Allison plops down on all fours, and begins vomiting violently.
          Heather kneels down next to Allison and pulls her hair back so it
          doesn't get hit by the vomit.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    That's nasty.
          
          Allison has a few more convulsions.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Fuck you.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Wanna wash your mouth out?
          
          Allison sits up, fixes her hair, then grabs the VODKA from Heather.
          Allison takes a mouthful, rinses, and spits. Allison then takes a
          drink.
          
                                 HEATHER (CONT'D)
                    My God, Ally.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          PEDRO and MITCH make their way into the back yard towards the ping
          pong table. PING PONG PLAYER 1, PING PONG PLAYER 2, BARNES'
          GIRLFRIEND and various PARTYGOERS are gathered around COREY and
          BARNES. Corey functions mechanically - his mind is not on the game.
          Barnes is openly frustrated as Corey finishes him off.
          
                                 BARNES
                    One more.
          
                                 PING PONG PLAYER 2
                         (reaching for Barnes'
                         RACKET)
                    Let someone else play, Barnes.
          
                                 BARNES
                         (to Ping Pong Player 2)
                    You guys suck - he'll be at the table all
                    night.
          
                                 PING PONG PLAYER 1
                    So let him beat someone else.
          
          Corey notices Mitch standing next to Pedro.
          
                                 COREY
                    You're Mitch?
          
                                 MITCH
                    Nice ta meet ya.
          
                                                                                 97
                                 COREY
                         (tossing his RACKET to
                         other side the table in
                         front of Ping Pong Player
                         2)
                    Follow me.
          
          Corey heads toward the Mustang, and Pedro and Mitch follow.
          
                                 PING PONG PLAYER 2
                         (wanting to play Corey)
                    Where you going Becker?
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, CARTER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
          
          PARTYGOERS yell in unison at various events displayed on the screen.
          JIMMY is off to the side of the room talking to BOBBY.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    You know I don't get involved with that
                    shit. You sell your drugs and pay what
                    you owe.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    That's what I'm doing! Bob, just listen
                    to me! I'm selling, but it's Sinjin.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    Sayeed's little brother?
          
                                JIMMY
                    Yes. And Louie and RJ.     Fucking three
                    guys.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    One of 'em's a cripple.    Don't make such a
                    big deal.
          
          
                                 JIMMY
                    A cripple 'cause he got shot!     All I want
                    you to do is just sit there!
          
                                 BOBBY
                    Fuckin' sit there and what?     Pull my
                    fuckin' cock...
          
                                 JIMMY
                         (interrupting)
                    And nothin'! Goddamit fuckin' Bob, I'll
                    handle everything. Everything. You just
                    sit your big fuckin' ass there, it'll be
                    enough. They won't fuck with you, bein'
                    in prison and shit.
          
                                                                               98
                                 BOBBY
                    Jimmy, I ain't in a mood to help you right
                    now. I really ain't. You're wreckin' my
                    livelihood. Soon no one pays me. And I
                    fuckin' help you? You're a thorn in my
                    balls.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Look Bobby, alright, I told 'em I had a
                    partner, that's you. You're gonna help me
                    now or you're not. And if you don't, I'm
                    a little fucked.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    What the hell's the matter with you? What
                    the fuck is going on in your head? You
                    comin' to me, knowin' I'm pissed at you,
                    and what for.
          
          Jimmy is losing it, his grip on reality.   He's drowning, grasping
          for anything that floats.
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Jesus, Bobby, I'll owe you. Alright?
                    I'll owe you. Just help me out here.
                    Help me.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT
          
          EMILY is standing with her back to the garage door talking to MALE
          PARTYGOER 1, an average size boy about Corey's age.
          
                                 MALE PARTYGOER 1
                    How come I haven't seen you before?    Did
                    you go to Athens?
          
                                 EMILY
                    I still go there. I'm a freshman.
          
                                 MALE PARTYGOER 1
                    Really? I graduated last year.    You know
                    anyone my year?
          
                                  EMILY
                    My brother.   Corey.   Becker.
          
                                 MALE PARTYGOER 1
                    Oh yeah, I know Becker. He dropped out
                    our senior year, though. He's your bro?
          
                                 EMILY
                    Unfortunately.

                    Yeah, he's kind of a loser.
          
                                                                                 99
          
                                 EMILY
                         (defending her brother)
                    So what are you?
          
          Changing the subject, Male Partygoer 1 pulls a couple of white
          TABLETS out of his pocket.
          
                                 MALE PARTYGOER 1
                    Ever try this?
          
                                 EMILY
                    Yeah...
          
          Male Partygoer 1 hands a Tablet to Emily, but she waits to see how
          Male Partygoer 1 take it, which he does by biting it in half and
          chasing it with his DRINK. Emily takes Male Partygoer 1's Drink and
          does the same.
          
          INT. DEREK'S POLICE CAR -- NIGHT
          
          DEREK is traveling on a busy road, with the sirens of his Police Car
          activated. CARS are pulling over to let him pass, but it is taking
          some time. He pulls out his CELL PHONE and punches in some numbers.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
          
          The room is crowded with PARTYGOERS. The CORDLESS PHONE is ringing,
          and DRUNK PARTYGOER answers it, clearly drunk. We cut back and
          forth between Derek and Drunk Partygoer.
          
                                 DRUNK PARTYGOER
                         (yelling above the noise)
                    Who is this?!
          
                                 DEREK
                    A friend 'a Carter's.
          
          
                                 DRUNK PARTYGOER
                    Oh, yeah, Carter! He's here!      Somewhere!
          
                                 DEREK
                    Tell him the cops are coming. There's
                    been several noise complaints.
          
                                 DRUNK PARTYGOER
                    What?!
          
                                 DEREK
                    The cops are coming!     Tell Carter!
          
                                DRUNK PARTYGOER
                    Oh yeah! Okay, I got it! Cops are
                    comin'! Tell Carter! Who is this?!
          
                                                                              100
          
                                 DEREK
                    A friend 'a Carter's!
          
                                 DRUNK PARTYGOER
                    Oh yeah, you already said that!
          
          Drunk Partygoer hangs up and turns over to a couple of other
          Partygoers.
          
                                 DRUNK PARTYGOER (CONT'D)
                         (to Partygoers)
                    Cops are comin'! I'm tellin' Carter.
          
          The other Partygoers are not impressed - they continue to sit and
          drink. Drunk Partygoer loses focus and rejoins them.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT
          
          COREY and MITCH barter over the Mustang, though Mitch seems more
          interested in his BEER than the car. PEDRO is putting the last
          touches on putting on the NEW TIRE. He picks the FLAT TIRE up and
          tosses it in the trunk.
          
                                 COREY
                    It's a good car.
          
                                 MITCH
                    It's alright. I'd have to ask Jeremy.
                    What do you want for it?
          
                                 COREY
                    Make an offer.
          
                                 MITCH
                    Twelve hundred.
          
                                 COREY
                    Twelve hundred! That's nothing!
          
                                 MITCH
                    Look, there's a lotta shit that Jeremy's
                    gotta do with it. It's not like he can
                    just switch the fuckin' plates and it's a
                    go.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Coño, we got thrown outta our apartment!
                    We need more money!
          
                                 MITCH
                    Steal some more cars.   I'll see what I can
                    do.
          
          Mitch polishes off his Beer and holds the empty cup up.
          
                                                                                  101
          
                                 MITCH (CONT'D)
                    You want another?
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT
          
          AARON and TROY step out onto the back porch and spot JESSICA and
          CARLOS. Upon seeing them, Carlos stands straight up.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Aaron's here.
          
          Jessica, still pacing, stops in her tracks and turns around beside
          Carlos. It's too late to gracefully exit, so Carlos stands there
          frozen. Jessica does not seem afraid.
          
          Aaron and Troy approach.    It's clear Troy doesn't really want to be
          there.
          
                                 AARON
                         (to Carlos)
                    Hey guy.
          
                                   CARLOS
                    Hey.
          
                                 AARON
                    You like talking to my girl?
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Aaron, I didn't mean nothin'.
          
                                    AARON
                    No?     Just friends?
          
                                   CARLOS
                    Yeah.
          
                                 AARON
                    What's the matter, don't like her that
                    way?
          
          Carlos painfully does not answer. Jessica, unfazed, takes another
          hit of WHISKEY. Jessica is confident because of the booze and
          because of Carter's promise. Jessica and Aaron begin arguing in
          calm "I'm above this" mannerisms.
          
                                 AARON (CONT'D)
                         (to Carlos)
                    Go 'head, take her home. Fuck 'er brains
                    out. She'll give you a little surprise.
          
          Carlos simply stands there, ashamed of his inability to act.
          
                                                                                102
                                 JESSICA
                    Fuck you, I'm clean. You're the cheatin'
                    asshole with bumps on your cock.
          
                                 AARON
                         (to Troy)
                    Hold this.
          
          Aaron hands his beer to Troy and then grabs the Whiskey Jessica is
          holding. Jessica flinches as if afraid Aaron would hit her.
          
                                 AARON (CONT'D)
                    Better wipe this off good. You never
                    know.
          
          Aaron uses his shirt to vigorously rub the mouth of the bottle
          before taking a long pull. The Whiskey is almost gone. Jessica
          grabs back the Whiskey, wipes it off as Aaron did, and polishes it
          off.
          
                                 AARON (CONT'D)
                    You're good at that. You ready yet to go
                    bang some dude? Maybe Carlos here?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Fuck you. I'm going to get Carter, and
                    he's gonna kick your ass.
          
                                 AARON
                    Carter ain't gonna kick shit.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    We'll see, right?
          
          Jessica moves to leave, but Aaron grabs her arm.
          
                                 AARON
                    Hold on a minute ...
          
          Jessica smashes the bottle over Aaron's head, knocking Aaron to the
          floor in a daze.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    That's for the pepper spray, asshole!
          
          The PARTYGOERS in the back yard are now fixed on Jessica and Aaron.
          CARTER runs over, holding his CIGAR and a BEER. BERUBI is behind
          Carter, eager for a fight.
          
                                 CARTER
                    What's goin' on?
          
                                 TROY
                    She smashed a whiskey bottle over his
                    head.
          
                                                                                103
          
                                 JESSICA
                    He grabbed me! I'm not gonna sit and wait
                    until he hits me again! He can just keep
                    his fuckin' hands off me!
          
                                 CARTER
                    He grabbed her?
          
          Troy shrugs his shoulders.
          
                                  TROY
                    I guess so.   It wasn't a big deal.
          
                                 AARON
                         (recovering, to Jessica)
                    You're dead.
          
                                  JESSICA
                    See?
          
                                 CARTER
                    Jess, you hit him with a bottle?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Before he fucking hit me!
          
                                 AARON
                         (to Carter)
                    Look, I ain't got no problem with you.
          
                                 CARTER
                    Fine. You touch her, and I promised her
                    I'd beat the livin' piss outta you. I'll
                    do it. Lay off.
          
          Aaron sits up against a tree, his hands to his head. Carter starts
          to leave. Carlos feels even more ashamed that Carter stepped in and
          did something that Carlos did not have the courage to do himself.
          
                                 BERUBI
                         (to Aaron)
                    You're lucky.
          
          Jessica grabs Carter by the shirt.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Carter, what the hell?!    You said you were
                    gonna kick his ass!
          
                                 CARTER
                    I said I would step in if he hit you, and
                    he's not gonna hit you.
          
                                                                                     104
                                 JESSICA
                    This is fuckin' bullshit!
          
          Jessica winds up and stomps Aaron in the groin.    Aaron growls in
          pain and doubles over.
          
                                 TROY
                         (in awe of Jessica's
                         ferociousness)
                    Woe, dude.
          
                                 CARTER
                         (to Jessica)
                    Jessica! What the fuck are you doing?!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    If you're not man enough to do what you
                    said, I will!
          
                                 CARTER
                    Jess, I'm not gettin' into this! I'm
                    sicka' this bullshit with you! You bring
                    this shit on yourself!
                         (to Aaron)
                    Don't touch her.
          
          Carter leaves, followed by Berubi.    Jessica watches them leave.    She
          turns down to Aaron.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    You know what? I don't need Carter.
                    What're you gonna do, tough guy?
          
                                 AARON
                         (still recovering)
                    Why don't you give me a minute and see?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Fuck you, you had your minute.
          
          Jessica storms toward Carlos' CAR, and Carlos follows.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
          
          ALLISON is lying on her back on the couch with her head in HEATHER's
          lap. Heather is stroking Allison's hair.
          
          They're both obliterated and just stuttering away.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I'm all talk. I can't cheat on Derek. I
                    love Derek. It's just that he makes me so
                    mad. And that makes me a psycho. Every
                    time a girl loses her temper, she's a
          
                                                                          105
                    fucking psycho.   Can't I be upset without
                    being a psycho?   Can't I just be mad?
          
                                 ALLISON
                    It's just every time you find a woman near
                    Derek, you go absolutely nuts.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Let's not use the word nuts, alright?
          
                                 ALLISON
                    You know what I mean.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Yeah, well, don't say nuts.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Alright, you are mighty, mighty... not
                    very nice when another girl is near your
                    boyfriend.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Don't say nuts, don't say psycho, don't-
          
                                 ALLISON
                         (interrupting)
                    I don't say those things.
          
                                  HEATHER
                    Yes you do!   Yes you do!
          
                                 ALLISON
                    What I meant, I don't mean them. I meant
                    that I don't mean them. That I don't mean
                    to say them.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Well, what do you mean?
          
          
                                 ALLISON
                    I don't know. I mean, you get so angry,
                    it's a little scary.
          
          Allison sits up on the couch. Heather sits up directly facing
          Allison, her hands on Allison's lap.
          
                                 ALLISON (CONT'D)
                    I get scared when you get all angry. You
                    get so mad sometimes, you start doing
                    things, saying things to hurt people.
                    Around you.
          
                                                                                106
                                 HEATHER
                         (starting to cry)
                    Oh, I don't mean to! I'd never say
                    anything to hurt you, Ally!
          
                                 ALLISON
                         (also starting to cry)
                    I know. Deep down, I know.      But you get
                    so angry...
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I'm so sorry! Oh, you're right! I am a
                    psycho! A rotten-bitch-psycho! I scare
                    you - Ally - who would never hurt anyone
                    or, or anything!
          
                                 ALLISON
                    It's alright, I know you don't mean it!
          
          Heather hugs Allison, who hugs back.    Both are bawling as they
          embrace.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    I don't mean it! You're my best friend!
                    My sister! I love you so much!
          
                                 ALLISON
                    No, maybe you shouldn't.     Maybe I don't
                    deserve it!
          
                                 HEATHER
                    You deserve it! You're so perfect!
          
                                 ALLISON
                    Don't say that! I'm not, I'm not!
          
                                   HEATHER
                    Yes you are!
          
          WIDE on Heather and Allison. The noise of the party drowns out
          their conversation. Allison is whispering forcefully into Heather's
          ear. Heather is listening, but cannot hear. We see her lips form
          the word "what?" Allison continues whispering, and Heather's face
          becomes furious. She pushes Allison back.
          
                                 HEATHER (CONT'D)
                    You fucking slut!
          
          Heather shoves Allison hard off the couch. As Allison stumbles
          roughly and attempts to recover, PARTYGOERS, mostly guys, gather
          around, cheering wildly. Heather kicks furiously at Allison, who is
          on all fours employing the turtle defense. We catch a glimpse of
          Allison's face - she is in utter panic. Heather's foot catches
          Allison square in the face, knocking her limp.
          
                                                                                 107
          Most of the crowd has stopped cheering. Heather continues to kick
          at Allison's limp body, and two SKINNY GUYS pull Heather away.
          Heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff, while everyone is
          tending to Allison.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, HALLWAY -- MOMENT'S LATER
          
          HEATHER, visibly psychotic, and still very drunk, is making a
          beeline straight for RJ, who shows no sign of noticing Heather until
          she is directly in front of him.
          
                                 HEATHER
                         (pointing to Berubi's
                         bedroom)
                    Wanna take me in there and fuck my brains
                    out?
          
                                 RJ
                    Sure, I don't give a shit.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Fucking great, let's go.
          
          Heather heads towards Berubi's bedroom, and RJ follows, passing
          JIMMY and BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES. Jimmy looks back at RJ as he
          passes.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Jimmy reenters the room he retreated from earlier, with Bobby in
          tow. The room is empty.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    What the fuck Jimmy?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Just hold on.
          
          Jimmy steps further into the room and stands pensive as Bobby takes
          a seat. Bobby lights up a CIGARETTE.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    I can't figure you Jimmy.
          
                                 SINJIN
                         (O.S.)
                    Where the fuck is RJ?
          
          The door bursts open again with a violent thrash, and LOUIE fires
          into view on his WHEELCHAIR with SINJIN pushing from behind.
          
                                 LOUIE
                    Take it easy you stupid motherfucker!
          
                                                                                108
          Sinjin kicks the door shut with the back of his foot and wheels
          Louie into the room. Louie is holding a half-full bottle of JACK
          DANIELS in his hand, the BOWLING BALL BAG still in his lap.
          
                                 SINJIN
                    This your partner?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    Where you been?
          
                                 SINJIN
                    Just gettin' a drink, Jimmy.     You took
                    long enough.
          
          Sinjin wheels Louie in a haphazard, indirect arc somehow closing on
          the center of the room. The doorknob rattles.
          
                                 SINJIN (CONT'D)
                         (to Louie)
                    Thought that shit didn't lock.
          
          Sinjin is staring at the door, but Louie is pre-occuppied.
          
                                 LOUIE
                         (to Bobby)
                    You're Buggerin' Bobby Bales.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    Excuse me you cripple motherfucker?
          
                                 LOUIE
                    Buggerin' Bobby Bales.     Sayeed knows you.
          
                                 BOBBY
                    Call me that again.
          
          Louie takes a strong pull from the bottle of Jack.
          
                                 SINJIN
                    Louie, shut the fuck up.     Let's just do
                    this.
          
                                 LOUIE
                    Call you what again?     What everyone calls
                    you?
          
                                  BOBBY
                    Yeah.   Call me that.
          
                                 LOUIE
                    Buggerin' Bobby Bales.
          
          Bobby stands, tosses his Cigarette aside, and marches toward Louie.
          Sinjin knowingly looses his grip on the Wheelchair and steps back.
          
                                                                                  109
                                 SINJIN
                    Bobby, let's relax now.   Louie may be a
                    fool...
          
          Bobby grabs Louie by the collar and throws him from the Wheelchair.
          Louis lands heavily on his crippled frame, dazed, the Bowling Ball
          Bag dribbling onto the floor near Sinjin. Bobby grabs the
          Wheelchair in both hands and begins smashing it against the wall and
          into the floor.
          
          As Jimmy and Sinjin watch, dumbfounded, the large clay LAWN DWARF we
          saw earlier bursts trough the window and lands in the center of the
          room. Everyone stops to stare at the Lawn Dwarf, including Bobby.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT
          
          JESSICA storms through the yard toward Carlos' CAR.   CARLOS is right
          behind.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Where'd we park?
          
                                  CARLOS
                    Over here.
          
          Carlos begins walking over to his CAR, and Jessica walks alongside.
          Jessica is clearly drunk. Passing by a now high EMILY backed up
          against a tree staring off into nowhere as MALE PARTYGOER 1 kisses
          her neck, they arrive at Carlos' Car. Carlos walks over to the
          driver-side door, but Jessica walks immediately over to the trunk.
          
                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing? Get in.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Open the trunk.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Jess, let's get out of here.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I want your bat.
          
                                  CARLOS
                    Screw that.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I'm gonna finish what I started.   I'm
                    gonna knock his teeth out.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Let's just go home.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Carlos, open the trunk!
          
                                                                                110
          
          Carlos grudgingly obeys. He walks back to the trunk and inserts his
          KEY, then lifts up. Jessica reaches in and grabs a wooden baseball
          BAT. She shuts the trunk and looks over to the house.
          
          AARON walks through Carter's front door and steps onto the porch,
          TROY right behind. Aaron is holding a bag of FROZEN VEGETABLES to
          his head in the area where Jessica hit him with the whiskey bottle.
          He spots Carlos and Jessica, and walks deliberately toward them.
          
                                 CARLOS
                    Get in the car.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I'm staying, and so are you, so shut up.
          
          Carlos swallows his pride, too yellow to push the point. Aaron
          moves toward Jessica very quickly, but a look at the bat Jessica is
          holding makes Aaron keep his distance.
          
                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    What's the matter? Aren't you gonna put
                    me in my place?
          
                                 AARON
                         (calming down)
                    Why don't you put that down.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Because I'm gonna use it to bash your head
                    in.
          
                                 AARON
                    You really want to do that?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    You really wanna make me?
          
                                 AARON
                    You're gonna do what you're gonna do, like
                    always.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    What the hell's that supposed to mean?
          
                                 AARON
                    Let me show you something.     Can I show
                    you?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    What?
          
                                                                                 111
                                 AARON
                         (inching closer to
                         Jessica and beginning to
                         loosen his pants)
                    I just wanna show you something.
          
          Jessica stands back and holds the bat in a cocked position.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    No more 'a this shit, Aaron. Just stand
                    back there. I'll bash you with this, I
                    swear.
          
          Aaron drops the Frozen Vegetables to the ground and loosens his
          pants.
          
                                 AARON
                    Look, just hold on. I wanna show you
                    this. I got it a little while ago, for
                    your birthday.
          
          Aaron lowers the left side of his pants to reveal a scarring TATTOO,
          which is placed above and to the side of his groin. Jessica looks
          closer. Troy, uncomfortable and not wanting to be there, lights up
          another CIGARETTE.
          
                                 AARON (CONT'D)
                    Can you see it?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    What the hell is it?
          
                                 AARON
                    It's J. H. C. I got it for your birthday.
          
                                 JESSICA
                         (not knowing what to say)
                    Bullshit.
          
                                 AARON
                    Will you come closer and look?   Troy, tell
                    her.
          
                                 TROY
                         (to Jessica)
                    It's your initials.    I told him it was
                    stupid.
          
          Jessica lowers the Bat and walks cautiously up to Aaron. She
          attempts to read the Tattoo, which is difficult because of the low
          light and the scarring.
          
                                 AARON
                    You like it, don't you?   I knew you would.
          
                                                                                112
                                 JESSICA
                    You're an idiot.
          
                                  AARON
                    I know.
          
          Jessica touches the Tattoo.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Does that hurt?
          
                                   AARON
                    No.    Try whacking it with the bat.
          
          Jessica laughs as Aaron smiles. Troy is bored. Carlos is
          miserable. Jessica stands up in front of Aaron, holding the Bat
          loosely by her side, unsure of what to do. Aaron gently grabs
          Jessica around the elbows and pulls her close. He puts his arms
          around her and hugs her loosely.
          
                                 AARON (CONT'D)
                    Can we just forget about this?
          
                                  JESSICA
                    Yes.
          
          Aaron hugs Jessica tightly as she drops the Bat and hugs back.
          
                                 AARON
                    Happy birthday.
          
                                  JESSICA
                    Thank you.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT
          
          EMILY, her back up against a tree, continues making out with an
          aggressive MALE PARTYGOER 1. As MALE PARTYGOER 1 comes up for air,
          we see that he has a hand down Emily's pants, fingering her.
          Emily's mind is somewhere else.
          
          Emily snaps back to reality and removes Male Partygoer 1's hand and
          pushes him away from her - she won't become another slut in a town
          full of them.
          
                                 MALE PARTYGOER 1
                    Hey, what's wrong?
          
          Emily makes for the front door and into the house.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT
          
          MITCH has refilled his BEER and patiently waits for a counteroffer
          from COREY.
          
                                                                                113
                                 COREY
                    How about two thousand even?
          
          Impatient with the proceedings, PEDRO walks over to the passenger
          door of the Mustang, swings it open, and leans inside, struggling a
          bit.
          
                                   MITCH
                    Can't do it.
          
                                   COREY
                    Why not?
          
                                 MITCH
                    It's not economically...
                         (searching for the word)
                    Good, right, sound, whatever.
          
          Pedro reappears from the backseat, holding an expensive STEREO.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Okay, give us two thousand and I give you
                    this nice stereo for free.
          
                                 MITCH
                    Where the hell you get that?
          
                                 COREY
                    Yeah, what the hell is that?!
          
                                 PEDRO
                         (to Mitch)
                    It was in the car.
          
                                 MITCH
                    I don't want a stereo.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    You can have it for free, mehn.
          
                                 MITCH
                    Where's the speakers?
          
                                   PEDRO
                    In the back.
          
          Corey walks over, opens the door and looks in the back.   His gaze
          falls upon an item on the floor in the back seat area.
          
                                 PEDRO (CONT'D)
                         (O.S.)
                    This stereo's a motherfucker, mehn, I'm
                    telling you. I was gonna keep it myself.
          
                                                                               114
          Corey pulls out from the back seat of the Mustang holding a large
          red and blue POLICE LIGHT. He is dumbfounded. Corey looks to Pedro
          for an explanation.
          
                                   PEDRO (CONT'D)
                    What's that?
          
                                 COREY
                    I thought you'd tell me!
          
                                 MITCH
                    It looks like police cherries.
          
                                   COREY
                    It can't be.
          
                                 MITCH
                    Look fellas, I'd like to help you out, but
                    I'm not into buying stolen cop cars. It
                    don't seem right somehow.
          
          Corey and Pedro struggle for an explanation, but are left
          speechless.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT
          
          JESSICA and AARON are leaning against a random partygoer's CAR.
          They look very calm.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I didn't cheat.
          
                                 AARON
                    Fine, you say so, fine.
          
                                   JESSICA
                    That's it?
          
                                 AARON
                    Well what the hell can I do? There's
                    nothin'. I got your goddam initials
                    tattoo'd next to my balls.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    It was a stupid thing to do.
          
                                 AARON
                    You don't like it?!
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Well of course I like it!       But what if we
                    break up?
          
                                                                                 115
                                 AARON
                    Yeah, I thought about that.    I'll say it's
                    for Jesus H. Christ.
          
                                JESSICA
                    Great. Then you could start going to
                    church.
          
          Two POLICE CARS pull onto the lawn to break up the party, both cars
          flashing their red and blue lights. TROY approaches Jessica and
          Aaron.
          
                                 TROY
                    Cops're here. I'm goin'.
          
                                 AARON
                         (to Jessica)
                    You need a lift?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Okay.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          COREY, PEDRO and MITCH notice a POLICE CAR containing POLICE OFFICER
          1 and POLICE OFFICER 2 as it pulls into the back yard. Pedro is
          still holding the STEREO. PARTYGOERS carry on, barely concerned
          that the police are breaking up the party. Police Officer 2 spots
          the MUSTANG hitched to the TOW TRUCK, a look of knowing recognition
          on his face.
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                    I'll be fucked...
          
                                 COREY
                         (staring at the lights)
                    Pedro, get in the truck.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Oh shit...
          
          Police Officer 1 speaks into the C.B.
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                    Hey Janice, tell Tim I found his car.
          
          From far off, Corey understands from the manner that the police
          officers have focused on the Mustang that they've been spotted.
          
                                 COREY
                    Pedro, let's get the hell outta here!
          
          Police Officer 2 rushes out of the car, followed by Police Officer
          1.
          
                                                                                116
          Pedro turns to Mitch.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Coge, keep this.
          
          Pedro practically throws the Stereo into Mitch's stomach. Mitch,
          completely shocked, drops his BEER and grabs the stereo out of
          instinct. Pedro darts for the passenger seat of the Tow Truck.
          
                                 MITCH
                    What the hell am I supposed to do with
                    this?
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Keep it, mehn! I gotta go!
          
          COREY moves to the driver-side door of the Tow Truck and opens it,
          and climbs behind the wheel. Pedro climbs into the passenger seat.
          
                                 MITCH
                    You better bring that truck back!   Harvey
                    is pissed!
          
          Corey starts the Tow Truck and tries to shift it into gear.
          
                                 COREY
                    Where the hell is first?!
          
          Pedro grabs the stick shift and throws it into first.
          
                                 PEDRO
                    Drive, Pendejo!
          
          Corey hits the gas, and the transmission screeches its disapproval.
          
                                 PEDRO (CONT'D)
                    Mehn, use the clutch!
          
                                  COREY
                    Shit!   Where!
          
          The Tow Truck conks out.
          
                                  COREY (CONT'D)
                    Goddammit!
          
                                 PEDRO
                    We're fucked!
          
          Pedro opens the door and jumps out.   Corey remains seated, frozen,
          hands on the dashboard.
          
          POLICE OFFICER 1 quickly overtakes Pedro and throws him to the
          ground. POLICE OFFICER 2 rushes over to the Tow Truck and points
          his GUN at Corey.
          
                                                                                117
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                    Out of the truck, asshole!
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BERUBI'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
          
          HEATHER and RJ are in Berubi's bedroom. Heather is on top of RJ,
          and the sex is extremely rough. Heather notices the RED AND BLUE
          LIGHTS continue flashing on the curtains, staring, entranced by
          them. RJ looks up to see what she's staring at.
          
                                 RJ
                    What the fuck?!
          
          Heather does not respond as she continues bouncing up and down on
          top of RJ.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT
          
          COREY gets out of the truck, hands in the air. POLICE OFFICER 1
          HANDCUFFS PEDRO. POLICE OFFICER 2 takes out his HANDCUFFS, spins
          Corey around by his arm, and throws him roughly against the tow
          truck, cuffing his hands behind his back. In the background, MITCH
          quietly places the stereo on the ground and begins walking
          indiscreetly toward the street.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          POV on JIMMY, BOBBY, SINJIN and LOUIE staring at the wall opposite
          the door. Bobby is still holding what's left of Louie's WHEELCHAIR.
          Sinjin throws his hands up in disgust/disbelief.
          
          We see what they're staring at - KWON is climbing clumsily through
          the window. A large GUN falls heavily to the floor and KWON falls
          in after it.
          
                                  SINJIN
                    Kwon!   What the fuck are you doin'?
          
          Kwon grabs his Gun and stands up, slightly out of breath from his
          climb.
          
                                 KWON
                    Those are my drugs.
          
          Jimmy watches, powerless.
          
                                 SINJIN
                    I just bought these.
          
                                 KWON
                    From who?
                         (pointing his Gun at
                         Jimmy)
          
                                                                                 118
                    Jimmy? I'm not here to argue.   Just gimme
                    my drugs.
          
                                 SINJIN
                    Alright, hold on. Slow down a second.
                    What is this shit, Jimmy?
          
                                 KWON
                    Tell him, Jimmy.
          
          >From O.S. a CHINESE STRESS BALL hits Kwon in the forehead. Dazed,
          Kwon can only blink his eyes tries to gather his senses. Bobby
          stares at Kwon a moment before landing his large fist square on
          Kwon's nose, knocking him empty-handed and on his ass beside Sinjin.
          Sinjin stands up to get between Bobby and Kwon.
          
                                 SINJIN
                    Alright everybody calm the fuck down!
                    This shit's gettin' outta hand-
          
          BANG! Everybody freezes as the sound and smoke of a gunshot
          lingers, then checks to make sure they weren't hit. As doorknob
          starts rattling with increasing intensity, everyone checks to make
          sure they weren't hit, then turns to the source of the gunshot.
          Louie is holding the Gun as he lays on his side, having scrambled to
          grab the Gun.
          
          The door bursts open - it's RJ, out of breath.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          POLICE OFFICER 1 is using one hand to hold onto PEDRO, still
          HANDCUFFED, by his upper arm, and the other hand to unlock and open
          the rear driver side door of his POLICE CAR. POLICE OFFICER 2
          watches as he keeps hold of COREY by his HANDCUFFS.
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                         (to Police Officer 1)
                    Holy shit, you hear that?
          
          The two officers hasten their actions. Police Officer 1 lowers
          Pedro into the Police Car, then moves to the front seat of the
          vehicle and grabs the C.B.
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                    This is Unit one five seven. Shot fired
                    at 15 Saddlebrook. Repeat, shot fired at
                    15 Saddlebrook. Request backup
                    immediately.
          
          INT. POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Police Officer 2 shoves Corey into the POLICE CAR next to Pedro.
          Corey and Pedro sit in the rear of the police car, and Police
          Officer 2 slams the door. Through the windshield we see Police
          
                                                                                 119
          Officer 2 run toward the house as he draws his PISTOL.   He moves up
          the porch past...
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- NIGHT
          
          DEREK walks up the steps onto the back porch as PARTYGOERS move out
          of the house away from the sound of the gunshot. He notices POLICE
          OFFICER 2 behind him.
          
                                 DEREK
                    You call that in?
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                         (moving up the porch and
                         into the house)
                    We should get everybody out of the house.
          
                                 HEATHER (O.S.)
                         (friendly)
                    Derek?
          
          Derek and Police Officer 2 turn to see HEATHER walking onto the back
          porch from the kitchen.
          
                                 DEREK
                    Heather, go home. This is gonna get-
          
          Heather interrupts Derek's statement with a swift, unexpected knee
          to Derek's groin. Derek doubles over, and Heather grabs him by the
          hair.
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                    Hey!
          
          Police Officer 2 shoves Heather to the ground, grabs Derek's
          HANDCUFFS, and cuffs her hands behind her. Derek is still stunned
          from the assault.
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 2 (CONT'D)
                    Derek, you alright?
          
          ALLISON, who had been standing back watching the assault, approaches
          Heather, who is getting up onto her knees. Allison gets on her
          knees and hugs Heather, who cannot hug back because of the
          handcuffs. Allison is bawling.
          
                                 ALLISON
                    I'm so sorry, Heather, I'm so sorry.
          
          Heather is shutting her eyes extremely tightly, struggling not to
          cry. She does not attempt to pull away from Allison's tight
          embrace.
          
                                                                                 120
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
          
          SINJIN marches straight toward LOUIE, who wears the pathetic look of
          a child about to be disciplined.
          
                                  SINJIN
                    Louie!   What the fuck are you shootin' at?
          
                                   LOUIE
                           (pointing at BOBBY)
                    Him!
          
                                  BOBBY
                    You missed.
          
                                 SINJIN
                    Gimme that motherfuckin' gun.
          
          Sinjin grabs the GUN from Louie. KWON is sitting up, still dazed,
          holding a HANDKERCHIEF to stem the flow of blood streaming out of
          his nose.
          
                                 RJ
                    Cops're here.
          
          Sinjin turns to inspect the room, contemplating the situation.   He
          walks toward Jimmy's BACKPACK.
          
                                 RJ (CONT'D)
                    We should go, Sinjin.
          
                                 SINJIN
                         (facetious)
                    I'm not sure about that, RJ! Let's break
                    out the chalk board, some X's and O's, an'
                    make fer certain!
                         (taking command)
                    Just toss Louie out the fuckin' window!
          
                                 KWON
                    Sinjin, those are my drugs.
          
                                 SINJIN
                         (holding out the
                         Backpack)
                    These are my drugs,
                         (pointing at the BOWLING
                         BALL BAG)
                    That's your money.
          
                                 LOUIE
                         (to RJ)
                    Easy motherfucker!
          
                                                                                121
          RJ drops Louie out the window like a sack of bird seed, Louie is
          followed by the remains of his wheelchair, then by RJ himself. Kwon
          stands up and grabs the bowling ball bag.
          
                                 KWON
                    That's my gun, too.
          
                                 SINJIN
                         (heading out the window
                         after RJ)
                    I'll send it UPS.
          
          Sinjin disappears out the window.   Bobby is about to follow, but
          turns back toward Jimmy.
          
                                  BOBBY
                    You owe me.
          
          Bobby exits.   Kwon stands over Jimmy.
          
                                 KWON
                         (foreboding)
                    I'll see you around, Jimmy.
          
          Jimmy watches as Kwon exits out the window.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Most of the PARTYGOERS are clearing out of the house moving toward
          their cars, but some of the more curious STRAGGLERS are gathering
          around on the back porch, wondering what happened. POLICE OFFICER 1
          is encouraging everyone to leave.
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                    Everybody clear outta here.
          
                                 FEMALE PARTYGOER 2
                    There was a gunshot.
          
                                 FEMALE PARTYGOER 3
                         (pointing back toward the
                         bedrooms)
                    Over there.
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                    We've got it. Clear outta here.
          
          Police Officer 1 enters the house, passing CARLOS among the crowd
          making it's way out of the house. He walks across the back yard
          with his KEYS in his hand. He glances down at his shoes a moment as
          he spots JESSICA, AARON and TROY approaching. JIMMY enters and
          moves across the frame toward his PIECE-OF-SHIT parked in the rear
          of the back yard.
          
                                                                               122
                                 JESSICA
                         (to Carlos)
                    Hey. What happened in there?
          
                                  CARLOS
                    I just heard a gunshot and everybody's
                    jettin'. Probably more cops'll be here
                    soon.
                          (regarding Aaron)
                    Are you goin' with him?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Yeah.
          
                                 TROY
                    C'mon, let's get outta here.
          
                                 JESSICA
                         (to Carlos)
                    Are you alright? You okay to drive?
          
                                 CARLOS
                         (weakly)
                    Yeah, I'll be fine.    I'm fine, I mean.
                    I'll see you.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    Call me tomorrow.
          
          Carlos walks off toward his CAR, and Jessica, Aaron and Troy walk
          toward Troy's CAR.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S OLD BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          POLICE OFFICER 2 is looking through Jerry's old bedroom, noticing
          the hole in the wall. We can hear POLICE OFFICER 1 knocking on the
          bathroom door in the hallway.
          
                                 POLICE OFFICER 1 (O.S.)
                    Anybody in there? Open up! This is the
                    police! We're clearing everybody out!
          
          We move past Police Officer 2 out into the hallway toward the
          noise...
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Policer Officer 1 is opening the bathroom door, gun raised, and is
          stopped dead in his tracks by what he sees...
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Two legs are hanging out the side of the bathtub, belonging to a
          girl whose the rest of whose body is obscured from view.
          
                                                                                  123
          Police Officer 1 drops his gun to his side and steps into the
          bathroom, staring down into the bathtub.
          
          Police Officer 2 walks up into the bathroom, noticing the BULLET
          HOLE in the wall just beside the mirror.
          
                                   POLICE OFFICER 2
                       Oh man...
          
          We see what they do - EMILY is lying back across the width of the
          bathtub, eyes open but utterly vacant, a gunshot wound through her
          cheek just below her cheekbone.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          CARTER is moving from the living room toward the bedrooms.     POLICE
          OFFICER 1 stops him.
          
                                    POLICE OFFICER 1
                       You can't come back here.
          
                                    CARTER
                       Whadda ya mean I can't go back there.
                       This is my house!
          
          Carter is persistent, and Police Officer 1 puts his hands up against
          Carter.
          
          INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Some of the STRAGGLERS are still scattered throughout the side of
          the house opposite the bedrooms and bathroom. BERUBI is forcefully
          waving them out of the house.
          
                                    CARTER (O.S.)
                       Get your fucking hands off me!
          
                                    BERUBI
                       Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!     Get
                       the fuck out!
          
          The Stragglers exit out the front door.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          STRAGGLERS are heading out the front door, joining the other
          PARTYGOERS in looking for their cars.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          STRAGGLERS   are heading out the back door, joining the other
          PARTYGOERS   in looking for their cars, and for their friends. A few
          Partygoers   remain continue to loiter in groups scattered sparsely
          throughout   the yard.
          
                                                                                 124
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
          
          HEATHER is seated in the back of a POLICE CAR with her hands cuffed
          behind her back.
          
          INT. POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Heather's body is contorted to her side to relieve the discomfort
          caused by the HANDCUFFS. Through the window facing Carter's house
          we see a figure approaching. As the figure nears, we recognize
          DEREK, seemingly recovered from his earlier thrashing. Heather does
          not notice Derek as he nears the door. Derek opens the door.
          Heather looks up at him.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Get away from me.
          
          Derek pulls Heather from the police car, and the exhausted Heather
          gives only nominal resistance. Derek unlocks her handcuffs.
          Heather turns around.
          
                                 DEREK
                    You should get out of here before the
                    other officers come back.
          
                                 HEATHER
                    Fuck you.
          
          Heather walks past Derek, and Derek does not turn to follow her.
          Heather notices ALLISON standing several car lengths away. Allison
          has her arms crossed across her body as if she were hugging herself
          for warmth, both her and Heather's purses strapped over her
          shoulder, her KEYS dangling from her hand. Heather begins walking
          slowly towards Allison, passing by...
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          COREY and PEDRO are seated in the back of the POLICE CAR. Corey
          looks over at Pedro- the look of foolish optimism usually present on
          Pedro's face has vanished. He looks down at the floor of the Police
          Car.
          
          Through the side window of the Police Car we see JESSICA, AARON, and
          TROY and climbing into Troy's CAR. Troy is handing Aaron his KEYS
          before climbing into the back seat.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS
          
          Aaron is behind the wheel sticking the Keys into the ignition.
          Jessica is in the passenger seat looking through her PURSE for her
          CIGARETTES. Troy sits in the back seat, spent.
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I left my novel in Carlos' car.
          
                                                                                125
                                 AARON
                    You wanna get it?
          
                                 JESSICA
                    I'll get it tomorrow.   We should just get
                    out of here.
          
                                 AARON
                    Alright.
          
          Aaron starts the car as Jessica lights her Cigarette. Without
          warning, as Jessica takes a drag, Aaron punches Jessica square in
          the jaw. The lit Cigarette flies out of Jessica's mouth, and
          Jessica falls out of view. Aaron reaches down, grabs the Cigarette
          and puts it in his mouth, still angry.
          
          He slowly pulls the car out of the back yard and toward the street,
          passing Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT parked in the opposite direction.
          The engine is still off. JIMMY is sitting still behind the wheel,
          hands down in his lap, staring straight ahead. PULL IN and HOLD on
          Jimmy.
          
          EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT
          
          ESTABLISHING SHOT with the house IN FOCUS in the background. A few
          STRAGGLERS remain in the backyard, smoking cigarettes, gossiping,
          staring back at the house, etc. RACK FOCUS to a group of stragglers
          in the foreground to the right of the frame, STRAGGLER 1 and
          STRAGGLER 2 smoking CIGARETTES among them. Straggler 2 flicks his
          Cigarette and leads all of the group except Straggler 1 frame left
          toward the street. Straggler 1 glances back at the house before
          taking a final puff of his Cigarette. He stomps it out under his
          foot and exits frame left after his buddies. HOLD on the house OUT
          OF FOCUS.
          
                                                                 FADE OUT:
          
          THE END
