"PET SEMATARY II"


FADE IN:

INT.  LEMARCHE CASTLE, TOMB - NIGHT (1865)

A storm is raging outside. We hear the clap and roll of THUNDER.

TOMB STAIRWAY -

RATS scurry away down the scum-covered steps as the GLOW OF A 
LANTERN and FOOTSTEPS herald someone's arrival...

GENVIEVE LEMARCHE

emerges around the bend. Mid-30s. Cultured beauty. Her dress and 
face are smeared with grime and... is that blood we see too? God 
only knows what's happened to her.

Genvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open 
window.

WINDOW

LIGHTNING streaks across the night sky outside. We catch a glimpse 
of the MOON disappearing behind the clouds.

Genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs. The tomb itself.

Water trickles in through cracks in the lichen-covered walls, 
pooling on the tomb floor.

Genvieve moves forward, her lantern throwing distorted shadows 
over everything...

In front of her is Anton LeMarche's stone sarcophagus.
Genvieve kneels in the water, one hand resting on the spiked iron 
railing which surrounds the tomb. She reaches the other hand 
towards a scum-covered plaque, brushing the grime away...

THUNDER and LIGHTNING reach a crescendo as...

A SKELETAL HAND rises out of the water, reaching for her.

Genvieve SCREAMS. The lantern falls from her grasp, sputtering 
out. The hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her 
breast instead...

Genvieve starts to laugh hysterically.

                    DIRECTOR (O.S.)
               (exasperated)
          Cut! Thank you, Renee. Can we
          throw some light on the set?

                    GENVIEVE
          I'm sorry...

Suddenly it is lighter. Genvieve can't stop laughing. The groping 
monster hand disappears back beneath the water.

WE PULL BACK, REVEALING -

It's not 1865. The LeMarche Castle tomb is in fact, a 90s movie 
set. We are inside a soundstage, on a raised set, so the slugline 
should really read...

INT.  SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET -

A FILM CREW scurries about. Everyone is LAUGHING now. The DIRECTOR 
sits to the right. He and the DP are already huddled over the 
video-assist monitor. We see the previous scene rewinding at high-
speed.

The FIRST A.D. moves in.

                    FIRST A.D.
          Water in the pool's running low,
          fill her up!

Crewmembers move towards the set.

An SFX PUPPETEER (i.e., the skeletal arm) crawls out from under, 
followed by an ELECTRICIAN.

                    PUPPETEER
          I can't see shit down there! I'm
          working blind!

GENVIEVE/THE ACTRESS

rises out of the water. Her name is actually RENEE HALLOW and her 
beauty is undeniable, even in such a disheveled state.

                    RENEE
          This is great, I could've spent
          four months on a romantic comedy
          with Warren Beatty, and instead,
          I've got a horny zombie trying to
          cop a feel!

The crew members LAUGH. She's well-liked on the set. Renee grins. 
Wardrobe and make-up personnel move in to adjust Renee's 
appearance.

                    RENEE
          Uhgh, there's water everywhere...
               (beat)
          Can I get a cigarette?

The MAKE-UP GIRL pulls a pack of cigarettes from her fanny-pack 
and offers Renee one. In a flash, a P.A. appears with a lighter. 
Renee mumbles "thanks" as she fires up. She squints her eyes, 
trying to see past the set lights.

                    RENEE
               (calling out)
          Geoff?
               (beat)
          Anybody see my boy?

                    GEOFF (O.S.)
          Right here, Mom...

GEOFF MATTHEWS, Renee's 12 year-old son steps into view. Renee's 
face lights up when she sees him.

                    RENEE
          How long have you been here?

                    GEOFF
          Couple minutes. I saw the last
          shot. That was pretty cool.

Renee grimaces as the make-up girl spritzes her face with a spray-
bottle.

                    RENEE
               (casually)
          How did it go with your father
          last night?

                    GEOFF
          Good. He said he'd be over for
          dinner at eight...
               (awkward)
          I mean... he misses you, Mom...

                    RENEE
          I miss him too...

                    RENEE
               (continuing)
          I just don't want you to get your
          hopes up, okay? We're trying to
          work things out, but...

Her voice trails off.

                    GEOFF
          I know, Mom.

                    RENEE
               (affectionate)
          You know everything, don't you?

Renee and Geoff are interrupted by a CREWMEMBER who's spraying 
"atmosphere" about the set with a hand-held smoke machine. Renee 
coughs.

Off-set, the FIRST A.D. is trying to get the show on the road.

                    FIRST A.D.
          Okay, people! Quiet! We're going
          to try this another time!

                    GEOFF
          Guess it's showtime.

                    RENEE
          Yep.

Renee kisses Geoff on the forehead. He takes the cigarette from 
her and moves off the set, standing near the camera.

The director turns back toward Renee.

                    DIRECTOR
          Alright, Renee. Last time. I
          promise. We nail this and you
          won't have to do this ever again.

                    RENEE
          That's what you said the first
          time...

Renee turns and heads back toward the stairs. A P.A. hands her a 
new lantern. As she reaches the stairs, the house lights dim, 
creating the proper atmosphere once again.

UNDER THE SET -

The puppeteer gets ready. It's cramped. The electrician checks a 
power box connection.

The director nods to the camera operator.

                    OPERATOR
          Rolling. Speed...

                    SLATE BOY
          "Castle of Terror." Scene 69A.
          Take thirteen.

The slate comes down.

                    DIRECTOR
          Action!

The scene replays itself as before, only now we're watching the 
action from multiple viewpoints.

We start on the video assist monitor, then move up to...

GEOFF

He grins as he watches the scene unfold.

ON THE SET

Renee has reached the sarcophagus. LIGHTNING flashes. The skeleton 
hand bursts up, grabbing Renee's arm. The scene continues past the 
original point of interruption.

UNDER THE SET -

We see an undetected LEAK. Water drips down. The puppeteer shifts 
position, struggling, and...

...knocks over the power box which SPARKS just as...

ABOVE -

Renee/Genvieve grabs the iron railing with both hands.

Electricity surges through Renee. Her body jerks and writhes like 
some nightmarish marionette.

UNDER THE SET -

The electrician drags the puppeteer back. Sparks fly.

                    ELECTRICIAN
          Jesus! We've crossed over into
          220! Shut down the generator!

ABOVE -

Crewmembers SCREAM and scramble back...

All the circuits are blowing, lights EXPLODING and showering 
sparks over the whole set. This is not part of the movie.

RENEE

It's awful. She shakes, her SMOKING HANDS frozen to the iron 
railing by the electricity running through her...

Suddenly, Renee falls forward against the iron. Her face begins to 
SMOKE AND SINGE...

The lights CONTINUE TO BLOW, casting a strobic effect over the 
soundstage, adding to the chaos.

ON GEOFF

As he witnesses the whole event. He tries to rush forward, but 
someone restrains him...

                    GEOFF
          Mom!!!!

Suddenly all the circuits in the stage are blown and the LIGHTS GO 
OUT. Renee slumps back into the water, smoke trailing up from her 
still form. And we...

OMITTED (SCENES 2 THRU 2J)

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY

An aged GOLDEN RETRIEVER is on the surgical table. CHASE MATTHEWS, 
D.V.M., gently strokes the dog's fur. He's good with the dog. He's 
kind. The retriever's owners: a MOTHER and her SON, look on.

                    CHASE
          I think this is probably for the
          best. He's a very old dog. He
          has arthritis. He has cataracts
          in his eyes...

Chase looks at the mother. He's always hated this part.

                    CHASE
          He's had a good life...
               (to dog)
          ...haven't you, boy?

                    INTERCOM
          Doctor Matthews, your son is on
          line one. He says it's an
          emergency...

Chase breaks concentration, pulling his eyes away from the mother 
and son.

INT.  SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET -

A blur of activity converges on the movie set. A TRIO OF 
PARAMEDICS. A FIRE OFFICIAL. A POLICE OFFICER. Medical equipment. 
Horrified crewmembers watch on, helpless.

WE STAY ON Geoff, momentarily blocked out and then revealed again 
and again, amidst the commotion of paramedics scrambling to save 
Renee. The director has his hand on Geoff's shoulder.

Geoff's eyes dart about, taking it all in. Things are happening 
very fast:

--Renee's hand is lifted. Someone checking her pulse. --Her 
eyelids parted. A pen light flashing at her fixed pupils.

                    PARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.)
          Run me down a line of normal
          saline.

--An I.V. needle plunges into the inside of Renee's elbow. --A 
syringe injects into the I.V. post.

--Hands hook up a life-pack monitor. Renee's dress is torn away. 
Electrodes press to bare skin. --The monitor screen blinks to 
life.

                    PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
          We have a bradycardic rhythm at
          30.

--Another PARAMEDIC dials out on a cellular phone, to the 
consulting physician.

                    PARAMEDIC #3 (O.S.)
          White female. Approximately
          thirty five years old.
          Electrocution...

--A clear tube is inserted down her throat. --The monitor shows 
erratic heartbeat.

                    PARAMEDIC #2 (O.S.)
          She's in V-fib.

--There's a renewed urgency even amidst their rush.

--Defibrillator paddles are pressed to her chest.

Geoff looks to the monitor as...

--It goes to flatline.

                    PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
          Clear.

                    GEOFF
          No...

Geoff moves forward, pulling away from the director. The police 
officer moves in and intercepts Geoff, turning the boy away.

Geoff's eyes fix on the monitor. An unbending flatline...

                    GEOFF
          You have to bring her back...

Chase rushes onto the set, pushing past crewmembers. He freezes at 
the sight of the horrific commotion around Renee's still form.

                    CHASE
          Oh Jesus...

Chase's gaze connects with his son.

                    GEOFF
               (helpless)
          Dad...

We pull back from Geoff, Chase, and the commotion around Renee. 
Farther and farther as the darkness around the set begins to close 
in...

                    PARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.)
               (urgent)
          We're losing her...

EXT.  A DREAMLIKE FOG

A form drifts forward, materializing out of the fog.

It's a CASKET. Appearing as if it's floating among the clouds. 
PULLING BACK, WE SEE that it's moving along A CONVEYOR. AND NOW, 
WE CAN make out the faint form of A PLANE as the conveyor descends 
from the cargo compartment.

The casket reaches the end of the conveyor. A tag marks its final 
destination: Bangor, Maine. HANDS reach in and lift the casket. 
FOUR BAGGAGE HANDLERS hoist the casket up onto their shoulders and 
carry it off.

                    HANDLER #1
          Is it true she grew up around
          here?

                    HANDLER #2
          Yeah. Over in Ludlow.

                    HANDLER #1
          Huh. Never met a movie star
          before.

                    HANDLER #3
          Well you're a little late for an
          autograph.

The baggage handlers laugh as they walk off into the distance. The 
fog closes around them and we...

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  PLEASANTVILLE CEMETERY - DAY

We drift down from the gray sky to the somber scene below. Off in 
the distance, a crowd of MOURNERS are gathered around a grave.

                    PRIEST (V.O.)
          ...I am the resurrection and the
          life, saith the Lord...

CLOSER -

THE HEADSTONE is adorned with an iron plaque. It reads, simply:

               RENEE HALLOW MATTHEWS
                    1955-1991

                    PRIEST (V.O.)
          ...She that believeth in me,
          though she were dead, yet shall
          she live; and whosoever liveth and
          believeth in me, shall never
          die...

THE CASKET is slowly lowered into the open grave. As it descends, 
WE SEE Geoff and his father, Chase, standing at the forefront of 
the crowd. Renee's grave is next to those of her parents.

Among the mourners is MARJORIE HARGROVE, an attractive local girl 
in her early twenties.

Further down the hillside, a wall of NEWS REPORTERS are gathered 
behind a roped-off media boundary. There is a blinding flurry of 
PHOTO FLASHES as the press records the scene before them.

A SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PATROL CAR cruises up the cemetery drive, 
pulling to a stop near the mob of reporters.

Out of the car steps GUS GILBERT. Gus is nearly forty, with a 
Sheriff's uniform fitted to his solid, ageless frame. Gruff, maybe 
a little self-important: Gus likes being a big fish in a small 
pond.

                    GUS
               (drawing near)
          Let's keep it back, folks.
          Try to show her a little
          respect...

A REPORTER ducks under the media boundary, moving in for a closer 
shot.

He doesn't make it two steps before he's intercepted by Gus. Gus 
grabs the reporter and shoves him back.

                    GUS
          Hey! What did I just say?

Gus means business. One look into his eyes reveals his intense, no 
nonsense approach.

                    REPORTER
          Ass-hole...

The reporter backs off.

BACK AT THE GRAVESIDE -

Beneath the gloomy, ominous skies, the lines on Chase's face shade 
him as a decade older than his thirty-five years. Chase gently 
places a comforting hand on Geoff's shoulder.

Geoff inches forward, pulling free of Chase's touch. Drawn to his 
mother, drawn from his father. The only blemishes on his youthful, 
rosy cheeks are the tears, the endless tears.

                    PRIEST (V.O.)
          I know that my redeemer liveth,
          and that he shall stand at the
          latter day upon the earth.

Geoff looks upon the casket, gazing into the abyss of despair.

FOLLOWING THE CEREMONY

The crowd has dispersed.

Geoff is standing at the base of Renee's grave. His eyes fixed. 
Unmoving. Unaccepting.

Chase is nearby, watching, not wanting to intrude on Geoff's 
private moment.

Gus quietly moves in at Chase's side.

                    GUS
          Did she always have reporters
          following her around like this?

                    CHASE
          Pretty much so.

Gus glances at Geoff.

                    GUS
          I hear you moved into town.

                    CHASE
          I wanted to get Geoff out of
          L.A. Just start things over, you
          know?

Gus nods. Now his eyes fall on Renee's headstone.

                    GUS
          I remember when Renee left. She
          couldn't wait to get out of
          Ludlow. She used to say that
          life moved too slow here...

Chase forces a smile.

                    CHASE
          That's Renee alright.

                    GUS
          I suppose so.

The sky above seems heavy with imminent rain and we...

EXT.  HOUSE - DAY

Lazy oaks embrace a vintage, two-story Victorian home in the rural 
neighborhood of Ludlow, Maine. A commercial MOVING VAN is parked 
out front.

Marjorie, the girl we saw at Renee's funeral, is coming down the 
sidewalk. She checks the address on the front of the house, then 
heads up the driveway.

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

Moving boxes clutter the downstairs.

Chase is weaving through the maze, doing an inventory on the 
boxes.

A sweaty PAIR OF MOVERS are climbing up the stairs. Each is 
hunched  over, with a garment box balanced on his back. The side 
of each carton is boldly labeled: RENEE - ATTIC.

                    MOVER (O.S.)
          We've got six more of these. You
          sure you want them all in the
          attic?

Chase is contemplating a compromise when Geoff appears from the 
kitchen doorway.

                    CHASE
          ...Geoff, what if we just give
          the clothes to Goodwill? We'll
          keep the rest. Just the clothes.

Geoff shakes his head, firm and deliberate denial.

                    GEOFF
          You're the one who wanted to move.
          Nobody would've touched them if
          you didn't want to move here...

Chase weakens, giving in.

                    CHASE
          All the 'Renee' boxes go in the
          attic. Sorry.

Marjorie KNOCKS on the open frame of the front door.

Geoff recognizes her from his mother's funeral. She flashes him a 
warm smile.

                    MARJORIE
          Hi. I'm Marjorie Hargrove. Your
          new housekeeper.

Marjorie has a naive, friendly quality about her. She's also 
blessed with eye-popping genetics. Standing there outside the 
door, looking more than a little nervous... we can't help but like 
her. Needless to say, she doesn't look like your typical 
housekeeper.

                    MARJORIE
               (re: Chase's reaction)
          Is something wrong?

                    CHASE
          Uh... no. You just... look
          different than you sounded on the
          phone. Please, come in.

Marjorie enters. She grins at Geoff again. Yep. She's nervous 
alright.

                    MARJORIE
          I'm real excited about working
          for you Mr. Matthews...

                    CHASE
          Well we're glad to have you,
          Marjorie. You can call me Chase,
          by the way.

Marjorie passes her curious eyes over one of Renee's garment 
containers.

                    MARJORIE
          I've always admired Ms. Hallow.
          That scene she did in Blue
          Midnight, where her lover meets
          her at the train station...
               (she sighs)
          I must've watched that movie four
          times.

Chase smiles. Marjorie's enthusiasm is endearing.

Just then, one of the movers loses his grip. A garment box bounces 
down the slope of the stairs. When it reaches the bottom, dresses 
spill over the floor.

                    MARJORIE
          Oh. I'll get that...

Marjorie moves for the spill. The first dress she touches is a 
beaded peach evening gown. Her fingers linger on the fabric.

                    MARJORIE
          This is gorgeous. She wore this
          at the Emmys, didn't she?

Geoff moves forward, acting overly defensive.

                    GEOFF
          Hey, don't touch her stuff. It
          made her crazy when people touched
          her stuff.

Marjorie is taken aback by the oddity of Geoff's statement.

Chase catches her eye, shrugging apologetically.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY

A VAN is parked outside. The rear side panel is masked off with 
tape and a stencil. Chase grabs the corner of the tape and 
carefully peels it back, revealing a crisp, new business logo:

ESTABLISHING. Shops and businesses situated around a lazy town 
square. QUiet. Relaxed. As rural as they come.

WE pick up Chase's van as it cruises by.

EXT.  VETERINARY OFFICE - DAY

Chase pulls the van in front of an unassuming veterinary office.

On the door is Chase's nameplate. And on the weathered wall is an 
outline of letters where the name and title "Quentin Yolander, 
Doctor of Veterinary Medicine" once was.

Geoff is first out of the van.

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Geoff and Chase move inside. The offices look like they were built 
in the 40s. A dark corridor stretches down the center of the 
suite. Faded green walls are solid, with few exteriors. It's 
creepy in here.

Heavy, grey plastic curtains absorb much of the light which does 
find its way in. Nothing looks like it's been updated in the past 
fifty years.

                    CHASE
          This doesn't look so bad...

Chase sweeps a curtain aside, revealing the interior to Geoff. 
Dust swirls in the air.

                    GEOFF
          How long ago did this guy retire?

                    CHASE
          It's been a few years.

Geoff takes a look around, growing uncomfortable.

                    GEOFF
               (skeptical)
          A few?

Geoff moves on down the central corridor which seems to grow 
darker and more dismal with every step. He moves on into the 
boarding room...

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY

Rows of kennels are stacked along the walls, smothered with 
cobwebs. Ancient, rusted surgical equipment is scattered 
everywhere. The place is a mess. Windows are boarded up and 
shadows cloak the room.

Over to the right, Geoff hears a RUSTLING.

A CARDBOARD BOX on one of the shelves jiggles. Something is moving 
around inside it.

Geoff's eyes widen. Still, morbid curiosity propels him forward.

The box rustles again. He reaches for it and...

A CREATURE LEAPS out at him, HOWLING. Geoff SCREAMS and jumps 
back. The box tumbles over and...

A CAT crawls out. Behind the protective mother, are four of the 
cutest kittens we've ever seen, MEWING away.

Geoff sighs just as Chase rushes into the room.

                    CHASE
          What's wrong?!

                    GEOFF
               (embarrassed)
          Nothing. I just got spooked by a
          bunch of furballs.

Inside the box is a note. Chase reaches for it. It reads: "And a 
warm welcome to you."

                    CHASE
          Great, now I've opened an
          orphanage too.

One of the kittens pads out of the box and looks up at Geoff with 
sleepy eyes. Her fur is striped.

                    GEOFF
          Well, I'll take one. If it's
          okay...

Geoff lifts the fragile creature, cradling it in his arms.

                    GEOFF
          She looks like a tiger.

Chase spies an old broom resting in the corner.

                    CHASE
          Tell you what, you do some
          sweeping up here, and she's yours.

Geoff nods and Chase moves back out into the hallway.

Geoff sets the box back upright and lowers Tiger in with the other 
kittens. He reaches for the broom and goes to work sweeping away 
the cobwebs.

Just as soon as he turns his back, Tiger climbs the side of the 
box, spilling over onto the floor.

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

Chase is unpacking a shipment of medical supplies. When he places 
them in the cabinet, he stirs up a layer of dust.

Tiger scampers by as Chase coughs his way out of the cloud of 
dust.

INT.  WAITING AREA

Tiger sees the front door ajar. And as she approaches to explore 
what lies beyond--

The door swings open...

ZOWIE, A SIBERIAN HUSKY is staring back at her. He's black and 
white with blue eyes, with a mask that is at once menacing and 
majestic.

A pudgy thirteen year old boy, DREW, has a hold of the dog's 
collar.

Zowie's BARK sends Tiger scrambling.

Drew loses his grip as Zowie yanks free. A strong, paternal 
command calls after Drew from outside.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Drew, you get a handle on that
          dog, now!

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

Chase spins around at the commotion as Tiger darts across the 
floor with the barking dog in pursuit.

Mayhem ensues as Zowie's big paws slip on the slick tile.

Geoff rushes in from the boarding area.

Tiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney.

Zowie's snoot wedges beneath the base, inches from Tiger's tiny, 
striking paw.

Drew slides in on his knees, renewing his hold on Zowie's collar. 
He pulls the dog back.

Geoff rescues Tiger from beneath the gurney.

Drew shrugs sheepishly.

                    DREW
          Sorry. He gets kinda hyper...

Drew's stepfather, Gus Gilbert, enters. The dreaded, domineering 
voice of authority in Drew's life. WE know him as the sheriff at 
Renee's funeral.

                    GUS
          Hell, he thought it was lunch.
          How ya doin', Chase?
               (a handshake)
          You haven't met my boy.
               (aside)
          Drew, where the hell are your
          manners.

Drew steps forward and awkwardly offers his hand to Chase. Then 
Geoff. The boys shake.

                    GEOFF
          He's a cool lookin' dog.

Zowie lurches forward, eager to shower affection on Geoff. Geoff 
strokes the dog's soft mane.

                    GEOFF
          What's his name?

                    DREW
          Zowie.

Drew puts his palm under Zowie's chin and turns him for Chase to 
see. There are several scabbed-over gashes on his left cheek.

                    GUS
          Damn dog stuck his nose in on my
          rabbits and they ganged up on him.
          I swear that dog's an idiot.

                    DREW
          Is he gonna be okay?

With one eye on Zowie, Chase sprays some antiseptic on the 
examination table and wipes it clean.

                    CHASE
          Let's have him hop up here.

Drew prods Zowie. Zowie jumps up onto the table. Chase looks over 
the facial lacerations, then turns on a penlight and examines the 
dog's eyes.

Gus passes a lingering look over Tiger. He reaches in to pet her, 
making sure it meets with Geoff's approval.

                    GUS
          When I was young I thought cats
          were the girls and dogs were the
          boys.

                    CHASE
          There are three more girls where
          that one came from looking for
          homes.

Drew perks up at the thought, but Gus shoots it down.

                    GUS
          Not our home.

Chase takes the light out of Zowie's eyes. He looks to Gus.

                    CHASE
          Thee facial lacerations should heal
          up pretty quickly. I'll give you
          som antibiotic cream--

                    GUS
          --Drew, he's your dog. Are you
          listening to this?

Chase turns to Drew and continues...

                    CHASE
          His left eye is scratched, corneal
          abrasion. Eyedrops will help, but
          it's going to take som time. Try
          to keep him away from those
          rabbits, huh?

Drew nods, casting a glance aside at Gus.

                    GUS
               (to Chase)
          I hear you've got Marjorie
          Hargrove working for you now.

                    CHASE
          How'd you know that?

Gus gives Chase a knowing grin.

                    GUS
          It's a small town, Chase.

Gus laughs and claps Chase on the shoulder.

                    GUS
          Hey Geoff, did you know your
          mother and I used to be high-
          school sweethearts?

Geoff is surprised at this. Surprised and annoyed. Tact isn't a 
quality that Gus possesses in abundance.

                    GEOFF
          Really?

                    GUS
               (nodding)
          Homecoming. Prom. Whole nine
          yards.
               (to Chase)
          Course that was a lifetime ago.

EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY

JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS are converging en masse for classes. 
Chase's van pulls up front.

INT.  VAN - DAY

Chase digs some cash out of his wallet. Geoff stares out at the 
school. He's dreading this.

                    CHASE
          What's a lunch cost these days?
          You want ten?

                    GEOFF
               (unenthused)
          Sure.

Chase looks at his son.

                    CHASE
          You nervous? New town, new
          school. I know it must be pretty
          hard for you...

                    GEOFF
               (cutting him off)
          I'll be fine, Dad.

Geoff reaches for the door, but Chase stops him. He's trying to 
reach his son. He really is.

                    CHASE
               (awkward)
          Geoff... you have to help me out
          here a little...

"MEOW!" Chase drops his eyes to the bulge squirming around in 
Geoff's jacket. He can't help but smile.

                    CHASE
          Are you sure you don't want me to
          pick you up. It's a long ride.

Geoff opens the side panel of the van and slips out his MOUNTAIN 
BIKE.

                    GEOFF
          That's what my bike's for...

Before Chase can say another word, Geoff is gone.

EXT.  VAN - DAY

As Chase pulls away, WE SEE the handmade sign taped in the back 
window:

                    PRICELESS KITTENS
                    FREE TO A GOOD HOME

EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY

Drew is among a small circle of BOYS. He recognizes Geoff walking 
his bike from the van. The largest of the boys, CLYDE, takes 
notice of the unfamiliar face.

Clyde is fifteen, going on twenty. You know the type: local bully, 
held back a year or two.

                    CLYDE
          Check it out. That's the new kid.
          The son of that movie star.

Mischief gleams in Clyde's eyes as he watches Geoff's every move. 
The other boys follow suit. Clyde always takes the lead.

Geoff fields their penetrating stares. For a second his eyes 
connect with Clyde's, then he moves on into the building.

Among the boys, Drew is the reluctant participant.

INT.  CLASSROOM - DAY

MRS. GORDON is addressing a room of SEVENTH GRADERS.

Geoff is doodling in his notebook, feeling acutely out of place as 
he tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new 
classmates are giving him.

                    MRS. GORDON
          People, this is Geoff Matthews.
          He'll be joining our class for the
          rest of the school year...

As Mrs. Gordon points to him, Geoff drops his face even lower. 
This is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer. He'd like 
to throttle Mrs. Gordon.

A freckle-faced boy, DOUG, fires off a question.

                    DOUG
          Hey, what's Hollywood like? Do
          you know Eddie Murphy?

                    GEOFF
               (annoyed)
          No.

                    MRS. GORDON
          Why don't we save that for later,
          Doug?

A girl with braces, SUSAN, continues the interrogation.

                    SUSAN
          What about Julia Roberts?

                    MRS. GORDON
          Susan! That'll be enough.

Susan shuts up. Geoff sinks even lower in his seat.

The kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room.

But one classmate's eyes are still on Geoff. It's Clyde.

Clyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in Geoff's jacket. He
catches a glimpse of Tiger's bobbing nose popping out.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

Geoff joins the stampede of kids as the BELL releases them for the 
day. Almost immediately, Clyde and his cronies, STEVIE AND BRAD, 
fall in step behind him. Drew hangs slightly off to the side, not 
really wanting to be a part of the intimidation.

                    CLYDE
          What's the hurry, Junior? Where
          you off to?

Clyde quickens his pace, pulling ahead of Geoff and stopping in 
front of him. Stevie and Brad move in on either side. Surrounded 
by peers, it's apparent how small Geoff is for his age.

On the wall next to them is a bulletin board display. Clyde 
glances at it. Geoff follows his gaze.

DISPLAY

It's one of those corny school affairs with construction paper 
letters spelling out: "WE REMEMBER RENEE HALLOW." Beneath that are 
pictures of Renee clipped from various magazines. Cloyingly 
tasteless.

                    CLYDE
               (feigning remorse)
          Too bad about your Mom. Papers
          said it was pretty gross, getting
          fried like that. Guess you saw
          it, huh?

Geoff nods. Clyde raises his eyebrows, pulling Geoff's jacket 
open.

                    CLYDE
          So, what are you hiding there?

                    STEVIE
          When you bring a friend to school
          you're supposed to introduce him.

Geoff's arm tightens protectively around Tiger.

                    GEOFF
          Her name's Tiger.

                    CLYDE
          Tiger? Don't you think that's
          kind of a pussy name?
               (reaching out)
          Can I hold her? I promise I'll be
          real careful.

Clyde has a convincing way about him. Geoff reluctantly hands the 
kitten over. Clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would 
never question his sincerity.

Geoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in 
Clyde's tone, something sinister.

                    CLYDE
          Hey, Geoff. You ever seen a
          kitten run?

                    GEOFF
          I've seen her run around the
          house.

Clyde's eyes narrow. He takes a couple of steps back. Geoff's 
heart starts to sink.

                    CLYDE
          No, I mean really run...
               (beat)
          Like this!

Clyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with Tiger. Brad 
and Stevie fall in behind him, laughing.

Drew shrugs apologetically. He's torn, but he tears off after them 
nonetheless.

                    GEOFF
          Shit...

Geoff runs off in pursuit of them.

EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY

Geoff rushes from the building, searching the dispersing crowd. 
There they are, tearing from the bike racks, pedaling for the 
street.

Clyde sees Geoff and mockingly holds the kitten out for display as 
they ride by.

Geoff runs for the bike racks.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Clyde and his cohorts break from the outskirts of town, riding out 
onto the open road.

Clyde glances back toward the center of town.

Geoff is so far behind he's barely visible.

Clyde returns his eyes to the road ahead, raising Tiger nose to 
nose with him.

                    CLYDE
          Having fun yet?

Clyde and his smirking buddies ride on, OUT OF FRAME.

WITH GEOFF

giving the pedals all he can, struggling to keep pace with the 
boys.

35    OMITTED

FURTHER ALONG

Scattered houses sprinkle the landscape ahead. Cochran Lake 
stretches into the distance beyond the housing.

Clyde's clan cuts from the road and blazes a trail across a 
residential property. The two-story house is weathered and boarded 
up. It looks vaguely familiar. Creepy.

And when WE FIND the mailbox post, we know why. The name is faded, 
but there's no question who once lived there. Five bold letters: 
"CREED."

Geoff whips by in a blur, still in pursuit.

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Clyde and his friends have abandoned their bikes. They've taken 
position on top of the slope of the hill, standing at the foot of 
THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY.

38    OMITTED

EXT.  PET SEMATARY PATH - DAY

Geoff pulls his bike to a stop short of the boys. He dismounts and 
leans it up against a tree.

                    GEOFF
          Just give me the cat, all right?

A devilish grin creeps over Clyde. He strolls down the path toward 
Geoff. Clyde grabs Geoff's handlebars and, backing up, pulls Geoff 
and the bike with him.

                    CLYDE
          I would but... there was a little
          accident...
               (feeding off Geoff's
               alarm)
          She was trying to get away. You
          know, running down my leg... and
          her head got too close to the 
          spokes. Pretty gross. What's
          left of her is up in the Pet
          Sematary. A zip-lock bag might
          help...
               (shrugs)
          ...but I happen to be out of them
          at the moment.

Drew shakes his head, disgusted he has to put up with Clyde's 
antics.

                    DREW
          Come on, Clyde, just tell him
          where the cat is...

                    CLYDE
               (turning on Drew)
          ...I TOLD HIM where the cat is!
          Now shut up, fuck-face!

Clyde punches Drew in the arm. Drew shrinks back.

Geoff flashes a hateful stare at Clyde.

All of the boys but Clyde are uncomfortably silent. There's 
something frightening about Clyde... something that extends beyond 
the standard bully antics. We begin to get the feeling that this 
kid is genuinely deranged.

                    CLYDE
               (relishing the
               moment)
          You heard about the Creed murders
          yet? And the place where the dead
          come back to life?

He motions to the path behind him.

                    CLYDE
               (continuing)
          It's just back there. Just down
          that path...

                    DREW
               (meekly)
          Clyde... it's not funny anymore.

                    CLYDE
          Oh? So you got a problem?
          What're you gonna do, fat-ass? You
          gonna sic big, bad, old Gus after
          me?

Drew shuts up. Clyde turns back to Geoff, drawing closer.

                    CLYDE
          What do you think, Geoff? Maybe
          you could dig up your Mom and take
          her back there. Maybe if you pray
          real hard, she'll come back.

With this last remark Clyde has pushed too far. Geoff's face is 
red with anger.

                    GEOFF
               (quietly)
          Just give me the cat, ass-hole.

Clyde's grin falters a moment.

                    CLYDE
          Excuse me, maybe I'm a little hard
          of hearing... but did you just call
          me an ass-hole?

Clyde pokes Geoff in the shoulder.

                    CLYDE
          You mad, Geoff? Cause if you are,
          you should take a shot at me...

This time Clyde shoves Geoff back even harder.

                    CLYDE
          Come on, you pussy! What's the
          matter with you?

Clyde moves forward again and Geoff suddenly LASHES OUT, catching 
everyone off guard.

For an instant, Drew marvels at Geoff's tenacity.

Clyde LUNGES. He hammers Geoff with blows.

Outsizing him by forty pounds, Clyde tosses Geoff to the ground. 
Geoff struggles, but Clyde's grip proves arresting.

Clyde throws Geoff onto his stomach, forcing his face into the 
dirt. It looks as if he's ready to smother his opponent.

Drew is the first to rush in. Brad and Stevie quickly follow. It 
takes all three of them to peel Clyde off Geoff.

Clyde gets to his feet and backs away. There's great pleasure in 
his crazed eyes as he watches Geoff coughing and gasping.

                    CLYDE
          Fuckin' ass-hole.

Satisfied he's handed out enough ill will for the day, Clyde turns 
away.

Drew's attentions remain on Geoff. As Clyde strolls by, he grabs 
Drew's arm and swings him around.

                    CLYDE
          This way, fat-boy.

Stevie and Brad follow. As the group passes Geoff's bike, Clyde 
gives it a kick, knocking it over. Then they're gone.

Geoff pulls himself to his feet. Brushing off the mess, he heads 
up the path in search of Tiger.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - DAY

The woods here have grown long with shadows. The air is still and 
the sound of birds is conspicuously absent.

A WOODEN ARCHWAY frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard. 
Scrawled across the weatherstained boards is a child's barely 
legible attempt at "PET SEMATARY."

Geoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude, crowded graves. 
Collars, leashes, bird cages and other accessories adorn the 
makeshift crosses and headstones.

Geoff moves along the outer circle of markers, each crafted by a 
child's caring hands.

As he searches, he can't help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs. 
On the outer circle, he sees a crate-board marker memorializing: 
SMUCKY THE CAT... HE WAS OBEDIANT.

MOVING INWARD, the markers are older. The ones he can still read 
convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death.

Here is a wide, flat, upright board planted deep in the earth: "In 
Memory of MARTA our Pet Rabit Dyed March 1 1965."

The next three rows are illegible, the inscriptions are weathered 
beyond recognition... And then, chiseled into sandstone: HANNAH 
THE BEST DOG THAT EVER LIVED 1929-1939.

And now... "MEOW." Faint. But very much alive.

Geoff picks up his pace, weaving quickly toward the center.

There, he finds Tiger. Trapped in a rusted old birdcage, its base 
swallowed by the grave.

Geoff opens the door and frees Tiger, stroking the trembling 
kitten.

Geoff's eyes are drawn to the far perimeter... to the deadfall...

THE DEADFALL looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of 
skeletal remains. An abstract stairway to things beyond. A wind 
picks up just then, sending leaves skittering in waves across the 
ground.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY PATH - DAY

When Geoff turns around, he finds Drew waiting for him under the 
archway. Drew smiles, full of respect for Geoff.

                    DREW
          I've never seen anybody punch
          Clyde before.

                    GEOFF
               (shrugs)
          He pissed me off.

                    DREW
               (his smile fading)
          Sorry about your mom.
               (beat)
          I couldn't handle not having my
          mom around. Just having Gus...

He grimaces at the thought.

                    GEOFF
          My dad's not so bad.

Drew glances around at all the makeshift grave markers.

                    DREW
          I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was
          dead...

                    GEOFF
               (serious)
          You shouldn't ever say that about
          your parents, not even your Dad.

                    DREW
          Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.

Geoff nods knowingly.

                    GEOFF
          What was all that stuff about dead
          people coming back to life?

                    DREW
          Nothing. It's just an old ghost
          story. Let's get out of here...

They head off, full of childhood.

INT.  KITCHEN - DUSK

Marjorie is at the stove, fixing up dinner, while Chase scans the 
newspaper at the table.

Geoff enters through the kitchen door. He moves past them without 
a word.

                    CHASE
               (calling after him)
          Hey! How was your first day at
          school?

                    GEOFF
               (over his shoulder)
          It sucked.

                    MARJORIE
          Now is that any way to talk to
          your father?

Geoff stops for a moment, turns...

                    GEOFF
          You're not my mother.

...and exits through the opposite door.

Chase looks to Marjorie and offers a sympathetic shrug.

                    CHASE
          Sorry.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DUSK

CRUDE CAGES HOUSE DOZENS OF RABBITS. Situated alongside the 
garage. A sign above the cages reads: PET RABBITS - $10.00. Bells 
positioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play.

Gus is rigging a wire along the base of the cage.

Finishing it off, he hangs the plug next to an outside socket. 
Moving onto the next chore, he pours pressed alfalfa pellets into 
feeding slots for the hungry rabbits.

Setting the feed aside, he takes a seat. Opening one of the cages, 
he grabs a rabbit and sets it on his lap, gently petting its soft 
fur.

One of the cages starts to vibrate.

Gus gives it a look: A PAIR OF RABBITS aren't interested in 
eating, they're joined in fast and furious passion.

Gus gets a chuckle out of the sight.

                    GUS
          Way to go, Romeo...

Gus replaces the rabbit in the hutch. And before he goes, HE SINKS 
THE PLUG INTO THE SOCKET. An ELECTRICAL CHARGE dances along the 
base of the cage, a deterrent for intruders.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Drew's mother, AMANDA, withdraws a roast from the oven.

Gus is at the sink, washing his hands. He turns to see Zowie 
laying at Drew's feet in the living room. Drew is watching a MUSIC 
VIDEO on TV.

                    GUS
          Drew, I don't remember inviting
          Zowie in for dinner.

                    DREW
          Just until he heals up?

Gus is waggling his thumb toward the back door.

Drew slumps in defeat.

Gus reaches into the cabinet and pours himself a Bourbon.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Drew walks Zowie from the house with a dish of dog food. As they 
pass the rabbit dens, Zowie alters his path. Drew gets a handful 
of his collar and pulls him back.

Across the yard is an enclosed dog run. Twenty feet long by ten 
feet wide. Drew puts Zowie inside with the dog food.

Drew strokes Zowie's mane affectionately, then backs away, closing 
the wood-framed door to the dog run.

INT.  DREW'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Amanda's about to put the roast on the table when Gus nuzzles up 
behind her, breathing down her backside. With his drink in hand, 
he sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of 
the neck.

Gus eases his free hand around between Amanda and the counter and 
presses his palm firmly into her crotch, drawing her body tight to 
him.

She stiffens at his intimate hold, uncomfortable with his timing.

                    AMANDA
          Gus, please...

At the back door, Drew is watching from beyond the screen, 
disgusted by the sight of Gus pawing his mother. Drew swings the 
door open as loud as he can to signal his return.

Gus plants a last kiss on the back of Amanda's neck and backs off. 
But before he goes, he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving 
platter. Leveling his leering eyes at Amanda, he stuffs it into 
his mouth suggestively.

                    GUS
          God damn, you're good.

Drew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table, returning his 
attention to the TV, where another MUSIC VIDEO is on.

Gus glances at the TV, annoyed by the MUSIC. He drops into his 
spot at the head of the table, blocking Drew's view. Drew leans to 
the side for a better look. Gus takes notice and leans to the same 
side to obstruct his view.

                    GUS
          You're breaking the law here,
          Drew.

                    AMANDA
          Really, Gus. It won't bother me.

Gus ignores her, inching forward with a confidential, harsh 
whisper.

                    GUS
          Your mom's spent the last hour
          cooking. Stop being a little jerk
          and show her some appreciation.

Drew aims the remote control at Gus, as if to shut him up, and 
silences the TV.

Amanda approaches with the roast. The moment it's on the table, 
Drew starts dishing up a hefty serving. Gus spears Drew's fork 
with the serving fork.

                    GUS
          Not that much appreciation. I
          thought we were gonna tone down
          that flabby ass.

                    DREW
          Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud
          that you are.

                    AMANDA
          Knock it off, guys...

Gus throws back a sip of Bourbon.

                    GUS
               (to Drew, quietly)
          You watch that mouth of yours,
          Drew buddy.

EXT.  ZOWIE'S DOG RUN - NIGHT

MOVING THROUGH Zowie's enclosed pen, WE SEE no sign of the dog. 
REACHING the door, WE FIND that the wood around the bottom hinge 
has been chewed through. The base of the door is ajar, just enough 
for a dog to have slipped through.

EXT.  RABBIT CAGES - NIGHT

In the still of the night, Gus' rabbit pens sit unattended. And 
then WE HEAR the tinkling of dog tags. Snoozing rabbits awaken as 
Zowie lumbers INTO FRAME.

Zowie rises on his hind legs, pressing his paws to a cage. Blue 
sparks fly as Zowie is jolted with the electrical charge.

INT.  GUS' ROOM - NIGHT

The ELECTRICAL ZING. The dog's whimpering CRY. And the RINGING OF 
BELLS reach Gus in rapid succession, rousting him from his sleep. 
He rolls out of bed and grabs his robe.

                    GUS
          Damn it, Drew. That dog is
          history!

Amanda stirs, groggily focusing on Gus' departing figure.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Drew swings open the door to the hallway as Gus marches by, 
stuffing shells into a shotgun. Panicked, Drew takes off after 
him.

EXT.  RABBIT CAGES - NIGHT

Zowie swings his head in the direction of the house as Gus bursts 
through the back door. Drew is one step behind.

Gus swings the gun up and fires off a SHOT.

Zowie bolts for the shadows of the hillside.

Drew rushes in and deflects the aim of the rifle.

                    DREW
          Don't shoot him!

Gus' eyes are wild with anger.

                    GUS
          What, Drew? What did you say?!

Gus throws Drew aside, brings the rifle back up and FIRES another 
random shot after the fleeing dog. All the while, his eyes remain 
on Drew, as if this were the boy's lesson to be learned.

He squeezes off one more SHOT...

A PAINED YELP echoes from the hillside. Zowie's yelp.

Drew whips his head aside in sickened shock. Even Gus is sobered 
by the unexpected hit.

All they can hear now are Zowie's WHIMPERING CRIES diminishing in 
the night.

Drew shoots Gus a look of such unbridled hatred that Gus is 
speechless. He backs away from Gus and darts off toward the dark 
hillside.

When Gus turns back for the house, Amanda is standing there.

                    AMANDA
          Jesus, Gus, what have you done?

                    GUS
          Ah, come on, Amanda, stop looking
          at me like that. He's had ample
          warning about that dog.

Amanda glares at him, an outpouring of pent-up strain.

Gus defiantly marches past Amanda, entering the house without ever 
meeting eyes with her.

EXT.  WOODS - NIGHT

Drew pauses long enough to listen for Zowie...

Nothing until a FAINT CRY drifts back at him.

DEEPER IN THE WOODS

Zowie limps INTO FRAME. Blood is flowing from the bullet wound in 
his left hindquarter, trailing from his suspended leg. Every step 
is a strain.

DREW

comes upon a break in the trees. The hanging moon outlines the 
knoll stretching beyond. And then, the strained breathing, the 
hushed WHIMPER.

Drew hesitantly approaches the crest of the knoll.

Zowie is just beyond, lying on his side at the end of the bloody 
trail. His chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every 
effort to survive.

Drew drops to his knees at Zowie's side and cradles the dog in his 
lap, shaking his head in denial.

Zowie's weak eyes shift, gazing longingly at Drew.

Drew strokes the fur under Zowie's chin, hardly able to see the 
dog through his glaze of tears.

Zowie's eyes drift off. His chest falls and doesn't rise again. He 
falls limp in Drew's arms. Drew hugs Zowie even tighter and he 
begins to weep.

FROM A DISTANCE

WE SEE the image of Drew with the dog cradled in his arms, 
silhouetted against the moonlit horizon.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

53    OMITTED

EXT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - MORNING

Geoff appears from the garage with his bike and takes off for the 
road. A WHISTLE catches his ear.

Drew is at the edge of the woods, beckoning for Geoff.

Geoff circles around and doubles back.

                    GEOFF
          I was just going by your house.
          Where's your bike?

The closer Geoff gets, the more he sees of Drew's despair. Then he 
sees the dried blood staining Drew's clothes.

                    DREW
          Zowie's dead.

Geoff's heart sinks. An unspoken moment of sympathy passes between 
the boys. Fighting the emotions, Drew finally speaks.

                    DREW
          I have to bury him. I don't want
          to go out there alone.

There's such grief in Drew's words that Geoff can't resist. He 
glances toward his house to make sure he hasn't been seen, then 
blends into the woods.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - DAY

Drew carries Zowie's relaxed form in his arms. Geoff is following, 
balancing a pickaxe and shovel.

Arriving at the graveyard, Geoff searches the outer perimeter for 
a vacant stretch of soil. Finding one, he lets the heavy tools 
fall to the ground.

                    GEOFF
          Is this a good spot?

                    DREW
          I'm not burying him here...

                    GEOFF
          Why not?

                    DREW
          There's a better place...

Drew heads for the base of the deadfall, with Zowie in his arms.

                    DREW
          It's back here somewhere, through
          the Indian woods. I know we can
          find it...

Drew continues up the deadfall, disappearing over the crest.

Geoff gathers up the shovel and pickaxe and follows after him.

                    GEOFF
          Hey, wait up!

EXT.  THE BOG - DAY

Geoff climbs over the peak of the deadfall...

Beyond is a dark swamp, A BOG, looking unlike anything one would 
expect in Maine. Tendrils of ground fog swirl about vegetation 
that looks almost prehistoric. Gnarled trees rise up from the 
murky earth, blocking the sun from view.

Geoff hurries down the other side of the deadfall to catch up with 
Drew. Somewhere off in the distance we hear an UNEARTHLY SOUND. 
Not a bird. Not any animal known to man.

Spectral shapes flicker at the edge of Geoff's vision, sinking 
back into the shadows as Geoff tries to focus on them.

                    GEOFF
               (uneasy)
          Drew, where are we going?

Drew doesn't respond. He continues on without another word, hell-
bent on finding this "better place."

FURTHER ALONG - DAY

At the boundary of the bog, A STAIRWAY OF HUGE, WIDE STONES rises 
from the blanket of ground fog. Bordered by fir trees. Leading up 
the hillside. The final leg of Drew and Geoff's journey.

                    DREW
          This is it... I wasn't sure if it
          even really existed.

                    GEOFF
          What did?

                    DREW
          The old Indian burial ground.

Geoff's eyes move to the stairway of stones.

                    GEOFF
          Come on, that's just a bullshit
          story. You said so yourself...

                    DREW
          What if it's not bullshit? If I
          bury Zowie there, and it works...
               (beat)
          ...he'll come back alive.

                    GEOFF
          Drew, I know your dog died, but...
          get a grip, man, you're freaking
          me out.

                    DREW
          Look, if there was even one chance
          in a million it'd work, wouldn't
          you want to try?

Geoff feels for Drew. It's pointless to reason.

Drew starts up the stone steps. Geoff has no choice but to follow.

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - DAY

Even in broad daylight, the flat-topped mesa has a sense of 
foreboding isolation. There's an almost palpable sense of 
"wrongness" about this place. As if the darkness of a dying black 
hole was seeping out of the ground and spreading across the earth.

Drew and Geoff approach the circle of rocky soil. They stand at 
the border, looking it over in eerie silence.

Somewhere off in the distance we hear the unearthly SOUND again, 
only this time, it's closer.

                    GEOFF
          Look, let's just get this over
          with.

Even Drew seems to have awakened from the haze he had fallen into. 
He gently sets Zowie's body on the ground.

                    DREW
          If this doesn't work... don't ever
          tell anyone I did this, okay? You
          gotta promise...

Geoff nods and hands over the digging tools. Drew swings the 
pickaxe, sinking it into the ground.

                    GEOFF
          You want me to help?

                    DREW
          You have to bury your own. That's
          the way the Indians did it. It's
          like a rule...

Backing away from the burial ground, Geoff takes a seat on a rock 
at the border of the forest. From there, he watches.

Drew alternates the pickaxe and shovel as he clears a hole in the 
rocky ground.

WE MOVE IN ON GEOFF, who's looking on with skeptical intrigue as 
the rhythmic SOUND of the tools continues.

59    OMITTED

LATER -

A cairn is complete: a conical pile of rocks over Zowie's grave.

Drew is now sitting on the rock next to Geoff. Together, they 
stare at the cairn as if Zowie might climb from beneath at any 
moment.

                    DREW
          What if he really does come back?

Geoff shrugs, pondering such a thought.

Geoff digs into his pocket and produces a pack of gum, offering 
one to Drew. With only a quick glance away from the grave, Drew 
snatches a piece and he stuffs it into his mouth. Geoff does the 
same.

They sit together in silence. Nervously chewing their gum. 
Watching the grave.

                    DREW
          I've never had anyone die
          before...
               (beat)
          ...but I guess you get over it. I
          mean, eventually...

                    GEOFF
               (quietly)
          You never get over it.

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - AFTERNOON

The sun dips over the horizon, giving way to dusk.

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - DUSK

Geoff's eyes shift from the grave to the darkening sky.

                    GEOFF
          It's getting pretty late. We
          better go.

                    DREW
               (disappointed)
          Yeah...

They rise, leaving the burial ground. En route, Drew pauses for a 
last look at the grave.

                    DREW
          So long, Zowie...

Geoff follows, glancing back at the burial ground. It looks 
magical in the twilight, not quite so sinister now.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT

Drew is walking home along the road, alone.

Headlights blind him as a car approaches. It slows and pulls a U-
turn, stopping at Drew's side. It's Gus' squad car. He pushes open 
the passenger door.

                    GUS
          Get in.

Drew takes a step back, shaking his head.

                    GUS
          Your momma's worried sick over
          you. You take off in the middle
          of the night, you don't show up
          for school. What're you trying to
          prove?

                    DREW
          I'm not trying to prove anything.
               (beat)
          I was burying my dog.

Gus turns his eyes away, focusing on the dark road ahead.

                    GUS
          Life is full of lessons. No one's
          above it. Not you. Not me...
          Now get in the car.

After a moment, Drew approaches the car. Without another word, Gus 
drives off.

64    OMITTED

EXT.  RABBIT CAGE - NIGHT

It's quiet now. And out of the silence comes the JINGLING of 
Zowie's dog tags. Zowie's LONG SHADOW creeps over the cage, 
distorted to monstrous proportion by the flickering light.

We move past the cages to the back porch...

We see ZOWIE'S PAW scratching at the door.

INT.  AMANDA AND GUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Amanda wakens with a start. She rises, eyes focusing on the dark 
bedroom. Gus is sound asleep next to her. Then, from outside, we 
faintly hear ZOWIE'S SCRATCHING.

Slowly, Amanda rises from bed, pulling on a bathrobe as she heads 
for the door.

EXT.  BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Amanda appears at the door. She unlatches it, stepping outside.

                    AMANDA
          Zowie?

Amanda looks down and SCREAMS.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Photos of Drew with Zowie are tacked on the wall above the bed. 
The one photo of Drew, Amanda and Gus has been altered with a cut-
out head of Zowie's pasted on Gus' shoulders.

WE FIND Drew below. He's fallen asleep with his Walkman on. Even 
with his ears covered, the POUNDING at the door jolts him awake. 
Half asleep, Drew peels off the headphones.

                    GUS (O.S.)
          Drew, you unlock this door! Right
          now!

                    AMANDA (O.S.)
          Unlock it, Drew!

The anger in his mother's voice brings him off the bed. Gus' 
POUNDING continues.

Drew moves to the door. The inside is secured by a double dead 
bolt. Instead of unlocking them, he opens a tiny, customized 
window which gives him a view of the hall.

                    DREW
          What did I do now?

                    AMANDA
          Open the door, Drew.

Drew unlatches the deadbolts and steps back as Gus bursts through 
the door.

                    GUS
          Where do you come off lying like
          that? "I'm burying my dog." You
          think a lie like that's never
          gonna catch up to you?

Drew backs into the bed, taking a seat.

Amanda comes through the door, and behind her is...

ZOWIE

This is our first glimpse of the resurrected dog. Fur shiny and 
wet, the gaping gunshot wound in his rear. Zowie's head hangs low, 
his eyes GLEAMING RED. The husky is covered with dirt from head to 
toe.

Drew's eyes widen in astonishment.

Zowie staggers across the room towards Drew, nails clicking on the 
floorboards. Drew shrinks back in uncertain horror as the dog 
moves closer.

Zowie absently throws his arms up onto the bed, across Drew's lap. 
And slowly, perfunctory, his tongue licks Drew's cheek. This last 
action of Zowie displaces Drew's fear. Tears well up in the boy's 
eyes.

                    DREW
               (a whisper)
          Zowie...

                    GUS
          Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going
          outside. You're grounded, buddy.
          That's the new law.

Drew lifts his hand from stroking Zowie's fur. His palm is covered 
with muddy blood.

                    AMANDA
          I never knew an open wound could
          smell so bad...
               (beat)
          Honey, he should have been looked
          at this morning. I don't know
          what you were thinking. It's a
          wonder he's still alive.

Drew gazes into the dog's vacant eyes. It truly is a wonder.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Chase enters and stops in the doorway.

Geoff sits in front of the television with a pile of videotapes 
next to him. He's scanning through Renee's old movies with the 
remote. The sound has been turned down and the effect is a little 
eerie.

ON THE SCREEN

We see RENEE move through a scene. Geoff hits the slo-mo button 
and the image winds down. Renee's face. HER EYES stare out at us 
from the alien universe of the past.

                    CHASE
               (gently)
          Geoff...

Geoff doesn't respond. He's captivated by Renee.

Chase moves into the room.

                    CHASE
          Geoff!

Geoff PAUSES the tape. Renee freezes, the image flickering ever so 
slightly. For an instant, we think we see a FLASH OF Renee being 
electrocuted. But it's only an instant.

Finally, Geoff tears his eyes away from the screen, resenting his 
father's intrusion.

                    GEOFF
          What?

                    CHASE
          You alright?

Geoff's face softens. He nods.

                    GEOFF
          Dad... do you think...
               (beat)
          ...you think you and Mom would've
          gotten back together?

Chase draws closer. He takes a seat next to Geoff. The pain in his 
son's eyes is almost more than he can stand.

                    CHASE
          I think so.

                    CHASE
               (continuing)
          Your Mom and I loved each other,
          Geoff. Don't ever think that we
          didn't.

                    GEOFF
          I still can't believe she's
          dead...

Chase moves to reach for his son, and suddenly the phone RINGS, 
shattering the moment.

Chase hesitates, but finally he rises and answers the phone.

After a moment, he returns.
                    GEOFF
          Who was that?

                    CHASE
          Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He
          got hurt again. I'm going over to
          take a look at him.

Geoff's eyes widen. He looks like a ghost walked over his grave.

                    GEOFF
          I'm going with you.

Chase nods and exits to get his coat.

Geoff looks back at the TV once more. The image paused.

Renee staring at us from beyond the grave.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gus, Amanda, Drew and Geoff are gathered around Chase's van.

EXT./INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT

Chase lays Zowie on his side on an examining table and shines an 
overhead light onto the wound.

Geoff is looking in from outside, utterly bewildered by the 
living, breathing dog.

                    CHASE
          How'd it happen?

Gus casts a threatening glance in Drew's direction.

                    DREW
               (glaring at Gus)
          Some psycho hunter probably got
          trigger happy...

Chase is too busy preparing a syringe to notice the nonverbal 
exchange.

                    CHASE
          I'm going to give Zowie a local
          anaesthetic so I can clean up the
          wound. I'd like to take him home
          tonight for observation.

                    AMANDA
          Fine.

                    DREW
          Can you keep him at your place
          until he gets better?

                    CHASE
          Sure...

Drew tenderly strokes Zowie's mane as Chase administers the 
injection. Zowie stares up at Geoff with dull, blank eyes.

Drew reads Geoff's bewilderment and joins him outside the van. 
Their words are clear, but whispered.

                    GEOFF
          Maybe he wasn't dead when we
          buried him.

                    DREW
          He was dead. You know he was.

Geoff returns his stare to Zowie.

                    DREW
          You can't tell anyone, Geoff.
          Ever.

Geoff looks into Drew's eyes and nods in understanding.

INT.  GEOFF'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tiger is curled up at the foot of Geoff's bed. Geoff climbs in, 
careful not to disturb the kitten. As he lays his head back on the 
pillow...

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Sleep tight, darling. I'll be
          with you soon.

It's a woman's VOICE. A familiar one. Now we hear the rhythmic 
CREAK of a rocking chair. And with it comes the voice again, 
humming a HAUNTING LULLABY.

Wide-eyed, Geoff turns his head toward the source...

A WOMAN'S NONDESCRIPT FORM is seated in the rocking chair across 
the room. Rocking forward, her face passes into a swath of 
moonlight...

It's Renee. With the rock of the chair, her face recedes back into 
the shadows. Her soothing HUM remains.

And again, her face passes into the swath of light. And again it 
retreats.

Geoff raises his hand, reaching out for her.

Renee's hand rises from the shadows, reaching for him.

But suddenly, THE ROOM BEGINS TO STRETCH.

The rocking chair and the bed seem distanced like polar extremes, 
mother and son hopelessly separated by forces beyond their 
control.

LIGHTNING FLASHES in the bedside window. Renee is falling farther 
and farther away.

                    GEOFF
          Mom!!!

Geoff leaps from his bed as the darkness closes in and...

GEOFF

bolts up from his pillow. Awake now, face wet with perspiration. 
It was a nightmare. Except, if it was a nightmare, why do we still 
hear...

...the steady CREAK of the rocking chair.

Geoff slowly turns his head once again, repeating the actions of 
his dreams.

In the shadows, the chair is still rocking. As it comes forward 
into the moonlight, we see ZOWIE, curled up asleep on the seat of 
the chair.

Tiger is not on the bed anymore. She's up on top of the bookcase 
now, wide awake, eyes fixed on the dog. She HISSES.

Geoff stares at the rocking chair, petrified.

INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY

Chase strips off the bandage over Zowie's rear end. The wound is 
gooey and open.

Geoff reads the concern in Chase's expression. Drew is right there 
at Geoff's side, looking on.

                    DREW
          What's the deal?

                    CHASE
          I don't know. He's had three
          days. His immune system should've
          responded by now...

Chase puts on his stethoscope and checks under the dog's rib-cage 
for a pulse. He checks a number of places, then shakes his head, 
totally confused.

                    CHASE
          I can't seem to find a pulse... it
          must be so weak, it's not
          registering...

Geoff and Drew share conspiratorial glances as Chase sets the 
stethoscope aside and extracts a blood sample.

Chase labels the capped vial of blood "ZOWIE" and carefully places 
it into a packing container. When he closes the lid, we see the 
preaddressed label:

               UNIVERSITY OF MAINE
          School of Veterinary Medicine
               Lab Samples Enclosed

Uncomfortable with Chase's investigation, Geoff reaches for Zowie.

                    GEOFF
          We'll take him back to the
          kennels, Dad.

78A   OMITTED

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DUSK

THE KITTENS ARE HISSING, shrinking to the back of their kennel.

Zowie stands motionless before their cage, gazing in at them.

Geoff and Drew are nearby, putting the finishing touches on the 
bedding inside a larger boarding kennel.

                    GEOFF
          You think my Dad'll figure out why
          he's not getting better?

                    DREW
          You think he'd believe it if he
          did?

One of the kittens SPATS fearfully at Zowie. Geoff turns to stare 
at Zowie.

                    GEOFF
          How can he not have a heartbeat?

                    DREW
               (worried)
          Maybe it takes a while...

Drew lifts Zowie into the kennel. Geoff secures the door, 
something that clearly must be done from the outside.

Zowie immediately begins to pace back and forth inside the cage. 
He turns towards us and we...

                                        CUT TO:

EXT.  TOWN, CHASE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A SNARLING WEREWOLF rushing at us.

Chase jumps back, frightened out of his wits and we realize...

The werewolf is part of a group of COSTUMED KIDS out trick-or-
treating. The kids LAUGH at Chase's reaction and hurry on, 
dragging their candy loot bags behind them.

Chase sighs and turns to lock the office door. He's closing up for 
the night.

He climbs into his Mobile Vet Van. We HOLD ON the new sign in the 
back window: "A HALLOWEEN TREAT. FREE KITTENS." Beneath that is a 
pencil-sketch of a black arched-back kitten.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Marjorie and Geoff are at the kitchen table with the remnants of 
dinner. Geoff is doing last-minute touches on his costume.

Marjorie looks over his costume. He's got a hockey mask pushed 
back onto the top of his head.

                    MARJORIE
          So who're you going as, Wayne
          Gretzky?

For effect, Geoff slips the hockey mask down over his face before 
answering.

                    GEOFF
          I'm going as Jason.

                    MARJORIE
          Jason? Who's he play for?

                    GEOFF
          He doesn't. He hacks people up.

Geoff checks his watch.

                    GEOFF
          I'm late.

As Geoff heads for the door, Chase is just coming in for the 
evening.

                    CHASE
          Hey! Where're you off to?

                    GEOFF
          I'm going out, Dad!

Geoff ducks out the door. Chase turns to Marjorie.

                    CHASE
          Out?

                    MARJORIE
          He's probably going up to the Pet
          Sematary. Kids've been going out
          there on Halloween night for
          years.

                    CHASE
          What do they do up there?

                    MARJORIE
          Oh, you know... drink beer, tell
          ghost stories. They try and spook
          each other out, talking about
          zombies and things...
               (she shrugs)
          It's no big deal, Chase. I did it
          when I was young.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Drew is at the bathroom mirror.

                    AMANDA
          Hold still. Hold still.

Amanda puts the finishing touches of color on Drew's lips. She's 
done an alarmingly good job of turning Drew into THE JOKER.

                    AMANDA
          You make sure you're home by ten.
          If Gus finds out I let you go...

                    DREW
               (sighs)
          I'll be home, Mom. Don't worry.
          I won't let Gus blow up again...

Amanda looks Drew straight in the eyes.

                    AMANDA
          Drew, I know Gus isn't your
          father, but you never even knew
          your real father. He walked out
          on the both of us, and you
          remember that.
               (beat)
          Gus isn't that way. He has it in
          him to love us both. You just
          have to give him a chance...

Drew nods respectfully. Amanda gives him a kiss. Drawing back, she 
rubs out the lipmarks she's left on his made-up cheek.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

Dark clouds paint the foreboding sky. A broken pulse of lightning 
streaks through the dense haze.

Abandoning their bikes next to the path, Drew and Geoff approach 
the archway. The graveyard beyond is deathly silent.

They pass beneath the archway, entering the clearing.

And now, a soft, chilling VOICE drifts over the graves.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Geoff, honey. Mommy's here...

Geoff freezes in his tracks, awestruck as...

A WOMAN'S BODY

swoops down from the darkness above, materializing out of nowhere. 
A fluttering negligee. Flowing blonde hair.

RENEE'S FACE appears out of the shadows, masked with sadness.

Geoff swallows the lump in his throat.

Renee's form keeps coming. But even as she approaches, her visage 
grows less distinguishable. Just a phantom countenance now. A 
shadow framed by golden hair, resting atop a veiled body...

She's coming so fast that she's upon Geoff in no time. He fumbles 
back, startled out of his wits...

THE BODY is upon him now, flailing wildly. Geoff thrashes and 
struggles, screaming bloody murder.

Gradually, he realizes the body isn't fighting back. Geoff eases 
his struggle, lets his scream fall off.

Now he hears wild, mischievous LAUGHTER.

Drew pulls the body away. It's just a heavy wad of stuffed 
clothing: A DUMMY dressed in a negligee, capped by a blonde wig. 
It dangles near the end of a slanted wire.

Clyde, Stevie, Brad, and a half dozen other costumed KIDS appear 
from the nearby cover of bushes, doubled over in laughter.

Clyde tugs at a piece of twine that's connected to the back of the 
dummy's head and makes spooky sounds. The dummy jumps around on 
the slanted wire.

Clyde drops the dummy and saunters forward.

                    CLYDE
          Look at this, Junior here
          practically shit his pants.

Clyde drops down, nose to nose with Geoff, who's still recovering.

                    CLYDE
          Maybe you're too chicken to hang
          out with the rest of the boys.
          You gonna run home to Daddy now?

Geoff brushes himself off and rises to his feet. He stares into 
Clyde's eyes.

                    GEOFF
          Fuck off.

Geoff pushes past Clyde and moves on into the graveyard, somehow 
managing to keep his dignity intact.

Drew follows, then the rest of the boys, leaving Clyde staring 
after them, standing alone with the dummy.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gus' squad car slows to a stop outside. Gus swings open the door 
and ambles toward the porch.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Amanda draws back from the window, mortified. She nervously 
crosses to the refrigerator and grabs a beer, turning as Gus 
enters.

                    AMANDA
          You're home early.

                    GUS
          Nope. Just ran out of smokes.

Gus opens a kitchen drawer and fishes for a pack of cigarettes. He 
fires one up.

                    GUS
          Where's the boy?

Amanda squirms.

                    AMANDA
          Uh... in his room...

Gus tightens his brow, casting a suspicious eye.

A sickened look flushes through Amanda as Gus pulls his eyes away 
from her and marches upstairs.

                    GUS (O.S.)
          DREW!

His feet POUND down the hallway. Silence for an instant. Then the 
powerful swing of Drew's door. Followed by Gus' hastened return 
down the hallway. And as he hustles down the stairs...

                    GUS
          God damn it, Amanda! You want me
          to be a father to the boy, and as
          soon as I lay down the law, you
          let him break it!

Gus stops before Amanda.

                    GUS
          Where is he?

One step away from terror, Amanda shakes her head. Gus loses his 
patience. He rips the can of beer from her grip and sends it 
flying across the room.

                    GUS
          WHERE IS YOUR SON!?

Amanda sighs in quiet defeat.

                    AMANDA
          The Pet Sematary.

Gus turns away and heads out the door.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Wheels spin as Gus' squad car streaks off into the night. The 
cherry top glows to life, bombarding the countryside.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

By now, nearly TWO DOZEN COSTUMED KIDS have gathered at the Pet 
Sematary. In the midst of the graves, a small story-telling 
campfire burns. A number of the boys sip beer, trying to pretend 
that the bitter after-taste doesn't bother them.

Clyde sits up front. At fourteen, he's the elder statesmen of the 
group. With a beer in one hand, and a cigarette in the other, 
Clyde is just finishing up a spooky yarn.

                    CLYDE
          ...yeah, that old Louis was one
          sick fuck... digging up little Gage
          like so, maggots pouring out of
          that kid's eyes...

Clyde whistles. He drags on his cigarette and puffs out a smoke 
ring. Sees he still has an audience.

                    CLYDE
          Ellie was the only Creed that
          lived. Then one night a few
          months later, Ellie freaks out,
          and she hacks up her grandparents
          with an axe!
               (beat)
          Police found her licking their
          brains off the blade... They
          locked her up in a psycho ward and
          all she said were two words: 'Pet
          Sematary. Pet Sematary.'

Clyde stares at the wide-eyed kids. He grins, takes a swig of 
beer, and moves in for the kicker.

                    CLYDE
          Oh yeah! Almost forgot! Here's
          the best part. Two nights ago she
          escapes. Word is, she was heading
          for Maine. Man I hope she doesn't
          show up out here.
               (feigning concern)
          Shit, we wouldn't even notice her,
          not if she's wearing a costume.
          She could be one of us...

Clyde casts a suspicious eye on the group. The kids uneasily look 
at each other, making sure they know who's behind each and every 
costume.

Suddenly Clyde drops his jaw in exaggerated horror.

                    CLYDE
          Oh my Goddd!!!

Clyde lifts a trembling finger, pointing beyond the group of 
spellbound listeners.

                    CLYDE
          It's... It's...

The kids are afraid to turn around, assuming Clyde's rigged up 
some unspeakable terror...

And for an instant, a look of real horror washes over Clyde's 
face...

A FIGURE

Is coming up the path beneath the archway, rising out of the 
swirling mist. A frightening silhouette, backlit by the moon.

But then Clyde realizes who it is.

                    CLYDE
          Shit! It's Drew's Dad. It's
          fuckin' Gus!

Drew and the others quickly turn around, realizing it's not part 
of the punch-line scare.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

The kids quickly scramble for hiding places in the bordering 
brush, dropping their beer cans as fast as they can.

As Drew leaps to his feet, he upsets the fire, knocking one of the 
logs. A FLAMING EMBER rolls to the base of one of the brittle old 
crosses.

Drew and Geoff run for it.

EXT.  PATH, ARCHWAY - NIGHT

Gus moves quickly up the meandering path, sending the blinding 
beam of his flashlight over the graves.

                    GUS
          You boys better not be drinking!

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

Through the thick woods, Drew is flanked by Geoff and Clyde.

                    DREW
          Oh man, he's gonna kick my ass...

Drew starts to take off. Clyde trips him on his first stride. Drew 
hits the dirt.

                    CLYDE
          Thanks for fucking up our
          Halloween, dumbshit!

Clyde recedes into the woods as Gus approaches the campfire. He 
scans the area with his flashlight, illuminating the various beer 
cans.

                    GUS
          Drew, you get your ass out here!
          Front and center!

Geoff pulls Drew to his feet.

Gus passes the flashlight over the woods. Kids duck away, 
retreating from their hiding places...

The flashlight sweeps toward Drew.

Drew freezes, spotlighted by Gus' beam. A burst of LIGHTNING 
floods Drew's horrified face.

                    GUS
          Get out here, Joker.

Geoff remains frozen in the woods nearby, out of Gus' light.

Behind Gus, the wooden cross is completely on fire now.

                    GUS
          You out here making a fool of me?

Drew shakes his head in instant denial.

                    GUS
          I'm warning you, buddy! You don't
          play by the rules, I'm gonna
          shadow your ass for eternity!

Drew makes a break from his spot in the woods. He weaves through 
the markers, arcing around the outer perimeter to avoid Gus...

...but Gus is quicker. He zigzags through the crosses and 
headstones to intercept Drew.

Gus gets a handful of Drew's collar and yanks him in.

                    GUS
          You little shit!

Gus draws his free arm back and smacks Drew across the face. Drew 
goes down.

GEOFF

is looking on from the woods, horrified. Torn...

DREW

cowers on the ground, trying to scramble away.

Geoff bolts out into the firelight, staring defiantly at Gus in 
silent accusation.

Gus is beyond furious. LIGHTNING flashes again.

                    GUS
          You get out of here, Geoff
          Matthews! This is between me and
          my boy!

Geoff doesn't move. Gus starts to advance forward...

...but the GROWL emanating from the woods gives him pause. 
Everyone turns...

A RUSTLING is heard in the bushes, and Zowie emerges into the 
building firelight, flashing his fangs at Gus. His eyes GLOW RED.

Gus freezes, studying Zowie.

Zowie inches forward, poised for the attack.

                    GUS
          Call off your dog, Drew.

Drew shifts his eyes from Zowie to Gus, too terrified to heed such 
a command.

Zowie brushes past Drew and Geoff, moving in on Gus.

Gus' eyes shift to burning cross at his side. With a swift boot, 
he kicks over the cross and presses it into his grip.

Swinging the cross like a primitive weapon, Gus connects with the 
side of Zowie's head.

Zowie spins a full circle from the impact. But he lands on all 
fours. Unphased. Taking the next step toward Gus. There's 
something clearly not of this world in Zowie's vicious stare.

                    GUS
               (terrified)
          Drew, call him off!

All Drew can manage is a faint appeal.

                    DREW
          Zowie...

Zowie goes for Gus, launching into the air...

                    GUS
          DREW!

...and sinking his glistening fangs into Gus' neck.

AN ERUPTION OF BLOOD showers the closest headstone.

Gus comes helplessly tumbling down with the weight of the dog. His 
SCREAMS are suddenly cut short as Zowie rips out his throat. His 
arms flail weakly at his sides, then grow still.

Drew and Geoff stare at the scene, wide-eyed with shock.

Zowie looks up from Gus' neck with dripping, red fangs. For a 
moment, his eyes settle on Drew. Then Zowie bolts off, 
disappearing into the night.

                    DREW
          Oh, God. Oh, God...

Drew's eyes shift to Geoff, whose face is flushed with sickened 
fear.

                    GEOFF
               (a whisper)
          Is he dead?

In dazed shock, Drew moves in for a closer look at the body.

Gus' eyes are wide open. Blood is still pumping in rhythm from his 
jugular with each weakening beat of his heart. It's a gruesome 
image against the roaring fire.

Drew kneels at Gus' side. He wants to touch him. To shake him 
awake, but with every attempt, he draws his hand back.

                    GEOFF
          Is he breathing? Can you hear him
          breathing?

Drew leans forward, turning his ear toward Gus' gaping mouth. And 
as he inches closer...

GUS' FINGERS TWITCH

His hand jerks up and closes around Drew's neck. Gus stares up at 
him with his crazed menace.

Drew SCREAMS. His fingers claw at Gus' hand, desperate to pry it 
loose...

...but then, Gus' hand relaxes as his last, dying ounce of 
strength fades away.

Drew shrinks back, crouching over the lifeless body as the blazing 
firelight dances over it. He turns his tear-filled gaze to Geoff.

                    DREW
          Oh man, Geoff... we killed him...
          we killed him...
               (beat)
          What're we gonna do?

Geoff draws closer and looks down into the dead man's face.

                    GEOFF
          We could bring him back.

Drew's eyes widen at the suggestion.

And now, GAZING DOWN on Gus' body, and on the boys, WE PULL UP 
INTO A SLOW SPIRAL...

We move ever higher, until we are LOOKING DOWN UPON THE ENTIRE PET 
SEMATARY. At the SOUND of a shovel cutting into rocky soil, we...

                                        CUT TO:

95    OMITTED

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - NIGHT

Three quick shots:

A SHOVEL sinking into the earth.

GUS falling head down into the grave, landing with a heavy THUD.

SOIL covering Gus' lifeless face.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Amanda is pacing back and forth on the porch, checking her watch 
every few steps. She sighs with relief as...

Drew appears from the darkness of the woods.

Drew dismounts his bike and carries it up the front porch steps, 
strangely silent. His clothes and face are caked with dirt.

                    AMANDA
          Jesus, Drew, do you know what time
          it is? Did Gus ever find you?

Drew moves on past her into the house.

                    AMANDA
               (calling after him)
          Drew? Drew, what happened?

                    DREW
               (trying not to lose
               it)
          Nothing happened, Mom. We just
          ditched Gus, that's all...

Drew pauses and stares out into the unknown darkness of the night.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase is in the study, perusing some files. He looks into the 
hallway as Geoff arrives home, then glances at the clock. It's 
late. Very late.

Chase rises. He's both angry and relieved. Right now, though, the 
anger's winning out.

                    CHASE
          Were you drinking?

Geoff absently shakes his head. He slumps back against the wall, 
drained from the night's horrors.

                    CHASE
          Drew's Mom called hours ago, the
          rest of the kids were back by ten.
          Where the hell were you boys?

Geoff shrugs, trying to mask his uneasiness.

                    GEOFF
          Just out.

                    CHASE
          "Out." Well that's great, Geoff.
               (beat)
          Look, I've been letting you get
          away with a lot these past few
          weeks, but I'm not going to stand
          for crap like this. I don't care
          if it's Halloween... it's a school
          night, and if you do this again...

                    GEOFF
               (cutting him off)
          I'm really tired, Dad... can I just
          go to sleep?

Chase stops and looks at his son. Geoff's exhaustion is self-
evident.

                    CHASE
               (sighing)
          Go on... we'll talk about this in
          the morning.

Geoff nods and heads for the stairs.

INT.  GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

THE CLOCK is creeping up on 2AM...

THUNDER rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter 
the window panes.

Geoff's eyelids fall beneath unbearable weight and he nods off to 
sleep. Tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest. 
Slowly, we move back towards the window...

In a flash of LIGHTNING--

GUS' FACE

APPEARS OUTSIDE. Washed in the haunting white glow. Streaked with 
mud. Caked with blood. Staring in at Geoff.

Geoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of THUNDER and whips his 
gaze to the window. Before he can focus...

...the pulse of lightning fades away. And with it, Gus' face. Only 
darkness remains beyond the window pane.

Geoff returns his gaze to the bedroom, unaware of Gus' appearance. 
He sinks back to his pillow, already hurtling towards sleep once 
more.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

MOVING IN ON the house, WE SINGLE OUT a rain-obscured window on 
the ground floor, the window to Drew's bedroom.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Drew is sound asleep, curled up under the sheets. He clutches his 
pillow like a life preserver.

                    GUS (O.S.)
          Drew!

Drew's eyes flutter open. He turns towards the window. Now, he 
hears some activity outside. And then Gus' hushed voice.

                    GUS (O.S.)
          Drew, buddy. I lost my keys.

Drew goes saucer-eyed. He swallows the swelling lump in his throat 
and rises from his bed.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Drew steadies his quivering fingers just enough to sink the key 
into the deadbolt on the back door. Drawing the CREAKING door 
open, he gazes out back.

                    DREW
               (scared shitless)
          Gus?

Nothing moves outside. The longer Drew watches, the more eerie 
each shadow becomes. Spooked, Drew steps back inside, quickly 
closing the door. He locks it back up again.

When he turns around, he's face to face with GUS.

Drew stiffens, backing into the wall.

                    DREW
          H-how'd you get in?

Gus offers a nightmarish grin and raises his hand, dangling his 
keys.

                    GUS
          Found 'em.

Drew's eyes follow a flow of blood from Gus' neck to the floor. 
Gus looks down at his dirty, bloody footprints. He's tracked blood 
all over the linoleum.

                    GUS
          I'm makin' a mess of your mother's
          kitchen floor...
               (beat)
          I need a shower...

Gus turns without another word and heads for the stairs.

Drew's mouth drops in utter astonishment as he watches Gus 
clumsily climbing the stairs.

After a moment, he returns his attention to the bloody kitchen 
floor. Tearing off a wad of paper towels, he wets them and begins 
to mop up Gus' tracks.

103   OMITTED

AT THE MIRROR - NIGHT

Gazing vacantly at his reflection, Gus covers his ravaged throat 
with a gauze strip, wrapping it around the circumference of his 
neck again and again and again.

Behind him, the shower is running, filling up the bathroom with 
steam.

Finishing the dressing off with a sloppy tape job, Gus reaches for 
the pajamas hanging nearby. He lazily buttons the buttons, failing 
to notice their alignment is off. He never did bother to shower. 
He's still covered with mud.

INT.  AMANDA AND GUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gus enters from the steamy bathroom. The shower is still running.

Amanda stirs, sleepy eyes focusing on him.

                    AMANDA
          Gus, hon. I'm sorry about
          tonight. You coming to bed?

Gus lifts the covers and climbs in. With him comes the chill of 
death. Gus presses up behind her. His hand moves beneath the 
sheets, finding its way over the curve of her waist, caressing. 
Amanda shivers.

                    AMANDA
          God, you're ice cold...
               (turning)
          ...and you smell! Lord, what did
          you get yourself into?

It's then that Amanda sees the bandage around Gus' neck. Blood is 
seeping through the gauze.

                    AMANDA
          My God, Gus, what happened?

Amanda reaches out to touch him, but Gus stops her hand short of 
the bandage. Instead, he leans forward and clutches one of her 
breasts.

Amanda tries to twist away.

                    AMANDA
          Gus... stop it! What's wrong with
          you?!

But Gus doesn't stop. He throws himself on top of Amanda, roughly 
forcing her back onto the bed.

                    AMANDA
          Gus!!!

Amanda's hands beat at Gus' face and back, to no apparent effect. 
With one arm forced against Amanda's throat, he rips open her 
nightgown with the other.

We pull away from Amanda's struggles, back to the bathroom. The 
shower running on and on, cloaking the bedroom in steam.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Geoff is riding along the highway, his backpack full of school 
books. Drew is waiting on the shoulder ahead. When Geoff 
approaches, Drew hops on his bike, getting up to speed.

WITH THE BOYS - RIDING

Geoff keeps glancing at Drew, waiting for him to say something. 
Drew maintains his enigmatic expression.

                    GEOFF
          Well?

Drew nods. Geoff's eyes widen in disbelief.

                    DREW
          Picture this... Gus comes down to
          breakfast and he doesn't say a
          word. He even kind of smiles,
          like he forgot he hates me. And
          then you know what he does? He
          serves me an extra helping of
          pancakes...
               (beat)
          I asked him if I was still
          grounded... "no." I asked him if
          you could spend the night, and he
          nods. It's like we're a family.
          A real family.

The words have their own meaning for Geoff, who stares to the road 
ahead in deep thought.

                    DREW
          It's weird...

                    GEOFF
          What do you mean?

                    DREW
          It's like he's not Gus anymore.
          He's different. You know, like
          Zowie...

They share a chuckle that ends in silent uneasiness.

INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY

Chase enters with a stack of files tucked under his arm. As he 
organizes them in the large filing cabinet with the others, he 
listens to his messages on the answering machine.

The current caller sounds a little annoyed...

                    MESSAGE MACHINE
          ...Doctor Matthews, this is
          Elliot Rudman at the university.
          I've looked over the blood
          specimen you sent us on canine
          Zowie...

Chase abandons the filing and immediately returns the call. While 
it RINGS...

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Knock, Knock, Doc.

A MOTHER and TWO TODDLERS are standing in the doorway to Chase's 
office, trying not to intrude on his call.

                    MOTHER
               (quiet whisper)
          We saw your sign. Are there any
          kitties left?

Chase studies them. They look like decent people.

                    CHASE
          Take your pick. They're in the
          boarding area. You can go on
          back.

Chase turns away as his phone call is answered.

                    CHASE
          Elliot, it's Chase...

INT.  LAB/INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE (INTERCUT) - DAY

ELLIOT RUDMAN has the phone tucked under his chin, in the midst of 
an autopsy. The WHIRR of the saw drowns out his words as he shaves 
the dome off a dog's skull.

                    CHASE
          I didn't get that...

The pathologist turns off the saw. His words become audible.

                    RUDMAN
          ...I said next time it might help
          if you took the blood sample while
          the animal was still alive...

The comment hits Chase out of left field.

                    CHASE
          What?

                    RUDMAN
          I don't know what you expected to
          find, Matthews. There's nothing
          wrong with the antigens, nothing
          to indicate an unusual death...

                    CHASE
          Wait, there must be some mix-up.
          He was... the dog is alive.

                    RUDMAN
          Not this dog. There wasn't enough
          oxygen in those red cells to pump
          life into a flea.

Chase is baffled, speechless.

                    RUDMAN
          You took over for Doctor Yolander?

                    CHASE
          Yes... why?

                    RUDMAN
          Because the last person that sent
          me blood from a dead animal was
          Yolander...

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY

The kennels have been cleaned up, but the room retains its eerie, 
dimly lit quality.

The DRIP of a faucet reverberates from the far corner.

The mother enters with a toddler clinging to each hand. Their 
smiles fade at the unsettling surroundings. Slowly, they move down 
the row of kennels.

                    TODDLER
          Where are the kitties?

INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY

                    CHASE
               (into the phone)
          Look, this is ridiculous...

Suddenly, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS pierce the air. Chase drops the 
phone and rushes out of the office...

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY

The toddlers are screaming at the top of their lungs. Mom is 
burying their heads in her dress.

Chase bursts in as the mother hastily retreats for the exit. Her 
horrified eyes flash by Chase. In an instant, she and the toddlers 
are gone.

Chase remains alone, moving down the long row of kennels with 
mounting trepidation...

Zowie's cage is empty.

Chase shifts his troubled gaze to the...

DRIP DRIP DRIP... as a PUDDLE OF BLOOD forms on the floor.

Chase raises his eyes...

THE KITTENS' KENNEL -

Nothing but bloody ribbons of torn flesh are left of the kittens, 
dangling from the grid gate. DRIPPING.

Chase looks away as a new level of fear runs through him.

                    CHASE
          Jesus...

It's too gruesome even for a man of Chase's background. Fighting 
the gag reflex, he searches the room for the missing dog...

...and then he spots the broken glass window vent along the floor. 
And the pile of blood-spattered shards laying on the tile.

EXT.  SCHOOL, STREET - DAY

Clyde, Stevie, and Brad are loitering near the front bike racks. 
Clyde's smoking away.

As Geoff and Drew come out of the school, the trio moves to 
intercept them.

                    CLYDE
          Hey!

Just then, Chase's van pulls at the curb, interrupting whatever 
trouble was about to happen.

Clyde looks from the van to Geoff, and falls back.

                    DREW
          Saved by the bell...

Chase hurriedly rolls down the passenger window as Geoff and Drew 
approach.

                    GEOFF
          Can I sleep over at Drew's
          tonight?

Chase is preoccupied with other concerns.

                    CHASE
          Yeah... that's fine...
               (beat)
          Listen, Drew, I got the tests back
          on Zowie. He's not well. Don't
          ask me how, but he got out this
          afternoon...

Geoff and Drew exchange concerned looks.

                    CHASE
          If he finds his way home, call me,
          no matter what the hour, okay? And
          don't try to approach him.
          Whatever he's got might be 
          infectious. Understand?

The boys nod their heads.

Chase masks his anxiety with a weary smile. With a wave, he speeds 
up, leaving the boys.

INT.  CHASE'S VAN - MOVING

A MAP of Maine is unfolded on the passenger seat. Chase is on the 
car phone.

                    CHASE
          Can I have the address for Quentin
          Yolander?

Chase jots an address down on the map. He turns the van up a 
mountain road, winding through the towering pines.

EXT.  YOLANDER'S CABIN - DAY

A remote, rustic dwelling nestled into the desolate backwoods.

INT.  YOLANDER'S CABIN - DAY

QUENTIN YOLANDER rocks back in his thick hide chair. His world is 
closed off from daylight by the extensive blinds.

He's holding a SMALL POODLE in his lap. Its big brown eyes are 
staring back at him.

                    YOLANDER
          You'd be so much more interesting
          with blue eyes...

And now, ONE OF THE POODLE'S EYES POPS OUT. Yolander's finger 
comes through from beneath the eye socket.

On closer examination, WE REALIZE that the dog is not alive at 
all. Yolander has his hand inside the hollowed-out carcass.

He carefully looks over a container of glass eyes on his desk and 
selects the right shade of blue. A shot of whiskey rests nearby.

Yolander reaches up into the poodle's belly and fits the blue eyes 
securely into place.

There's a KNOCK at the door. Yolander ignores it. Maybe he's deaf. 
Another KNOCK. Yolander turns towards the door, annoyed at the 
intrusion. And behind that annoyance, there's a touch of madness.

PULLING BACK, we see the rest of the room. Stuffed animals are 
crowded from floor to ceiling. A product of Yolander's obsession 
with TAXIDERMY.

                    YOLANDER
          I'm immortalizing a poodle. State
          your business!

Yolander presses some stuffing into the poodle's gut and begins to 
sew up the stomach.

                    CHASE (O.S.)
          Doctor Yolander. This is Chase
          Matthews. I've moved into your
          offices in Ludlow...

Yolander's attention remains on the needle as he meticulously 
stitches the belly.

                    CHASE (O.S.)
               (continuing)
          ...I sent a blood sample out for
          analysis. They tell me I sent
          them the blood of a dead animal...

At this, Yolander breaks his concentration. The needle pricks his 
hand. Blood oozes from the puncture, dripping onto the dog's 
stomach.

                    CHASE (O.S.)
          ...a dog...

Yolander rises from his seat and swings open the door.

Chase stands in the doorway, startled. It doesn't take a genius to 
figure out that the good Doctor is drunk.

                    YOLANDER
               (glaring)
          Why are you bothering me about
          this? Can't you leave it be?

                    CHASE
          I... um...

Chase glances to the right and steps back...

A BOBCAT

is perched nearby, frozen in mid-pounce. It takes a second for 
Chase to register that the bobcat has been stuffed.

Now Chase sees the rest of the room... a whole zoo of stuffed 
animals, looking like a rural version of the Bates Motel.

                    CHASE
               (momentarily thrown)
          ...the pathologist... he said that
          you had reported a similar 
          incident... with a cat...

                    YOLANDER
          The Creed cat, that's right.
          Bastard's name was "Church".
               (grins)
          Let me guess. Your dog's tissue
          isn't healing, pupils aren't
          dilating... maybe you can't find a
          heartbeat?

                    CHASE
          Exactly! I thought it might be
          some sort of blood condition...
          immune deficiency or...

Quentin Yolander laughs. It's disconcerting.

                    YOLANDER
          There's no "blood condition." The
          dog isn't sick, it's dead.
               (drawing closer)
          And so was Creed's cat. And so
          was his wife the night she was
          killed for the second time...

As Yolander moves forward, Chase backs up. He bumps into a whole 
shelf of stuffed creatures. To his right, A RAVEN sits frozen on 
its perch. Chase regards Yolander as being completely insane.

                    YOLANDER
               (menacing)
          You want some advice, friend? You
          get in your car, you pick up your
          family... and you get the hell out
          of that town.

                    CHASE
          Well... uh... thanks...

Chase continues to back out of the door. On his way out, he bumps 
into the stuffed raven's perch...

...only this raven isn't stuffed. It spreads its wings and 
SCREECHES.

Chase just about jumps out of his skin, tripping out of the 
doorway.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gus reaches into the cage and grabs a rabbit by the ears. He 
casually snaps the neck. Laying the limp carcass on a stump 
cutting board, he quickly skins it.

Hanging above the cages, there is now a line of furry pelts. Half 
a dozen.

Drew and Geoff are on the porch, looking on.

                    DREW
          I guess we're having rabbit for
          dinner.

Gus hangs the freshly skinned fur to dry and violently snatches 
another hare from the cage.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The dinner from Hell. Geoff splats a helping of mashed potatoes 
onto his plate, all the while keeping a wary eye on Gus...

Gus is serving himself a chunk of rabbit. It hits the edge of the 
plate, teetering on the rim. He passes the dish on.

Gus meets Geoff's gaze. For a moment, there's a deadened, vacant 
look in Gus' eyes. Then slowly, a limp smile creeps over him, 
sending a chill up Geoff's spine.

Geoff averts Gus' stare. Gus helps himself to potatoes and passes 
the plate on. He lets go of it short of reaching Drew. Only Drew's 
quick hands save it from hitting the table.

Amanda comes to the table with a dish of LIMA BEANS. She casts Gus 
a cold, hateful stare and sets the limas down. She's still angry 
over last night.

Gus dishes a sloppy scoop and passes it toward Drew. Like before, 
he lets it drop too early. This time Drew doesn't save it. The 
lima beans shower the floor.

                    AMANDA
          God damnit, Gus! This isn't
          funny!

Amanda fetches a dishtowel and kneels to clean up the mess.

Geoff and Drew exchange quick glances. As Geoff reaches for the 
salt...

...Gus intercepts his wrist. Geoff gulps.

Gus drops his jaw, revealing a gooey mass of food. But the frozen 
smile and the look in his eyes convey dementia rather than 
playfulness.

Geoff and Drew can't believe their eyes. They laugh uncomfortably. 
There's no other response.

Gus LAUGHS too... awkward, terrible laughter. Spitting out food 
over his shirt and plate as he does so.

The boys stop laughing, but Gus just keeps on going.

Amanda stares at Gus and carries the mess out of the room.

Through his laughter, Gus' bandage has slipped down, exposing part 
of his ragged wound. The wound glistens, oozing CLOTTED BLOOD and 
GOOEY PUS.

Drew hesitantly reaches for Gus' neck, readjusting the bandage.

Grossed out, Geoff averts his eyes and sets his fork aside.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - LATER

Geoff and Drew enter. Drew swiftly secures the deadbolts on his 
door.

                    GEOFF
          What was that all about? You
          think he's trying to scare us?

                    DREW
          I don't know but I'm not taking
          any chances...

Drew opens the chest at the foot of his bed and produces a 
SHOTGUN. A box full of shells spill as he withdraws the gun. 
Cracking open the chamber, Drew loads two shells into the chamber.

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

A moonlit horizon. Unmoving. Silent. The kind of silence that 
pulls at the darkest recesses of imagination.

And now, A LONE FIGURE appears on the horizon. It's Zowie, moving 
at a deliberate pace.

ATOP A KNOLL

Zowie takes pause. The TINKLING of his collar tags resumes as he 
drops over the horizon line, cutting down the hill.

INT.  CHASE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase sits in the den, looking exhausted and disheveled. In front 
of him, the t.v. is on. RENEE'S FACE stares out at us. Chase hits 
the remote and rises, moving to the back door.

He checks the deadbolt, then secures the chain link as a backup. 
From somewhere outside, we hear a DOG HOWL.

Chase's eyes drop to the DOGGY DOOR, a holdover from the previous 
owner. Chase bends down and latches the door.

Now he pauses at his desk... considers... then pulls something out 
of the bottom drawer. It's a gun.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Chase moves to the front of the house, securing that door. 
Satisfied, he turns off the light and heads upstairs...

WE STAY AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS -

MOVING INTO DARKNESS, shadow and form begin to take shape. We hear 
a low GROWL and see a flash of RED EYES. It's Zowie. Already in 
the house.

123   OMITTED

INT.  CHASE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Coming through the door from the downstairs, Chase stops cold.

RENEE is on the bed. Clothed in a negligee. Lying across a blanket 
of rose petals. Her eyes meet his with powerful longing.

                    RENEE
          Chase. I miss you so much...

                    CHASE
               (dry-mouthed)
          Renee...

Chase approaches. Slowly. Fearful that this is all a dream.

Renee reaches out her hand. They touch. This is not a dream.

                    CHASE
          Oh God...

Chase absently sets his gun on the bedside table as Renee draws 
his body to hers.

They kiss. Once. Twice. Not a dream.

Renee rolls Chase over, forcefully climbing on top. Chase sinks 
down into the center of the bed as Renee straddles him.

Slowly, Renee slips off the top of her negligee...

                    RENEE
               (a whisper)
          I can come back, Chase...

...and sinks down on top of him, kissing him hungrily.

Her nipples graze his chest, then her breasts flatten as she 
grinds her hips against his.

Almost instantly, the weight of her grows unbearable. Chase fights 
to pull his mouth from hers, to breathe...

                    CHASE
          No... Too heavy.

There is no pleasure in his words, just unmitigated horror as 
Renee's body comes down on him harder.

                    CHASE
          ...can't breathe... I can't...

CHASE'S EYES

pop open, frenzied, AS HE COMES OUT OF HIS DREAM.

Chase is alone on the bed, but he's still feeling the weight 
pressing down on him...

ZOWIE

is laying on his chest, staring back at him, rearing his teeth in 
a growl...

Zowie LUNGES forward, jaws flashing, and Chase twists sideways...

GNASHING TEETH connect with Chase's shoulder, then with the 
pillows where Chase's head used to be. A BLIZZARD OF DOWN FEATHERS 
ERUPTS...

Chase scrambles out of bed, flailing for the gun on the bedside 
table...

THE GUN spins out of reach and across the floor...

Chase DIVES for the gun and reaches it just as Zowie leaps to the 
floor. In a panic, Chase FIRES WILD...

Zowie abruptly turns and SMASHES through the bedroom window, 
sending glass flying.

EXT.  HOUSE - NIGHT

Zowie slides down the room and leaps to the ground below, 
disappearing into the night.

INT.  CHASE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Chase looks on in terror. Finally he pulls his eyes away from the 
shattered window...

...and catches a glimpse of something in the dresser mirror. 
Something that sends a chill up his spine.

The flurry of down feathers is floating to the mattress. But 
intermingling with the feathers are a handful of ROSE PETALS, 
slowly settling to the bed.

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

Chase is bare-chested at the mirror, applying a dressing to the 
dog bite on his shoulder.

Marjorie appears in the doorway with a basket of laundry. She 
stops short at the sight of Chase standing there in his boxers.

Chase catches her reflection in the mirror and is startled.

                    MARJORIE
          I didn't mean to... I was going to
          empty the hamper...

Chase turns, shaking off the scare.

                    CHASE
          It's okay.

Marjorie's eyes can't help but fix on the dog bites scattered over 
Chase's chest and arms.

                    MARJORIE
          What happened to you?

                    CHASE
          I had a little run-in with Zowie.

                    MARJORIE
          You sure did...

Marjorie sets the laundry aside.

                    MARJORIE
          Here, let me do that...

Marjorie looks over the antiseptics Chase has laid out on the 
sink. Saturating a wad of gauze with hydrogen peroxide, she gently 
cleanses the gashes on his arms.

There's nothing overtly sexual in her actions, but the gentleness 
of her touch doesn't go unnoticed by Chase.

                    MARJORIE
          I hope he doesn't have rabies.

                    CHASE
          He doesn't. I don't know what he
          has, but I'm hoping to God it's
          not infectious...

Chase stops and looks at Marjorie's reflection in the mirror.

                    CHASE
          Marjorie... what do you know about
          the Creed murders?

Marjorie stiffens for a moment. Obviously the Creeds are a sore 
spot for the people in this town.

                    MARJORIE
          Did you ever play that game where
          you pass a story down a row of
          people and see how screwed up it
          gets by the time it's done?
          People say Louis Creed's son came
          back from the dead and it drove
          him crazy...
               (she rolls her eyes)
          He killed his wife and himself,
          and that's the end of story.
          Anything else belongs in the
          National Enquirer.

Marjorie tapes the bandage over Chase's shoulder too tight. 
Chase's groan snaps her back to the reality at hand.

                    MARJORIE
          Sorry. Now tell me what that has
          to do with Zowie?

Chase closes his eyes, shutting out the pain.

                    CHASE
          I wish I knew.

INT.  LIBRARY - DAY

Chase approaches the counter, looking to the ELDERLY LIBRARIAN for 
assistance.

                    LIBRARIAN
          What are you looking for, Hon.

                    CHASE
          Do you have anything on the Creed
          murders? I can't find the 
          microfilm from that period...

The librarian's smile vanishes. She lowers her voice, focusing her 
attention on some paperwork.

                    LIBRARIAN
          We don't keep anything on file
          from that far back.

                    CHASE
          But you've got files from the
          previous years...

                    LIBRARIAN
          We have nothing on the Creed
          murders, sir. Can I get you
          something else?

Chase looks around and realizes that a dozen hostile eyes are on 
him. TOWNSPEOPLE withholding a dark secret.

Chase slowly backs away, eager to escape the field of hostile 
stares.

EXT.  HIGHWAY, COUNTRY BRIDGE - DAY

Geoff and Drew have parked their bikes beneath the bridge. They 
sit on the bank of the creek below, watching the water run past. 
Geoff is lost in thought.

                    GEOFF
          Do you think everyone that came
          back would be like Gus?

                    DREW
          I don't know...
               (thinking)
          ...maybe it depends on what you
          were like before you...

                    GEOFF
               (finishing)
          Dies?

Drew nods. He tosses a stone into the creek, then looks up at the 
sun and sighs.

                    DREW
          I gotta go back and do my
          chores...

                    GEOFF
          Go later...

Drew shakes his head.

                    DREW
          I can't. Gus'd kill me if I
          showed up late.

The boys reluctantly rise and move to their bikes, walking them up 
the steep grade to the highway.

                    DREW
          See you at school Monday?

Geoff nods. He looks at Drew. The boy is genuinely frightened. But 
there's nothing either of them can do. They're trapped in their 
roles as kids.

Both boys mount their bikes. Drew turns...

                    DREW
          You ever think about running away?

                    GEOFF
          All the time.

Drew smiles at this. He waves to Geoff and pedals off.

                    DREW
               (calling back)
          See ya!

Geoff waves and heads off in the opposite direction.

WE STAY ON DREW -

As he moves down the road. Up ahead, we hear the approaching WHINE 
of a motorcycle...

CLYDE

rips by on an old junkyard fixer-up MOTORCYCLE, and he's heading 
in Geoff's direction.

Seeing him, Drew brakes and pulls his bike into a U-turn, pumping 
furiously to catch up with Geoff.

ON GEOFF -

Now Geoff hears the WHINE of Clyde's motorcycle. He glances 
back...

Clyde's spotted him, REVVING the engine.

Geoff pedals like mad, but it's no use. Clyde is closing in on 
him, grinning sadistically.

Clyde sweeps in next to him, calling out over the ENGINE.

                    CLYDE
          Well look who's here!

Clyde veers right, forcing Geoff towards the shoulder of the 
road...

131   OMITTED

132   OMITTED

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The ground ahead drops toward a ravine. Geoff has nowhere to go 
but down the slope. Clyde is right there beside him...

Laughing, Clyde reaches over and grabs ahold of Geoff's handlebar. 
He jerks it sideways...

                    CLYDE
          Oops!

Geoff's front wheel turns perpendicular. The bike pitches forward, 
THROWING Geoff into the dirt ahead...

Clyde broadies his bike to a stop. With the engine idling, he hops 
off.

Before Geoff can get to his feet, Clyde has picked up Geoff's bike 
and planted it upside down in the dirt.

                    CLYDE
          Guess your Dad's not here to save
          you now, is he?

Clyde gets a handful of Geoff's collar and drags him over toward 
the bike. With his free hand, Clyde cranks the pedal.

The back wheel spins. Faster and faster.

                    CLYDE
          You ever seen a tire take off a
          nose?

Through the blur of the spokes, WE SEE Geoff, eyes widening 
fearfully.

                    CLYDE
          Neither have I.

Clyde forces Geoff's face toward the spinning tread.

                    CLYDE
          Might even kill ya. Wheel might
          chew right into your brains. You
          could visit your mom.

Geoff tries to get a hold on the frame of the bike for leverage, 
but his arms don't reach beyond the spinning wheel.

Clyde is full of deranged glee, fueled by Geoff's fear.

But now, A HAND grabs the wool scarf streaming from the back of 
Clyde's neck and yanks him off of Geoff.

Clyde reels, finding...

GUS standing there behind him. He looks bad. Real bad. His 
bandages are unwound and his ruined neck is still seeping. His 
face is unearthly pale. He's deteriorated considerably since 
yesterday.

                    CLYDE
               (startled)
          Jesus Christ, Gus!

Gus levels a threatening gaze at Geoff.

                    GUS
          Go home.

But Geoff remains frozen. Gus fixes him with a stare that could 
turn flesh to stone.

                    GUS
          I said... GO HOME!!

Geoff snaps out of it and flips his bike over. He gets a running 
start, making a beeline for the highway without ever looking back.

ON THE KNOLL NEARBY

Drew stops short of the ravine, watching from afar as Gus steps 
toward Clyde.

BELOW -

Clyde throws up his hands. He's frightened, but he tries to muster 
up a cocky front.

                    CLYDE
          Come on, Gus, I was just fucking
          with him...
               (nervous laughter)
          What're you gonna do? Give me a
          ticket? I mean, shit, Gus...

Clyde grows increasingly wary of Gus' evil stare. Gus steps 
closer.

                    CLYDE
          You can't lay a finger on me...

Wrong. Gus lashes out, backhanding Clyde across the face.

Clyde falls to the ground, flat on his back, with his nose gushing 
blood. Terrified.

Gus turns around and lifts the idling motorcycle. With one hand 
under the back of the seat, and the other working the accelerator 
handlebar, Gus advances toward Clyde.

Gus kicks the bike into gear and REVS the accelerator.

THE REAR WHEEL SPINS. On the pavement it would be moving forty 
miles an hour.

Clyde can't believe his eyes. Pleading.

                    CLYDE
          Gus... what are you doing?

                    GUS
          I'm just fucking with you...

Gus plants his foot against Clyde's chest, pinning him, and lowers 
the spinning rear wheel TOWARD CLYDE'S NECK. The wheel WHINES like 
a circular saw.

Gus lowers the wheel. Then jerks it away, flashing a sadistic 
smile.

Just when Clyde thinks Gus is backing off, the wheel comes down 
again...

                    CLYDE
               (wailing)
          Stop it, man! Stop it!!!

Gus gets into the rhythm as he lowers and retracts the spinning 
wheel at the terrified bully.

But this time, as the wheel comes down...

CLYDE'S WOOL SCARF, defying gravity, gets swept up, swallowed into 
the GEARS.

And along with the scarf, here comes Clyde's SCREAMING face. We 
can only imagine the gruesome instant that follows.

BLOOD sprays up over Gus' arms and chest. And then we hear the 
sound of CRUNCHING BONES jamming the motorcycle's gears.

                    GUS
               (dead-pan)
          Whoops.

He bares his teeth in a death's head grin.

ON THE KNOLL

Drew has witnessed the killing. He's mortified.

BELOW -

Gus tosses the bloody motorcycle aside, slowly raising his eyes up 
to where Drew stands. His eyes meet Drew's.

Drew hastily jerks his bike around and takes off.

Gus starts after him on foot.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DAY

Drew rushes through the front door, SLAMMING it behind him and 
throwing the deadbolt.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Drew climbs onto his bed and grabs his shotgun from the gun rack. 
His fingers shake as he flips off the safety.

                    DREW
          Oh man...

Just then we hear the CRACKLE of a POLICE P.A. and Gus' amplified 
VOICE coming from the yard outside.

                    GUS (V.O.)
               (mocking)
          This is the Police, come out of
          the house with your hands up!

Gus finishes his words with a burst of FEEDBACK and then amplified 
MANIACAL LAUGHTER.

Drew's eyes go wide with terror. He creeps out into the hall, 
clutching the gun.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

Drew tries to look out the window. Then we hear a low, guttural 
GROWL. Drew slowly turns...

Zowie is standing down the hall, leveling a dead stare. Zowie 
takes the first step forward.

                    DREW
               (horrified)
          No, Zowie! It's me!

Pleading, Drew slowly retreats down the hallway.

Along the way, he backs right into...

GUS, grinning from ear to ear.

Drew recoils against the wall, swinging up his shotgun.

                    DREW
          Stay back!

But Gus just keeps on grinning. He takes a step forward...

Drew pulls the trigger...

And CLICK! Nothing happens. The chambers are empty.

                    GUS
          Forget something, Drew buddy?

Gus raises his hand. He's holding the shotgun shells. He lets them 
fall to the floor.

Suddenly Gus wrenches the gun from Drew's hands. He swings it 
and...

...Drew SCREAMS and ducks beneath the blow, as the shotgun butt 
SMASHES a hole in the wall above his head. Gus flings the shotgun 
aside and LUNGES for Drew...

Drew races down the hallway to the back door. He turns the latch. 
The deadbolt has been locked from the inside.

Drew's eyes whip to the keyholder on the wall. All the keyhooks 
are empty.

Here comes the JINGLING of keys in Gus' pockets as he comes down 
the hall...

Drew dashes away from the back door.

Gus' eyes shift from Drew's fleeing form to A BOX OF TOOLS in the 
service closet.

AT THE FRONT DOOR

Drew jimmies the knob. Again, the deadbolt is locked from the 
inside. Tears are streaming down Drew's face now.

FOOTSTEPS approach. Drew spins around...

Gus is advancing, WITH A HAMMER tight in his grip.

                    GUS
               (crazed)
          You have the right to remain
          silent...

WHAM! Gus SMASHES the hammer into the wall to punctuate his words. 
Plaster goes flying.

                    GUS
               (continuing)
          ...while I bash your fucking head
          in!

Drew's eyes dart frantically, looking for a way out. The closest 
route of escape is UP THE STAIRS.

Down the hallway, Zowie starts running forward. Drew's caught 
between a rock and a hard place...

                    GUS
          You have the right to a lawyer,
          but you won't need one...

He runs for it. Gus charges to intercept him...

Drew gets to the stairs first.

                    GUS
          ...cause you'll be dead!

WHAM! Gus brings the hammer down with the claw end leading. It 
sinks into the stair below Drew's feet...

Zowie LEAPS past Gus, tearing up the stairs as Gus wrenches the 
hammer free...

UPSTAIRS

Drew makes it to the top of the stairs with Zowie right on his 
heels.

Drew DIVES into Amanda and Gus' bedroom as...

Zowie springs from the floor. Drew SLAMS the door shut, SMACKING  
Zowie. Zowie collapses to the floor, dazed.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Drew throws the latch on the door. Almost immediately, Gus is 
outside, POUNDING at the door with the claw end of the hammer. 
Wood splinters fly as the hammer claw sinks through...

Drew SCREAMS and goes for one of the dormer windows. It's stuck; 
he can't get it open.

From the hallway, Gus violently SMASHES the door again and again. 
The door is splintering apart. WE SEE glimpses of Gus through the 
ragged holes.

                    GUS (O.S.)
          Do you understand these rights,
          Drew buddy?!

Drew grabs a chair and HEAVES it through the window...

                    GUS (O.S.)
          ...OR ARE YOU JUST TOO FUCKING
          STUPID?!

The bedroom door EXPLODES INWARD and Gus claws his way into the 
room...

Wasting no time, Drew climbs through the broken window...

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DAY

Drew slides down the slant of the roof. He hits the lattice and 
takes it to the ground with him.

Untangling himself, he gets to his feet...

...and here comes Amanda, ARRIVING HOME.

Drew runs for her car, waving his hands, throwing himself into her 
path so she'll go no further. She SLAMS on the brakes.

Drew pulls open the passenger door and dives inside...

                    DREW
          Gus killed Clyde, Mom! He's
          trying to kill me!

Just then, the BACK DOOR flies open. Gus steps out.

                    GUS
          Drew, buddy! Daddy's not done
          yet!

Amanda spots the hammer hanging from his grip. Gus cracks a sick 
smile and FLINGS THE HAMMER at the car...

CRACK! The hammer bounces off the windshield, causing it to 
spiderweb.

                    DREW
          Go Mom! Go!!!

That's all the convincing Amanda needs. She puts the car into 
reverse and stomps on the gas...

INT.  CAR - DAY

Speeding down the highway. Drew and Amanda are mortified.

Suddenly, we hear the WAIL of Gus' patrol car coming up from 
behind. Amanda looks to the rear-view mirror...

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

Approaching from the road ahead is a POTATO TRUCK.

INT.  AMANDA'S CAR - DAY

Amanda hips her head back in front of them. The potato truck is 
blaring its HORN.

Gus' car swerves out onto the shoulder, speeding up to match her 
pace.

                    DREW
          Mom!!!

Gus cranks the wheel, jumping back onto the road, forcing Amanda's 
car into the path of the oncoming truck.

INT.  POTATO TRUCK - DAY

THE DRIVER stands on the BRAKES.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

THE POTATO TRUCK COLLIDES WITH AMANDA'S CAR. HEAD ON.

Thousands of potatoes explode from the rear of the truck, 
obscuring our view.

WE HEAR THE HORRIFYING SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING METAL. CRUNCHING BONES. 
AND SILENCED CRIES.

Gus' vehicle speeds past. WE HOLD on the mess of twisted steel. 
Clearly there are no survivors.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - DUSK

Geoff enters first. Wearing a dark suit. Looking pale and empty 
inside. Chase follows, dressed in black. It's obvious they've been 
to a funeral.

Without a word, Geoff heads up the stairs. Chase watches on, 
feeling utterly helpless.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Chase exits from his bedroom, pulling a sweater over a more casual 
change of clothes. He cocks his head at the SOUNDS of Geoff moving 
about in the attic above.

The door atop the attic stairway is barely ajar.

Chase wrinkles his brow, concerned. Turning away, he heads 
downstairs.

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

Marjorie is preparing dinner. Across the room, the kitchen TV is 
playing...

ON TELEVISION is the evening news. A photo of Drew and Amanda 
appears above the NEWSCASTER.

                    NEWSCASTER
          ... Friends and neighbors came to
          pay respects for Drew and Amanda
          Gilbert, who died in a head-on
          collision Saturday...

Chase enters the kitchen, eyes moving to the TV.

                    MARJORIE
          Those poor people. I saw Gus this
          morning... he looked terrible.

Chase pulls his eyes away from the broadcast as Marjorie sets 
dinner on the table. Chase yells upstairs.

                    CHASE
          Geoff, dinner's ready!
               (after no reply)
          Geoff?!

                    GEOFF (O.S.)
          I'm not hungry.

Chase gives Marjorie an apologetic look and rises from the table.

Meanwhile, the news broadcast continues. A photo of Clyde appears 
on the screen.

                    NEWSCASTER
          ...in other news, the
          disappearance of a Ludlow youth
          remains a mystery. Clyde Parker
          was last seen on Saturday
          afternoon. His motorcycle was
          found off Highway 62...

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Chase pushes open the door. A spring coil pulls the CREAKING door 
closed behind him. One look at the attic and Chase turns pale...

A huge window at the far end of the room allows the moonlight to 
reach all corners of the spacious old attic...

All of Renee's belongings have been unpacked. The entire attic has 
been converted into a museum-like room, down to the last 
meticulous detail. A room in preparation for Renee's return.

Gauzy curtains billow out from some unseen draft. Pictures of 
Renee rest everywhere. Awards. Memorabilia...

GEOFF is seated before the brightly lit, three-way theatrical 
mirror, casually setting out Renee's make-up.

                    CHASE
          Geoff... what are you doing?

There's an obsessive dementia in Geoff's gaze.

                    GEOFF
          I'm getting things ready for Mom.

Chase sighs. Obviously the strain of Drew's funeral has proven too 
much for Geoff. He moves closer.

                    CHASE
               (gently)
          Mom is dead, Geoff. You know
          that...

A creepy smile flickers across Geoff's face.

                    GEOFF
          She doesn't have to be.

Chase freezes as a chill runs up his spine.

                    CHASE
          What are you talking about?

                    GEOFF
          I can bring her back. The same
          way Drew and me brought Zowie
          back...

At this, Chase is positively spooked.

                    CHASE
          Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie
          didn't die.

                    GEOFF
          He did. We buried him.
               (intense)
          There's a place out in the
          woods... if you bury something
          there, it comes back alive.

Chase stares at his son. This is insane. It must be.

Just then, the PHONE RINGS downstairs. Geoff continues to stare at 
his father.

                    GEOFF
          We tried it on Zowie first. And
          then we did it again, when Zowie
          killed Gus. Drew didn't want Gus
          to be dead, so we brought him
          back, too...

It's too much for Chase. His mouth is hanging agape.

                    MARJORIE (O.S.)
               (outside the attic
               door)
          Doctor Matthews, you've got a
          call. It's the caretaker at the
          funeral home. Something about
          your wife's grave...

Chase nods in private acknowledgement. He stares at Geoff as he 
backs away.

                    CHASE
          Look, Geoff. Just... just relax,
          okay. I'm going to take this call
          and I'll be right back. Okay?

Geoff doesn't respond. Chase pulls open the door and leaves.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Chase is on the phone. The CALLER'S WORDS bring grave concern to 
Chase.

                    CHASE
          What?! Christ, I'll be right
          there...

Chase hangs up, stunned. He turns to Marjorie, who's watching him 
with a concerned gaze.

                    CHASE
               (hurried)
          Marjorie, I need you to stay late.
          Geoff is really upset and I have
          to take care of this. Don't let
          him leave the house, alright?

Chase is out the door before she has a chance to respond.

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Geoff is laying on his mother's bed, weeping. Tiger sits at the 
foot of the bed. Suddenly she wakens and HISSES.

From out of the darkness...

RENEE'S HAND

ENTERS FRAME, gently touching Geoff's side. And with its arrival, 
so comes her eerie LULLABY.

                    RENEE
               (a whisper)
          I need you, Geoff...

GEOFF

slowly raises his head, bewildered. Renee's hand withdraws into 
the darkness. He reaches out for her, but she's gone. The LULLABY 
remains, beckoning from down the attic stairs.

The attic door slowly swings open of its own accord.

Geoff rises from the bed and follows.

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS FOYER - NIGHT

Geoff looks into the living room as he passes. Marjorie has fallen 
asleep on the sofa with the TV on.

155   OMITTED

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

The lullaby drifts from beyond the deadfall. The fog rolls inward, 
towards the distant burial ground. As Geoff moves towards the 
deadfall, the fog converges around him.

EXT.  THE BOG - NIGHT

The lure of Renee's lullaby pulls Geoff deeper into the woods. We 
hear the unearthly ANIMAL HOWL once more.

EXT.  PLEASANTVILLE CEMETERY - NIGHT

Chase's van pulls to a stop behind a maintenance vehicle.

Chase is greeted by the limping CARETAKER, who quickly leads him 
off across the rolling hillside.

                    CARETAKER
          ...sorry to disturb you, Doctor
          Matthews, but I thought you'd want
          to come have a look for yourself.
          It's the damndest thing...

AT RENEE'S GRAVE -

Chase stops cold, gazing at the ground before him in disbelief...

The grave is a gaping cavity. The casket has been unearthed. 
Renee's body is missing.

                    CHASE
          Jesus...
               (uncomprehending)
          Gus did this?!

                    CARETAKER
               (nodding)
          He stuck around after the funeral.
          Told me he had an order to exhume
          your wife. I didn't think much of
          it until I saw him drag the body
          out of the coffin...
               (shakes his head)
          He put your wife in his truck and
          drove off right through Amanda and
          Drew's headstones...

The caretaker points across the hillside...

TIRE TRACKS cut through the manicured grass, cutting a path of 
destruction right through the field of headstones and on through 
the fence.

                    CARETAKER
          I swear, nothing this weird has
          happened since Louis Creed dug up
          his boy...
               (beat)
          You want me to notify the
          authorities?

Chase doesn't answer, he just storms past the caretaker.

INT.  VAN - NIGHT

The van is speeding down the dark, open highway. Chase is on the 
car phone, frantic, waiting as it RINGS. There's finally an 
answer...

                    CHASE
          Doctor Yolander, this is Chase
          Matthews, we spoke the other
          day...

Yolander cuts him off.

                    YOLANDER'S VOICE
               (bitter)
          You didn't leave town, did you.

INT.  YOLANDER'S HOUSE (INTERCUT)

Yolander sits in the darkness, a bottle of whiskey and a tumbler 
at his side. His "creatures" are all around him, eyes glowing with 
reflected moonlight. His voice is slurred. The voice of someone 
who's already damned.

                    YOLANDER
          You sorry bastard. You stayed. I
          have nothing more to say to you,
          Matthews...

                    CHASE'S VOICE
               (desperate)
          Look, just tell me one thing. Did
          I treat an animal that had been
          brought back to life? Did I?!

                    YOLANDER
          What do you think?

INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT

Chase grips the carphone tightly, his knuckles white.

                    YOLANDER (V.O.)
          Believe what you saw, Matthews.
          The dog was dead.

                    CHASE
          My God...
               (mounting horror)
          ...how is that possible? You have
          to help me, Doctor Yolander. I
          don't know what I'm dealing with
          here! They've dug up my wife...

                    YOLANDER'S VOICE
               (cutting him off)
          I'm retired from my practice,
          Matthews. It's your practice now,
          and it's your problem.
               (beat)
          God help you...

                    CHASE
               (screaming)
          Wait! Don't hang up!

But Yolander does. And now we hear the DIAL TONE.

                    CHASE
          Shit!

Chase flings the carphone down, looking up as...

An approaching potato truck ZOOMS by. Blinding headlights. A 
BLARING HORN. Chase barely swerves out of the way.

Recovering from the scare, Chase reaches over and opens the glove 
compartment. He pulls out his gun and sets it on the seat next to 
him.

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND

Geoff climbs the stone steps, reaching the flattop meas. He stops 
short, looking over the clearing...

GUS

is standing in the center of the burial ground. He's HUMMING, 
mimicking Renee's feminine tone. Now he stops and slowly turns, 
regarding Geoff with dead eyes. He's holding a pickaxe and shovel 
at his side.

Gus looks to the ground at his side. Geoff follows his gaze...

A VISION OF RENEE'S GRAVE APPEARS -

Headstone. Manicured grass. Thriving flowers. As if it had been 
uprooted from her resting place at Pleasantville and set down 
right in the middle of the Micmac ground.

And now, the vision of Renee's grave fades away. In its place is a 
bundle of white: RENEE'S SHROUDED BODY.

Gus raises the pickaxe, offering it to Geoff.

                    GUS
          You bury your own, Geoff.

Geoff slowly nods and approaches, seduced beyond reason.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Marjorie stirs on the couch, blinking her eyes open at the SOUND 
of a THUD upstairs. Otherwise, the house is dark and silent.

                    MARJORIE
          Geoff?

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Marjorie starts up the long, dark flight of stairs to the attic. 
The thin night-shirt she's wearing does little to protect her from 
the sudden cold. She clutches herself, shivering.

                    MARJORIE
          Geoff? You okay up there?

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Marjorie cautiously pushes open the door. Her concern for Geoff is 
forgotten as she beholds the Renee Hallow memorabilia.

She moves about Renee's unpacked belongings in bewildered 
reverence.

The gauzy curtains billow about Marjorie like ghosts. And then she 
glimpses something beyond the curtains...

A FIGURE

stands in the shadows, wearing the BEADED PEACH DRESS that 
Marjorie had admired earlier. For a moment we think it's Renee, 
but as Marjorie draws closer, we see that the dress has been 
fitted onto a dressmaker's model.

Marjorie lays a hand on the fabric, feeling the contours of the 
design.

EEXT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase's headlights sweep across the front of the dark house. 
Pulling to a stop, Chase opens the van's door...

ZOWIE

LEAPS out of the darkness, sinking his teeth into Chase's 
shoulder.

Chase is thrown back over the car seat, grappling with the 
nightmare dog as it tears into him again and again...

Chase SCREAMS, reaching back for the gun. He grabs hold of it and 
swings it around... FIRES...

Zowie is BLOWN backwards, clear out of the car, spraying CHASE 
with BLOOD...

Zowie lands outside on his feet, looking stunned. His chest is a 
ruined mess. Zowie WHIMPERS and drags himself weakly towards the 
front porch.

Chase stumbles out of the van, clutching the gun. He's bleeding 
profusely.

179   OMITTED

EXT.  PORCH - NIGHT

An old saw is laying in a pile of sawdust next to a square hole 
that's been cut in the base of the front door.

Chase gives it a look as he tries the door. It's unlocked. Chase 
enters, bringing with him an illuminating swath from his 
headlights.

INT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase's headlights stream through the windows, distorting the 
interior. The house looks like it's been through a tornado. A 
trail of BLOODY PAW PRINTS leads into the kitchen. The stench is 
repulsive. Grimacing, Chase has to keep himself from gagging.

                    CHASE
          Jesus...

As Chase moves forward, he catches sight of...

GUS

standing in a swath of light. At Gus' feet is Zowie, tongue 
lolling out of his mouth. Dead for the second time. Scattered 
around the dog are various tools.

Propped against the wall is the cut out square of wood. It's 
fitted with hinges at the top.

                    CHASE
          Gus, what are you doing?!

Gus glances down at the dead dog.

                    GUS
               (dead-pan)
          I was building a doggy door.

                    CHASE
          God damn it Gus, you dug up my
          wife! What the fuck is going on
          around here?!

Gus brings a cordless electric drill up from his side, pointing it 
at Chase in a threatening manner.

                    GUS
               (grins)
          A little drilling. A little
          killing.

As Gus moves forward, Chase gets a good look at him for the first 
time. He doesn't look even remotely alive.

                    CHASE
          Holy shit!

Chase levels his gun with a trembling hand.

Gus stabs the air with the drill, feeding on Chase's horror.

Chase pulls the trigger. A bullet pounds Gus' chest. A SPRAY OF 
FLESH explodes from his back.

Unphased, Gus regains his balance.

                    GUS
          God I hate when that happens...

Before Chase can squeeze off the next round, Gus rips the gun from 
his grip...

                    GUS
          You got a permit for that?

Opening the chamber, Gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses 
the gun aside.

                    GUS
          Didn't think so.

Gus fires up the drill. The bit spinZZZZZZ. He DIVES at Chase, 
knocking him back against the counter. The drill bit SINKS INTO 
CHASE'S ARM...

Chase SCREAMS as Gus withdraws it. Now, he presses it into Chase's 
shoulder. Chase is on the verge of blacking out now. The pain is 
unbearable...

Gus withdraws the drill once again, aiming now for Chase's eye.

                    GUS
               (maniacal)
          No brain, no pain, Chase. Think
          about it...

The whirling drill bit is millimeters away from Chase's eye. He 
clutches Gus' arm, trying to force the drill aside...

At the last second, adrenaline kicks in and Chase diverts the 
drill. It SINKS INTO the counter-top nearby... STUCK.

Gus ROARS, lashing out, but Chase manages to duck away...

Chase catches sight of HIS GUN on the floor. He scrambles for it, 
scooping it up...

BULLETS are rolling across the floor every which way. Chase slaps 
his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber...

Gus' hands CLAMP DOWN around Chase's neck. He swings Chase around 
and SLAMS him against the wall, lifting him off his feet...

Chase GASPS as the life is literally crushed out of him...

He brings the gun up beneath Gus' chin and jams it into his ruined 
throat. Gus just keeps on throttling him...

                    GUS
               (insane)
          Just remember, Chase... I had Renee
          first... and now I'm gonna have her
          last...

BLAM! The top of Gus' head BLOWS off. His BODY is thrown back by 
the incredible force, tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a 
HEAVY THUD.

Chase sucks in precious air, then his head snaps up.

                    CHASE
          Geoff!

Chase stumbles from the house. It's a wonder he's even conscious. 
He swings open the van door and throws himself inside, sinking the 
key into the ignition.

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Marjorie is now seated before Renee's theatrical make-up mirror, 
entranced. She's wearing the beaded peach dress.

With the help of Renee's vast array of cosmetics, Marjorie has 
turned herself into a stunning beauty.

The lipstick isn't quite right. Turning to the countertop 
magnifying mirror, she carefully touches up her ruby red lips. Her 
face fills nearly the entire mirror...

...except for one rim, which reflects the dark, shadowy attic 
behind her.

A HUGE EYE joins her reflection in the distorting mirror. Marjorie 
nearly jumps out of her skin. She spins around...

                    MARJORIE
          Jesus, Geoff! Don't sneak up on
          me like that!

...but no one is there.

THE MAKE-UP MIRROR catches another glimpse. Renee's RED LIPS, 
magnified tenfold. The lips begin to move...

                    RENEE
               (a whisper)
          Did you really think you could be
          like me?

Renee's fist swings in, SMASHING a panel of the mirror...

Marjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying 
glass. And as her hands come down, she finds...

Renee standing before her. Her ghostly form silhouetted by 
moonlight. Curtains billowing around her. We never fully see her.

Marjorie's face goes white with fear.

                    RENEE
          Such a young face... but you've got
          potential...

Renee grabs a fistful of Marjorie's hair, viciously YANKING her 
head back...

                    RENEE
          We'll do the eyes first. You
          always start with the eyes...

Renee lashes out, SLASHING a mirror shard across the skin beneath 
Marjorie's right eye. Marjorie SCREAMS.

INT.  GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

Geoff awakens at the commotion upstairs. He rocks forward, rising 
from his bed.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Geoff pauses at the base of the attic stairway, looking up at the 
open door. All he hears are the faint SOUNDS of movement.

                    GEOFF
          Marjorie? You know you're not
          supposed to be in the attic.

Geoff starts up the stairs.

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Geoff trepidatiously enters. He weaves through the maze of gauzy 
curtains. And then he sees her...

Renee is standing in the midst of the attic. She's perfectly made 
up. Gorgeous. Just as she was on the day she died. She smiles 
warmly.

                    GEOFF
          Mom...

                    RENEE
          I came back for you, Geoff. We're
          going to be together again.

Renee raises her outstretched arms to receive him. Through the 
haze of his tears, Geoff doesn't see the sinister, vacant gleam in 
her eyes.

INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT

Reaching the house, Chase SKIDS to a stop across the lawn.

188B  OMITTED

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Chase cautiously enters with the gun in his grasp. The spring coil 
swings the CREAKING door shut behind him.

From Chase's vantage point, he can't see them yet. He makes his 
way around the stripped dressmaker's model, past an upright 
dressing mirror. And then he sees...

MARJORIE

Slumped against Renee's bed like a ragdoll. We can only see half 
of her face. It looks untouched. Chase reaches for her...

                    CHASE
          Marjorie?

Marjorie's head rolls sideways, exposing the other half of her 
face. The skin has been stripped from her skull and peeled back...

Chase turns his head away. And that's when he sees them...

RENEE AND GEOFF

Holding each other tightly. Geoff has his head buried in Renee's 
breast. Renee looks up from her son, meeting Chase's gaze. Her 
voice is both seductive and terrifying.

                    RENEE
          Hello, Chase.

Chase gasps. The word "horror" doesn't do the moment justice.

                    CHASE
          Oh my God...

                    RENEE
          We can try again, Chase. We can
          make it work this time.

Chase sinks back against the wall. He's lost a lot of blood and 
his strength is leaving him.

                    CHASE
               (shaking his head)
          No...

                    RENEE
          Don't you love me anymore, Chase?

                    CHASE
          You're not Renee... Renee's dead...
               (screaming)
          Geoff! Get over here now!

But Geoff just holds his mother tighter. A hint of annoyance 
flickers through Renee's eyes. She strokes Geoff's hair.

                    RENEE
               (looking at Chase)
          Geoff, honey, why don't you go
          downstairs. Your father and I
          need a moment alone. Do it for
          me?

Geoff looks up at his mother, mesmerized. She releases him from 
the embrace. He brushes past Chase without a glance and heads for 
the attic door.

                    RENEE
          Geoff...

Geoff pauses at the door, looking back. Renee's words have a 
hauntingly familiar ring...

                    RENEE
          I love you.

Geoff smiles. Turning away, he opens the door and...

CLYDE

is standing there, an AXE perched on his shoulder. His face is 
torn to shit, bones and brain matter exposed. He's covered from 
head to toe in dirt and clotted blood. He looks worse than any of 
the undead we've seen. A total walking nightmare.

                    CLYDE
               (grinning)
          Hey, Junior. Wanna play?

WHOOSH! Clyde swings the axe, sinking it into the wall just in 
front of Geoff's face...

Geoff tumbles back onto the floor, snapping out of his trance.

Clyde brings the axe down...

...and Geoff rolls to the side, barely avoiding decapitation.

                    CHASE
          Geoff!

Chase stumbles forward to rescue his son. As he does so, Clyde 
brings the axe back up, SMASHING Chase in the head with the blunt 
end...

Chase goes down. Unconscious.

                    CLYDE
          Oops! Looks like Daddy got a boo-
          boo...

Clyde turns his gaze back on Geoff.

                    CLYDE
          Now, where were we?

Geoff shuffles backwards across the floor as Clyde moves into the 
room.

Renee passes behind Clyde. She SLAMS the attic door shut and snaps 
off the knob with a jerk of the wrist, locking them all inside.

Scared out of his wits, Geoff makes it to his feet. Clyde swings 
again and misses...

Geoff grabs hold of the axe handle, struggling, and the two boys 
go down...

RENEE

Moves to the vanity. She sweeps a hand across it, sending 
everything crashing to the ground. Crystal perfume bottles 
SHATTER, spilling their contents over the floor.

Renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on. She touches the 
flame to the perfume-soaked floor...

FLAMES roar into existence, racing across the floorboards, 
igniting the curtains...

We see the flames reflected in Renee's soulless eyes.

ON GEOFF AND CLYDE

As they wrestle with one another across the floor. Bloody spittle 
drips from Clyde's face. He flashes a feral snarl.

Clyde LUNGES forward and tears into Geoff's shoulder with his 
teeth...

Geoff SCREAMS. His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a 
mirror shard. He JABS it up and into Clyde's eye...

Somehow, Geoff manages to roll out from under Clyde. He rises to 
his feet...

Clyde lets loose a DEMONIC ROAR. He charges, SLASHING the axe 
wildly, knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike. 
Nothing's going to stop him. Nothing.

Flames are consuming the attic, licking the rafters, igniting the 
canopy drapings... devouring everything. SMOKE is rolling across 
the floor...

Geoff reaches a far wall. He's trapped in a corner. There's 
nowhere else to go. Behind Geoff is a CIRCUIT BOX. INSULATED 
CABLES run from the box down through the attic floor. Geoff 
turns...

And here comes Clyde...

                    CLYDE
          Here it comes, buddy! HERE IT
          FUCKING COMES!!!

Clyde swings. Geoff ducks. The axe hits the circuit box behind 
him, severing the insulated cables...

As Clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try, Geoff 
reaches for one of the SPARKING CABLES.

Clyde raises the axe above his head...

                    CLYDE
          Eat it, ass-hole...

                    GEOFF
          EAT THIS!!!

...and Geoff shoves the live cable into Clyde's mouth!

SPARKS shoot out of Clyde's eyes and ears. He jerks back and 
forth, writhing in a horrific replay of Renee's electrocution.

Then Clyde's face BLOWS APART in a gout of ruined flesh and BLUE 
FLAME. The circuit is blown and the SMOKING BODY falls...

Geoff drops the cable. The blazing inferno is closing in. He runs 
to Chase...

Chase is barely conscious. Geoff drops to his knees and pulls his 
father to his feet...

                    RENEE (O.S.)
          Don't leave me again, Geoff!

Geoff turns...

RENEE

is standing in the midst of the FLAMES, reaching out. The make-up 
and mortician's wax she wears fall victim to the heat and her 
"face" begins to MELT AWAY...

                    RENEE
          Don't leave me alone!

Geoff turns away, horrified. With Chase on his shoulder, he 
reaches the door. Locked. Geoff sets Chase against the wall.

He spots the AXE, still clutched in Clyde's hand. Geoff drags the 
axe free from the dead boy's grasp and goes to work on the door...

Ignoring Renee's CRIES, Geoff swings the axe again and again, 
chopping the door apart. He coughs through the smoke. The flames 
are almost upon them...

Finally, the wood splinters apart. Geoff reaches through and 
grasps the outside handle, pulling the door open. Then he turns 
and lifts Chase up once more...

At the door, Geoff pauses for one final, tearful look back. Then 
his face hardens and he turns away, pulling Chase to safety.

                    RENEE
          NO, GEOFF! NO!!!

ON RENEE

Alone in the fiery storm, SCREAMING. Flames devour her flowing 
white dress. Her face doesn't even look remotely human anymore.

And as the inferno slowly closes in, we...

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  VETERINARY OFFICE - DAY

We PULL OUT from a sign on the door that says "CLOSED".

Chase is just now locking up the door. He's bandaged up, looking a 
little worse for the wear, but happy to be alive. He turns, 
grinning...

GEOFF

stands near the van, holding Tiger in his arms.

                    GEOFF
          All set?

                    CHASE
          All set.

Chase joins Geoff at the van and together they climb inside. Chase 
starts the engine, pulling away from the office.

WE STAY ON THE VAN -

As it moves off down the street, passing the familiar landmarks of 
sleepy Ludlow.

RISING UP -

We follow the van as it sweeps out of town. Ludlow looks picture-
perfect from our bird's eye vantage point. Charming and quiet.

                    CHASE (V.O.)
          So where're we going?

                    GEOFF
          Anywhere but here.

We continue rising up into the brilliant blue sky, losing the van 
amidst the rolling Maine countryside and we

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  MICMAC FOREST - DAY

RUSHING over the woods, just above the tree tops. It's an ocean of 
swaying green beneath us. A forest as ancient and mysterious as 
anything on the Earth.

AND SUDDENLY -

The endless trees fall out from under us. We find ourselves above 
the flattop mesa of the Micmac burial ground, swooping downward...

The ground surges towards us. We see Renee's OPEN GRAVE.

The quality of light is different now. We hear the wail of the 
LONESOME WIND, and perhaps, the WHISPER of something altogether 
alien.

And on the unsettling note, we...

                                        FADE TO BLACK.


THE END
