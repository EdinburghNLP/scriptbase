FADE IN:

EXT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

On a taxi arriving at the Delta terminal of Kennedy Airport.
A man in a well-tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi.

CUT TO a CLOSER SHOT of the man as he pays the cabbie. He is
WILLCOX HILLYER, the middle-aged "Buddy" of this story and
the observer through whose eyes it is seen. He has a dry,
ironic, rather agreeable manner and he should seem like
everyone's idea of a successful author, a slightly graying,
trim, still-youthful-looking fifty. The CAMERA follows him as
he walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag.

INT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer at a counter getting his
ticket processed. A little smile is on his face as he talks
to a pretty airline girl. This character likes girls; his
aloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to
them. The airline girl smiles back, she finds him attractive.
We don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track --
it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, but
now a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if
slightly annoyed by something.

CUT TO a POV shot of a tall, gaunt, almost totally bald man
at the next ticket counter. The man is about sixty-five and
looks like a half senile Great Dane. He is DAVE WILKIE,
erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. Age has not
been at all kind to Dave; his face is lined with bitterness,
he is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a very
unpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline
representative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily.
He wears an expensive, ill-fitting suit and a Texas-type hat.
We don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the
track.

CUT BACK to a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he stares with
a frown at the man. It's as if he knows the man but can't
place him. The airline ticket girl speaks to him and he turns
back to her, his face softening as he answers her, obviously
saying he'll carry his bag. He nods goodbye to the girl,
turns and the CAMERA follows him as he walks some distance
away and stops, looks back with another pensive frown at the
tall, gaunt man at the next counter.

CUT TO ANOTHER POV shot of Dave Wilkie, a longer shot than
the first. The man is now arguing angrily with two airline
representatives, still waving his ticket and shaking his
head. We don't hear him. Lip-readers might pick up what he is
saying: "I'm supposed to be in first class, not tourist.
What's the matter with this friggin' airline?"

CUT BACK TO Willcox Hillyer, a CLOSE SHOT of his face as he
rubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember the
man. The CAMERA holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry
Dave, racking his brain. He shakes his head, he cannot place
the man and yet he knows him. The CAMERA moves in closer on
Willcox Hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at
this ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a
distance, FAINT MUSIC on the track -- it is "Dixie," played
with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great Louis Armstrong
in his prime. At first we can barely hear it, then the MUSIC
becomes LOUDER as Hillyer's frown deepens and he seems almost
to know the man.

MAIN TITLE (SUPERIMPOSED): "RAMBLING ROSE"

The MUSIC remains a bit in the distance, but it can be heard.

OTHER TITLES (SUPERIMPOSED): over the following action.

VARIOUS SHOTS, on Willcox Hillyer. He gives up his effort to
recognize the strangely familiar Dave with a little shrug,
turns and walks away with his travel bag.

INT. DELTA TERMINAL - LOUNGE - DAY

We see him entering the departure lounge and boarding the
plane.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

A shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive
young stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane. He
is not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face
when he sees a pretty girl -- he seems to have a real
affection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry
and ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. We see him sit
in a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley
sheets. He stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys,
then sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make
corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle.

Something or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight
frown and CUT TO a POV shot of Dave Wilkie, all wonder and
enthusiasm. This OVER the TITLES and we do not hear the
dialogue they speak, what we heard is LOUIS ARMSTRONG, but I
will put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. We do
not want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will
be obvious from the acting.

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (not on track)
     Buddd-dee! My God, if it ain't
     Buddy! Well, if this ain't the
     darnest thing!

ANOTHER ANGLE, on them both as Dave blocks the aisle, an
idiot false-toothed grin on his face. Hillyer has a pained
embarrassed smile.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (not on track)
     Excuse me... your voice is familiar
     and I'm sure I know you from
     somewhere...

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (not on track, with
           delighted injury)
     Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know
     me!

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (not on track)
     Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (not on track)
     It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie,
     don't you remember me?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (not on track)
     Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how
     are you?

The men shake hands, Dave enthusiastically, Hillyer less so.
We see Dave stow his suitcase and take the seat next to
Hillyer.

EXT. KENNEDY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of a big Delta jet making its final taxiing
turn and ROARING into a take-off.

INT. KENNEDY - DAY

CUT TO a dramatic underbelly shot of the jet going up.

END OF TITLES.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

A shot of the attractive, young stewardess, harried as she
fixes drinks.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

CUT TO Dave and Willcox Hillyer as the young stewardess gives
them drinks. Dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees
the single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an
aggressively self-satisfied conversation and says nothing to
her. He speaks to Hillyer, who is making a real effort to be
polite but is less than happy about the encounter.

               DAVE WILKIE 
     Well, I am in the construction
     business, Buddy, and without
     braggin' I have done real good at
     it. 
          (with a meaningful
           bitterness)
     There are those who wouldn't have
     expected that out of me. 
          (pauses as if waiting for
           a reaction, but Hillyer
           is very silent)
     Right now I'm buildin' a giant
     motel unit near Alexandria, outside
     Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm
     on the construction side.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (making polite talk)
     Well, that's interesting, Dave. I
     always liked Washington, it's a
     pretty town.

               DAVE WILKIE 
     Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York.
     But the niggers have took it over,
     just like every other city we got,
     only worse.

Hillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but
Dave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self
satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey.

               DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
     But I have done real good in the
     construction field. What I don't
     know about buildin' ain't worth
     knowin'. I knocked off twenty-eight
     thousand smackeroos last year,
     how's that for an old country boy?

Dave pauses, realizes this might not impress; glances down
with curiosity at the galley sheets, then an unpleasant
smile.

               DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
     Ha ha, course you make a lot more. 
          (points at the galleys)
     What's that you got there, Buddy?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (reluctantly)
     Galley proof.

               DAVE WILKIE 
     Galley what?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     Page proof of a book I'm working
     on.

               DAVE WILKIE 
     How about that. Well, you always
     were a screwball.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (lifts an eyebrow in mild
           irony)
     Oh, yeah?

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (unfazed)
     I don't mean that the way it
     sounds. 
          (stares at galleys as if
           rattlesnake)
     Imagine it, a book. And I used to
     know you personal way back when.
          (pauses, then earnestly)
     Tell me something, Buddy, how do
     you dream up all that stuff?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (absolutely straight)
     Well, actually, we have a little
     black boy named Her---t who lives
     in the garage. He does it for me.

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (for a moment half
           believes it, then a slow,
           stupid grin)
     Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy,
     always jokin' around. Almost as
     much of a joker as your Daddy. 
          (drains his drink,
           grimaces; a heavy
           drinker, Dave)
     I saw your Daddy a coupla years
     ago, I was up in Glenville lookin'
     at a motel site. I guess that's
     where you're headed, huh, to see
     him?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (stares out of plane
           window)
     That's right, Dave, I'm headed for
     Glenville on a whisperin' jet.

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (suddenly calls out)
     Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us
     another drink! 
          (to Hillyer, sullenly)
     Dumb little bitch, supposed to give
     us two in the first place.

Willcox Hillyer listens with a pained half smile, a hand at
his temple.

               DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
     This friggin' airline's out of its
     mind. 
          (a martyr)
     The sons of bitches tried to put me
     in tourist.
          (portentuously
           philosophical)
     But our whole civilization is
     screwed up, Buddy. The heebies and
     the coconuts have took it over and
     ruined it.

Willcox Hillyer half closes his eyes in weariness, but says
nothing. Gently, he rubs his temple. It is plain Dave Wilkie
gives him a headache.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the pretty young stewardess as she brings
two more drinks. Dave stares sourly at her, wholly unmoved by
her charm.

               DAVE WILKIE 
     Took your time gettin' here.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     She has other things to do, Dave.

Willcox smiles apologetically at girl.

               DAVE WILKIE 
     Supposed to get two drinks in the
     first place. This friggin' airline
     can't do nothin' right.

The stewardess purses her lips at Dave, who is bowed over his
drink busy opening it. Hillyer lifts an eyebrow at the girl
as if to say, "Don't blame me because of this damned idiot,"
and she half smiles at him.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (obviously getting him off
           subject)
     Tell me about that job in
     Alexandria, Dave, the big motel
     you're building.

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (with pedantic exactitude,
           the man is a complete
           pain in the ass)
     Near Alexandria. It isn't in
     Alexandria, it is outside it.

               WILLCOX HILLYER
     I see. Outside it.

               DAVE WILKIE
     That's correct -- outside it, not
     in it. As for the job, well, the
     Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of
     grief and we use a pile of niggers
     to haul and tote and they ain't
     worth a sorry-ass damn. 
          (takes big swallow of
           drink)
     But I can build anything, Buddy.
     Give me the plans and I can build a
     goddamn staircase to the moon. It's
     a fact, I can build anything... 
          (pauses, then bitterly)
     ... but she never believed that.
     Oh, hell, no, she never believed in
     me.

This is another pointed bitter reference to the unknown
"she." Once again, Willcox Hillyer is deliberately
unresponsive.

               WILLCOX HILLYER
     Um-m, well...

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (broodingly)
     Doubted my ability all along, the
     little bitch. I never remarried,
     Buddy, you know that, don't you?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     Well, no, I didn't actually.

               DAVE WILKIE 
     She's te reason -- cured me of
     women once and for all. Oh, I got
     rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste
     no time kickin' that bitch out.
     Hell, she was screwin' everybody in
     Savannah. I caught her in a motel
     with this long tall son of a bitch
     and boy did I beat the everlastin'
     piss out of him!

Dave Wilkie's eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it
and one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the
man. It is frightening even now; he is a clown, but he is a
dangerous clown. As his long, bitter, impassioned tirade
continues, Willcox Hillyer becomes increasingly tense and
pale -- it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and
he is struggling to control himself.

Dave's tone and voice are laconically Southern, but the
hatred and misery in his eyes are raw.

               DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
     She didn't marry him, though, later
     she married another guy and went to
     Winston-Salem. It didn't last
     That girl couldn't have no lastin'
     marriage, she left him and married
     another dumb sucker and went out
     west. Little bitch left him, too,
     and you know what she's married to
     right now?
          (puts a big finger on
           Hillyer's chest)
     A kike. That's right, some kind of
     kike horse doctor named Schapiro
     out in Seattle, who's got the nerve
     to have the same first name I got.
     Wouldn't you know it, Rose would
     wind up married to a goddamn kike?
     She was always out of her friggin'
     head and I'll tell you why.
          (his eyes narrow and again
           he puts a finger on
           Hillyer's chest)
     Buddy, she was sick in her mind and
     between her legs, too. She was
     a nymphomaniac.

               WILLCOX HILLYER
          (he has had enough; with a
           pale trembling anger and
           in even tone)
     Dave, you are as full of shit as a
     Christmas turkey and you know it.
     Now if you want to start a fight on
     this plane and get yourself in
     jail, go right ahead. But I am
     telling you, you are full of shit
     right up to your eyeballs.

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (with surprising mildness;
           a little smile almost as
           if he is pleased)
     I don't want to start no fight with
     you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full
     of shit?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor
     and Rose has been a good wife to
     him for a long time. To call her a
     nymphomaniac is the most stupid
     thing I ever heard in my life.

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (again surprisingly mild)
     You loved her, didn't you. Well, so
     did I. 
          (a little shrug)
     You'll have to admit she had four
     husbands.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     Yeah, it took her a while to grow
     up and find Mr. Right, but she did
     it. She found him.

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (another little smile)
     She used to call me Mr. Right.
     Remember that, Buddy?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (he is pale with anger)
     Yeah, I remember it.

Willcox picks up galley sheets, half turns away.

               DAVE WILKIE 
     Well, I tell you, I don't know what
     the world's come to these days.
     Things used to be better. We didn't
     have any money, but things were
     better. 
          (grimaces in anger)
     Goddamn niggers and kikes burning
     the flag, rioting, raising hell --
     they ought to shoot their asses
     off. I tell you, Buddy, where this
     country made its mistake was
     allowing people without property to
     vote.

During this speech, Willcox Hillyer grits his teeth but says
nothing. He keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. As Dave
shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation ..

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ATLANTA TERMINAL - HERTZ COUNTER - DAY

A shot of Willcox Hillyer at a Hertz Counter in the Atlanta
airport. A tense, wrought up Dave Wilkie is in the b.g. of
the shot. During the following brief exchange, Hillyer is
politely cool, Wilkie under a great strain.

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (holds out hand)
     Well, got to get a plane to
     Savannah. Great running into you,
     Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (sweating, tense, under
           some kind of awful
           emotional strain)
     Ah-h, if you happen to run into
     Rose sometime... do me a favor,
     give her a message for me, will
     you?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (a trifle wearily)
     Dave, I haven't seen Rose for
     years.

Hillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young HERTZ
GIRL, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag.
In desperation, Dave takes his arm.

               DAVE WILKIE 
     Buddy, I'm a sick man. I had a
     heart attack last year, I wasn't
     expected to live.

Hillyer turns to Dave, puzzled and interested; Dave earnestly
explains.

               DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
     You might see her. She writes your
     Daddy, and she and that doctor came
     to see him, didn't they? I wish
     you'd tell her something... I never
     could write letters.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (in a different tone,
           interested, curious)
     What do you want me to tell her,
     Dave?

               DAVE WILKIE 
          (a painful inward
           struggle; the man is
           tormented, miserable)
     Oh, to hell with it, never mind.
     Don't tell her anything. Don't even
     tell her you saw me. 
          (half turns his back, his
           face twisted with strong
           emotion)
     Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my
     plane.

Willcox Hillyer and the pretty young Hertz Girl stare after
Dave Wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. Hillyer
seems affected, less hostile toward Dave now. He speaks half
to himself, half to the Hertz Girl.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     He still loves her. The poor damn
     fool still loves her.

               HERTZ GIRL 
     Who was she?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     A girl named Rose.
          (pulls himself back into
           the world of reality)
     Still take R75 to Glenville?

               HERTZ GIRL 
     Yes, sir.

Willcox nods thanks and walks away carrying his travel bag.

EXT. ATLANTA AIRPORT - ROAD - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford driving from the airport.

EXT. INTERSTATE 75 - DAY

A shot of the red Ford on Interstate 75, Atlanta skyline in
b.g.

EXT. GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY

On the red Ford as it speeds along a Georgia Interstate
through red clay hills in green springtime.

INT./EXT. CAR - GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY

CUT TO a shot on Willcox Hillyer CLOSE ON his face in the
car. He is lost in reflection. A look of bitter sweet emotion
is on his face, an expression of sadness mixed with
amusement. As the CAMERA holds on his face, we hear again on
the track Louis Armstrong's great version of "DIXIE," or
music of comparable power, beauty and nostalgic evocation.
Now the music is stronger, much stronger than behind the
titles, we are beginning to hear it full force.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

BLURRED SCREEN FLASHBACK:

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DAY

A shot of a thirteen-year-old boy on the front porch of a
house in the sleepy Depression South of many years ago. He is
BUDDY, Willcox Hillyer as a boy. The MUSIC continues as he
shades his eyes to look at something far away.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a LONG POV shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl
walking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. A ZOOMAR LENSE
takes us TOWARD her. She is carrying a cardboard suitcase
tied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are
dusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired and
seems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but her
primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and
sweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with
the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she
stares ahead uncertainly at the "nice" Southern home which to
her seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frightened
and apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhausted
from the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. She
blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces
herself to walk on.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PORCH

CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the porch. Expressionless,
unreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an
even gaze directly into the CAMERA. He has his hands on his
hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a
mannerism of his father's.
Buddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always
with complete success. Unreadable as a Sphinx, he stands
there, waiting.

EXT. HILLYER HOME PORCH - DAY

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose at the foot of the porch steps. A
tentative little smile is on her face. It is very plain she
is nervous and frightened.

               ROSE 
     Hello. I'm Rose, and I've come to
     live with you and your family.

Silence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen,
Rose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another
little smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the
steps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot.
He still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his
expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.

               ROSE (CONT'D)
     What's your name? What do they call
     you?

Finally, the boy speaks -- and he is not so bad. He's a child
after all.

               BUDDY 
     Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.

               ROSE 
          (greatly reassured, a real
           smile now)
     Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice
     name, I like it. I am real pleased
     to meet you. 
          (solemnly holds out her
           hand, they shake)
     Hey, look, do you think you got a
     cold drink of ice water somewhere?

               BUDDY
     Sure. Let me take your suitcase.

A warm and beautiful smile comes on Rose's face and a little
twinkle comes into her eyes. The innocence and sweetness are
not lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes
boys and men.

               ROSE 
     You're sweet.

INT. HILLYER HOME BEDROOM STUDY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy's mother, Mrs. Hillyer, in a Morris
chair in her bedroom study.

MOTHER is a sensitive, kind and rather appealing if slightly
eccentric lady of about 37 or 38. She wears glasses, has a
Victorian hairdo and a 1930ish style dress. At the moment
Mother is absorbed in her studies -- notebooks and history
books are littered and piled everywhere around her chair. She
is drinking a Coca-Cola and smoking a cigarette held by a
bobbie pin. Calmly, she glances up as Buddy enters the room.
The CAMERA pulls back to include him.

               BUDDY 
     The new girl is here.

               MOTHER 
     Wonderful. What's she like,
     Brother? What is your impression of
     her?

               BUDDY 
     She talks a great deal and smiles a
     lot. She's very pretty, she has a
     real good figure. She's very
     girlish or womanish, if you know
     what I mean. She wouldn't hurt
     anybody, this girl. She couldn't.

Mother accepts her son's precocious pronouncement as
perfectly normal; talks to him as if he's an adult.

               MOTHER 
     Your impression is very reassuring,
     Brother. Of course she's had
     troubles, poor thing, but I sensed
     that was that the girl was like and
     I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.

               BUDDY 
     You mean confirmed, Mother. I
     didn't confirm it before. I would
     have had to confirm it previously,
     in order for it to be reconfirmed.

               MOTHER 
     All right, all right. Doll and
     Waski are upstairs taking their
     nap, you go get them and bring them
     down to the living room. Where is
     the girl?

               BUDDY 
     In the kitchen drinking all the ice
     water in Glenville. She walked out
     here, she didn't go by the hotel.

               MOTHER 
     Walked, in all that heat? It's a
     wonder she hasn't got sunstroke.
     I'll phone Daddy and you go get
     Doll Baby and Waski.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM

A shot of Mother, Rose, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the living
room of the Hillyer household. DOLL is a pretty little girl
of about 11, WASKI a boy of 5. Mother's tone is very gentle,
very sweet, very kind. Her unabashed admiration for her own
children has an ingenuousness that is more amusing than
offensive.

               MOTHER 
     Rose, this is Waski. His real name
     is Warren but we call him Waski. He
     doesn't like it much and I suppose
     someday we'll have to stop calling
     him that.

               WASKI
     You can stop it right now.

               MOTHER 
     When he was baby we called him "Wa
     Wa," a baby name, you know. You
     will find him a very good boy. His
     brother can be bad and so can his
     sister, but Waski is a very good
     boy. And as you can see he's
     beautiful.

               WASKI 
     Oh, Mother, cut it out.

               MOTHER 
          (serenely)
     There are plenty of girls who would
     give thousands of dollars to have
     your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty
     and that's all there is to it.
     Beauty is there and we have to
     recognize it. Now Rose, the little
     girl sitting across from you with
     the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She
     looks like an angel and she is an
     angel, but she can be a naughty
     angel sometimes, although her
     father won't believe it. Her real
     name is Frances, but we call her
     Dolly or Doll.

               DOLL 
     I don't like that, either, it's
     worse than Waski. I want to be
     called Fran.

               MOTHER 
     Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the
     redhaired boy you see sitting
     there, of course you have met him,
     he is my oldest son and my most
     brilliant child. All children have
     great creative powers, but I don't
     want to rattle on about my
     children, they say I brag too much
     about them, especially about
     Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?

Rose has not as yet caught on to Mother's style and is
staring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly popped.

               ROSE 
          (feebly)
     Oh, no, ma'am.

               MOTHER 
     Well, it's rather interesting about
     Brother, actually. I realized the
     remarkable thing he had when he was
     six weeks old. He looked at me and
     understood me, he knew exactly who
     I was. I know it sounds crazy but
     it's true. He's very remarkable, he
     was born for the ministry and could
     move millions, but he doesn't know
     that yet. I have to warn you about
     him, he can be very dangerous,
     there is an evil streak in him, a
     streak of pure sheer meanness. But
     at heart Brother is saintly and
     that is why he was born for the
     ministry even if he doesn't know
     it.

Thus, Mother. Slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with
reality, but no fool. A very intelligent woman really, and
very, very gentle and kind.
Her style, however, takes a little getting used to and her
long speech throws Rose completely. She stares at Mother in
speechless open-mouthed awe, unable to say a word.

The CAMERA moves in CLOSER on Rose as she moistens her lips,
swallows, tries to talk and can't. She is very, very nervous.
Now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine
VOICE OVER the shot. It is the voice of DADDY, Mr. Hillyer,
Buddy's father.

               DADDY'S VOICE 
     Honey, you'll scare the gizzard out
     of the girl going into the fourth
     dimension like that.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy in the doorway of the living room. He
is a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner
all his own. As extravagant as his remarks often are and
funny though he is at times, the man has a courtly Southern
dignity that is never lost. He is no clown, he is not even a
comedian, he is a man and a formidable man at that: all the
characters in this story love and fear him. We see now where
Buddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on
the hips thing. Daddy is unreadable. A straw hat is on the
back of his head, a rolled-up Glenville Tribune is in his
hand, his hands are on his hips. He is staring with what
seems to be stern fierceness at them all, but his attitude
really is inscrutable.

               MOTHER 
     It isn't the fourth dimension. To
     you it's the fourth dimension,
     maybe, to me it's simply the truth.

               DADDY 
          (staring fiercely at Rose)
     Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud
     has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all
     assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un
     hmmm.

Daddy walks in as Rose stares wide-eyed at him. It is obvious
he scares the absolute bejesus out of her, she looks actually
as if she might faint, her hands trembling on her lap and her
knees quivering beneath her cheap and tacky dress. But she
has a surprise coming. She is soon to lose all her fear of
him, every bit of it. Daddy walks over and sits in a chair
beside her, stares fiercely at her for a moment, then begins
a long speech. Again, extravagant as this speech is, he is no
clown, he is not "being funny," he means every word he says.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     Well, Rosebud, now you are here,
     darling, and I swear to God
     graceful as the capital letter S.
     You will adorn our house, Rosebud,
     you will give a glow and a shine to
     these old walls. If there's one
     thing I like to have around, it's a
     frizzy-haired blonde. Now I assume
     Mrs. Hillyer and the children have
     introduced themselves and made your
     acquaintance, and so forth and so
     on?

Rose can barely answer, eyes fixed in rapt fascination on
him, a half whisper.

               ROSE 
     Yes, sir.

               DADDY 
     All right. Now as head of this
     household I have a couple of
     remarks to make. It is my dear
     wife's belief, which I accept
     although I do not totally grasp it,
     that to hire a person to do
     household work is a criminal
     practice. Therefore, you are here
     not as a servant, you are here as a
     friend, as a guest and hopefully as
     a member of this family. You will
     eat your meals with us, you will
     share life itself with us -- in
     love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in
     love and harmony. Do you understand
     me?

               ROSE
          (a half whisper)
     Yes, sir.

Daddy pauses, then in a different tone, his hidden gentleness
and kindness are much more plain; as he talks Rose's eyes
begin to well with tears.

               DADDY 
     Now, I know you've had some
     troubles in your life, those...
     scoundrels in Birmingham and so
     forth trying to... lead you astray.
     I hope you find a safe haven here,
     honey, I know you've had a hard
     time. Life can be cruel to a young
     girl all alone. We welcome you to
     our home, Rosebud, we all welcome
     you from the heart and hope you are
     happy here.

Rose bites her lip, her eyes are filled with tears; an
inaudible whisper.

               ROSE 
     Yes, sir.

INT. HILLYER HOME

VARIOUS SHOTS of Rose doing household chores: sweeping the
floor, vacuuming, cooking. She is cheerful in her work,
smiling, good-humored and she works hard. It is obvious she
is happy. We see the children in most of these shots. It is
apparent Rose is a very good worker and very happy in her new
home.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Rose is washing the dishes while the children finish
breakfast. Buddy looks up from this cornflakes with a
slightly sly expression.

               BUDDY 
     Rose, who were those scoundrels in
     Birmingham?

               ROSE 
     Nobody.

               BUDDY 
     But who were they?

               ROSE 
     They were just bad men, that's all.

               BUDDY 
     In what sense were they bad?

               ROSE 
     Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no
     sense to it.

               BUDDY 
     Did they try to induce you to
     become a prostitute?

Rose turns around, lifts her eyebrows, tosses down the
dishcloth.

               ROSE 
     I don't answer talk like that,
     Buddy. I just don't hear it, I turn
     my back and look away.

Rose turns her back on him.

               BUDDY 
     Was that what they tried to do? Was
     that why Daddy gave you the job, to
     save you from those scoundrels?

               ROSE 
     Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll
     say that. He's the best and most
     kind-hearted man in the world.

               BUDDY 
     Hey, Rose, did you hear about that
     terrible thing down in Cave
     Springs?

               ROSE 
     What terrible thing in Cave
     Springs?

               BUDDY 
     There was this old man that ate his
     niece.

Rose stares emptily for a moment, then bites her lips
together.

               ROSE 
     I didn't hear you. I didn't hear
     that.

               BUDDY 
     He really did, he ate his little
     niece. He made pork chops out of
     her.

               ROSE 
     I don't hear you. I just turn my
     back on that kind of talk and look
     away.

               BUDDY 
     Well, it's only the truth. There
     are horrible things in the world,
     Rose.

               ROSE 
     Buddy, you are in one of your evil
     moods, I don't want to talk to you.
     I'm going out and sweep the patio.

Rose exits and the CAMERA stays on Buddy, Doll and Waski.

               BUDDY 
     Rose is almost as sentimental as
     Mother. If there's one thing I
     can't stand it's sentimentality. In
     Chattanooga this man committed an
     almost perfect murder. He killed
     his wife with a black widow spider.

               DOLL 
     Oh, shut up, Buddy.

               WASKI 
     Yeah, shut up.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose on the stone patio of the Hillyer
house, an attractive area with outdoor furniture and
crabapple tree limbs overhead. Rose is busy sweeping. The
CAMERA PANS to follow her and we pick up Mrs. Hillyer,
Mother. It is a nice day and she is studying out on the
patio, books and notebooks piled around. Rose glances down
curiously at her.

               ROSE 
     What are you studying now, Mrs.
     Hillyer?

               MOTHER 
     More history, Rose.

               ROSE 
     Are you going to get your degree
     soon?

               MOTHER 
     Well, I am working on my thesis.

               ROSE 
          (as she busily sweeps)
     It must be wonderful to be so
     smart. I don't see how you do it,
     reading all those books, learning
     all that stuff.

               MOTHER 
          (looks up, and gently)
     Rose, you work too hard. Why don't
     you go sit down somewhere and drink
     a Co-Cola?

               ROSE 
          (smiles, trusts and knows
           Mother now, not at all
           afraid of her)
     You're so sweet.

Rose again busily sweeps.

               MOTHER 
     Really, why don't you go sit down
     somewhere?

               ROSE 
     I like to work. I don't mind work.
     It's the least I can do after all
     you and Mr. Hillyer have done for
     me. 
          (stares worshipfully at
           Mother)
     You're so sweet. There never was
     nobody like you.

               MOTHER 
          (gently)
     Well, you run on now.

               ROSE 
     Yes, Ma'am.

Exit Rose. Mother adjusts her notebook and turns the page of
a history book as she resumes her studies. We hear the sound
of an approaching CAR and she glances up.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of a slightly worn-out 1932 Model-A Ford as it
rolls up the driveway of the Hillyer home, Daddy at the
wheel.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Daddy as he gets out of the Model-A. He has
his usual straw hat on the back of his head. The CAMERA
FOLLOWS him as he walks onto the patio.

               DADDY 
     Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful
     day.

               MOTHER 
     Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd
     work outside.

               DADDY 
     How goes it, darlin'?

               MOTHER 
     Slow, hon. But at least I can
     concentrate now that Rose is here.

               DADDY 
     What do you think of her, honey?

Mother doesn't answer, she writes on, head bowed over her
notebook. We see in this shot the hearing aid she wears and
hear from it a faint BUZZ.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     Turn up your hearing aid.

               MOTHER 
     What?

               DADDY 
     Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at
     me like a snake.

               MOTHER
          (adjusts hearing aid)
     Oh. Did you say something?

               DADDY 
     I asked you what you think of
     Rosebud, now that she's been here a
     while.

               MOTHER 
     Honey, she's perfect. She works all
     the time and she's wonderful with
     the children. And they love her,
     even Brother likes her though he
     won't admit it. I think she's just
     perfect.

               DADDY 
     Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.

               MOTHER 
     And she's such a good-hearted
     thing, there isn't an ounce of harm
     or malice in her.

               DADDY 
     Well, I'll admit I don't see any
     flies on her yet.

               MOTHER 
     There are no flies on Rose, I don't
     know what you're talking about.

               DADDY 
     Well, she must have done something
     to encourage those scoundrels in
     Birmingham, even if she did run
     away from them.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy in the window of the kitchen. He is
propped on his elbows and listening with keen interest to the
talk on the patio. We hear the VOICES of his parents OVER the
shot.

               MOTHER'S VOICE 
     If you mean... boys and men, I
     don't think so. Rose seems very
     calm about all of that.

               DADDY'S VOICE 
     Well, so far I have to agree. She
     seems calm as lettuce.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he draws back into the kitchen.
We see Doll and Waski playing a game on the kitchen table.

               BUDDY 
     Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce.
     Do you believe that, Doll?

               DOLL 
     No.

               WASKI 
     Neither do I.

               BUDDY 
     Oh, Waski, you don't even know what
     we're talking about.

               WASKI
     I do, too.

Buddy turns, looks back out the window.

EXT. HILLYER SOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO Mother and Daddy on the patio. Daddy stands up.

               DADDY 
     Well, let's hope for the best,
     darlin'.

               MOTHER 
     Hope for the best? I don't
     understand all this skepticism. I
     thought you liked Rose.

               DADDY 
     I love Rosebud, I am wild about
     Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't
     turn out to be a hidden hotcha
     character, that's all. We have
     growing children in the house.

               MOTHER 
     Hotcha character. If I had to live
     with your cynicism, I wouldn't want
     to live at all. What you can't
     understand is that the creative
     forces of the universe are
     positive, not negative.

               DADDY
          (gently, his irony is
           mild)
     All right, darlin', don't go off
     into the fourth dimension.

               MOTHER 
     I'm not in the fourth dimension --
          (points a finger at him)
     -- you are in the fourth dimension,
     when you allow skepticism and doubt
     to take control. As Blake said, if
     God had doubt the sun would go out.

               DADDY 
          (again gentle irony,
           always courtly toward
           her)
     Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I
     don't understand these deeper
     things the way you do.

               MOTHER 
          (reaches up, takes his
           hand)
     Be nice to Rose. She's never had a
     real home.

               DADDY 
     You're a wonderful woman, darlin'.
     As long as you're around, I'm sure
     the sun wouldn't dare go out.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll and Waski in the kitchen.
Doll and Waski are playing parchesi on the kitchen table.
Buddy turns from eavesdropping at the window and strolls
across the kitchen, hands in his khaki pants.

               BUDDY 
     It's pitiful. Neither one of them
     know.

               DOLL 
          (as she shakes dice)
     I think Daddy suspects.

               BUDDY 
     No, he doesn't. Not really.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he goes to the hall door,
carefully opens it to make no noise and peers down the hall.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose busy dusting hall furniture,
humming as she works. We hear on the track the SOUND of the
Model-A starting, and Rose freezes. Then, quickly, Rose
hurries down the hall toward the front door.

ON Buddy as he watches her through a crack in the door. He
has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his face is
expressionless.

ANOTHER ANGLE, POV of Buddy but CLOSER on Rose at the end of
the hall. She is staring soulfully through the glass of the
front door as we hear the Model-A go down the driveway. Rose
lifts a hand between her breasts, sighs. A lovesick
expression is on her face.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

ON Buddy, as he comes back into the kitchen sadly shaking his
head.

               BUDDY
     It's really pitiful. She's in bad
     shape.

               DOLL
     She's watching the car again?

               BUDDY
     Yeah.

               DOLL
     I get so irritated with Daddy. He's
     so dumb sometimes.

               WASKI
     Yeah, I know.

               BUDDY
     Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.

               WASKI
     I do, too!

               BUDDY
     All right, what do you know?

               WASKI
     Rose is madly in love with Daddy...

               DOLL
          (pauses, then solemnly)
     Well, don't tell Mother.

               WASKI
     Do you think I'm crazy?

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A shot of the family at dinner in the dining room at night.
Daddy is at the head of the table, Mother is at the other
end.

Buddy, Doll and Waski are all seated in neat, nice clothes,
hands washed and hair combed. Rose is serving, but a place is
set for her. She wears an attractive little apron and is
smiling, blushing, happy as Daddy teases and jokes at her.

               DADDY
     (in a good humor) 
     Rosebaby Blossom, these are the
     most delicious candied yams I ever
     ate! Why, they just melt in my
     mouth. And this fried chicken is
     fit for a king. How do you do it,
     Peachbird? What is the secret of
     your art, Plum Blossom, huh?

               ROSE
          (blushing, smiling)
     Oh, I don't know, I... I...

               DADDY 
     Rosebird Baby, you are the light of
     my life, darlin'. How did we ever
     get by without you?

               ROSE 
          (stares at him, stricken)
     I... I'll get the grits.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Rose as she exits, and STOPS on Buddy and
Doll. Buddy slews his eyes toward his sister, who meets his
gaze for a moment then looks down at her plate. The CAMERA
MOVES on to Mother, who is utterly oblivious of anything
going on between Rose and Daddy.

               MOTHER 
     Rose does have a gift for cooking.
     She learns so fast, but mainly I
     think it's that she tries so hard.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the family as they eat dinner. Rose is
seated at the table now. She is picking lifelessly at her
food and glancing from time to time with a lovesick
expression at Daddy, who is busy eating and seems wholly
unaware of it. Mother also is wholly unaware, but all the
children know what is happening. Rose takes a gravy for a
biscuit and spills a little, her hand is trembling.

               MOTHER
          (gently, suspects
           absolutely nothing)
     Rose, you're in an awful dither
     tonight. What's the matter with
     you, honey, are you sick or
     something?

               ROSE
          (in a feeble voice)
     No, ma'am, I'm just fine.

               MOTHER 
     You look sick if you ask me. I hate
     to leave you with the dishes and
     all, but I'm supposed to go to a
     meeting of the Garden Club this
     evening.
          (to Daddy)
     I'll need the car keys.

               DADDY 
     I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got
     no business behind the wheel of an
     automobile. You don't think about
     what you're doing and you'll run
     into a telephone pole.

               MOTHER 
     I think about what I'm doing all
     the time, and I've got as much
     business behind the wheel of an
     automobile as anybody. Besides, I
     want you to stay and help Rose with
     the dishes, the poor girl isn't
     feeling well.

               DADDY 
     All right, darlin'.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

A shot of Daddy alone in the dining room, reading a newspaper
and drinking coffee. Rose comes INTO THE PICTURE, gets dishes
as she clears the table. She stares with a lovesick
expression at Daddy, who is absorbed in paper.

               DADDY
          (to himself, mostly)
     Hmmp. Did you realize there are a
     thousand Coca-Cola millionaires in
     Atlanta?

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll tiptoeing down the darkened
hall toward the front door. We hear the MODEL-A going down
the drive. They peer out of the glass of the front door. They
whisper.

               BUDDY
     There goes Mother.

               DOLL
     Yeah.

               BUDDY 
     Let's go peep from the living room.

               DOLL
     Okay.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they tiptoe into the darkened
living room. They go over to the sliding doors and silently
struggle for the best peeping spot. Buddy gets up high, Doll
down low, at the crack in the doors through which light
shines.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of the dining room, as seen by children.
Daddy sits absorbed in his paper, oblivious of Rose. She is
staring down at him with a pale look of love.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a CLOSE-UP of Buddy and Doll, their heads together.
They whisper.

               DOLL
     I think she's gonna kiss him.

               BUDDY
     At least.

INT. HILLYER HOME DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy and Rose, as seen by children. The
table now is cleared and Rose stands half behind Daddy,
staring down at him with a stricken expression.

               DADDY 
          (half to himself)
     Ehh, Lord, should have bought that
     stock when we had some money. A
     thousand millionaires.

Rose suddenly makes up her mind, places her hand on his
shoulder, turns sideways, sits down on his lap, puts an arm
around his neck.

               ROSE 
     Oh, oh! Oh, Mr. Hillyer, I love
     you, I love you so much! I've
     tried, but I can't help it! Please
     kiss me -- will you kiss me?

For a long time Daddy stares groggily at her with a half
frown as if he can't believe it. In order to stare at her, he
must tilt his head back and, handsome man though he is, he
looks a bit like a startled rooster. Her breasts are pressed
against him, and her eager -pink lips are waiting for a kiss.

               DADDY 
          (finally clears his
           throat)
     Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap.
     What are you doing, girl? Are you
     crazy?

               ROSE
     Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr.
     Hillyer!

               DADDY 
     Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you
     crazy girl. Now I'm telling you
     again, get off my lap. Come on,
     Rose, get up. Now you get up, I
     say, and stop this!

               ROSE 
     No, no! You don't understand, I
     love you! It's real love and I
     can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr.
     Hillyer, I love you, I love you so
     much...

Rose breaks down and begins crying, her head on his shoulder.
She has her arms wound tight around him and Daddy seems at a
loss what to do.

               DADDY
          (in a shaken voice)
     All right, all right. Now calm
     down, Rose, the children will hear
     you. Calm down, let's talk... about
     this thing, let's discuss it.

               ROSE
          (sobbing)
     Don't make me... me... me... get
     up!

               DADDY 
     Calm down, Rose, let's calm down
     and discuss it ...

INT. HILLYER HOKE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll. Doll is down near the floor
and can't see as well. They whisper.

               DOLL 
     I can't see. What are they doing,
     what's happening?

               BUDDY 
     They're discussing it.

               DOLL 
     I can't see, let me see...

Doll tries to rise up and Buddy puts a hand on her head and
shoves her down.

               BUDDY 
     This is my place and you can't have
     it.

               DOLL
          (a whispered moan of
           frustration)
     Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?

               BUDDY
          (his eyes open wide)
     He's trying to get up -- good God,
     one of her titties is out!

               DOLL 
     Let me see!

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy and Rose, as he struggles to rise
from the chair. They are half falling to the floor and now
they fall, Rose still on his lap. One of her breasts has come
out of her dress, which is very loose and low-cut. She has no
bra, the breast is bare. Daddy is staring groggily at the
breast as if slightly dazed.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK TO Buddy and Doll. Buddy is frustrated now.

               BUDDY 
     Now I can't see. What are they
     doing?

               DOLL 
          (happy, peeping through
           crack)
     Boy! Wow!

Buddy groans and peers intently through crack.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A POV shot of scene as observed by Buddy. He is up too high,
the dining table blocks his view. We see the lower half of
Rose and Daddy. Rose's skirt is up well above her knees.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll.

               DOLL 
     Wow! Brrrother!

               BUDDY 
     What are they doing?

               DOLL 
     Buddy, this is amazing, you
     wouldn't believe it.

               BUDDY 
     What are they doing, Doll?

               DOLL 
          (staring, enthralled)
     He kissed her.

               BUDDY
     Is that all?

               DOLL 
          (happily, enjoying it)
     He had his hand on her titty.

               BUDDY 
     Let me look. 
          (can't stand it, grabs her
           around waist and pulls
           her away; eagerly looks,
           sags)
     Aww-rr...

CUT TO a POV shot of the scene in the dining room.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

DOWN LOW, we can see under the dining room table now. Daddy
has his hands on Rose's shoulders and is firmly pushing her
away.

               DADDY
     All right, that is enough of this
     nonsense, and I mean enough! Get up
     off this floor, Rose, and put your
     damned tit back in your dress! Do
     you hear me, girl, get up off of
     that floor!

Rose, on all fours, blonde hair over her face, making little
whimpering noises of dismay:

               ROSE
     Ohh-hhh... ohh...

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO Buddy and Doll.

               BUDDY 
          (disappointed)
     She's putting the titty back.

               DOLL 
          (a furious whisper)
     Buddy, that was my place.

Doll forces her way in and they both peep through crack in
door.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose and Daddy. Rose stands sheepishly
by the dining room table, half-crying as she adjusts her
dress. Daddy sits in his dining room chair. Daddy is glaring
at her.

               DADDY 
     Goddamn you, girl! You've made me
     make a fool out of myself, damn
     your hide, but let me tell you I am
     standing at the pass of Thermopylae
     and I won't budge! The very idea,
     my own home with children in the
     house, to say nothing of my wife --
     oh-h, you had better believe I am
     standing at Thermopylae, you little
     nut, you had better believe it!
     What are you, crazy? A man is
     supposed to be a fool like this,
     but a woman is supposed to have
     some control and sense! Are you a
     nitwit? What's the matter with you?

               ROSE 
          (weeping)
     Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr.
     Hillyer... I just... couldn't help
     myself. I'm sorry...

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they peep at the door.
Doll whispers angrily at him.

               DOLL 
     Buddy, that was pretty snotty of
     you, pushing me away like that just
     when it was interesting.

               BUDDY 
     You shouldn't watch such things,
     Doll.

They continue to peep with interest through the crack in the
doors.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Daddy. Now Rose is sitting penitent
and crying in one of Daddy's handkerchiefs. Daddy's anger is
gone, he has gotten control of himself and speaks to her now
in a different tone.

He sits beside her, an arm around her shoulders in a fatherly
way.

               DADDY 
     Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor
     miserable little child, don't you
     know I love you? Do I have to put
     my hand on your body or kiss your
     pretty lips to prove it? You are
     beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved
     you since you first came here,
     darlin'. And don't you know Mrs.
     Hillyer loves you, too, that she's
     already taken you into her heart,
     and that that woman's heart is as
     wide as the blue sky itself and as
     deep as the stars?

               ROSE 
          (weeping in handkerchief)
     Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's
     been so good to me...

               DADDY 
     Do you know what a friend you have
     got there? Do you know she would
     fight for you like a tiger, that
     she would fly to your defense in an
     instant with all the courage in her
     soul if anyone tried to hurt you?
     Is this any way to repay her trust
     and love? Are you ashamed as I am
     ashamed? 
          (pauses as Rose sobs in
           handkerchief)
     Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But
     let me warn you, damn your hide,
     this is Thermopylae and I am
     standing here. Do you hear me, damn
     you. I am standing at Thermopylae
     and the Persians shall not pass!
     Now get your tail out of here and
     go wash those dishes, and stop
     crying!

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO Buddy and Doll in the darkened living room. He
gestures that they'd better leave, and they do. The CAMERA
FOLLOWS them as they tiptoe out of the living room.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STAIRS - NIGHT

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Buddy and Doll as they tiptoe up the front
stairs.

INT. HILLYER HOME - TOP OF STAIRS - NIGHT

ON Buddy and Doll at the top of the stairs. They pause to
talk and now they don't have to whisper. Doll is happy,
pleased.

               DOLL 
     Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted
     to kiss her some more and play with
     her, but he didn't, because he
     loves Mother and all of us, and he
     loves Rose, too. Isn't he
     wonderful, isn't he great?

               BUDDY 
          (dryly, aloof; he doesn't
           mean this really)
     Wonderful? He kissed her and played
     with her titty, and I don't see
     anything so great about that. He
     was probably afraid Mother would
     come back early and catch him.

               DOLL 
     You know, Buddy, sometimes you make
     me sick.

Doll gives him a venomous glance and walks away. The CAMERA
STAYS on Buddy as he stares after her with a thin little
smile. Be seems wryly amused that he has made her angry.
After a moment, he turns and stares in the direction of
downstairs and his face changes. His smile fades, then slowly
returns as he thinks of what has happened.

               BUDDY 
          (quietly, to himself)
     Thermopylae. The Persians shall not
     pass.

It is obvious that secretly Buddy admires very much his
father's behavior.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A shot of Buddy at night in his small bedroom.

He wears a rather skimpy old-fashioned nightshirt that comes
midway between his hips and knees. At the moment he is
finishing brushing his teeth at the bureau, using an old
fashioned water pitcher and bowl. The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he
walks across the room in the light of the lamp by his bed. He
looks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of his
bed. He pushes it far back and we see springs. He takes out a
small "book" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it.

CLOSE-UP: The front cover of the pamphlet. We see the overall
title: LITTLE DIRTY COMIC BOOKS. And beneath it: BLONDIE AND
DAGWOOD. And beneath that, in smaller letters: "Mr. Dithers
Comes to Dinner -- and How!" We see Buddy's hands in the
shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a
glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a drawing
maybe of "Blondie" stark naked with a finger in her mouth
going, "Tee-Hee!"

ON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the
Little Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps to
the bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to the
bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on the
flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a
faint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back the
covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and
throws the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies on
pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of his
room OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on a weepy Rose in a very thin nightgown. The
shot is FROM BELOW as Buddy might see her as she stands over
his bed. She looks very lonely and unhappy and is half
crying.

               ROSE 
     Buddy... are you asleep?

ANOTHER ANGLE, on both of them. Buddy stares at her in
surprise. It is dim in the room, but we can see them in the
moonlight.

               BUDDY
     No, I'm awake. What's the matter?

               ROSE 
     Buddy, I am wandering in a
     wilderness, lost. 
          (sits glumly on edge of
           bed)
     I just feel awful. Do you mind if I
     get in bed with you for a little
     while?

               BUDDY 
     Well, all right.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed in the moonlight.
It is all innocent enough, Buddy is a child and Rose
obviously has no lewd intent in getting into his bed. She
lies back on a pillow staring up at the ceiling and smoking a
cigarette.

               ROSE 
     I thought I'd go crazy back there
     in that room all by myself with
     nobody to talk to. As a child, I
     never had no room all to myself, we
     were awful poor. Buddy... I have
     got a confession to make.

               BUDDY 
     What is it, Rose?

               ROSE 
     It's so terrible I can't tell you.
     Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it
     hurts to have a broken heart, what
     a terrible feeling it is, and I've
     had a broken heart so many times.
     Men, I don't understand them, I
     can't figure them out and they
     break my heart, that's all. I can't
     find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find
     him no matter how hard I look, all
     I find is a whole pile of Mr.
     Wrongs. But this is the worst ever
     because it wasn't his fault. It was
     my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was
     bad -- oh God, I was bad, you
     wouldn't believe how bad I was.

               BUDDY 
          (a little smile)
     What'd you do, Rose?

               ROSE 
     Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell
     you who it was, but do you know
     what I did? I sat on his lap and
     got ahold of him and wiggled and
     wiggled my ass on him and was
     worse'n you could know, a child
     like you. Why, I let one of my tits
     fall out deliberate on purpose and
     practically smack him in the face
     with it and I let my dern skirt
     come up so he could see my
     drawers... 
          (pauses, realizes this
           isn't too dignified)
     But to get back serious to what I
     was sayin', it is not only, Buddy,
     the loss of him but my own bad
     behavior what bothers me so...

               BUDDY 
     You were pretty bad, huh?

               ROSE 
     Why, it has just made me ill,
     Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to
     eat nothin', I don't, and me I got
     a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral
     for me. I'm ill.

               BUDDY
          (slyly, pretends he
           doesn't know)
     But, Rose, what is the cause of it
     all?

               ROSE
     Promise not to tell Doll? -- or
     nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm
     so much in love with him I am out
     of my mind!

               BUDDY
     But, Rose, how could such a thing
     as that happen?

               ROSE
     I fell madly in love with him when
     he called me Rosebud. You know that
     first day when I come and he said I
     looked graceful like a capital
     letter S and called me Rosebud? I
     fell madly in love with that man
     right then.
          (sighs tragically)
     But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a
     good man and won't have nothin' to
     do with me.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed. Buddy has
propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the
moonlight -- we see the soft notch between her breasts in the
open V of her thin nightgown. She is completely unself
conscious with him.

               BUDDY 
          (casually)
     Can I touch you here?

Before she can answer, he touches her breast with his finger
through her nightgown.

               BUDDY (CONT'D)
     Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.

               ROSE 
          (casually, doesn't object)
     What did you expect?

               BUDDY 
     Well, I thought they were more like
     a cantaloupe.

               ROSE 
     Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a
     cantaloupe.

               BUDDY 
          (touches her breast more
           boldly, his hand outside
           the nightgown)
     There's some kind of gristle in it,
     though.

               ROSE 
     Buddy, quit that, you're just a
     child, you're not supposed to be
     interested in such things.

               BUDDY 
     Actually, I am, though.

               ROSE 
          (dreamily, thinking of
           Daddy as she smokes
           cigarette and stares up
           at the ceiling)
     You know, that Daddy of yours is
     the funniest man, the things he
     says, you never know what's going
     to come out of his mouth next.

               BUDDY
     Can I put my hand inside your
     nightgown, Rose?

               ROSE 
     No, you can't. And I'll tell you
     this -- he scares me. As kind as he
     is, he scares me. You can't fool
     around with him, not with that man.
     And, boy, I sure better not try
     nothin' like that with him again,
     he'll fire me.

               BUDDY
     Rose, can't I see what the nipple
     on it is like?

               ROSE
          (frowns)
     Buddy, what's come over you? A
     child like you, askin' such things.

               BUDDY
     But I'm curious, Rose.

Puts his hand in her nightgown.

               ROSE 
     Buddy, get your hand offa me! Quit
     it, get you hand away...

Takes his wrist.

               BUDDY 
     Just for a second. Please, Rose,
     what's the harm?

               ROSE 
          (gently)
     Buddy, you don't realize it but
     what you're doing isn't nice.

               BUDDY 
     Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see
     what the nipple on it is like.

               ROSE 
     You don' t need to know that. It's
     none of your business.

               BUDDY 
     Aw, be a good sport, Rose. 
          (sweetly, almost sugarily)
     You like me, don't you? I like you
     a lot.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. We
see Daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly
out into space. Mother lies asleep in a big four poster in
the background of the shot. Daddy sighs wearily to himself in
the grip of "insomnia in reverse."

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK to Buddy and Rose in bed. He has evidently sweet
talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in
her nightgown. There is no indication of lewd interest on
Rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face.
Buddy seems quite fascinated, however.

               ROSE 
     Well, are you satisfied now? Can we
     just lie and talk, huh?

               BUDDY 
     Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.

               ROSE 
     'Course it does.

               BUDDY 
     First I couldn't feel it, but now I
     feel it easily, it's like a little
     acorn.

               ROSE 
          (moistens her lips,
           swallows; it is affecting
           her; she frowns)
     All right, that's enough. 
          (firmly pushes his hand
           away)
     You're just a child and wouldn't
     understand it, but that type of
     thing can stir a girl up. Now lie
     back and we'll talk.

               BUDDY 
     That was very interesting. Thank
     you, Rose.

               ROSE 
          (lighting cigarette)
     Don't mention it.

               BUDDY
          (pensively, with the
           solemn pedanticness of a
           precocious child)
     It was softer'n I thought, that was
     my main impression. You know, if
     you hit a girl there it would hurt
     her a lot.

               ROSE 
     Who would want to do such a thing
     as that?

               BUDDY 
     Well, some fiend might.

               ROSE 
          (stares wonderingly at
           him)
     You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't
     figure you out at all. You can be
     very nice, but like your mother
     said there's an evil streak in you.

               BUDDY 
     There's an evil streak in
     everybody, Rose.

               ROSE 
     There ain't none in your Daddy. You
     know, what happened has just made
     me love him all the more. I not
     only love him, I respect him, I
     admire him.

               BUDDY 
     Rose, I have a serious favor to ask
     you.

               ROSE 
     Most men wouldn't do what he done.
     If they can get a girl they go
     right ahead and get her -- I guess
     to hell they do, just like a dern
     rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell
     her she's no good when they done
     the same thing their selves.
     They're a bunch of monkeys. I like
     'em, but they're a bunch of
     monkeys.

               BUDDY 
          (trying to be casual)
     Rose, since you're here in bed with
     me and everything and I've already
     touched your titty...

Can't quite say it; leans over and whispers in her ear and we
don't hear what he says.

               ROSE 
          (her eyes open wide as he
           whispers)
     Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What
     an awful thing to say, and where
     did you get any such idea as that,
     anyhow?

               BUDDY 
     I'm curious to see what it's like.
     I'm very curious, Rose.

               ROSE 
     Well, now that is just too bad!
     Curiosity killed the cat.

               BUDDY 
     Yeah, but satisfaction brought him
     back. Can I?

               ROSE 
     No! You ought to be ashamed of
     yourself astin' such a nasty things
     a child your age!

               BUDDY
     Can't I touch it a little, Rose --
     not a lot, just a little?

               ROSE 
     Of course you can't! I'm... I'm
     shocked at you, Buddy, real
     shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm
     going back to my own bed!

               BUDDY
     Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's
     all, I have a natural curiosity,
     it's only human. You're my friend,
     aren't you? Don't you like me? 
          (again sweetly, almost
           sugarily)
     I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact,
     I love you.

               ROSE 
          (softens despite herself)
     Well, you're sweet, but you don't
     really love me.

               BUDDY 
     Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good
     sport.

               ROSE 
     Buddy, you're just a child.

               BUDDY 
     I'm thirteen. And I have a natural
     curiosity. It's only nature, Rose,
     that's all. Now what's wrong with
     nature, huh?

               ROSE 
     Well, nothin'.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy sitting on the edge of his bed in
pajamas. He looks frowzle-haired and glum. The CAMERA FOLLOWS
him as he wearily gets up and walks across the bedroom in the
moonlight and takes a package of cigarettes from a bureau. Be
glances over his shoulder as we hear Mother.

               MOTHER 
     What's the matter, hon? Is anything
     wrong?

               DADDY 
     No, darlin'. Just that damnable
     insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a
     baby for an hour then I'm wide
     awake. You go back to sleep.

Daddy lights a cigarette and walks to the window and stares
out at the moonlit night.

The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER on his face and we see a weariness
and strain he has not shown before.

               DADDY 
     The Depression has got me. That
     miserable hotel, no money anywhere,
     strong men out of work, children
     hungry. It's a great life if you
     don't weaken.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A shot close on Rose and Buddy in bed. Evidently Rose has
weakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her, but we can
only surmise this, the shot is on their heads and shoulders
and a cloud has crossed the moon, the light is more dim. A
different look is on her face, a solemn expression as if she
is listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely
haunting. She moistens her lips, speaks in a slightly feeble
voice.

               ROSE 
     You better quit that.

               BUDDY 
     But Rose...

               ROSE 
     I must be outta my mind. Buddy,
     quit it.

               BUDDY 
     Am I hurting you?

               ROSE 
          (pauses, stares off as if
           listening, then in an
           even feebler tone, a half
           whisper)
     No. No, you're not hurting me. 
          (moistens her lips,
           swallows)
     But I think you better quit it.

               BUDDY 
     But why, if I'm not hurting you?

               ROSE 
     You wouldn't understand.
          (puts a hand on his
           shoulder as if to push
           him away, but can't; puts
           her other hand over her
           eyes)
     Oh, God, I must be outta my mind.
     What would your Momma think?

The hand falls limply from Rose's eyes and she turns her head
to the side and closes her eyes. Helplessly, she lies there
as the boy fiddles with her.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in a
bathrobe and slippers. He looks very frowzled and sleepy.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

ON Daddy as he walks into the kitchen, turns on the light. He
goes to the ice box, an old-fashioned type made of wood that
takes cakes of ice. Be pours out a glass of milk.

INT. HILLYER ROME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a very CLOSE SHOT on Rose's face. The light is dim but
we see perspiration on her forehead. Her breathing is not
normal. Her eyes are shut tight, her teeth are clenched.

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy. We do not see what he is doing,
but evidently he is fiddling with her. He seems quite
interested in the proceedings.

               BUDDY 
     Rose, beyond a doubt this is the
     most fascinating experience of my
     life.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy in the kitchen as he sits rather
gloomily at the kitchen table drinking the glass Of milk.

               DADDY 
          (to himself)
     Ehh-hh, Lord, man born of woman
     hath few days and they are full of
     trouble.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot close on Rose ai Buddy in the bed. The shot is
of their heads and shoulders.
She has an arm very tight around his shoulders and her eyes
are shut tight. The moment of truth is at hand.

               ROSE 
     Ohh-hh! Ohhh-hh! 
          (it's all over; she twists
           sideways, puts both arms
           around him)
     Oh, Buddy, you're so sweet. I love
     you a lot.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy as he washes out the glass in the
sink.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy in the bed. The extremity of
her crime has dawned on Rose and she is sitting up in the bed
with a look of horror on her face. Buddy is staring worriedly
at her.

               BUDDY 
     Rose, are you all right? Are you
     sick or something?

               ROSE 
          (staring off in space,
           lost in horror)
     No. No, I'm all right. 
          (turns, stares at him,
           puts a hand in woe on her
           forehead)
     Oh, God, what have I done? I have
     robbed a cradle and fallen into
     hell!
          (fumbles desperately on
           bed for cigarettes)
     I must be crazy, a child like you.
     Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful,
     this is terrible, I gotta get outta
     here!

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy as Rose in a panic gets out
of the bed, pulls down her thin nightgown and tiptoes toward
the door. She stops and looks back as a chilling thought
occurs to her.

               ROSE 
     Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody,
     would you?

               BUDDY 
          (a trifle too piously)
     Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a
     soul.

               ROSE 
     I sure hope you don't.
          (still in a panic)
     I gotta get outta here, good night.

               BUDDY 
          (sweetly)
     Good night, Rose.

INT. HILLYER SOME - UPSTAIRS HALL AND DOWNSTAIRS HALL

CUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in
his bathrobe. The shot is down the staircase and Rose in the
upstairs hall tiptoes into the picture. A floorboard creaks
and he looks up and sees her.

               DADDY 
     Rose, what are you doing up?

               ROSE 
     Nothin', just goin' to the
     bathroom.

               DADDY 
     Is anything wrong?

               ROSE 
     No, sir.

               DADDY 
     Well, good night.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose in the upstairs hall. Fortunately for
her the light is dim. Her knees are shaking beneath the
nightgown, she looks as if she might faint.

               ROSE 
     Good night.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS her as she goes on shaky legs down the
hall.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose as she enters her small bedroom.
Feebly, as if totally exhausted, she shuts the door behind
her then leans against a bureau and states into its mirror.
The horror of her own criminality has overwhelmed her. With
trembling hands, she takes a cigarette from her half empty
pack and finds a wooden kitchen match on the bureau.
Her hands tremble visibly as she strikes the match. She has
not turned on the light in her room and her considerable
charms are very apparent in the orange glow of the match.
Burning match in her fingers, she stares at her own
reflection in the bureau mirror, transfixed by a horrible
realization.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DREAM - CELLAR

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BLURRED SCREEN: the border of the screen is
blurred, we are obviously seeing a nightmare fantasy. The
shot is of an eager, excited, diabolically mischievous Buddy
and an astonished, awed DOLL. They are in some far dark
recess of the cellar of the house and the scene is furtive,
murky, cobwebby.

               BUDDY 
     Wait till you hear what happened!
     Now you wont believe this, Doll,
     but Rose came in my room and got in
     my bed last night...

ANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy from below with candlelight giving his
child's face a sinister look. Now he has "Dracula" teeth and
evil arched eyebrows.

               BUDDY (CONT'D)
     ... and she sweated and snorted
     like a horse and had a horrible
     fit, her eyebrows were all
     scrunched up and she groaned like
     she was eying and foamed at the
     mouth!

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose standing horrified before the mirror.
The match is still burning in her fingers.

                                   QUICK CUT TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM/STUDY

A shot of Mother in her study, a worried Doll stands before
her. The border of the screen is blurred, it is another flash
of fantasy.

               MOTHER 
     Yes, dear, what is it?

               DOLL 
     Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his
     bed last night and he fiddled with
     her and she snorted and had a fit --
     and he says I would too if I was
     grown-up. Is it true, Mother --
     would I sweat and snort and froth
     at the mouth and have a horrible
     fit like he says?

Mother stares in consternation at Doll.

                                   QUICK CUT TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

A shot of Daddy and Rose on the front porch of the house. The
scene is murky, dark, gloomy night and the weather is bad.
Daddy has his arm rigidly thrust outward as he points down
the driveway. A weeping, slumped Rose sadly walks down the
steps carrying her cardboard suitcase. Fantasy.

               DADDY 
     Out! Out, you viper in the grass!
     Out! Never darken our doorstep, you
     immoral, terrible girl!

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK to Rose standing before the mirror, sick with
horror. A feeble whimper-like groan comes from her.

               ROSE
     Ohh-hh, ohhh-hh... 
          (match burns her fingers,
           she shakes it out)
     Ouch! Oh-hh... ohh...

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose as she turns from the bureau and stares
off into space, a very badly frightened girl. Half-crying,
she speaks to herself.

               ROSE (CONT'D)
     He'll tell 'em for sure, he will.
     Oh, Lord, what can I do?

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy half asleep in bed. The light of the
lamp by his bed goes on and he sleepily opens his eyes. The
CAMERA COMES BACK and we see Rose in her nightgown standing
by his bedside. She is very pale and tears are on her cheeks.

               ROSE 
     I hate to turn on this light, you
     Daddy's awake downstairs, but I
     have to take the chance.
          (sits by him on bed)
     Buddy, please don't tell on me.

               BUDDY
          (rather coolly)
     I said I wouldn't. 

               ROSE
          (her lip trembles)
     Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as
     I've been please have pity on me
     and don't ruin me by telling them
     what I did. I know it was bad, it
     was bad and dumb. But mostly it was
     dumb, I didn't mean you no harm,
     I'd never want to hurt a hair on
     your head and that's the truth. I
     love you. But they'd think I did,
     they'd think I was awful, they'd
     despise me and hate me...

Rose bows her head and begins crying into her hands.

CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Buddy. We hear the soft sound of Rose
weeping over the shot. Buddy is affected, his flinty child's
heart has been touched, but he is not quite ready to admit it
yet. He is struggling with himself, trying to remain "cool"
and not show his emotion. He frowns, moistens his lips,
swallows. With seeming coolness, very much as in the scene
with Doll in which he deprecated Daddy's stand at
Thermopylae, he shrugs.

               BUDDY 
     Well, I don't know what you're
     worried about. It was my idea, I
     was the one who thought of it, not
     you.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Rose. She is staring at the
boy with hopeless despair.

               ROSE 
     You don't understand. They'd blame
     me, not you. And they'd think I was
     awful, a disgustin' girl, which I
     am, but Buddy, please don't tell
     them. Please don't. Ill have to go
     and I love it here, I love your
     whole fam'ly, your Daddy, your
     Mother... 
          (pauses, then makes her
           final and ultimate plea
           in a shaking voice as
           tears run down)
     Buddy, I know I'm no good, I'm a
     bad girl but I can't help it,
     please have pity on me and don't
     tell! Please don't, please...

Too much for Buddy, he loses his "cool." He swallows and
blinks as if he might cry, then sits erect in the bed and
squares his shoulders and assumes a stern expression Daddy
style.

               BUDDY 
          (very solemnly)
     Rose, they could stick splinters
     under my fingernails, and I will
     never say a word! I will never tell
     them, because... I love you!

               ROSE 
          (sees that he means it,
           smiles in relief and
           throws her arms around
           him)
     Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew
     you did, knew it all the time...

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, lying in bed and staring up
sleeplessly at the ceiling. Insomnia in reverse has got him.

               DADDY 
          (a half whisper to
           himself)
     Ehh-hh, Lord... great life if you
     don't weaken.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy. Rose is sitting on the bed
beside him and she has dried her tears and got herself in
hand.

               ROSE 
     Well, Ill tell you this. I have
     learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't
     gonna run around, but when I start
     botherin' your Daddy and worse
     robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the
     facts of life. 
          (pauses, then with firm
           resolution)
     Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get
     myself up and go out.

               BUDDY 
          (a wee mite puzzled)
     You're going to get yourself up and
     go out?

               ROSE 
     Buddy, Mr. Right is out there
     somewhere and I'm gonna find him!

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A shot of a coolly angry Mother in the kitchen. It is late
morning. As she talks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show a
sheepish Buddy standing "on the carpet before her. The other
children, Doll and Waski, are seated at the kitchen table
having hamburgers for lunch. They are happily smiling with
schadenfreude amusement at their brother's discomfiture.

               MOTHER 
     Brother, when I have to wake you up
     at eleven o'clock in the morning
     you're either sick or you were up
     very late last night. 
          (points a finger at him)
     And you weren't reading Huckleberry
     Finn. I looked and its not in your
     room. Now what were you doing?

               BUDDY 
          (sheepish)
     Mother, I have to tell the truth. I
     wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I
     was reading one of those Little
     Dirty Comic Books.

               MOTHER 
          (sadly)
     Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed
     in you. You mustn't look at those
     horrible things, they degrade the
     human image.

               BROTHER 
          (hangs head)
     They're filthy, Mother.

               MOTHER 
     Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the
     most beautiful things in life, the
     creative power of the universe is
     behind it.

               BROTHER 
     I know, Mother.

               MOTHER 
     But we must respect that power, we
     must be in awe of it.

               BROTHER 
     I am in awe of it, Mother.

               MOTHER 
     I don't think you are sufficiently
     in awe of it. Get the castor oil.

               BROTHER 
          (winces, as Doll and Waski
           happily smile)
     Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.

               MOTHER
     This isn't punishment, I don't
     believe in punishment. It's for
     your health. Obviously you're sick
     if you can act like that.

As she talks, Buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil
and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. A smiling
Doll comes forward and hands Buddy half of an orange. He
makes a face at her. Mother takes the bottle and pours out a
tablespoon of castor oil.

               BUDDY
          (wanly)
     Mother, cant you make it calomel
     instead of castor oil?

               MOTHER
     This is for your own good. When you
     look at negative, destructive
     things like those little filthy
     comic books, you are sick. Here,
     take this.

               BUDDY
          (he is resigned, there's
           no way out; he makes a
           face, swallows the castor
           oil)
     Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!

               MOTHER 
     Stop gagging like that and putting
     on a show, and swallow it. 

               BUDDY 
     Uhhh, gahdam stuff! 

               MOTHER 
     What did you say, Brother? 

               BUDDY 
     I said ahhh-dam stuff. 

               MOTHER
     No, you didn't say that, Brother.

               BUDDY 
     Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing
     aid isn't working right. I said
     ahhh-dam stuff.

               DOLL 
     No, Mother, he's lying...

               BUDDY
     Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts

               WASKI
          (happily excited,
           stammering)
     He did lie, and... and... and
     Mother, yesterday he stole money
     out of your pocketbook!

               BUDDY
     Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat,
     or Ill kill you!

               MOTHER
     Children, children! Be quiet, all
     of you! 
          (the children at once
           simmer down)
     The vibrations in this house are
     strange today. Where's Rose,
     anyhow?

               BUDDY
     She's getting herself up to go out.

               MOTHER 
          (frowns, adjusts hearing
           aid)
     What'd you say, Brother?

               BUDDY 
     She's getting herself up to go out.
     I think she's coming down the hall
     now.

               MOTHER
     Oh, yes, it's Thursday. 
          (glances around at sound
           of an opening door)
     Hello, Rose, dear... 
          (her eyes open wide as she
           stares at Rose,
           disconcerted; now weakly)
     ... my, you're... looking pretty...

CUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She is
quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink
rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in
some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most
remarkable thing of all.

The skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin
material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could
be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the
least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white
sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white
material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her
breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material.
It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear
of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing
suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black
patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent
leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is
on her face.

               ROSE 
     How do you like my outfit? I made
     most of it myself.

Rose walks in, "modeling" the outfit and the CAMERA PICKS UP
Mother.

               MOTHER 
          (smiling, slightly aghast)
     Well, it's... very gay.

We hear the SOUND of the Model A on the driveway.

               BUDDY 
     Here comes Daddy.

               ROSE 
          (staring down admiringly
           at the outfit)
     I have a knack for designing
     clothes. But I had to buy the shoes
     and the pocketbook.

               MOTHER 
          (makes up her mind to
           defend Rose)
     Well, I think it's charming, Rose. 
          (tactfully)
     But don't you think... ah, the
     skirt is a little tight?

               ROSE 
     Oh, no, that's the style. It's
     meant to be clinging.

We hear the PORCH DOOR SLAM. Smiling, happy, Rose glances
around. We hear the SOUND of the kitchen door opening.

CUT TO a POV SHOT of Daddy in the kitchen doorway. As usual,
he has a rolled-up Glenville Tribune in his hand and a Straw
hat on the back of his head.His hands are on his hips and he
is hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees.

               DADDY 
     Ye gods and little fishes. What
     have you done to yourself, Rose?

ON THEM ALL. Rose is smiling, happy to be the center of
attention.

               ROSE 
     Nothin'. I got myself up, that's
     all.

               DADDY 
     Got yourself up?

               ROSE 
     Yeah. I'm goin' out.

Daddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head. Sits at
table.

               DADDY 
     Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest
     outfit I ever saw in my life. You
     walk down the street like that and
     they'll put you in jail, Rose.

               MOTHER 
     Why, they won't either. She looks
     pretty. And I wish you wouldn't
     pick on the poor girl all the time.
     Don't listen to him, Rose, you look
     pretty, even beautiful.

               ROSE 
          (smiles affectionately at
           Mother)
     You're so sweet.

               DADDY 
     If you've got time before you go
     "out," get me a half-a-cup of
     coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a
     half-a-cup.

               ROSE 
     Why, sure, always got time to get
     you a half-a-cup, and one of these
     days I'm gonna get you a whole cup
     and see what happens.

               DADDY 
          (a growl, doesn't like
           jokes about his foibles)
     Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole
     cup, my nerves can't stand the
     caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful
     insomnia in reverse last night. Lay
     there and sweated blood for hours.

               DOLL 
          (sweetly)
     Daddy, Buddy was up late last night
     reading little dirty comic books.
     Mother gave him a dose of castor
     oil and he cursed it, he took the
     Lords name in vain, then claimed he
     hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.

               MOTHER 
     You mustn't be a tattletale, dear.
     You mustn't be Delilah-ish and
     Jezebel-ish toward your brother,
     dear.

               DOLL 
     I'm only trying to help him,
     Mother.

               BUDDY 
     Heh, what a hypocrite.

               MOTHER 
          (to Daddy)
     I do wish you'd speak to Brother.
     It's true he's been looking at
     those horrible little books again.

               DADDY 
          (stares sternly at Buddy)
     Lay off of that stuff, son. It
     upsets your mother.

               MOTHER 
          (genuinely worried)
     I'm serious. We forget he's just a
     child. I wish you'd speak to him.

               DADDY 
     I'll take him with me downtown. 
          (glances at Rose as she
           comes with coffee)
     And you, too, Rose, if you want a
     ride.

               ROSE 
     Sure, love one. Here's your half-a
     cup of coffee.

Daddy is staring with a very dubious frown at Rose's skirt.
He slowly shakes his head.

               DADDY 
     That's a pretty stylish skirt,
     Rose. The only thing I don't
     understand is how did you ever get
     it on.

               ROSE 
          (happy, pleased by his
           interest)
     Well, it has buttons.

Points to little buttons on right side of the skirt.

               DADDY 
     How can the buttons stand the
     pressure?

               ROSE 
     There are more on the other side.

Points to buttons on left side.

               DADDY 
     Turn around, darlin'.

Happy to oblige, Rose turns around. Her plump, round,
feminine behind is only too plainly revealed through the thin
material. Daddy slowly shakes his head.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     They'll put her in jail. The damn
     little fool might as well be naked.

               MOTHER 
          (a wee mite worried)
     Well, it is a little tight. But it
     isn't as bad as all that. No one
     will notice unless they have such
     thoughts in the first place.

               DADDY 
     Who doesn't have such thoughts? 
          (glances at wristwatch)
     We'd better get going.

               MOTHER 
     You're not having lunch?

               DADDY 
     Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never
     eat, darlin', you know that. Not
     eating and reverse insomnia are my
     curses. Let's go, Rose, you and
     Brother, let's hit the road.

               MOTHER 
     Rose, you and Brother wait in the
     car. I want to speak for a moment
     Lo Mr. Hillyer.

               ROSE 
     Yes, Ma'am.

               MOTHER 
     Doll, you and Waski run on, too.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy as they walk out onto the
patio of the house. Rose walks down the steps to the flower
garden and Buddy follows.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose and Buddy as Rose picks a red rose and
puts it in her hair.'

               ROSE 
     Did your Momma really give you
     castor oil?

               BUDDY 
     Yeah.

               ROSE 
          (puts an arm around his
           shoulders)
     You're my sweetheart.

INT. HILLYER HOME KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO Mother and Daddy at the kitchen table.

               MOTHER 
          (earnestly)
     I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose
     and tease her like that. Of course
     her clothes are silly, but she's
     ignorant, naive, she doesn't know
     any better.

               DADDY 
     The girl worries me. If she walks
     down the street like that, an army
     will be following her.

               MOTHER 
     Well, I admit that outfit isn't
     very modest. But she doesn't mean
     any harm, she just wants to
     attract, attention.

               DADDY 
     She will succeed.

               MOTHER 
     I don't think you understand her.
     It isn't sex she wants, it's love
     she wants and this is the only way
     she knows how to get it.

               DADDY
          (musingly)
     That farmer in Gadsden was awful
     eager to get rid of her, and I'm
     beginning to see why.

               MOTHER 
     He and his wife both said she had a
     fine moral character and was
     wonderful with children.

               DADDY 
     Well, she loves children, all
     right.
          (adds dryly)
     She loves everybody.

               MOTHER 
     But that's a wonderful quality, not
     a bad quality.
          (takes his hand)
     Have a little patience with her.
     She's such a good-hearted little
     thing and tries so hard.

               DADDY 
          (stares pensively at her)
     You are the one who's good-hearted.
          (rises)
     As for Rose, let's hope for the
     best.

               MOTHER
          (rises, again takes his
           hand)
     Be kind to her. She loves you so
     much.
          (Daddy stiffens slightly,
           and she adds)
     In a perfectly proper way, of
     course.

               DADDY
     Yes, of course.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy waiting in a Model A. Rose is
smiling, happy to be going out. The red rose is prominent in
her hair, Daddy walks INTO THE SHOT, gets into the driver's
seat of the car, He glances in a wry manner at the flower in
her hair.

               DADDY 
     What have you got in your hair,
     girl?

               ROSE
     My rose. It's kind of like a motto.
     People will say, there comes Rose
     with her rose.

Daddy gives her another wry stare and starts the Model A.

CUT TO a shot of the Model A going down the driveway.

EXT. MODEL A IN TOWN - DAY

ANOTHER SHOT or two of the Model A on the quiet summer
streets of a sleepy little town in the Depression South of
years ago.

INT./EXT. MODEL A - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. Buddy is
in the middle. Daddy is staring expressionlessly straight
ahead. His tone is sternly neutral as he speaks.

               DADDY
     You were up late last night,
     Brother.

               BUDDY
     Well, a little.

               DADDY
     Reading dirty comic bocks.
          (glances shrewdly at him)
     And you admitted it?

               BUDDY
          (a trifle uncomfortable)
     Well, yeah.

Both Rose and Buddy begin to look increasingly tense.
Hawkshaw the Detective is on the scent. Daddy stares ahead.

               DADDY 
     You were up late last night, too,
     Rose.

               ROSE 
          (meekly)
     Yes, sir. I had to go to the
     bathroom.

A long pause, as Daddy stares ahead. His expression is
inscrutable.

               DADDY 
          (finally, "casually")
     Sometimes I think I was born to be
     a detective. I get a feeling about
     things. I'm not always right, but
     often I am.

EXT. MODEL A BY LIGHT - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the Model A as it stops for a red light.

INT./EXT. MODEL A - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. Daddy
turns and stares sternly at Buddy.

               DADDY 
     Son, was Rose in your room last
     night?

               BUDDY 
          (scared, but a good liar)
     No. Why should Rose be in my room?

Daddy sternly scans them both. They stare back "innocently"
at him. Finally he seems to accept it.

               DADDY 
     I can't imagine why. It was just a
     thought.

Daddy shifts gears and faces front. Buddy glances upward in
relief, as if to say, "Wow, that was close."

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     Where do you want me to let you
     out, Rose?

               ROSE 
     Oh, anywhere downtown.

               DADDY 
     You don't know where you're going?

     Oh, I'll just mosey around here and
     there.

     It'll do just fine.

CUT TO a shot of Rose as she walks along, swinging her hips

CUT TO a shot of Rose as she walks up to a bus stop. A fairly
WELL-DRESSED MAN with a door-to-door salesman kit is standing
there. Rose glances at him then sidles up alongside him as if
she's waiting for a bus. He glances at her for a moment with
interest, but doesn't want to stare, looks away. We see the
Model A stop in the background of the SHOT.

EXT. STREET - DAY

CUT TO Daddy and Buddy. Daddy is staring pensively at the
scene.

               DADDY
     I never saw anything like it. How
     did she pick him up so fast?

               BUDDY
     I don't know.

               DADDY
     The girl strikes like a cobra.

Slowly shaking his head, Daddy starts the car.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A shot of Rose and the Young Salesman as they walk along. She
is holding his arm and they are smiling and talking as if the
best of friends. We hear MUSIC ON THE TRACK. The MUSIC
continues over the following MONTAGE OF SHOTS.

INT. HONKY TONK - VARIOUS SHOTS

ON Rose in a beer "honky tonk" with the Young Salesman in a

them, a big beefy man -- he is BUSTER.

EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

ON Rose as she walks down a sidewalk in late afternoon with
Buster and still another man, a tall fellow in a Coca-Cola
Delivery Man's uniform or shirt. Rose seems to be innocently
happy, but the men appear to be having a mild dispute.

her, smiling. The COCA-COLA DELIVERY MAN is left on the
sidewalk, disappointed.

               MOTHER (O.S.)
     What time is it?

               DADDY 
     Quarter of twelve.

               MOTHER (O.S.)
     Is she all right?

               DADDY 
     I don't see any bruises or broken
     bones.

CUT TO a shot of Mother in bed in the four poster.

               MOTHER 
     Bruises and broken bones, what kind
     of thing is that to say?

Daddy walks INTO THE SHOT, sits on the edge of the bed.

               MOTHER (CONT'D)
     Why shouldn't she go out and have
     boyfriends?

               DADDY 
     No reason at all, darlin'.

               MOTHER 
     Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing
     and picking on her.

               DADDY 
     Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All
     I'm saying is that a girl who would
     wear clothes like that is going to
     get in trouble sooner or later.

               MOTHER 
          (doubtfully)
     Well, time will tell, won't it?

               DADDY 
     Yes, darlin', time will tell.

afternoon. Mother looks up idly, looks back down at her
notebook, then looks up again with a frown.

CUT TO A POV SHOT of a SCRUFFY-LOOKING KAN as he darts behind

sinister, but he definitely is scruffy.

ON Mother. Frowning, she puts down her notebook and rises,
walks toward the door of the kitchen.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose washing dishes in the kitchen. As
usual, she is in a cheerful good humor. We see Buddy at the

THE SHOT, worried, frowning.

               MOTHER 
     Rose, that scruffy-looking man is
     out in the yard again.

               ROSE
          (her smile fades)
     Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he
     is, I really don't.

               MOTHER 
     I had better call Daddy.

INT. HOTEL - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy behind the desk of a slightly run-down
small hotel of the Depression era. He is handing a key to a

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Rose in the kitchen.

               ROSE
          (innocently)
     Well, he might be that man who
     followed me home from the store the
     other day. But I don't know who he
     is, Buddy, I really don't.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - YARD

EXT. HILLYER HOUSE - FRONT PORCH

CUT TO a shot of a worried-looking Mother on the front porch
of the house. Buddy and a meek-looking Rose are in the
background in the doorway. A weary, out-of-breath Daddy comes
INTO THE SHOT and walks up the steps, straw hat in hand.

               DADDY 
     I couldn't catch him. He ran like a
     deer.

Daddy fixes a stern glance on Rose. As he does so, Mother and
Buddy also turn and look at her. Rose smiles wanly.

               ROSE 
     I don't know him.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT PORCH

ON Mother as she opens the front door. A sullen Billy stares
at her.

               MOTHER 
     Yes?

               BILLY 
     Is Rose here?

               MOTHER 
     She must have gone out for a walk
     with the children.

               BILLY 
          (sullenly)
     Well, I got to see her.

               MOTHER 
     She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but
     Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to
     have callers during working hours.

               BILLY 
          (sullenly)
     Where is she?

               MOTHER 
     I said she isn't here. NOW you go
     home. Be a nice boy and go home.

Gently but firmly, Mother shuts the door in Billy's face.

A SHOT of Billy frustrated on the front porch. Sadly,
reluctantly, he turns and walks off the porch down the steps.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A SHOT of the family at dinner at night. Daddy, Mother, Rose,
Buddy, Doll and Waski. The SHOT FAVORS Mother.

               MOTHER 
     That sulky boy was here again this
     afternoon. I was almost scared, he
     wouldn't go away.

               DADDY 
          (throws his napkin on
           table)
     Rose, my patience is wearing thin.
     First a scruffy man who runs like a
     deer and now a sulky boy who wont
     go away. This is getting to be a
     regular monkey and dog show.

               ROSE 
     I swear to God I don't know who in
     the world he is. Really, I don't, I
     don't know no boy like that, I
     don't.

Slowly, his face grim, Daddy returns his napkin to his lap
and resumes eating. The children are very silent and look a
trifle scared.

               MOTHER 
          (finally, in a small
           voice)
     Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys
     and men like her. You cant blame
     her for that, hon.

               DADDY 
     Rose, I realize you don't know this
     boy, but if you know anybody who
     does know him, if you have even a
     faint clue as to who he might be,
     then convey to him that he had
     better stay away from my house and
     stop scaring my wife... and I don't
     mean maybe.

INT. HILLYER SOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy in his room at night. He is dressed
and at a study table listening with cheap earphones to a
homemade crystal radio set. Enter a rather somber-faced Doll
in her nightgown.

               BUDDY 
          (listening)
     Chattanooga. I had St. Louis,
     Missouri.

               DOLL 
     Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.

               BUDDY 
     So am I.

               DOLL 
     She hasn't got any sense. In some
     ways, she's awful dumb.

               BUDDY 
          (takes off earphones,
           gives it a moment of
           grave consideration, then
           his opinion)
     It isn't that she hasn't got any
     sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence
     is probably above average, maybe
     quite a bit above average.

               DOLL 
     Then why does she act so dumb?

               BUDDY 
     Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll.
     And neither does smartness. You see
     --

Buddy is interrupted by the SOUND of the distant angry shout
of a man's voice, evidently from somewhere outside in the
woods because Buddy and Doll turn at once toward the window.
In shock they listen.

               FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
     You son of a bitch, what are you
     doing here?!

               SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
     I'd like to ask you the same
     question, you bastard!

               FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
     I told you to stay away from her,
     goddamn you!

               SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
     You got no right to tell me to stay
     away from her, I knew her before
     you did!

               BUDDY 
     Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh boy. Daddy
     isn't going to like this.

               FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
     She told you to leave her alone,
     didn't she?

               SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
     Like hell she did! You're the one
     she wants to get shed of!

               BUDDY 
     Come on!

He and Doll hurry from the room.

hall and down the stairs. The CAM M FOLLOWS them down the
stairs.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BACK HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they slow down and creep
cautiously down the back hall to the back porch. We hear the
men yelling somewhere out in the dark bushes.

               FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
     You'll swallow teeth yourself if
     you don't leave her alone, you ugly
     bastard! Go on, throw one, throw
     one!

               SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
     I'll throw one, you son of a bitch!

We hear a great CRASHING in the bushes, a SMACK of a fist, a
GROAN of shock, an OATH, a SHOUT, more CRASHING.

EXT. BACK PORCH - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot from the POV of the children, on Daddy on the
back porch as the lights blaze on. He wears his bathrobe and
has a big shotgun in his hands. Now he speaks in a loud,
clear and very angry voice.

               DADDY 
     All right, I have got a Parker
     shotgun here and it is loaded and
     the trigger is cocked and wherever
     you birds are and whatever you are
     doing you had better get the hell
     out of here goddamned quick!

A sudden total silence ensues, then a sudden CRASHING in the
bushes as the "birds" take off.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     And do not come back, you sons of
     bitches! Stay away from my house
     and home and my wife and children
     or I'll blow your goddamned heads
     off!

INT. HILLYER HOME - BACK HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they cower in awe in the
downstairs hall. Daddy walks up to them carrying the shotgun.
He is grim and furious, but his voice is surprisingly calm.

               DADDY 
     You children go to bed. And
     Brother, stay away from Rose, I'll
     speak to her in the morning.

INT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll in the upstairs hall. Doll
meekly goes to her room.
Buddy hesitates, looks at Rose's door, glances nervously back
at the stairs, then goes to Rose's door, knocks softly, opens
it.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Rose as he stands in the doorway
of her room. Rose is sitting on the edge of her bed in her
nightgown, a damp cloth held against her jaw which seems a
little swollen. A look of fear and guilt is on her face.

               ROSE 
          (rather feebly, as if it
           explains something)
     I got an awful toothache.

               BUDDY 
          (quietly)
     Rose, if you don't keep your
     boyfriends away from the house,
     Daddy is going to fire you.

               ROSE 
          (innocently)
     But I don't know who they are.

Buddy makes an exasperated grimace and exits, shutting door.
The CAMERA REMAINS on Rose as she rolls her eyes upward in
dismay.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

A shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. The
silence is deafening. Everyone looks depressed except Daddy,
who is aloofly calm. Rose's head is bowed meekly over her
plate as we hear the CLATTER of silverware. Finally, Daddy
speaks in an almost pleasant tone.

               DADDY 
     Well, Rose, my sleep was a little
     disturbed last night, and so was
     Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the
     children's. How about you? Was your
     sleep disturbed, too?

               ROSE 
          (solemnly)
     Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I
     heard strange voices in the night.

               DADDY 
          (softly strumming fingers,
           finally)
     Strange voices, Rose?

               ROSE 
          (innocent as an angel)
     Yes, sir.

               DADDY 
          (still aloofly polite)
     Now Rose, stop behaving as if
     you're Bo Peep. Those men had a
     flight last night because of some
     female in this house, and it wasn't
     Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.

               MOTHER 
          (very tense)
     I don't think we ought to discuss
     this in front of the children.

               ROSE
          (weeping, a hand over her
           eyes)
     Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe...
     one of 'em... was Foster... but I
     don't hardly know him!

               DADDY
     Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth
     and quit crying!

               MOTHER
          (draws herself up)
     I will not sit here and listen to
     you be brutal to this poor girl.

               DADDY
     I am not being brutal to her!

               MOTHER
     You certainly are! She has an awful
     toothache, look at her jaw, it's
     all swollen.

               DADDY
          (trying to restrain
           himself, aloofly polite
           to the utmost)
     Darlin', it is not my fault if the
     girl has epizootics --

-- The word means "an animal epidemic," and it's a pet word
of Daddy's; he pronounces it epi-zoo-tics, not epi-zoo-ot
tics, and uses it to mean any outrageous human malady --

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     -- I am not responsible for her
     epizootics and I did not bring
     about her epizootics. Now listen to
     me. When I have to get up in the
     middle of the night and defend my
     home with a shotgun against a
     couple of damned scoundrels
     fistfighting in the bushes --

               MOTHER
     Scoundrels? They weren't
     scoundrels, they were just boys.

               DADDY 
     Boys? You say to me boys?

               MOTHER
     Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they
     were boys! Boy friends of Rose,
     chat's what they were, and why
     shouldn't she have boy friends? Do
     you want her to be unnatural? Don't
     you think she's human the same way
     you are yourself? It's the South,
     that's what it is, the South with
     its horrible traditions, of slavery
     and crime and the oppression of
     women, who are just as good as men
     and just as human!

               DADDY 
          (his eyes are a trifle
           glazed)
     Now darlin', what has the South got
     to do with this?

               MOTHER 
          (in a real snit, afraid he
           will fire Rose)
     And when I try to talk to you
     seriously, when I try to explain to
     you the unlimited creative power of
     life, how beautiful it would be if
     we gave up this hopeless struggle
     and simply loved each other from
     our hearts, what do you do -- you
     mock me!

               DADDY 
          (mildly, his eyes are even
           more glazed)
     I don't intend to mock you, dear. I
     respect your philosophy. It's
     beyond my comprehension, but I
     respect it.

               ROSE
          (head bowed, weeping in a
           little handkerchief)
     Ohhh-hh, ohhh...

               DADDY 
          (exasperated)
     Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your
     cornflakes!

               ROSE 
          (piteously)
     I'm not hungry.

The word is hongry, not hungry.

               DADDY 
     Now you listen to me, Rose --

               MOTHER 
          (with fire in her eyes)
     Just a moment! You are not going to
     fire this girl for an innocent
     thing like having boy friends, not
     while there is breath in my body!

               DADDY 
     I don't intend to fire her,
     darlin'.

               MOTHER 
     It isn't her fault if she's
     popular... what?

               DADDY 
     I said I don't intend to fire her.
     I just want to ask her to keep her
     boy friends away from my home and
     hearth, that's all.

               MOTHER 
          (simmers down at once, now
           calmly)
     Well, that's very reasonable. Howe
     I hate to bring it up, but she's
     got an awful toothache, we've got
     to carry her to the dentist.

               ROSE 
     I don't want to go to the dentist.

               MOTHER 
     Be quiet, Rose.

               DADDY 
     Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the
     hotel. You and Brother can handle
     the girl's epizootics. I'll just
     say one more thing. 
          (turns to Rose and, in a
           grave tone)
     Rose, I told you you had a friend
     in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she
     would fight for you like a tiger?

               ROSE 
          (meekly)
     Yes, sir.

               DADDY 
     All right, thanks to her, and
     thanks to this case of epizootics,
     you are getting another chance. 
          (points a finger at her,
           and sternly)
     But don't try my patience again. We
     have growing children in this
     house. Do you understand me?

               ROSE 
     Yes, sir.

INT. DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Mother, Rose and Buddy in a dentist's
waiting room. Rose is holding a rubber ice bag to her jaw,
which is quite swollen. She is groaning and half weeping in
pain.

               MOTHER
     Poor thing. Does the ice help,
     Rose?

               ROSE
     Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't
     never been to no dentist before.
     He's gonna kill me, I just know it.

               MOTHER
     No, Rose, he'll help you.

ANOTHER ANGLE, Rose shrinks in fear as, enter the dentist in
a white coat, DR. WINTON, a kindly-looking, gray-haired man.
We see a nurse behind him. He smiles in a reassuring manner.

               DR. WINTON 
     Nurse says we have a nervous
     patient. Now, young lady, be calm.
     First of all, let me tell you, I am
     not going to hurt you.

               ROSE 
     Yes, you are.

               DR. WINTON 
     No, I am not.

               ROSE 
     Look, you can't kid me.

               MOTHER 
          (rises, takes her by the
           hand)
     Now, come on, Rose. Stop being so
     childish, come on.

INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Mother and Dr. Winton, as they
guide and lead Rose into the dentist's operating room.- She
plants her feet and her eyes open wide with horror as she
sees the chair and other equipment.

               ROSE 
     I'm not goin' in there, I don't
     like the looks of it!

               MOTHER 
          (annoyed)
     Rose, sit down in that chair and be
     quiet! We're trying to help you,
     you silly creature, sit in that
     chair!

               ROSE 
          (very reluctantly sits in
           chair)
     Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna
     kill me.

               DR. WINTON 
     You and the boy wait outside.

INT. DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Mother and Buddy in the waiting room. Enter
Dr. Winton with a little frown.

               DR. WINTON 
     Well, she finally let me look in
     her mouth. Is it true she's never
     been to a dentist?

               MOTHER 
     She was raised on a poor dirt farm.
     I'm sure she's never seen a dentist
     or hardly even a doctor.

               DR. WINTON 
     Well, she has one mouth in ten
     thousand, I don't see teeth like
     that once in ten years. Her trouble
     is an impacted wisdom tooth, but
     there isn't a cavity in her head,
     not a single one. She has perfect
     teeth.

               MOTHER 
     But the wisdom tooth will have to
     be pulled?

               DR. WINTON 
     Yes, and it's very bad. It probably
     should be done at the hospital
     under general anesthesia.

               MOTHER 
     That would scare her to death.
     She's terrified of hospitals. To
     her, a hospital is where you go to
     die.

               DR. WINTON 
     I think you're right, it would be
     harder on her. But you'd better
     call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to
     need help to get home.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

A shot of Daddy behind the wheel of the model-A. Rose lies
pale and exhausted on Mother's shoulder on the front seat. A
trace of bloody gauze can be seen in her mouth and her eyes
are closed. Buddy is on the back seat.

               ROSE
          (a whisper, muffled by the
           bloody gauze)
     Never again, never again...

               MOTHER
          (with pity, gently)
     I know it was bad, honey. I'm
     sorry...

               ROSE 
     No more dentists, no more
     dentists...

               MOTHER 
     It'll get better now.

EXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the Model-A in the driveway of the Hillyer
home. Mother helps Rose out of the car, but Rose can't stand
on her feet. Daddy has to catch her from falling. Daddy picks
her up in his arms and carries her up the steps as Buddy runs
ahead to open the front door.

EXT. HILLYER PATIO - DAY

A shot of Mother and Daddy and Buddy on the patio. It is a
beautiful sunny morning. Mother and Daddy are seated at an
outdoor table about to have coffee. Daddy is opening mail and
Buddy, in the b.g., is gluing up a kite. Enter a smiling and
healthy Rose with orange juice, toast, cups and coffee on a
tray.

               DADDY 
     Good morning, Rose. And how do you
     feel today?

               ROSE 
     Wonderful. Except I can touch the
     place back there with my tongue, I
     wouldn't even know I had that tooth
     pulled.

               DADDY 
          (dryly, as he looks at
           mail)
     Well, I know it, I just got the
     bill for it.

               ROSE 
     Boy, for four or five days there I
     didn't think I'd live. But I'm my
     old self again!

               DADDY 
     Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange
     voices in the night, Rose.

               ROSE 
     Oh, no, sir.

               MOTHER 
     Rose has learned her lesson,
     haven't you, Rose?

               ROSE 
     Yes, ma'am.

INT. HOTEL - MEZZANINE - DAY

A shot of Daddy peering down at an old pool table in the
mezzanine of the family hotel. Buddy stands by with a pool
stick in hand. In the b.g., we see a black bellboy, SHADRACH,
approaching.

               DADDY 
     I see my mother-in-law's face, son.
     Read 'em and weep, boy, I am
     playing a spectacular combination,
     a triple. The nine ball in the
     corner! 
          (takes his stance with cue
           as Shadrach walks up)
     Read 'em and weep, boy, that's all
     she wrote.

               SHADRACH 
     Mistah Hillyer, the Chief of Police
     wants you on the telephone.

               DADDY 
          (about to make his shot,
           looks around)
     The Chief of Police?

               SHADRACH 
     Yassuh.

Daddy straightens up, sets his jaw, leans the cue against the
table and marches toward the elevator as Buddy stares after
him. The CAMERA STAYS on Buddy.

INT. HOTEL - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy going down the hotel stairs. He holds
onto the banister, sliding with his hands far ahead in order
to take four and even five steps at a time -- it is a
childish trick, the point of the game is to touch as few
stairs as possible.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Buddy as he jumps down the last remaining
five steps and walks into the lobby. Daddy comes from behind
the desk, grim.

               DADDY 
     Rose is in jail. She bit a
     policeman's thumb. Come on, son,
     Shadrach can run the hotel.

EXT. MODEL-A - STREET - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in the Model-A. Daddy stares
grimly ahead. Buddy steals a worried glance at him.

INT. LOCAL JAIL - DAY

CUT TO a shot in the local jail. The shot is on Daddy as he
stands before jail bars staring sternly into a cell. His
hands are on his hips, his straw hat is on the back of his
head and a bit to one side. Buddy stands beside him, a little
bit behind, a worried look on his face. The CHIEF OF POLICE,
a fat man, is on the other side of Daddy.

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose in the cell. Her hair is mussed,
her dress is torn. A little innocent, frightened smile is on
her face. The CAMERA PANS to include Daddy and the Chief of
Police.

               CHIEF OF POLICE 
     That was a awful brawl down at the
     Busy Beaver, Mr. Hillyer. You know
     that fat Horton, the bootlegger?

               DADDY 
     Yes, I know the son of a bitch.

               CHIEF OF POLICE 
     Son of a bitch is right, he dern
     near killed a man. And this girl
     was the cause of it all. What's
     more, she bit a police officer's
     thumb right to the bone.

               DADDY 
     Well, Rose, what have you got to
     say for yourself?

               ROSE 
          (coughs, then feebly)
     I got an awful bad cold.

               DADDY 
          (nods slowly, then with
           aloof politeness)
     That's all you've got to say,
     you've got a bad cold?

               ROSE 
          (coughs again)
     Well, I don't know what happened.
     They were arguin' about baseball,
     then all of 'em started fightin'.
     As for that policeman, I didn't
     bite him, I don't think I bit him.

In dour silence, Daddy and the Chief of Police stare at Rose.
She gives them a little smile, as if to say, "See how
innocent I am?" The Chief turns to Daddy and asks with dry
irony:

               CHIEF OF POLICE 
     Well, she's your girl, Mr. Hillyer.
     You want me to release her in your
     custody?

               DADDY 
     No, not really. But I guess we'll
     have to do that, John. Let her out.
     Let the crazy creature out and I'll
     take her home.

INT./EXT. MODEL-A - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the Model A. Daddy
stares grimly ahead, silent. Buddy looks solemn. Rose is
badly frightened and still coughing. Finally she ventures a
little smile and speaks to Daddy.

               ROSE 
     I got an awful cold, I think I'm
     sick.

Daddy is silent, his eyes fixed ahead.

EXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the Model A as it turns onto the Hillyer
driveway.

INT./EXT. MODEL A

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. She tries
again.

               ROSE 
     I didn't mean to bite him. He was
     hitting Horton with a blackjack in
     the meanest way and... and I bit
     him accidental.

               DADDY 
          (stops the car, turns to
           Rose)
     I have to go back to the hotel. I'm
     on duty at the desk and who knows a
     quest might arrive. I will see you
     at suppertime, Rose.

               ROSE 
          (a feeble smile)
     I didn't mean to bite him, I really
     didn't.

               DADDY 
     I will see you at suppertime, Rose.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A SHOT of Buddy and Doll in the living room of the Hillyer
home at night. Doll is half-heartedly practicing scales on
the piano and Buddy is pacing the floor, hands clasped behind
him in something like the style of his father. As the CAMERA
FOLLOWS Buddy in his pacing we see Waski playing with marbles
on the floor.

               DOLL 
          (turns around on piano
           stool, to Buddy)
     What is Rose going to do? Where can
     she go?

               BUDDY 
     They've been in there the longest
     kind of time. I can't stand it, I
     gotta find out what's going on.

               DOLL 
     You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill
     you!

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy coming with great furtiveness from the
living room out into the front hall. Very cautiously, he
tiptoes across the hall and bows down and listens at the door
of his mother's bedroom-study. He crouches down, peeps
through the keyhole.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM/STUDY - NIGHT

CUT TO a "keyhole shot" of Daddy and Mother in the bedroom.
Mother sits in her study chair, a handkerchief to her eyes.
Daddy sits in a chair nearby. He looks depressed.

               DADDY 
     I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as
     much as you do.

               MOTHER
          (wanly)
     Well, she does seem to cause a lot
     of trouble, I admit. But she
     doesn't mean any harm and it'll
     break the children's hearts, they
     all love her.

               DADDY 
     It's because of the children she's
     got to go. I don't want to be
     holier-than-thou, but the girl
     doesn't have the same outlook we
     do. Morals don't mean a thing to
     her, not a thing, and we can't have
     a girl like that in this house.

               MOTHER 
     Who is to say our morals are better
     than hers?
          (frowns, sighs)
     But maybe you're right. She
     could... influence Dolly...

               DADDY 
     That is exactly what I'm afraid of. 
          (pauses, and firmly)
     The girl has got to go, darlin'.

               MOTHER 
     But morals come from the heart, not
     from rigid rules and empty laws.
     And in her heart Rose has never
     hurt anyone and she never would.
     Therefore, she's not immoral. Not
     really.

               DADDY 
     Now look, darlin', this is no time
     to go off into the fourth
     dimension.

               MOTHER 
     But what I said is the simple
     truth. And now I see something
     else, I see more deeply into it...

Mother has a slightly "other-worldly" look on her face. Daddy
glances at the door of the bedroom, he suspects something.

               DADDY 
     Just a moment, darlin'.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy crouched at the keyhole. With great
alacrity, he jumps up and hurries across the hall and shuts
the living room door just as Daddy whisks open the bedroom
door. Daddy grimaces.

               DADDY 
     Could of sworn that boy was out
     here.

Daddy shuts the door and at once almost like the movement of
a ballet Buddy opens the living room door and tiptoes back to
the keyhole.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a Shot of Daddy and Mother. It is another "keyhole
shot."

               MOTHER 
     How could Rose really be a bad
     influence on Dolly? She has a
     loving nature, you ought to want
     someone like that around your
     children. Why do you think those
     boys and men like her?

               DADDY
     Well, I have a pretty good idea.

               MOTHER 
     If you mean sex, you couldn't be
     more wrong. Rose likes those boys
     and men, she has love in her heart,
     and that is what they want. It's
     the most rare and beautiful thing
     in life and that is why they follow
     her.

               DADDY 
     They follow her because she's a -- 
          (he is about to say "piece
           of tail," but interrupts
           himself)
     -- no, I won't say that.

               MOTHER 
     What she doesn't understand is that
     her behavior is disturbing to other
     people. She's young, she's got to
     learn to restrain the life force
     that's in her. Its creative, but in
     her case it's too creative.

               DADDY 
     Darlin', Rose has got to go!

               MOTHER 
          (rises)
     I'll talk to her, I'll reason with
     her.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

               DOLL
     What's happening?

               BUDDY 
     Mother is struggling desperately.
     In fact she's fighting like a
     tiger. But I don't know, it's
     close, it's mighty close.

               DOLL 
          (pauses, then in a low
           tone, slightly wide-eyed)
     Buddy... does Rose really... "do
     it" with all those boys and men?

               BUDDY 
          (aloofly, like Daddy)
     Doll, don't ask childish questions.

               WASKI

     Of course not!

knocks on Roses door and enters.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

shock at Rose on the bad. Rose is lying back on a pillow and
staring groggily at her, obviously not quite all there.
Frowning with worry, Mother sits beside her and puts a hand
on her forehead.

               MOTHER 
     Rose, you're very sick. You're

They are badly frightened, even terrified.
The CAMERA PANS to show the ambulance attendants carrying
Rose strapped in a stretcher down the stairs, as Mother helps

conscious now and her eyes roll with terror toward the
children.

Rose lies in a hospital bed. The nurse, mother, Daddy, Buddy,
Doll and Waski enter, all of them looking very grave.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE ON Rose as she weakly turns her head on
the pillow. Her eyes well with tears as she recognizes the
children.

               ROSE
          (a feeble whisper)
     Pray for me...

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the nurse as she speaks in a whisper we
don't hear to Mother and Daddy, obviously telling them they'd
better go. Daddy beckons to the children and they start to
leave, all looking depressed.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of DR. F. ROBERT MARTINSON, a rather unpleasant
man with a spade beard. He has a superior, patronizing way of
talking and very little Southern accent if any. The scene is
his office and he is in a swivel chair behind his desk.

As he speaks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Daddy, Mother and
the Hillyer children.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is
     strong as an ox and that is what is
     keeping her alive. But not many
     people walk away from double
     pneumonia, Madam, not many.

               MOTHER 
     She looks terrible, just awful.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     Of course she does and I must say
     I'm puzzled by your delay in
     getting her to the hospital. I
     should think ordinary powers of
     observation would have suggested to
     you that she was seriously ill.

               MOTHER 
     She hid it from us, Doctor. She's
     afraid of the hospital.

               DR. MARTINSON 
          (a thin superior smile)
     Afraid of the hospital?

               MOTHER 
     Deathly afraid of it. Her people
     were poor tenant farmers and she
     doesn't know anything about doctors
     or medicine or hospitals.

               DR. MARTINSON 
          (frowns in open disbelief)
     A tenant farm? Are you trying to
     tell me that girl is a product of
     the hookworm and pellagra belt?

               MOTHER 
     Well, her people were very poor.
     She says she was often hungry as a
     child, and I'm sure the food she
     ate was pretty awful, not a
     balanced diet at all.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     Exactly, and that's why she
     couldn't possibly have come from
     such a farm.

               DADDY 
          (icily polite)
     Excuse me, sir, are you calling my
     wife a liar?

               MOTHER 
          (embarrassed)
     Honey, please...

               DR. MARTINSON 
          (a thin unpleasant smile)
     It's simply that I find it
     incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from
     the girl's illness at the moment,
     she is very strong, a very healthy
     specimen of a young human female --
     and a comely one, too. She must
     have gotten protein somewhere as a
     young child, if only sporadically.

               MOTHER 
     It is kind of amazing. The dentist
     says she has perfect teeth, there
     isn't a cavity in her mouth.

               MR. MARTINSON 
          (tries to make a
           supercilious joke)
     Her entire mouth is a cavity,
     Madam, ha ha ha.

               DADDY 
          (dryly, doesn't like the
           man a bit)
     Ha ha ha ha.

Mother frowns at Daddy and Dr. Martinson gives him an aloof
glance.

               DR. MARTINSON 
          (with spurious dignity)
     The point is you don't grow up like
     that on a diet of sorghum and
     hominy grits. She got protein
     somewhere, she's a very strong girl
     and I think she'll live... despite
     the delay in medical treatment.

               DADDY 
     That's all I want to know. 
          (rises)
     Lets get out of here before I get
     the epizootics myself. Thank you,
     Doctor, for your discourse, it was
     fascinating, no doubt.

               MOTHER 
     Yes, thank you, Doctor.

               DR. MARTINSON 
          (as they leave)
     I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do
     you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an
     animal epidemic?

               DADDY 
          (icily polite, from the
           door)
     No, I mean epizootics.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother, Daddy, Buddy, Doll and Waski as
Daddy comes out of the Doctor's office and shuts the door.

               DADDY 
     I can't stand that polecat. They
     ought to hang him.

               MOTHER 
     You don't like him because he's a
     Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.

               DADDY 
     He's a polecat, dear.

INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Mother and the Hillyer children in a
hospital elevator as a black elevator operator runs them
down. Daddy has his hat politely removed and is staring
pensively ahead.

               DADDY
     Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in
     that bed. 
          (sighs, shakes his head)
     I hope she'll be all right, but I
     still think we ought to fire her.

               MOTHER 
     I don't see how you can even think
     of it now.

Daddy purses his lips but says nothing. It is obvious the
"epizootics" have saved Rose, at least for the time being.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A SHOT of Rose in bed in her own bedroom. She is propped up
on pillows and wearing a rather attractive pink silk
housecoat of Mother's.
A tray is on her lap and she is eating her supper as Buddy
sits on the edge of the bed talking with her, or rather
listening to her. It is obvious she is well on the road back
to health.

               ROSE 
     Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside,
     and so unhappy with that rich wife
     who doesn't understand him, her
     being a Southerner and everything,
     and what a bedside manner he has
     got -- so gentle and kind beneath
     the professor way he acts!

               BUDDY 
     Rose, you are too uncritical of
     people.

               ROSE 
     You don't know the bedside manner
     that man has got. Why, it does me
     good just to see him sit there all
     solemn and go pokin' in his bag
     like he's gonna cure me, which he
     did of course. And even more
     important he loves me, like a
     patient I mean, the other day he
     got tears in his eyes just
     listenin' to my heart beat.

               BUDDY 
     He did?

               ROSE 
     Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw
     'em, and a little bit he says to
     me, "You know, you are beautiful."
     Now wasn't that a nice thing for a
     doctor to say to a patient, wasn't
     it? What could cheer a girl up
     more?

               BUDDY 
     Rose, I have got doubts about that
     doctor and so does Daddy.

               ROSE 
     He's got doubts about hisself and
     that's the saddest thing of all.
     Would you believe that poor man
     thinks nobody likes him?

               BUDDY 
     Yeah, I'd believe it.

               ROSE 
     Well, I like him. I used to be
     afraid of doctors but not any more.
     Why, he could operate on me any old
     time and I wouldn't even be scared.

               BUDDY 
     Rose, you are just entirely too
     uncritical of people.

               ROSE 
     I ain't neither. Listen here,
     Buddy, besides all his vast medical
     knowledge, he has the most kindest
     heart beneath the professor way he
     acts -- he wants justice in the
     world and he's got some real
     interestin' ideas.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother opening the front door. Dr. Martinson
is there-with his black bag, an icy polite look on his face.;

               MOTHER 
     Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a
     lot better, I just gave her her
     supper. She's almost all well now.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     Let me be the judge of that, Madam.

               MOTHER 
     Yes. Well. She's upstairs.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY/NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Rose in Rose's bedroom.

               ROSE 
     Justice, that's what he wants,
     justice for everybody and
     especially for niggers. And I think
     that's real nice of him because
     black people don't have a very good
     life, you got to admit that, to be
     a nigger is sometimes practic'ly
     fatal, but the wife don't
     understand all of that, she thinks
     niggers are just so much dirt,
     which anybody ought to know better
     if they been on their ass their
     ownselves -- and that is the cause
     of his profound unhappiness, Buddy,
     that no-good-mean wife with all her
     Southern prejudice against niggers
     and everything!

It is a very long speech and delivered with a non-stop
vitality that leaves Buddy a trifle groggy. Slowly, he shakes
his head, as enter Mother.

               MOTHER 
     The Doctor is here. And Brother,
     supper is ready.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A SHOT of the Hillyer family minus Rose eating dinner in the
dining room. The meal is almost finished, Daddy cutting apple
pie.

               DADDY 
     Is that Doctor still up there,
     Brother.

               BUDDY 
     Yeah, he's still up there.

               DADDY 
     What's taking the rascal so long?

               MOTHER 
     Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a
     rascal, he's one of the finest
     physicians in Glenville. He studied
     at Johns Hopkins University.

               DADDY 
     I don't care where the polecat
     studied.

               MOTHER 
     Sometimes the negativism and
     cynicism in you makes me want to
     vomit. 
          (shakes her head sadly as
           Buddy surreptitiously
           puts his napkin on table)
     Your real trouble is that you're
     anti-intellectual. The irony is
     women are supposed to be emotional,
     but I never saw anybody who
     depended more on emotion and
     prejudice than you do.

               BUDDY 
          (a half audible murmur)
     Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.

               MOTHER 
     Now I have a plan about Rose, an
     educational plan. She's getting
     better and we don't want any more
     trouble --
          (notices Buddy slipping
           out)
     Brother, you ought to hear this.

               BUDDY 
     I'll be right back.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he slips out during following
speech.

               MOTHER 
     First, those clothes she wears.
     They're too provocative. I've
     talked to her a lot about it and I
     think she understands...

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy as he goes down the hall, eyes
narrowed.

ON Buddy posted in the doorway of the living room. He has his
hands on his hips Daddy-style and is staring sternly up the
stairs.

CUT TO A POV SHOT of Dr. Martinson with his black bag in hand
and shoulders hunched coming down the stairs. The man is
slinking, has quilt written all over him. As he goes down the
stairs he glances to one side, sees Buddy and frowns. The man
gives a sudden nervous start of fright as we hear Daddy's
voice loud on the TRACK.

               DADDY (O.S.)
     Everything all right, Doctor?

CUT TO A POV shot of Daddy at the rear of the downstairs
hall, napkin in hand and hands on hips. He is staring sternly
at the doctor.

CUT BACK TO the Doctor. He glances nervously again toward
Buddy.

ANOTHER POV SHOT of Buddy. Looks just like Daddy, hands on
hips.

ON Dr. Martinson, as he looks back at Daddy.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     Oh, yes. Yes. Just fine. A few more
     days... a little more rest...
     she'll be perfectly healthy.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy as he walks forward down the hall
toward Buddy. The CAMERA PICKS UP Buddy and both of them
grimly stare after the fleeing doctor.

               DADDY 
          (in a low, conspiratorial
           tone)
     What do you think, Brother?

               BUDDY 
     I don't know. But you better watch
     him like a hawk, if he comes back
     again.

               DADDY 
     He's not coming back again. We
     scared the rascal off, son.
          (puts a hand on Buddy's
           shoulder)
     Come on back to supper. Your mother
     has a theory about how to educate
     Rose.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A SHOT of Mother and Rose and the children in the kitchen. We
see a sewing machine and evidences of dressmaking. Rose has
on a new and modest little dress that Mother evidently has
made for her.

               MOTHER 
     You see, Rose? Now that's the kind
     of dress you ought to wear.

               ROSE
          (less than enthusiastic)
     Yeah, it's kinda nice.

               MOTHER 
     You look very pretty in it, Rose.
     Really, you do.

               ROSE 
          (smiles at Mother)
     Well, you're real sweet to make it
     for me.
          (puts an arm around
           Mother's shoulder)
     There never was nobody like you.
     And you don't need to worry, I
     ain't goin' out no more.

               MOTHER 
     Well, there's no reason you
     shouldn't go out, Rose... in
     moderation.

               ROSE 
          (a little shrug)
     I don't want to. When I was lyin'
     there in that hospital bed at
     death's door I says to myself, I
     ain't goin' out no more. If I ever
     get outta this, I'll just stay
     home.

Rose casually pulls the dress over her head and stands there
in panties and bra, oblivious of Buddy and the children. She
has about as much modesty as a small child herself.

               ROSE (CONT'D)
          (rather sadly)
     Besides, there ain't no Mr. Right
     out there. Or if there is I can't

see them shaking hands with the Minister. Rose smiles
sweetly, modestly.

EXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the Model A driving up in the driveway of

takes Doll's hand with one hand and Waski's hand with the
other.

               ROSE 
     All right, we'll play monopoly

Mother, Daddy and Buddy watch Rose go up the steps with Doll
and Waski.

               MOTHER 
     She's like a different person.
     Being so sick made a big impression

     Um-hmm.

It is Hawkshaw the Detective and his Unwilling Assistant.
Daddy solemnly points to dim marks in the flower bed.

               DADDY 
     See that, son? Now this is a heel,
     see, and there, that's the ball of
     a foot. Someone has been walking
     here.

               BUDDY 
          (reluctantly)
     Well, it's not very plain.

               DADDY 
     That is because it rained recently,
     the rain has obscured the evidence.
     But you could still take plaster
     casts of these footprints, then
     match up the plaster casts with
     whosever shoes they are, and that
     way you could catch him --
     understand?

               BUDDY 
     But how would you find him?

               DADDY 
     Well. Well, what I mean is, you
     could prove it was his shoes if you
     did catch him. But look this,
     Brother, it is even more
     interesting. Look at this mark
     here, and that mark over there. Now
     wouldn't you say those marks are
     the marks of a ladder?

               BUDDY 
     Well, I don't know. 
          (trying to sound like a
           fellow detective, but
           doesn't want Rose to get
           caught)
     No, I don't know, Daddy, I think
     the rain has obscured it.

               DADDY 
     True, but if you look sharply you
     can see that those marks are the
     marks of a ladder. Now let's go
     back to the garage and see if the
     ladder has been tampered with.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy back in the garage. They are
scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the
garage. All Daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead
ringer for Sherlock Holmes. He is in dead earnest about this,
it is no Joke and he does not dream of being funny.

               DADDY 
          (points to ladder, eyes
           narrowed)
     See, son? The paint is flaked off
     here, freshly. Look at it, Brother,
     there is no question about it. Some
     person or persons unknown have very
     recently tampered with this ladder.

               BUDDY 
     Well... maybe...

               DADDY 
     And there's only one reason anybody
     would want this ladder -- to get up
     into Rose's bedroom in the dark of
     night! I am going to chain up this
     ladder and padlock it! -- and that
     is not all I am going to do!

     Yes, sir.

               MOTHER 
          (a bit overwhelmed by
           Daddy)
     She hasn't actually done
     anything...

               DADDY 
          (very firmly)
     Just a moment, dear. 
          (turns to Rose and almost
           sadly)
     We can't have it, Rose. Can you
     behave yourself -- or not? That is
     the question, to behave or not to
     behave, to suffer the slings and
     arrows of outrageous chastity and
     keep your skirt down or to hoist it
     in the light of the moon and make
     whoopee -- that is the coil
     shuffling question. 
          (a dramatic pause, then
           points at her)
     If you can't behave I am going to
     fire you and I say it in front of
     you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it.
     I point my rigid finger right at
     your nose, Rose, and I stare
     unwaveringly into your big blue
     eyes and I tell you... this is a
     final warning. Do you hear me?

               ROSE 
          (very meekly)
     Yes, sir.

INT. HILLYER HOME - CELLAR - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy, Doll and Waski as they climb from the
crawl space down into the cellar by the furnace.

               DOLL 
     Well, if she's got any sense at
     all, she'll listen to that.

               BUDDY 
     Sense doesn't mean anything to
     Rose. But I think we're on safe
     ground now. Daddy chained up the
     ladder, whoever it is can't get in
     the house.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

A shot of Buddy sound asleep in his bed in the early gray
dawn. As we DISSOLVE IN on the shot, we hear a loud BANGING
and DADDY'S VOICE. 

               DADDY (O.S.)
     Open that door! Open it up, open it
     this instant! Do you hear met open
     that door!

Buddy sits quickly up in bed, at once pushes back the covers
and gets out of the bed, hurriedly reaches for his khaki
pants.

INT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy in the upstairs hall. He is fully
dressed and is banging angrily on Rose's door.

               DADDY
     Rose! Rose! Open this goddamn door!
     Open it or I'll break it down!

ANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy as he hurries down the hall up to
Daddy, in khaki pants and pulling a shirt over his head.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     Open that door, damn you!

               BUDDY
     Daddy, what's the matter?

               DADDY 
          (glances around at him)
     She's got somebody in there,
     Brother! His shoes are on the back
     porch -- there they were, naked and
     smiling at me! 
          (bangs on door)
     Rose, open this door immediately!

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy as he bangs on the door. We see a
frightened Doll in her nightgown in the b.g. down the hall, a
hand to her mouth. Daddy commences kicking at the door.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE ON Daddy.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     Open up, Rose! Procrastination
     won't help you!

Finally, the CLICK of a bolt and slowly the door opens. We
see a wide-eyed, terrified Rose. She has a sheet around her
and evidently nothing more.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
          (he pushes past her)
     All right, where is he? Where's the
     culprit?

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy in the bedroom. He yanks open the
closet door, looks under the bed as he talks.

               DADDY 
     Where is he? I know he's in here,
     where is he, Rose? His shoes were
     on the back porch I smiling at met
     Where are you, you son of a bitch?

In her distress and dismay, the sheet has come down over
Rose's shoulder and one of her breasts is exposed.

               ROSE 
          (feebly, she is terrified)
     There ain't nobody here, Mr.
     Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!

               DADDY 
     Where is he? Where have you got him
     hid? 
          (notices curtain blowing
           in wide open window)
     Ah, ha!

The CAMERA follows Daddy as he strides angrily toward the
window and leans out of it and stares down. Rose makes a
little whimpering sound.

EXT. HILLYER SOME - GARDEN - DAWN

CUT TO a POV shot of the garden below as seen by Daddy from
the window. We see lying on the ground BILLY, the Sulky Boy
who scared Mother. He wears only undershorts and is groaning,
holding his leg, which evidently he has injured in jumping
from the window.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAWN

On Daddy, as he turns from the window to Rose.

               DADDY 
     And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?

               ROSE 
     Well, it's Billy.

               DADDY 
     And what, may I ask, was Billy
     doing here?

               ROSE 
          (a straight answer)
     Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very
     poor, he don't have no money and
     there wasn't no place else to go.

               DADDY 
     Well, it was a silly question.

               ROSE 
     He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He
     wants to be a fireman.

               DADDY 
     Ye gods and little fishes, a
     fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose,
     you're naked as a jay bird. When
     you're dressed, come on downstairs.
     I'm afraid your friend Billy is
     injured, where are his clothes?

               ROSE 
          (begins weeping, both
           breasts now are exposed)
     Under the mattress. I hid 'em so
     you wouldn't be mad. He wants to
     marry me, he loves me. I can't
     marry him, he's too young and
     hasn't got no job, but he loves
     me... now you wouldn't hurt him,
     would you?

Daddy gently pulls the sheet around her to cover her breasts.

               DADDY 
     I won't hurt him, honey.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A shot of Daddy, Mother and Rose at the kitchen table
drinking coffee in the early morning. Daddy looks grave,
Mother looks sad, and Rose is crying into a handkerchief.

               ROSE 
     Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and
     I hadn't ought to of done it. But
     I'm only a human girl and I... I
     ain't always perfect. I promise I
     won't let him in the house no more,
     I promise. Won't you and Mrs.
     Hillyer forgive me?

               DADDY 
     Rose, darlin', you break my heart.
     But I am only a human man myself of
     the father variety. Rose, pack your
     bag, baby, as of this moment you
     are hired, mired and fired.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

A shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. The
dissolve suggests that some time has gone by. Daddy looks a
bit grim, Rose has a wan and depressed expression. Mother
looks worried.

               DADDY 
          (politely)
     Well, Rose, going out to look for a
     job today?

               ROSE 
          (eyes down)
     What's the use, there ain't none.

               DADDY 
     Mmm. Would you get me another half
     a-cup of coffee, dear?

Rose rises and he watches her leave, then turns to Mother.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     It has been three weeks since I
     "fired" her. Is there no way to get
     rid of this girl? Are we stuck with
     her for life?

               MOTHER 
     She can't get a job, it's a
     depression. And we can't just throw
     her out on the street.

               DADDY 
     The hell we can't.

Rose returns with coffee and pours it out for Daddy.

               MOTHER 
     Rose, you don't look well and you
     haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.

               ROSE 
     I'm not hungry. I can't eat
     nothin', I haven't been able to eat
     since I got fired. I think maybe
     I'm sick.

               DADDY 
     God forbid. You're not sick, Rose,
     forget it. Don't get any notions in
     your head, you're not sick.

               ROSE 
     Yes, sir.

               MOTHER 
     She does look a little peaky.

               DADDY
     No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine.
     She's perfectly healthy, don't give
     her ideas.

               ROSE 
     Well, I'll do the dishes, then I'm
     goin' to lie down a minute and
     rest. My stomach hurts.

Daddy watches Rose exit to the kitchen, then leans forward
and speaks to Mother, his expression a bit sly.

               DADDY 
     Her plan is obvious, plain as day.
     She's going on a hunger strike. The
     question is, how do we foil her?

               MOTHER 
     She's just nervous and worried. And
     you would be, too, if you had no
     job and no place to go.

               DADDY 
          (thinking hard)
     Something has got to be done or
     Rose is going to be in this house
     forever.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY AND PATIO - DAY

A shot of the Model A coming up the driveway of the Hillyer
House. It is late afternoon.

CUT TO a shot of Daddy getting out of the car. He has a
triumphant little smile on his face.

A shot of Daddy as he walks onto the patio, a rolled-up copy
of the Glenville Tribune in his hand and his straw hat on the
back of his head. He definitely has a triumphant expression.
Buddy on the patio notices it.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the kitchen on Mother and Rose. Mother is
helping a rather wan Rose prepare dinner. Enter Daddy.

               DADDY 
          (as if everyone will be
           pleased)
     Well, I have got news! I called
     long distance and spoke to Cousin
     Hop and you'll be glad to know,
     Rose, I have found you a job!

               ROSE 
     Tennessee?

               DADDY 
     Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!

               ROSE 
     Well. What kinda job is it?

               DADDY 
     Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a
     fine, outdoor-type job.

               ROSE 
     You mean a farm?

               DADDY 
     No, no, not exactly. It isn't a
     farm in the sense that it's a farm.
     Not at all. It's a... dairy
     establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm
     sure you'll like it because it's
     so... peaceful!

Rose bows her head and begins crying.

               MOTHER 
     Honey, Rose was born on a farm and
     has terrible memories of farm life.
     Now I don't think --

               DADDY 
     Just a minute, Rose, you don't
     understand. This isn't a dirt farm
     like the one you were born on, it's
     nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I
     talked to him on the phone, a fine
     man... it's not a farm, damn it,
     it's a beautiful dairy
     establishment! Stop crying, Rose!
     Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's
     ideal!

               MOTHER 
     I don't know how you can call it
     ideal -- don't you know what the
     word "farm" means to her?

               DADDY 
     I don't give a hoot in hell's
     hollow what it means to her! She
     can't stay in this house forever! I
     fired her, damn it!

               MOTHER 
     It sounds like a farm to me.
     Calling it a dairy establishment,
     that's just trickery and flummery.

               DADDY 
     Trickery and flummery or not, she's
     going there tomorrow on the bus!
     It's settled! And I must say we've
     been more than fair to you, Rose,
     it's pretty selfish and mean
     hearted of you to sit there and cry
     like that!

Rose sits head bowed at the kitchen table.

               ROSE 
     I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm
     cryin' because of somebody else.

               DADDY 
          (stops in mid-air, so to
           speak)
     What?

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy outside on the patio, listening
intently at the window. He leans forward with a keen
interest, eyes wide.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Daddy. He is peering intently at Rose.

               DADDY 
     What did you say, Rose?

CLOSE ON Rose, as she turns, weeping.

               ROSE 
     Well, I was born on a farm
     myself... and I hate to think of
     the baby being born on one.

On them all. Daddy and Mother stare in shock at Rose.

               DADDY 
     What baby? What baby? What baby are
     you speaking about?

               ROSE 
     Mine.

               DADDY 
     Your baby?

               ROSE 
     Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.

               DADDY 
          (he is "poleaxed,"
           staggered)
     Good God almighty. This is a
     catastrophe, they won't hire her.

               MOTHER 
          (looks up, sees Buddy in
           patio window)
     Brother, get out of that window!

Buddy ducks down out of eight instantly. Both Mother and
Daddy, however, are too preoccupied and upset to be concerned
with him.

               DADDY
          (stares off groggily into
           space)
     This is a total catastrastroke. As
     of this moment I am stumped, I
     admit, I am stumped and treed both,
     the hound dogs have me surrounded.

               MOTHER 
          (as Rose begins crying)
     Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know
     you feel awful, but don't cry,
     honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the
     father, dear?

               ROSE 
     Well, I... I... I don't know...
     maybe it was... but no, you can't
     be sure about a thing like that. It
     wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.

               MOTHER 
          (gently)
     I know it's embarrassing... but who
     were you exposed to, dear?
     ROSE 
     Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h,
     that's kinda hard to say.

               DADDY 
     You're not going to get anywhere
     with that line of questioning. The
     problem is, what are we going to
     do?

               MOTHER 
     That's why I'm asking her who the
     father is. It's the most vital
     question of all. Who's the father,
     dear?

               DADDY 
          (offhand; he is thinking
           hard about what to do)
     She already told you, she doesn't
     know.

               MOTHER
          (naively)
     But she must know... unless...
     unless... Rose, was there more than
     one person?

               ROSE 
          (weeping in handkerchief)
     Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't
     think. I... I'm not really sure.

               MOTHER 
          (gently, a tiny frown, a
           bit shocked)
     Rose, really, you shouldn't act
     like that.

               ROSE 
          (weeping)
     Oh, I know. But I didn't, really.
     Honestly, I didn't. There was only
     one, but he's out of town and leave
     no forwardin' address.

               DADDY
          (a brilliant idea)
     Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No
     forwarding address, huh? 
          (turns to Mother)
     In the shock of this brilliant
     move, I forgot something.

               MOTHER 
     What did you forget?

               DADDY 
     I forgot that Rose will lie like a
     child. She's no more pregnant than
     I am, she just doesn't want to go
     to that farm!

               ROSE 
     Yes, I am.

               DADDY 
     No, you're not.

               ROSE 
     Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.

               DADDY 
          (triumphant, sure he's
           right)
     All right, tell us, Rose, what
     makes you think you're pregnant?

               ROSE
          (simply)
     I haven't had my period for three
     months and my stomach is getting
     big.

               DADDY
          (again "poleaxed" for a
           moment, but pulls himself
           together)
     I don't believe it.

               ROSE
     It's so, Mr. Hillyer.

               DADDY
     All right, damn it. We've seen you
     with your clothes off around here,
     stand up and pull up your dress and
     let's take a look!

               MOTHER
     Honey!

               DADDY
     She doesn't have to take her
     panties off, we can see her stomach
     with 'em on. All she has to do is
     pull up her dress and let us see
     her belly.

               ROSE 
     Well, all right, if you just won't
     believe me.

Rose stands up.

               MOTHER 
     Rose, you don't have to.

               ROSE 
     I don't mind.

               DADDY 
     Now, you will see, she's lying like
     she always does -- that belly will
     be flat as a pancake!

Rose lifts her dress and Daddy leans forward eagerly to
confirm his belief. Rose stands there with her skirt lifted.
She has on a pair of skimpy white panties. An unmistakable,
definite protrusion can be seen in the area below her navel
just above the line of her panties. A stupefied look is on
Daddy's face.

               MOTHER 
     I'd say about three months. Are you
     satisfied?

               DADDY 
     I am poleaxed and in a non compos
     mentis condition. I wash my hands
     or the whole thing.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Doll walking up onto the patio with
schoolbooks. The CAMERA follows her as she walks over to
Buddy, who is crouched down eavesdropping at another window.
She whispers to him.

     What's goin' on?

               BUDDY 
     Rose says she's goin' to have a
     baby and she sure looks it, but I
     don't think so.

               DOLL 
     A baby... and she isn't even
     married.

               BUDDY 
     That's the least of her troubles.
     Rose had a rare tropic disease and
     the little tubes in her that babies
     swim down are all stopped up, she
     told me all about it.

               DOLL 
     If it isn't a baby... what is it?

A shot of Buddy and Rose in a rather elegant Doctor's waiting
room. It is night and they are alone on a small sofa. Buddy
has a very solemn and worried look. Rose lies weeping in
terror on his shoulder.

               ROSE 
     Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all
     up! They're gonna cut my stummick
     all open, I'll die!

               BUDDY

     You won't die, Rose.

     Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S SOME OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Dr. Martinson's private office in his home,
quite a bit more luxurious than his office at the hospital. A
sober-looking Mother and Daddy sit talking to him. He almost
seems to relish the situation.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     I'm not surprised you thought she
     was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can
     look very much like pregnancy. But
     it was pure wishful thinking on her
     part. The girl can never have
     children, she had gonorrhea at
     fifteen and it was untreated.

               MOTHER 
          (shocked, rather feebly)
     Gonorrhea?

               DR. MARTINSON 
     Don't worry, Madam, she can't
     infect your dear little kiddies.
     She long ago fully recovered, but
     the disease did irreparable damage.
     The girl is permanently barren.

               MOTHER 
     Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose,
     what a life she has had.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     We make our own lives, Madam. As
     for malignancy, I don't think so,
     it's very unlikely. I probably
     shouldn't have even mentioned that
     possibility to her.

               MOTHER 
          (rather coldly, seems
           disenchanted with him)
     No, you shouldn't have, it was
     needlessly cruel. She thinks she
     has cancer and is going to die.

               DR. MARTINSON
     She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was
     merely giving her the facts.

               DADDY 
     Well, it's a disaster. I don't know
     what to say, Doctor, I am floored.
     How dangerous is the operation?

               DR. MARTINSON 
     Any major operation is dangerous.
     However, as we know from her
     previous illness, she's a very
     strong girl.

               DADDY 
     Well, if it isn't malignant and she
     can get through the operation all
     right, it might be better than her
     really being pregnant. She doesn't
     even know who the father might have
     been.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     Oh, it's definitely better, beyond
     question. A fatherless child, an
     ignorant girl with no job, no
     money, no home. It's fortunate, a
     blessing really, and a stroke of
     good luck for another reason I want
     to mention to you.

               MOTHER 
          (totally disenchanted with
           the Doctor)
     This conversation is making me a
     little sick.

               DADDY 
     Honey, that's no way to talk to the
     Doctor, he's merely doing his job,
     dear.

Oddly enough, in the stress of the situation, Daddy now seems
almost friendly to Dr. Martinson, whom previously he
considered a polecat.

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S HOME OFFICE WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Rose in the waiting room. He is
helping her lie on the couch on pillows as she weeps, a hand
over her face.

               BUDDY
     I gotta find out what they're
     saying. You lie back and rest,
     Rose, and I'll give you a report on
     it.

               ROSE 
     I don't want to know...

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a CLOSE shot of Dr. Martinson. An expression of
distaste is on his face. The CAMERA pulls back as he talks to
Mother and Daddy.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     I'm sorry the truth nauseates you,
     Mrs. Hillyer, because before you
     leave there's a bit more of it I'd
     like to put to you. This operation
     provides a therapeutic opportunity
     that I feel is quite important in
     regard to this particular girl, who
     suffers not only from an ovarian
     cyst but from a certain
     psychoneurotic condition as well.

               MOTHER 
     What do you mean, what kind of
     gobbledygook talk is that?

               DADDY 
     Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am
     following you.

               DR. MARTINSON 
          (gives Mother an aloof
           glance, then to Daddy)
     First, about the girl's history.
     Evidently she's been very
     promiscuous since early childhood,
     she has no control over her sexual
     impulses. Furthermore, she is
     permanently barren, she can't have
     children.

               DADDY 
     Go on, Doctor.

               MOTHER
          (quietly)
     Yes, go on.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     I am thinking particularly of the
     other ovary. As a rule I don't
     believe in removing it. The woman's
     hormonal system is profoundly
     disturbed, she is subject to
     possibly serious depression, she
     loses many of her secondary sexual
     characteristics for example, her
     breasts might shrink and become
     flabby, facial hair might appear
     along with a coarsening of the
     features, and of course her sexual
     drive is greatly diminished,
     especially in a girl or young
     woman. For these reasons I am
     opposed to removing the other
     ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?

               DADDY 
     I am ahead of you.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     Then... may I speak quite frankly
     with you, Mr. Hillyer?

               DADDY 
     Please do.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     I have of course observed the girl
     in treating her.

               DADDY 
     Of course.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     I think we both know her.

               DADDY 
     Yes, we know her.

               MOTHER 
     What are you talking about? I don't
     understand all this mumbo jumbo and
     the funny looks on your faces.

               DR. MARTINSON 
     Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in
     more ways than one. She is an
     extreme psychoneurotic with
     uncontrollable sexual impulses. It
     would be a mercy to spare her the
     suffering she causes herself and
     others. Therefore I recommend as a
     therapeutic measure the removal of
     her second ovary. It is ethically
     and medically the only proper
     decision in this case and I suspect
     your husband agrees with me.

               DADDY 
     Reluctantly, I do. It would be a
     blessing to her and everyone else.
     The girl is oversexed and I say --
     spay her!

               MOTHER 
          (slowly rises to her feet
           and in a trembling voice)
     Over... my... dead... body!

A long, frozen pause as both Daddy and Dr. Martinson stare at
Mother in surprise. She stares at the Doctor with fire in her
eyes. He seems already to shrink a little. Finally she speaks
with a calm fury.

               MOTHER (CONT'D)
     Are you human beings or are you
     some kind of male monsters? Is
     there no limit to which you won't
     go to keep your illusions about
     yourselves?

               DR. MARTINSON 
          (shrinking a little)
     Illusions, Madam?

               MOTHER 
     You'd go so far as to mutilate a
     helpless girl who has no means to
     defend herself, you'd go that far?
     Don't you think I know what you've
     just said and don't you think I
     understand the dreadful and
     revolting crime you've just
     conspired to commit?

Dr. Martinson stares at her in fear and shock, intimidated by
the calm fury and ice-cold moral indignation.

He opens his mouth as if to speak, but no sound comes out.
Mother turns to Daddy.

               MOTHER (CONT'D)
     I thought I knew you. I thought I
     knew you better, I thought in your
     heart you were a good and kind man.
     Well, I can't believe what I've
     just heard in this room. A
     defenseless girl depending on you
     for protection, and you propose to
     mutilate and destroy her. How could
     you listen even for a moment to
     that sadistic man?

               DADDY
          (slightly shattered)
     Well, now, darlin'... give me a
     chance to defend myself.

               MOTHER 
     I can't believe you really meant
     it, if I did I'd want to die. You
     aren't a male monster, that man is
     but you aren't. Look me in the eye
     and tell me, do you really want to
     take Rose's womanhood away from her
     when it's all she has got?

               DADDY 
     Well, I... I hadn't thought about
     it that much. I was thinking...
     well, it's an idea, the girl is
     oversexed, and...

               MOTHER 
     Rose isn't oversexed, that's
     ridiculous. If you're going to talk
     nonsense, I don't want to talk to
     you at all. Rose is exactly the
     same as the rest of us, except more
     so.

               DADDY 
     Well, I know, more so. That's why I
     was thinking... maybe she'd be
     better off.

               MOTHER
          (with a quiet fury)
     Better off? How could she ever find
     love and happiness, if you did what
     you're talking about? Are you
     insane?

               DR. MARTINSON 
          (rather feebly)
     Now, may I say, I am against that
     particular procedure, as a general
     rule. But in a case of near
     nymphomania, it doesn't seem
     monstrous to me at all, but
     medically advisable.

Both Mother and Daddy totally ignore him. Mother's eyes are
fixed on Daddy and he is struggling with himself, staring
down at the floor.

               DADDY 
     Well, now, I admit... in Rose's
     case, it would be cruel. If Rose
     wasn't attractive and pretty...
     well, it would probably be bad for
     almost any young woman. I don't
     know exactly what I was thinking
     about, the doctor said it and it
     sounded reasonable.

Daddy finally looks up at Mother and admits his error like a
man.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     But you're right, darlin', you're
     absolutely dead right, it would be
     an awful and horrible thing to do.
     I'm sorry, honey, forgive me, I
     didn't mean it.

Mother turns from Daddy and walks up to the desk and stares
down at Dr. Martinson as if he is a loathesome bug upon which
she intends to step.

               MOTHER 
     I will not cry like a woman. If I'm
     upset it's because of what my
     husband said, not because of you.
     You can't make me cry like a woman,
     a woman has got just as much
     intelligence and self-control as a
     man. And you get this in your head.
     If you hurt that girl, I'll hire
     lawyers and sue you for malpractice
     for every penny you have got, I'll
     do my level best to ruin you. Do
     you understand me?

               DR. MARTINSON
          (a sickly smile, he is
           licked totally)
     Yes, I understand you, but you have
     misunderstood me completely.

               MOTHER 
          (icy cold)
     I understand you perfectly. You
     leave that girl alone, you wretched
     man, or you will be sorry.

               DR. MARTINSON 
          (a foolish smile, as if
           Mother has paid him some
           kind of compliment)
     Actually of course I won't operate,
     I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy
     will operate and of course he'll be
     guided by your wishes in this
     respect.

               MOTHER 
     Let him be guided not by my wishes
     and not by Rose's wishes, although
     I am sure they are identical. Let
     him be guided by the wishes of the
     creative power of life itself,
     because that is what has spoken
     through me tonight.

EXT. STREET BY HOSPITAL - DAY

A shot of the Model A parked on the street outside a hospital
in a small Southern town. We see Daddy slowly pacing back and
forth in front of the hospital entrance, his head bowed and
his hands clasped behind him.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER on the Model A. Buddy sits in the
middle on the front seat, Mother is at the window. Doll and
Waski are on the back seat. They all are staring with pale
worry at the pacing Daddy fifty feet away. All are
frightened, Mother is very pale. Doll has a tiny handkerchief
to her eyes and is half crying. Even Waski is very scared.

               WASKI 
          (seems on verge of tears)
     Mother... is Rose going to die?

               MOTHER
          (in a trembly voice)
     No, Waski, she won't die, because
     we are praying for her.

CUT TO a shot of Daddy from the POV of the car. He looks at
his wristwatch, frowns and walks into the entrance of the
hospital.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on them all in the car. They wait, pale and
silent. Doll sniffles in her handkerchief.

               DOLL 
     Why is it taking so long?

               BUDDY 
     Here comes Daddy.

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy as he slowly walks up to the car,
his straw hat in his hand.

CUT TO a shot of Mother CLOSE on her face as she stares at
her husband as if trying to read the news on his face. A tiny
frown comes on her forehead as icy fear comes in her eyes.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Daddy as he walks up to the window of
the car, hat in hand. A trace of tears can be seen in his
eyes, but when he speaks his voice is calm.

               DADDY
          (philosophically)
     Well, I thought I'd seen the limit,
     but these are the most great, gaga
     epizootics she's ever had.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy and them all. In pale fear, mother
stares at him, uncertain what has happened.

               DADDY 
     Fine.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A shot of Daddy sitting with mother at the kitchen table.

Bright cheerful sunshine comes in the window that opens on
the patio. Rose comes into the SHOT carrying a coffee pot, a
sunny smile on her face.

               DADDY 
     You're looking very chipper this
     morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?

               ROSE 
     Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever
     felt! Except for a big old scar on
     my stummick, I wouldn't even know I
     been in the hospital.

               DADDY 
          (with mild irony, as she
           pours him coffee)
     Well, we know you were there. The
     bill that hospital sent was
     absolutely horrendous.

               ROSE 
          (her smile fades a trifle)
     Well, I'll pay you that back
     sometime, Mr. Hillyer.

               MOTHER 
     Don't worry about it, honey.

Daddy pauses, seems to be struggling with himself, he is
frowning.

               DADDY 
     Rose... I hate to be mean, but... 
          (another pause, then a
           little shrug)
     Oh, nevermind, forget it.

               ROSE 
          (in a little sad voice)
     What was it, Mr. Hillyer?

               DADDY 
          (rises)
     Nothing, Rose.

Daddy stops beside her, puts an arm around her shoulders and
with weary irony.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     We all love you, darlin'.

Daddy wearily picks up his straw hat from the kitchen counter
and walks out of the kitchen on the patio, as the CAMERA
stays on Rose and mother.

               MOTHER 
     Don't worry, honey, you'll find
     something.

               ROSE 
     I was offered that job as a
     waitress.

     tonks.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the patio. He has eight or nine
gourds on an outdoor table and is cutting round holes in them
and emptying out the seed. He glances up as Rose walks up to
him, pocketbook in hand. She seems a little sad. But she
smiles at him.

               ROSE 
     Hi, Buddy. 
          (puts an arm around his
           shoulders)
     How's my sweetheart who never told
     on me when I was bad?

     Okay.

           gourd)
     Makin' homes for purple martins,
     huh? We had 'em on the farm.
     They're the prettiest things.
     That's what I wish I was, a bird.
     Just fly around catch bugs and have
     a lot of fun.

               BUDDY 
     What are you going to do, Rose?

               ROSE 
     Take a little walk with me, huh?

EXT. HILLYER HOME - GARDEN

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy on a beautiful summer day
walking in the garden behind the Hillyer house. They walk up
to an empty rabbit hutch. The hutch is made of rough lumber
and chicken wire and has cubicles for about a dozen rabbits.

               ROSE
          (as she stares at the
           empty hutch)
     I guess I'll work as a waitress,
     Buddy. I done that before and it
     got me in worse trouble than you
     could know, but I can't stay here
     no more. Why did you get rid of
     your rabbits, Buddy?

               BUDDY 
     They're dumb things. I got tired of
     them.

               ROSE 
          (smiles, touches chicken
           wire)
     Did you know when I was a child we
     had pretty near five hundred
     rabbits?

               BUDDY 
     Five hundred rabbits?

               ROSE 
     Yep, we had 'em in orange crates
     all over. It was Daddy's dream. He
     was goin' to get rich raisin'
     rabbits. It was what killed Daddy.
     He didn't drown hisself till a long
     time later after Momma and Lunette
     died of typhoid, but it was them
     rabbits what killed him.

               BUDDY 
     How did the rabbits kill him?

               ROSE 
     He thought he could sell 'em, but
     nobody but country folks eat
     rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got
     no money. We had to eat them dern
     rabbits our own selves. Every dern
     one, and it took about four years
     to eat 'em all up.

               BUDDY
          (a little smile)
     Well, that doctor said you got
     protein somewhere and I guess he
     was right.

               ROSE 
     Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But
     later on after Momma died and Daddy
     wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin',
     I sure would of been glad for a
     little rabbit stew. You know, I
     oughtn't to of told you about what
     Daddy done when I was a child.
     Until them rabbits ruined him, he
     was a real good man, Buddy.

               BUDDY 
     What was your mother like?

               ROSE 
     A saint just like your own mother.
     She's up in heaven right now, her
     and Lunette, there ain't no doubt
     about it.

ANOTHER ANGLE as Buddy and Rose walk away hand in hand away
from the rabbit hutch.

               BUDDY 
     Maybe it was eating all those
     rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.

               ROSE 
     Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to
     me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito
     bite. 
          (stops, smiles, puts an
           arm around his shoulders)
     I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't

               BUDDY 
     I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose
     come in?

               DADDY 
     No, she hasn't. 
          (frowns, looks around)
     I think I hear a car.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY

CUT TO a shot of a 1930's automobile in the Hillyer driveway
at night as it drives up and stops before the front steps.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Rose and Dave Wilkie in the car. Here
DAVE is much YOUNGER, of course, and a rather handsome man in
a stolid way. Even though he is younger than when we saw him
on the plane, he is quite a bit older than Rose. Rose's eyes
are opened wide, she is a bit breathless, obviously something
important has happened. Dave stares at her as if fascinated,
almost as if awed.

               DAVE 
          (rather stiffly)
     I want to thank you for a wonderful
     afternoon and evenin'. Can I see
     you in the mornin'?

               ROSE 
          (a bit breathless)
     Yes. Year you can, you sure can.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy peering out of the window of the
living room.

               DADDY
     Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,

               MOTHER 
     Who?

               DADDY 
     You know Dave, his wife used to do
     dressmaking for you before she
     died.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose on the steps. Happy as a clam, she
turns and waves at Dave in the car, then goes on up the
steps.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of the front hall as Rose comes through the
front door. She is very excited, happy.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA follows her as she goes into the living room with
her big news.

               ROSE 
     You'll never guess what happened! 
          (pauses, then
           dramatically)
     I have met Mr. Right! I been with
     him all day and he loves me, I know
     he does, he loves me and he's going
     to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me
     already!

               MOTHER 
     Well... well, that's wonderful,
     Rose.

               ROSE
     And who do you suppose he is? That
     policeman who arrested me, the one
     I bit! He is Mr. Right!

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CHURCH - DAY

VARIOUS SHOTS of a wedding in a tiny country church. We see
shots of Rose in a white wedding dress, smiling, happy. Dave
is stiff and solemn in his best suit. Daddy gravely gives
Rose away. We hear no dialogue here, MUSIC on track. We see
Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the front row, all in Sunday
best and very solemn. We see a CLOSE SHOT of Rose's knees
trembling beneath her white wedding dress as a country
minister marries them. VARIOUS SHOTS of a rather idyllic
country wedding in a very plain, unpretentious country
church, and...

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

A shot of Rose, Dave, Buddy, Doll and Waski at a picnic
celebration outside the church by a running brook.

The scene should be beautiful in summertime. We see a
barbecue pit, homemade ice cream in the metal can, other
picnic things. A happy Rose is kissing first Buddy, then
Doll, then Waski. Dave smiles fondly, but rather stiffly at
her.

               ROSE 
     And now Waski, are you and Buddy
     and Dolly ready for some ice cream,
     huh? Do you like picnics or don't
     you?

               WASKI 
     We like 'em! We love 'em!

               DAVE 
     Well, it isn't a picnic, honey.
     It's a barbecue.

               ROSE
          (a little smile)
     Okay.

               DAVE 
     A picnic doesn't involve roast
     meat, hon. At a barbecue you have a
     lot of roast meat.

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy as he stares pensively at Dave.
The CAMERA stays on him as we hear VOICES OVER. Rose is
happy, Dave phlegmatic.

               ROSE (V.O.) 
     Well, all I know is there's ice
     cream. And I'm gonna have me a
     plate right now!

               DAVE (V.O.)
     Better wait, hon. It'll spoil your
     appetite. Have some barbecue first.

The CAMERA stays on Buddy, as he stares pensively at Dave. He
has no expression on his face at all.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

A shot of Rose and Dave bidding goodbye to the Hillyers.
Daddy, Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski are in the model A. Rose
is obviously on the verge of tears as Dave speaks solemnly to
Daddy.

               DAVE 
     Well, we are off to Savannah, Mr.
     Hillyer. No more police work, I'm
     getting in the construction field.

               DADDY 
     Good luck, Dave. And good luck to
     you, too, Rosebud.

               ROSE
          (begins crying)
     Oh, Mr. Hillyer! I just can't stand
     to say goodbye!

Daddy starts the Model A.

               ROSE (CONT'D)
     I love you all! Goodbye, Buddy!
     Goodbye, Dolly! Goodbye, Waski!

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose as she weeps and waves the
handkerchief.

               ROSE (CONT'D)
     Goodbye! Goodbye!

INT./EXT. MODEL A - STREET - DAY

A shot of Daddy and Mother in the Model A as Daddy drives. We
see Doll and Waski solemn on the back seat, but Buddy is not
visible.

               DADDY 
     Well, thank God we are rid of her
     at last. And the best thing of all
     is that she's happy. The little nut
     is happy, she found Mr. Right in
     the nick of time!

               MOTHER 
     Well, yes, she's happy. Of course
     Dave doesn't have her life force,
     not at all. There isn't much
     furniture in his house, just a
     table and one or two chairs,
     whereas Rose has furniture coming
     out of the windows.

               DADDY 
     Honey, he is Mr. Right.

               MOTHER 
          (slowly nods)
     Yes, I think so. He adores her,
     it's almost pitiful the way he
     worships her. I just hope she isn't
     too much for him.

Mother pauses, frowning, she has her doubts, looks over her
shoulder.

               MOTHER (CONT'D)
     What do you think, Brother?

Mother frowns in surprise.

CUT TO a POV shot of Buddy on the back seat of the car. Now
it is clear why we couldn't see him in the other shot. Be is
lying down on the seat of the car with his Sunday coat pulled
over his head.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother and Buddy, Doll, Waski. Buddy lies on
the seat, motionless with his coat over his head.

               MOTHER (CONT'D)
     What's the matter with him?

               DOLL 
          (seems awed, staring down
           at Buddy)
     I don't know. I think he's cryin'!

CUT TO ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother, from the front as she slowly
turns back and stares thoughtfully ahead. The shot is also on
Daddy. They both stare ahead in pensive silence. Finally
Mother speaks.

               MOTHER
          (rather sadly)
     Maybe Brother is right. Maybe so.

END OF FLASHBACK

INT./EXT. HERTZ CAR ON INTERSTATE - DAY

ON Willcox Hillyer behind the wheel of the Hertz car. He is
staring pensively ahead, a faint trace of tears in his eyes.
It is a very faint trace, a look of mild irony and amusement
is on his face.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (dryly, to himself)
     Mr. Right. Dave Wilkie.

Willcox slowly shakes his head.

EXT. HERTZ CAR - INTERSTATE EXIT - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it takes a turn-off from an
Interstate.

EXT. HERTZ CAR - BUSTLING CITY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it drives into a rather
bustling little Southern city that does not look at all like
the "Glenville" we have seen. A lot of traffic, new roads,
filling stations, prosperity. It could be Rome, Georgia as it
is today.

EXT. CAR PAST HOLIDAY INN - DAY

ANOTHER SHOT of the red Ford going past a modern Holiday Inn
in the city.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

ON the red Ford as it turns into a familiar driveway, that of
the old Hillyer home.

But insofar as possible it looks different now, like a relic
from the past.
Maybe the house needs painting, the garden is in weeds -- the
place is not exactly dilapidated, but it is marked by time.

A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he gets out of the red Ford and
walks up the familiar steps of the front porch, travel bag in
hand.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT PORCH - DAY

ON Willcox Hillyer at the front door. He tries the knob,
opens the door and goes inside.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer as he glances into the
living room. The room looks the same but different -it is
musty, dim.

Willcox Hillyer stares at it as if haunted a bit, turns and
the CAMERA follows him as he crosses the hall and looks into
Mother's old bedroom-study. This room is quite different. The
four poster is gone. The room is dusty, musty, dark.
Magazines are on the floor in a ring around Mother's old
study chair. We see "male" things. It is apparent Daddy lives
alone in this room.

A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he walks down the familiar hall
back to the kitchen.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

He looks around. No one is there. He glances at a modern
refrigerator that is in pretty poor shape, glances with a
frown at dishes in the sink unwashed. He goes on out to the
patio.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy putting out seed for birds on a table
on the patio. Daddy now is a very old man, but his
personality and style are the same as ever. He looks up with
a stern frown as Willcox Hillyer comes out on the patio.

               DADDY 
     Well, you rascal, where'd you come
     from?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     Hello, Daddy. How are you?

               DADDY 
     About as good as can be expected
     with one foot in the grave. Good to
     see you, son. 
          (they shake hands)
     Did you bring any of that Yankee
     whisky with you?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's
     Scotch.

               DADDY 
     It's Yankee whisky to me.

Daddy takes him by the arm, leads him back into the kitchen.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     How do you stand it up there, boy,
     in all that ice and snow? What are
     you, a polar bear?

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as they enter the
kitchen. The former opens his travel bag and takes out a
bottle of Teacher's.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     I can use a drink after the plane
     ride I had.

               DADDY 
     Your wife and children are back in
     New Hampshire in the snow?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (a little smile; it is
           summer, there couldn't be
           snow in New Hampshire)
     Yeah, they're in the snow.

Willcox opens whisky, looks for glasses in the dusty familiar
cupboard.

               DADDY
     Are they polar bears, too?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (frowns at cupboard)
     Good God, the way you live here.
     This place hasn't been dusted since
     Mother died. Look at that goddamned
     refrigerator.

               DADDY 
     Got another twenty years in it,
     boy. 
          (something seems to be
           bothering him)
     By the way, son, do you recall
     Rose, that pretty blonde girl who
     came to our house way back in 1935
     or 1936 and caused such a damnable
     commotion.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (frowns, turns and stares
           at him)
     Of course I recall Rose. In fact
     I've been thinking of no one else
     for the last hour and a half.

               DADDY 
     How could that be, son?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     Dave Wilkie of all people was
     sitting by me on the plane -- her
     first husband. It's funny you would
     mention Rose. Did you hear from
     her?

Willcox pours out whisky.

               DADDY 
          (casually)
     Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.
     You'll have the back bedroom, son,
     Mother's old art room. Just be
     careful going down the stairs you
     don't break your Yankee neck.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as they walk with
their drinks out to the patio.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     What's all this about Rose? What do
     you mean, you heard from her in a
     manner of speaking?

               DADDY 
     Oh, I heard from her, I got a
     letter from her, she's fine. But
     there is some sad news.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     What sad news? Did her cancer come
     back?

               DADDY 
     Oh, no, no, she got all over that.
     Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     Is her husband sick or something?

               DADDY 
     No, it's another thing. I was going
     to write you about it, but since
     you were coming down anyway I
     thought I'd wait till you got here.
     What did Dave Wilkie have to say?

ANOTHER ANGLE on Willcox Hillyer and the aged Daddy as they
sit on the patio sipping whisky. Willcox Hillyer is not
disturbed or worried about Rose, Daddy has been very casual
and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news
really is.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     The pitiful son of a bitch said
     Rose was a nymphomaniac.

               DADDY 
     Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed
     you?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     You're damn right it incensed me,
     the miserable bastard. He also said
     the kikes and the niggers have
     taken over Washington. D.C.

               DADDY
          (nods somberly)
     Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's
     pitiful like you say. When he lost
     Rose it ruined the man, it
     destroyed him totally when he lost
     Rose.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     He didn't lose her, he threw her
     away.

               DADDY 
     Yes, I guess he did. He threw her
     away and it was the mistake of his
     life.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (staring off pensively
           into space)
     You know, I don't know this town
     any more. All this traffic, new
     buildings, prosperity...
          (pauses, almost as if in
           pain)
     Where have the years gone, Daddy?
     Where is the little town I knew as
     a boy?

               DADDY 
     At rest in the creative universe
     with Mother, son.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (a little smile)
     That's what she would say herself.

               DADDY
          (simply, he is not
           emoting)
     A wonderful woman, boy.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     It always gives me a funny feeling
     to come home. Dear old Southland.
     Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --
          (a fond little smile)
     -- except you, you're still here.

               DADDY 
          (matter-of-factly)
     Not for long, boy. I've outstayed
     my welcome already.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     It's funny you would mention Rose,
     I was thinking about her all the
     way up in the car.
          (gives him a glance)
     Or maybe it isn't so funny.

               DADDY 
          (as if in previous
           thought)
     I'm older than hell, boy. But this
     Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll
     say that.

               WILLCOX HILLYER
     All right, Daddy. We have our
     drink, we're out on the patio, you
     have prepared me for it. Rose's
     cancer has come back, hasn't it?

               DADDY 
          (simply, quietly)
     No, son, she is dead. 

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (numb with shock, for a
           moment can't speak or
           think)
     Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she
     died?

               DADDY 
     I am afraid so, son. About a week
     ago. Her husband phoned me, she had
     asked him to call me if anything
     happened.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (in awful shock)
     But... but how? She was young! Rose
     wasn't old!

               DADDY 
     She was fifty-six, son. Of course
     she didn't look it, nowhere near
     it. The cancer came back, I'm
     afraid I fibbed about that. But it
     was very quick, son. She was in the
     hospital only two weeks, and the
     last week she didn't know anything.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
          (in distress, a slightly
           choked voice)
     Excuse me, I'll be right back.

Willcox Hillyer rises with his drink in hand and walks across
the patio to the kitchen door.

INT. HILLYER HOME KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer as he goes into the kitchen.
He picks up the whisky bottle and pours himself a very large
drink.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Willcox Hillyer as he stares across
the kitchen lost in thought.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

BLUR-BORDERED SHOT OF ROSE

in the kitchen, a sunny smile on her face as she pours coffee
for Daddy. A very quick moment, only a few seconds.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

A CLOSE SHOT OF WILLCOX HILLYER

in the kitchen, drink in hand, a look of grief on his face.
He struggles to control himself, puts a hand over his eyes,
then pulls himself together, turns from the kitchen.

SHOT OF THE PATIO

ON Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as the former walks up with his
refreshed drink and sits down. He is in control now, his face
is expressionless and he is seemingly calm.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     Well, you have knocked me for a
     hell of a loop, old man. A hell of
     a loop.

               DADDY 
          (simply)
     I know. You loved her. So did I. It
     was an awful shock to me, too. An
     awful shock. Rose was so alive it's
     hard to believe.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     I can't believe it, Daddy. I know
     it must be true, but I can't
     believe it.

               DADDY 
     It's true, son. The girl with the
     cornflower eyes is dead, she is no
     more,

Daddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on
himself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerful
feeling is behind his words.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     She got cancer of the breast, was
     operated on and had a seven-year
     recovery, then after a brief
     illness passed on in her sleep, as
     the man with whom she'd lived in
     beautiful love and harmony for
     twenty-five years held her hand.
     That is what happened, son, and God
     rest her lovely soul!

CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer. Despite his efforts
to control himself, tears are in his eyes. He clenches his
teeth, takes a big swallow of his drink.

ANOTHER ANGLE on them both as Daddy rises.

               DADDY (CONT'D)
     And now, if you are through with
     that Yankee whisky, we'll go to the
     Holiday Inn and get some dinner.

SHOT OF WILLCOX HILLYER AND DADDY

as they walk toward the red rental Ford. Daddy uses a cane.
He is a very old man. Willcox Hillyer looks in pain, he
grimaces as they walk along.

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?

               DADDY 
     Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd
     want to?

               WILLCOX HILLYER 
     That's a hell of a thing to say.
     Why, Rose?

               DADDY 
          (stops and firmly)
     Now look, boy, get a grip on
     yourself. Rose had a good life. She
     found her. Right, didn't she? She
     triumphed over everything, what are
     you blubbering about?

               WILLCOX HILLYER
     I'm not blubbering.

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford going down the familiar
driveway.

SHOT ON DADDY AND WILLCOX HILLYER

in the car. Daddy is staring fiercely ahead, Willcox Hillyer
stares ahead in gloom.

SHOT OF THE RED FORD

as it pulls up in front of the Holiday Inn we have already
seen.

SHOT ON DADDY AND WILLCOX HILLYER

in the car. Willcox Hillyer sits there staring off into space
in deep gloom. Daddy eyes him and now relents. We see
sympathy in his face.

               DADDY 
          (gently)
     Rose isn't dead, son. Not really.
     Some of us die, but some of us
     don't. Rose lives. As long as some
     little girl somewhere gets herself
     up and goes out, Rose lives.

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy, now middle-aged Willcox
Hillyer, as they walk toward the entrance of the Holiday Inn.
MUSIC.
                      THE END
