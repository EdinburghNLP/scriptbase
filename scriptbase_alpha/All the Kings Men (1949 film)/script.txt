Interior: Jack Burden's Desk, The Chronicle, Day

Jack Burden is looking over the morning edition of "The
Chronicle." He reads the society page. A man enters and leans
across his desk.

          MAN
     Burden! Jack Burden! The boss wants
     to see you.

He folds his paper, rises, and walks by the presses into
Madison's office.

Interior: Madison's Office, Day

Madison, the city editor, is correcting copy at his desk.

          MADISON
     Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow
     called Willie Stark?

          JACK
     No. Who'd he shoot?

          MADISON
     Oh, county... uh... treasurer, or
     something like that.

          JACK
     What's so special about him?

          MADISON
     They say he's an honest man. What I
     want you to do is to hop into your
     car...

          JACK
     Why, you promised me a vacation.

          MADISON
     Well, that can wait.

          JACK
     Yeah... but there's a... a girl I
     know.

He opens his newspaper to the society page and shows Madison
a photograph of Anne Stanton.

          MADISON
     Oh... Well, she can wait too.

Jack takes the paper back and looks at it.

          JACK
     The question is... can I?

          MADISON
     The answer is... get up there.

          JACK
     Right.
          (starts to go)
     Oh... uh... what did you say his
     name was?

          MADISON
     Who?

          JACK
     The fellow's name.

          MADISON
     Oh, the... uh... Stark... Willie
     Stark.

Madison goes on with his work.

          JACK
          (as he leaves)
     Willie Stark...

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Kanoma City, Day

As Jack Burden's jalopy pulls up before the Kanoma County
Courthouse of this back-country, one-street small town.

          JACK
          (voice over)
     I found him in Kanoma City. A typical,
     hot, dusty, backwoods county seat.

He gets out of the car, and notices a crowd of people gathered
around a platform in the town square. As he walks over the
begins to hear the words that Willie Stark is speaking.

          WILLIE
     ...to lie to them in order to line
     their own dirty pockets with the
     taxpayers' money. When have the
     citizens of Kanoma County ever
     witnessed a campaign like this? Why
     is the opposition so anxious to defeat
     me? Why have they used every dirty
     method known to make sure I'm not
     elected county treasurer? Well, I'll
     tell you why...

A man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, Tiny Duffy, comes out
of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to Willie's
speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break
up the gathering.

Jack Burden stands close to the platform, next to Willie's
son, Tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills.

          WILLIE
     ...Because they're afraid of the
     truth... and the truth is this.
     They're trying to steal your money.
     Yeah, I said steal. The county
     commissioners rejected the bid on
     the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll
     tell you their reason is the job
     will be done better. The county
     commissioners would have you believe
     that they're interested in public
     welfare. They're interested in
     welfare, sure. But it's their own.
     Let's look at the reason in the light
     of the facts and the figures. That
     brick factory is owned by one of the
     commissioners. That same brick factory
     uses convict labor.

The sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd.

          SHERIFF
     Sorry, Willie, you'll have to move
     on.

          WILLIE
     Why?

          SHERIFF
     City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five:
     more than five people congregating
     is disturbing the peace.

          WILLIE
          (ignores him)
     If you folks'll be so kind as to
     read these handbills, my boy will
     pass them out among you.

          SHERIFF
     There's an ordinance against that
     too.

          WILLIE
          (his face grim)
     Pass 'em out, Tom.

The sheriff pushes Tom back, grabbing the handbills out of
his hand. Willie jumps down off the platform.

          WILLIE
     Let him alone!

The sheriff collars Willie, then notices Jack on the platform
snapping a picture.

          SHERIFF
          (to deputy)
     Get that camera! Willie, you're under
     arrest.

He takes Willie by the arm and leads him away. The crowd
follows them to the courthouse. Tiny Duffy wipes the sweat
off his neck and goes back into the poolroom.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Kanoma City Poolroom, Day

Two of Duffy's men, Pillsbury and a local commissioner, are
playing pool as Jack enters.

          JACK
     Where can I find Tiny Duffy?

          PILLSBURY
     Right over there, mister.

He walks over to Duffy. Some townspeople, who followed him
there, gather around him to listen.

          JACK
     Uh, they told me I could get my camera
     back here.

          DUFFY
     Who told you that?

          JACK
     People. Can I?

          DUFFY
     You the reporter that's been snoopin'
     around town?

          JACK
     Are you Tiny Duffy?

          DUFFY
     What paper?

          JACK
     Chronicle.

          DUFFY
     You sure come a long way to stick
     your nose into other people's
     business.

          JACK
     That's true... Only my boss on the
     paper can't see it that way.

          DUFFY
     It ain't any of his business either.

          JACK
     Whose business is it?

          PILLSBURY
     Them as is tendin' to it. County
     commissioners that the voters of
     Kanoma County elected to tend to
     their business and not take no buttin'
     in from nobody.

          JACK
     You a commissioner?

          PILLSBURY
     Yeah. Name's Pillsbury. Dolph
     Pillsbury.

          2ND COMMISSIONER
     Me too. I'm a commissioner too.

          JACK
     Who isn't a commissioner?

          DUFFY
     He's the head man.

          JACK
          (to Pillsbury)
     Then you're in a position to know
     where --

          DUFFY
     He's in a position to know nothin'.
     And to say nothin'.

          JACK
     I thought you said he was head man?

          DUFFY
          (smiling)
     He uses my head.

          PILLSBURY
          (laughing loudly)
     Oh, Tiny, you're a card... Ain't he
     a card? Yeah, he's a card... Now,
     who thought up those city ordinances
     about arresting someone for making a
     speech?

          DUFFY
     Who's arrested? Nobody's been
     arrested.
          (looks toward the
          door)
     Hi, Willie.

Willie enters, accompanied by the sheriff and his deputy.
The others in the room, including Sugar Boy in his bartender's
apron, step aside to let him pass through.

          PILLSBURY
     Hi, Willie.

          DUFFY
          (to Sheriff)
     Did you apologize to Willie?

          SHERIFF
          (mumbles)
     Yeah, I apologized to Willie.

          DUFFY
     Did you give him his handbills back?

          SHERIFF
     Yeah, I gave 'em back.

          DUFFY
     Give him back his flag and his bag
     and...
          (points to Jack)
     give this man his camera.

          WILLIE
     I'm going to be on that same street
     corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy.

          DUFFY
     You go right ahead, Willie. We all
     believe in free speech. We got to...
     it's in the Constitution.

          WILLIE
     My boy is out distributing those
     handbills now.

          DUFFY
     It's a free country, Willie. If you
     can convince the people to vote for
     you... you go right ahead.

          WILLIE
     What did you want to see me about,
     Mr. Duffy?

          DUFFY
     I wanted you to meet a fella came
     all the way up from the state capital
     to meet you. A reporter. Wants to
     write you up... maybe put your picture
     in the paper.

          WILLIE
          (turns to Jack)
     I'm happy to know you, sir.

          JACK
     Burden's my name... Jack Burden. Can
     we go somewhere where we can talk?

          DUFFY
     Now that ain't polite. Don't you
     want to hear both sides of the story?

Jack examines the camera that has just been returned to him.

          JACK
     I know your side.
          (finds the plate
          missing)
     What happened to the plate your men
     took from my camera?

          DUFFY
     Must have dropped out. Oh, come on,
     fellas, let's relax. It's a hot day...
     Hey, Sugar Boy...

          SUGAR BOY
     Yeah?

          DUFFY
     Bring some cold beer for the boys.

          WILLIE
     None for me, thank you kindly.

          PILLSBURY
     Now you know Willie don't drink,
     Tiny. His wife don't favor drinking.
     And Willie's the teacher's pet, ain't
     you, Willie?

          WILLIE
     I'll have some orange pop if you
     don't mind.

Duffy roars with laughter.

          DUFFY
     Orange pop! All right, Sugar Boy.
     Bring him some orange pop.

          SUGAR BOY
          (stutters)
     Th-th-the p-p-pop's s-s-sold out.

          DUFFY
     Did you hear that, boys? The p-p-
     pop's s-s-sold out.

They all laugh.

          PILLSBURY
     Now ain't he a card?

          WILLIE
          (his face hard)
     He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you...
     you don't say anything.
          (to Jack)
     Let's go, mister.

They turn and go out.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Dirt Road, Day

Jack is driving Willie home to his farmhouse. They pass a
farmer and his family walking by the side of the road. Willie
smiles and waves to them.

Exterior: Stark Farmhouse, Day

As the car pulls into the drive we see Pa Stark in his rocking
chair on the porch, and Lucy, who stands at the top of the
steps, waiting to welcome Willie.

          WILLIE
          (as they go up the
          steps)
     This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden.

          JACK AND LUCY
     How do you do?

          WILLIE
     That's my pa.

Jack reaches out to shake his hand.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Stark Farmhouse, Night

Willie finishes chewing his food, pats his mouth with a
napkin, and pushes his plate back.

          WILLIE
     Now we'll talk.

Camera pulls back to include Jack, Lucy, and Pa, all seated
around the dinner table.

          JACK
     You've been talking for a long time,
     Mr. Stark.

          PAPPY
     Willie's got a lot to say.

          LUCY
     You sleepy, Pappy? You want to have
     a nap?

          PAPPY
     No, I want to hear it.

Lucy gets up and turns on a light in the kitchen.

          LUCY
     I'm worried about Tom. It's getting
     dark. He should have been home.

          WILLIE
     He's a strong boy. Don't worry about
     him. He can take care of himself.

          JACK
     How old is the boy?

          WILLIE
     Fifteen.

          JACK
     How long have you been married?

          WILLIE
     Nine years.

Willie grins at Jack's look of surprise. Lucy comes back
into the room.

          LUCY
          (laughs)
     He was a neighbor's boy. They were
     poor folks. Both died. I couldn't
     have any children, so... He's a good
     boy.

          WILLIE
     Oh, he's the best. I couldn't love
     him any more if he was my own flesh
     and blood.

          JACK
          (to Lucy)
     And now you, Mrs. Stark?

          LUCY
     Oh, there isn't very much to tell
     about me.

          JACK
     How did you meet?

          LUCY
     I was teaching school and one day a
     pupil walked in. It was Willie. I
     couldn't have a grown man in the
     class and Willie wanted to learn so
     badly... so I married him.

          JACK
     Is that the only reason?

          LUCY
          (pressing Willie's
          arm)
     Except that I loved him.

          WILLIE
     Get the coffee, Lucy.

She goes back into the kitchen.

          JACK
     When did they fire you, Mrs. Stark?

          LUCY
          (as she serves the
          coffee)
     A couple of weeks ago. I'd been
     teaching for a long time and nobody
     ever said I wasn't all right. But I
     don't care. I don't want to teach in
     a schoolhouse that they built just
     so somebody can steal some money.
     And Willie doesn't want to be
     Treasurer, either, if he has to
     associate with those dishonest people.

          WILLIE
          (glumly)
     I'm going to run. They can't keep me
     from running.

          JACK
     If you don't mind the truth, Mr.
     Stark, you haven't much of a chance.

          WILLIE
     I'm going to run. They're not going
     to kick me around like I was dirt.

          LUCY
     I don't care if Willie loses... just
     so he gets the truth to the people.
     Isn't that true, Willie?

Willie is silent. Jack looks at him.

          LUCY
     Isn't it, Willie?

          WILLIE
     Hmmm?... Yeah, yeah, sure, that's
     right.

          LUCY
     Well, if you lose you can give a
     little more time to studying your
     law books.

          JACK
     Oh, you studying law too?

          WILLIE
     By myself, at night.

          PAPPY
     Willie's a smart boy.

          WILLIE
     If I ever find the time I'm going to
     take a course at the university.

The door opens slowly and Tom comes in from the porch. His
clothes are torn and his face is dirty and bloody. He still
carries some of the handbills. They rise to their feet and
cluster around him.

          LUCY
     What happened, Tommy boy? What's the
     matter?

          TOM
          (head down, muttering)
     I gave out the handbills, Pa.

          WILLIE
     Speak up. Speak up.

          LUCY
     Let him tell it his own way. Go on,
     Tommy.

          TOM
     This time they were waiting for me.
     They took them away from me. Threw
     them in the dirt and beat me up. I
     brought some of them back.

          WILLIE
          (pats him on the back)
     Good boy. Have you eaten yet, Tom?

          LUCY
     Let him wash up first.

As Tom and Pappy go into the other room, a rock comes crashing
through the front window, shattering the glass. Willie, his
face filled with anger, throws open the door and stalks out
onto the porch. Jack stands at the door, watching Willie
shout into the darkness around him.

          WILLIE
     I'm going to run... and you're not
     going to stop me. I'm gonna run even
     if I don't get a single vote.

                                   FADE OUT

FADE IN:

Interior: Jack Burden's Desk, Day

Jack's fingers type out a story, the last line of which reads
"an honest man with courage." He pulls the sheet out and
hands it to Madison.

          JACK
     Here you are... the last of the Willie
     Stark articles. Now can I go?

          MADISON
     Yes. You've earned your vacation.
     You've been writing these like you
     really mean them.

Jack rises and walks toward the door.

          JACK
     I do.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Ferry To Burden's Landing, Day

Jack's car is ferried across the bay to the slip of Burden's
Landing.

          JACK
          (voice over)
     I hadn't been home in a long time.
     Only a hundred and thirty miles from
     Kanoma City. It was separated from
     the mainland by a body of water. For
     the first time I wondered if it wasn't
     separated by more than that.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Mrs. Burden's Home, Day

As Jack arrives, Mrs. Burden and her husband, McEvoy, are
seated at a lawn table near the boat landing.

          JACK
     Hello, Mother.

She runs forward to meet him.

          MRS. BURDEN
     Floyd, Jack's home. Oh, he looks
     fine... doesn't he look fine?
          (to Jack, coquettishly)
     How do I look, Jackie boy?

          JACK
     You look beautiful, Mother.

          MRS. BURDEN
     I've got so many things planned for
     you... parties and... it'll be just
     like old times. But first, let's
     have a drink.

          MCEVOY
     Can't that wait until this evening?

She goes ahead and pours the drinks.

          MRS. BURDEN
     Floyd... honey... my son's home.

          MCEVOY
     How long do you plan on staying?

          JACK
          (coldly)
     Two or three weeks. If that's all
     right with you.

          MRS. BURDEN
     I'm sure your father would be --

          JACK
     Stepfather, Mother.

          MRS. BURDEN
          (reproachfully)
     Now, Jackie... here we all are. Floyd,
     Jackie, myself.
          (raises her glass for
          a toast)
     To the best time we've ever had
     together.

          JACK
     Yes, Mother.

They drink. Mrs. Burden gulps hers down avidly. Jack looks
at her and then at McEvoy.

          JACK
     Excuse me... I...

He turns and walks back toward the shore. He boards a small
motorboat and heads toward a house that can be seen across
the water.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Stanton Home (Burden's Landing), Day

As the boat approaches the shore. Adam Stanton reaches down
and pulls the boat up on land. He throws his arm around Jack,
and the two climb the hill toward Judge Stanton, who stands

They walk back together to the patio tables.

          JUDGE
     Oh, just sitting here... waiting for
     all of you to come home. You know,
     when a man starts to get old his
     eyes stray and play funny tricks on

     To all the good times we've had
     together at Burden's Landing. And
     especially to this one. Because my
     son's home.

          JACK
     Thank you, Mother. Thank you very
     much.

          MRS. BURDEN
     Monty, Anne and I have been discussing
     Jack's career. What do you think he
     ought to go in for? Shall he be a
     lawyer, doctor...

Jack looks at Anne.

          ANNE
     We were just discussing whether you
     should...

          JACK
          (to his mother)
     I like what I'm doing, Mother.

          MCEVOY
     You do very well at it. I read your
     articles about this fellow... Willie
     Stark. Very convincing... Too
     convincing for my tastes.

          JACK
     A lot of people like them.

          MCEVOY
     A lot of people are fools. Articles
     like that shouldn't be permitted.
     They only tend to incite people.

          JACK
     What are you afraid of?

          STANTON
     I thought they were very good. I was
     proud of you, Jack. I was particularly
     interested in Stark's ideas on health
     and medicine. You know the conditions
     at the hospital I work in. They're
     intolerable. I'd like to meet this
     Willie Stark. He sounds like an honest
     man.

          MCEVOY
     Honest man? This state is full of
     these log-cabin Abe Lincolns with
     price tags on them. The louder he
     yells the higher his price.

          JACK
     You think you can buy anything, don't
     you?

          MCEVOY
     Yes, don't you?

There is a silence. Then McEvoy turns to the Judge.

          MCEVOY
     What do you think, Judge?

          JUDGE
     I think this state could stand a few
     changes.

          MCEVOY
          (his face white)
     Well, I'll tell you what I think --

          ANNE
          (quickly)
     Oh, please... let's not talk politics.

          MRS. BURDEN
     Anne is right. I absolutely forbid
     any more of it. I know what we need,
     we need another toast.
          (to the Judge)
     You propose it, Monty... you're so
     good at it.

The Judge picks up his glass and stands up.

          JUDGE
     To the young people... to Anne, to
     Jack, to Adam... To what lies before
     them. To the world they'll make...
     in spite of the mistakes we've made.

          MCEVOY
          (rising)
     The mistakes you've made, not me.
     You're all still pretty high and
     mighty, aren't you? You all think
     this state needs a change. You don't
     like the way it's run. Well, who's
     going to run it? Willie Stark? The
     Judge?
          (to Jack)
     You? You can be bought too. As a
     matter of fact you have been. And
     with my money.

Jack's answer is to throw his liquor in his stepfather's
face. There is a pause. McEvoy wipes the liquor off with his
handkerchief.

          MCEVOY
          (slowly)
     That's a waste of good liquor.
          (looks at Mrs. Burden)
     Your mother wouldn't approve.

Jack turns and leaves the room.

          MRS. BURDEN
     Jack...

She hurries after him.

Exterior: Veranda, Night

As Mrs. Burden comes out after Jack. Anne stands in the
doorway.

          MRS. BURDEN
     Jack... you go back in and apologize.

          JACK
     Apologize? I'd rather die.

          MRS. BURDEN
     I've got to live with him.

          JACK
     Well, I don't. Neither do you. You
     don't love him, Mother. You never
     did.

          MRS. BURDEN
     Son, don't spoil anything now... He
     can help you.

          JACK
     I can get along without him. You
     need this house. And the parties.
     And the cars and the clothes and the
     lies. I don't. It's the truth, Mother,
     face it. For once in your life, face
     it.

Mrs. Burden appeals to Anne.

     Anne, please... please make him

     Anne, Burden's Landing is a place on

     exist. It's me pretending I live on
     what I earn. It's my mother trying
     to keep herself young, and drinking
     herself old doing it. It's you and
     Adam living in this house as though
     your father were still alive. It's

          through the window)
     Hey, those speeches! Ain't they awful?
     Ain't they just plain awful? Question
     to you: if somebody told him he was
     a sucker, do you think he'd quit?

Willie has just finished his speech and is on his way over
to the hotel.

          JACK
     I don't know, Sadie. I really don't
     know.

          WILLIE
          (as he comes into the
          lobby)
     Did it sound all right, Mr. Burden?

     Fine, Willie, fine.

          WILLIE
     Thanks.

Sadie lies on her bed, listening to Willie in the next room,
rehearsing one of his speeches.

          WILLIE'S VOICE
     Now, friends, if you will bear
     patiently with me for a few minutes,
     I'll give you the figures. What we
     need is a balanced tax program...

          JACK'S VOICE
     No, Willie, no.

Sadie pulls off a shoe and hurls it at the wall.

          SADIE
     What I need is some sleep. Shut up!

Interior: Jack's Hotel Room (Upton), Same Time

Willie lies on his bed. Jack finishes shaving in the bathroom
as he continues to rehearse him.

          JACK
          (shouting back at
          Sadie)
     Shut up yourself!
          (goes to bed, shakes
          Willie)
     Listen, Willie, try it on your feet
     this time.

          WILLIE
     Oh, no. Wait a minute. My feet are
     killing me. Let me stay here, huh?

          JACK
     All right... Look, Willie, you tell
     'em too much. Just tell 'em you're
     going to soak the fat boys and forget
     the rest of the tax stuff.

          WILLIE
          (pathetically)
     That's what I say.

          JACK
     But it's the way you say it. Willie,
     make 'em cry. Make 'em laugh, make
     'em mad, even mad at you. Stir 'em
     up and they'll love it and come back
     for more. But for heaven's sake don't
     try and improve their minds.

          WILLIE
          (suddenly)
     A man don't have to be governor.

          JACK
          (surprised)
     What?

          WILLIE
     A man don't have to be governor.

Pause.

          JACK
     Well, they haven't counted up the
     votes yet.

          WILLIE
          (quietly)
     Oh, I'm going to lose, Mr. Burden. I
     know that. Don't try and fool me.
     I'm not going to lie to you. I wanted
     it. I wanted it so badly I stayed up
     nights thinking about it. A man wants
     something so badly he gets mixed up
     in knowing what he wants. It's
     something inside of you. I would
     have made a good governor. Better
     than those other fellows.

There is a knock on the door.

          JACK
     Come in.

          WILLIE
          (almost to himself)
     A great governor.

Sadie enters. She immediately spots the liquor, and pours
herself a drink.

          SADIE
     Since you won't let me sleep you
     might at least give me a drink.

          WILLIE
          (muttering)
     Build them highways... greatest system
     of highways in the country.

          JACK
          (to Sadie)
     Help yourself.

          WILLIE
     I'll build schools.

          SADIE
          (to Jack)
     What's up?

          JACK
     Nothing... except Willie here has
     been saying as how he's not going to
     be governor.

          SADIE
          (directly, to Jack)
     So you told him.

          JACK
     I don't tell anyone anything... I
     just listen.

          SADIE
          (goes to Willie)
     Who told you?

          WILLIE
     Told me what? Told me what?

          SADIE
     That you're not going to be governor.

          WILLIE
          (getting up)
     Jack! Told me what?... Told me what?

Jack says nothing. Sadie gulps down her drink, bangs the
empty glass on the bureau top, and turns to face Willie.

          SADIE
          (loudly)
     All right! That you've been framed,
     you poor sap.

Willie looks at her steadily for a moment.

          WILLIE
          (quietly)
     Framed?

          SADIE
     And how! Oh, you decoy, you woodenhead
     decoy! And you let 'em. You let 'em
     because you thought you were the
     little lamb of God. But you know
     what you are?
          (she waits for his
          answer; he has none)
     Well, you're the goat! You are the
     sacrificial goat! You are a sap...
     because you let 'em.

          JACK
     Sadie! That's enough.

          SADIE
     Enough? He didn't even get anything
     out of it. Oh, they'd have paid you
     to take a rap like that, but they
     didn't have to pay a sap like you.
     Oh, no, you were so full of yourself
     and hot air, all you wanted was a
     chance to stand up on your hind legs
     and make a speech: my friends, what
     this state needs is a good five-cent
     cigar. What this state needs is a --

          WILLIE
          (to Jack)
     Is it true?

          SADIE
          (prayerfully, to the
          ceiling)
     He wants to know if it's true.

          WILLIE
     Is it true?

          JACK
     That's what they tell me.

There is a long pause. Willie looks almost as if he is going
to cry. Sadie pours out another drink, a stiff one.

          SADIE
          (handing it to him)
     Here.

Willie drinks it all.

          JACK
     Hey, lay off that. You're not used
     to it.

          SADIE
          (jeeringly)
     He's not used to a lot of things.
     Are you, Willie?

          JACK
          (angrily)
     Why don't you lay off of him, Sadie?

          SADIE
          (ignores Jack)
     Are you, Willie? Are you? Are you...
     are you, are you, are you?

She shoves the bottle at him. He takes it and pours himself
a drink.

Interior: Sadie's Hotel Room (Upton), Morning

Willie is snoring on the bed. Sadie's coat is thrown over
him. She is in the bathroom, applying lipstick. Jack enters.

          SADIE
     Hi.

          JACK
     Well, things seem to have quieted
     down.

          SADIE
          (laughs)
     Yeah, I quieted him down.

          JACK
     Yeah. How was he? Noisy?

          SADIE
     Oh, he reared some. He's been telling
     me all the things he's going to do.
     He's going to do big things, this
     fella. He's going to be President.
     He's going to kill people with his
     bare hands. I quieted him down...
     Hey! Who's Lucy?

          JACK
     His wife.

          SADIE
     He talks like she's his mammy...
     she's going to blow his nose for
     him.

Jack sits on the bed next to Willie.

          JACK
     Well, I'll take him from here on in.
     They're waiting for him at the
     barbecue.

Sadie pulls her coat off Willie and goes to the door.

          SADIE
     Yeah, well give me a receipt for the
     body and I'll be on my way.

She leaves. Jack bends over Willie, who continues to snore.

          JACK
     Hey, Willie, Willie... come on, wake
     up, Willie. Come on, Willie.

A crowd mills about underneath a banner that reads HEAR WILLIE
STARK MAMMOTH BARBECUE -- UPTON FAIRGROUNDS

Exterior: Fairgrounds, Day

Willie, staggering a bit, hung over, reacts painfully to the
staggering height of the Ferris wheel. He leans on Jack for
support, and they walk on.

Exterior: Fairgrounds, Day

Willie takes a seat on the children's swing as Jack goes off
to get some coffee. Two little girls stare curiously at him.
Willie waves them off. Jack returns with the coffee and pours
some whisky in it. Willie tips his hand, forcing him to pour
more, then gulps his drink down.

Exterior: Bandstand (Upton), Day

Duffy, Pillsbury, and the other politicians stand on the
platform, waiting for Willie. A band plays march music. Duffy
goes over to Sadie, who is standing on the steps of the
platform.

          DUFFY
     Where is he?

          SADIE
          (pointing)
     There he is.

Escorted by Jack, Willie approaches the platform and stumbles
up the steps past Sadie.

          SADIE
     Whoops!

          DUFFY
          (to Jack)
     Is he drunk?

          JACK
     Never touches the stuff. Lucy doesn't
     favor drinkin'.

Duffy follows Willie up on the platform.

          SADIE
          (to Jack)
     How'd you get him here? He was out
     stiff.

          JACK
     Hair of the dog that bit him.

          SADIE
     Hair? He must have swallowed the
     dog.

On the platform, Duffy looks uneasily at the bleary-eyed
Willie. The band suddenly plays a fanfare, and the chairman
steps up to the microphone.

          CHAIRMAN
     Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a
     great deal of pleasure to introduce
     to you that true man of the people,
     the next governor of the state...
     Willie Stark.

There is scattered applause as Willie steps forward to speak.

          WILLIE
     My friends...

He turns his face from side to side, and fumbles in the right
side of his coat pocket to fish out his speech.

          WILLIE
     My friends... I...

He tries to focus on the speech, which he clutches before
his eyes with both hands. Then he lifts his head, and looks
directly at the people who have come to hear him. As he
speaks, the camera focuses on the faces of these people: the
farmers, workers, hicks, red-necks who are Willie's audience,
Willie's people.

          WILLIE
     I have a speech here. It's a speech
     about what this state needs. There's
     no need in my telling you what this
     state needs. You are the state and
     you know what you need... You over
     there... look at your pants. Have
     they got holes in the knees? Listen
     to your stomach. Did you ever hear
     it rumble from hunger?... And you,
     what about your crops? Did they ever
     rot in the field because the road
     was so bad you couldn't get them to
     market?... And you. What about your
     kids? Are they growing up ignorant
     as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause
     there's no school for them?... No,
     I'm not going to read you any speech.

He throws his speech away. Duffy looks alarmed.

          WILLIE
     But I am going to tell you a story.
     It's a funny story...

          SADIE
          (from the steps)
     Hey!

          WILLIE'S VOICE
     ...So get ready to laugh.

          SADIE
     What's he up to?

          JACK
     Shut up!

          WILLIE
     Get ready to bust your sides laughing,
     'cause it's sure a funny story. It's
     about a hick... a hick like you, if
     you please. Yeah, like you. He grew
     up on the dirt roads and gully washes
     of a farm. He knew what it was to
     get up before dawn and get feed and
     slop and milk before breakfast...
     and then set out before sunup and
     walk six miles to a one-room, slab-
     sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick
     knew what it was to be a hick, all
     right. He figured if he was going to
     get anything done, he had to do it
     himself. So he sat up nights and
     studied books. He studied law because
     he thought he might be able to change
     things some... for himself, and for
     folks like him.

Sugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's
speech.

          WILLIE
     No, I'm not going to lie to you. He
     didn't start off thinking about the
     hicks and all the wonderful things
     he was going to do for them. No. No,
     he started off thinking of number
     one. But something came to him on
     the way. How he could do nothing for
     himself without the help of the
     people. That's what came to him. And
     it also came to him, with the powerful
     force of God's own lightning, back
     in his home country, when a
     schoolhouse collapsed because it was
     built of politics... rotten brick.
     It killed and mangled a dozen kids.
     But you know that story. The people
     were his friends because he fought
     that rotten brick. And some of the
     politicians down in the city, they
     knew that... So they rode up to his
     house in a big, fine, shiny car and
     said as how they wanted him to run
     for governor...

Jack, electrified, grips Sadie's arm.

          JACK
     Sadie, he's wonderful... wonderful...

Duffy fidgets as Willie continues to pace and speak, his
face filled with conviction, and with fury.

          WILLIE
     ...So they told the hick... and he
     swallowed it. He looked in his heart
     and he thought in all humility how
     he'd like to try and change things.
     He was just a country boy who thought
     that even the plainest, poorest man
     can be governor if his fellow citizens
     find he's got the stuff for the job.
     Well, those fellows in the striped
     pants... they saw the hick and they
     took him in.

He points his finger at Duffy, who is coming over to speak
to him.

          DUFFY
          (low voice)
     Willie, what are you trying to do?

Willie turns on him, roaring.

          WILLIE
     There he is! There's your Judas
     Iscariot.
          (he pushes Duffy across
          the platform)
     Look at him... lickspittle... nose-
     wiper.

Duffy gestures frantically to the band.

          DUFFY
     Play! Play!

          WILLIE
          (pushing him again)
     Look at him!

          DUFFY
     Play anything.

The band starts to play, adding to the pandemonium. Willie
shouts above it.

          WILLIE
     Look at him! Joe Harrison's dummy!
     Look at him!

          DUFFY
     That's a lie!

          WILLIE
     Look at him!

Duffy signals to some of his goons standing near the platform.

          DUFFY
     Go get him, boys... go get him.

Sugar Boy leaps up on the platform, his pistol drawn and
pointed at Duffy's men. Willie throws up his arms to silence
the crowd.

          WILLIE
     Now, shut up! Shut up, all of you.
     Now, listen to me, you hicks. Yeah,
     you're hicks too, and they fooled
     you a thousand times, just like they
     fooled me. But this time I'm going
     to fool somebody. I'm going to stay
     in this race. I'm on my own and I'm
     out for blood.

The camera moves in close on Willie's face.

     where he was going.

We see an insert of a newspaper. It has a caricature of
Willie, swinging a sledge hammer. The caption reads

STARK ATTACKS ADMINISTRATION
CHARGES OLD MACHINE STILL CORRUPT

          JACK
          (voice over)
     He had his foot in the door and he
     kept right on pushing to get in. He
     had lost the election but he had won
     the state... and he knew it... and
     the people knew it.

Interior: Hotel Lobby, Day

The lobby is packed as Willie, Jack, Sugar Boy, and Pillsbury
enter. Willie makes signals to Duffy to tag along with the
entourage. Willie leans over to speak to the room clerk.

          WILLIE
     This is Jack Burden, a friend of
     mine. From now on he's going to live
     here. Give him anything he wants.

The group starts up the stairs, past the officers who are
standing guard. Duffy stops to speak to one, pointing his
finger at some of his men standing below.

          DUFFY
     Let these boys through, officer.

          WILLIE
          (to Jack)
     Duffy works for me now.

          JACK
     It looks like everybody works for
     you.

They start up the second flight of stairs.

          WILLIE
     No. No, not yet. But I want to keep
     him around. He reminds me of something
     I never want to forget.

Willie stops and looks around at Duffy's men hurrying up the
steps.

          WILLIE
          (to Duffy)
     Come on, come on, come on, come on.
     Are these the boys?

          DUFFY
     These are the boys that can get the
     boys.

          WILLIE
     How many do you think we can get?

          DUFFY
     Fifty.

          WILLIE
     How much?

          DUFFY
     Five dollars a head.

          WILLIE
          (to Sugar Boy)
     What do you think, Sugar? Do they
     look like good boys?

          SUGAR BOY
     T-t-they b-b-better be.

          WILLIE
     Get a hundred... All right, go on,
     all of you. Blow. Blow, blow. You
     too, Duffy. Go on.

Duffy and his men turn and go downstairs.

          JACK
     If they all look like them I'd hate
     not to take one.

          WILLIE
     That's the object. Not like when
     they beat up my boy Tom.

          JACK
     How is Tom?

          WILLIE
     Oh, he's fine. He starts college in
     the fall.

          JACK
     Oh. And Lucy?

Willie's expression changes. He starts up the stairs.

          WILLIE
     Fine... fine.

     Hey, I need a boy... Where's a boy?
          (boy runs up)
     Take that downstairs; they're waiting
     for it. Right away, on the double.
          (to typist)
     Listen, baby, you've got to double-
     space all of this... he can't read,

The door opens and Willie, Jack, and Sugar Boy come in.

          JACK

          SADIE
          (to typist)
     And they need four copies.
          (looks up)
     Hi, Jack. How are you?

          WILLIE
     Sadie is my secretary now.
          (to messenger, trying
          to squeeze by)

Sugar Boy appears in the doorway. Sadie slips by into the

     Keep everybody out of here. I want
     to talk to Jack and Sadie alone.

He walks over to Jack, who leans back on the bed.

          WILLIE
     From now on you're working for me.

          JACK
     Doing what?

          WILLIE
     I don't know. Something will turn
     up, won't it, Sadie?

          SADIE
     Yeah. We need a college man around...
     for research.

          WILLIE
     How much did they pay you on that
     newspaper?

          JACK
     Three hundred dollars a month.

          WILLIE
          (laughs)
     I could buy you cheap, couldn't I?

          JACK
     For a bag of salt.

          WILLIE
     No. No, I don't play that way. I
     like you, boy. I always have. I'll
     tell you what I'll do. I'll give you
     four hundred dollars a month and
     traveling expenses.

          JACK
     You throw money around like it was
     money.

Willie gets up and walks to the window.

          WILLIE
     Money?... I don't need money. People

Mrs. Burden, and McEvoy are part of the audience sitting

     well, it's an honor I never thought

     I have a question.

          WILLIE
     Shoot.

          STANTON
     A lot of people in this state have
     been saying that you've been making
     deals... some of them with the very
     groups that you claim you're against.
     Is that true?

          JACK
     Adam, you know how rumors start...

          WILLIE
     Yes. Yes, that's true. I have nothing
     to hide. I'll make a deal with the
     devil if it'll help me carry out my
     program. But believe me, there are
     no strings attached to those deals.

          STANTON
     You're sure about that?

          WILLIE
     Doc, Jack here has been telling me
     how you feel about things... how
     you'd like to see a new hospital
     built, a hospital that's the biggest
     and best that money can buy. You
     want those things, Doc, because,
     well, because you're a man who wants
     to do good. Now, I'd like to ask you
     a question.

          STANTON
     Shoot.

The guests laugh good-naturedly.

          WILLIE
     Do you know what good comes out of?

          STANTON
     You tell me, Mr. Stark.

          WILLIE
     Out of bad... that's what good comes
     out of. Because you can't make it
     out of anything else. You didn't
     know that, did you?

          STANTON
     No, I didn't... There's another
     question I'd like to ask you. You
     say there's only bad to start with
     and the good must come with the bad.
     Who's to determine what's good and
     what's bad?... You?

          WILLIE
     Why not?

          STANTON
     How?

          WILLIE
     Why, that's easy. Just... just make
     it up as you go along.

More laughter. Willie smiles and goes on.

          WILLIE
     Folks, there's a time to talk and
     there's a time to act. I think the
     time to act is right now. And with
     your support, I not only will win
     but I will do all of the things I
     promised. I need your help. Oh, I
     need it badly. But I'm not going to
     beg for it. In the name of this state
     which we love... in the name of the
     governor in whose house we meet... I

          WILLIE
     Look, I'll give you complete power

     ax to clear the way for you. Is that
     a deal?

The Judge smiles, then puts out his hand.

The crowd erupts into cheers as he steps outside.

     This is not a time for speechmaking.
     I should get on my knees and ask God

Loud cheers. Adam watches Anne. She applauds. Willie looks
down at the crowd and continues his speech.

          WILLIE
     This much I swear to you. These things
     you shall have. I'm going to build a
     hospital. The biggest that money can
     buy... and it will belong to you.
     That any man, woman, or child who is
     sick or in pain can go through those
     doors and know that everything will
     be done for them that man can do. To
     heal sickness. To ease pain. Free.
     Not as a charity, but as a right.
     And it is your right that every child
     shall have a complete education.
     That any man who produces anything
     can take it to market without paying
     toll. And no poor man's land or farm
     can be taxed or taken away from him.
     And it is the right of the people

The door to Willie's office bursts open and Willie dashes
out.

          WILLIE
     All right, come on, both of you.
     Let's go, hurry it up.

They go out through the reception room, pick up Sugar Boy,
and head down the corridor.

          WILLIE
     Come on. Pillsbury put his hand in
     the pork barrel and got caught. You
     know, I never did trust that guy.

Some newsmen are waiting on the top landing.

          NEWSMEN
     Have you heard about Pillsbury? What
     do you intend to do about Pillsbury?
     How about it, Governor?

Willie pushes by them.

          WILLIE
     Later, boys, later.
          (to Jack)
     Say, Jack, go back and get the Judge.
     Let's get him over to my hotel just
     as soon as you can.

They all hurry after Willie as he rushes down the stairs.

Interior: Lobby State Capitol, Day

Anne is about to go up the stairs when she meets Willie and
the others on the way down.

          ANNE
          (to Willie)
     I waited for you.
          (she sees Sadie)
     Hello.
          (back to Willie)
     You promised we could... uh... discuss
     my charity project... Children's
     home?

          WILLIE
     Well, I'm very sorry. Something very
     important came up. You'll call me
     later, won't you?

          ANNE
     Yes, certainly.

          SADIE
     We're late.

Anne watches as they cross the lobby and exit.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Stark's Hotel Suite, Night

Close shot of Willie, seated, with his feet propped up on a
table. Pillsbury stands before him. Jack, Sadie, Duffy, and
Sugar Boy are also in the room.

          WILLIE
     Look at you, Pillsbury. Fifty years
     old, gut-sprung, teeth gone, never
     had a dime. If the Almighty had
     intended for you to be rich he'd
     have taken care of that a long time
     ago. The idea of you being rich...
     that's plain blasphemy. Ain't that a
     fact?

Pillsbury doesn't answer.

          WILLIE
     Answer me!

          PILLSBURY
     Yes.

          WILLIE
     Louder, man. Don't mumble. Speak up.
     Say it's a fact, a blasphemous fact.

          PILLSBURY
     It's a fact, a blasphemous fact.

Sugar Boy laughs loudly. The phone rings and Sadie picks it
up.

          SADIE
     Yeah?... Oh, I see.
          (hangs up)
     Dumond can't come. He says his wife
     is sick.

          WILLIE
     I don't care if she's dying. Sugar,
     get the car. Get him and bring him
     over here.

Sugar Boy exists. Willie turns back to Pillsbury.

          WILLIE
     Now, you know what you're supposed
     to do, don't you, Pillsbury? You're
     supposed to stay poor and take orders.
     Oh, there'll be some sweetening for
     you from time to time... but Duffy'll
     take care of that. Don't you go
     setting yourself up on your own again,
     do you understand that?

          PILLSBURY
     Yes.

          WILLIE
     Louder, man. And say, I understand
     that.

          PILLSBURY
     I understand that.

          WILLIE
     Give him a pen and some paper, Sadie.

There is a knock on the door.

          WILLIE
     See who that is, Duffy.

Judge Stanton enters.

          WILLIE
     Oh, hello, Judge. Sit down. I'll be
     with you in just a couple of seconds.
          (back to Pillsbury)
     Now write what I tell you to write...
     Dear Governor Stark. I wish to resign
     as auditor due to ill health, to
     take effect as soon as you can relieve
     me. Respectfully yours.
          (after a pause)
     Did you sign it?

          PILLSBURY
     No.

          WILLIE
          (roaring)
     Well, sign it! Don't put any date on
     it. I can fill that in when I need
     it.

Pillsbury signs the paper.

          WILLIE
     Now bring it to me.

Pillsbury moves slowly, so Sadie yanks the paper out of his
hand and passes it to Willie.

          WILLIE
     Now get out.

Pillsbury slinks out of the room.

          JUDGE
     The papers have the story.

          WILLIE
     Yeah, I know.

          JUDGE
     They're talking about impeachment
     proceedings.

          WILLIE
          (rising)
     Against who?

          JUDGE
     This time, Pillsbury.

          WILLIE
     I got that "this time," Judge.

          JUDGE
     How true is it?

          WILLIE
     It's too true.

The phone rings.

          SADIE
     Yes?
          (hands phone to Willie)
     This is it, Willie. Jeff Hopkins on
     the wire.

Willie takes the phone, but puts his hand over the mouthpiece
so that he can speak to Jack.

          WILLIE
     What have we got on Hopkins, Jack?
          (as Jack riffles
          through the black
          book)
     Hello, Jeff. About that Pillsbury
     business...
          (reads from black
          book Jack holds out
          for him)
     Here's what I want you to do when it
     comes up in the legislature. Now,
     wait a minute, wait a minute. You
     listen to me.
          (still reading from
          book)
     You got a mortgage coming due on
     that place of yours in about five
     weeks, haven't you? You'd like to
     get it renewed, wouldn't you?
          (pause)
     All right, Tiny'll talk to you in
     the morning.

He grins and hangs up the phone.

          WILLIE
     Get going, Tiny.

Duffy leaves.

          JUDGE
     You haven't answered my question.
     Why are you saving Pillsbury's hide?

          WILLIE
     I'm not a bit interested in
     Pillsbury's hide. It's something
     much more important than that. If
     the McMurphy boys get the notion
     they can get away with this, there's
     no telling where they'll stop.

          JUDGE
          (quietly)
     Or where you will... Pillsbury is
     guilty. As attorney general of this
     state, it's my job to prosecute.

          WILLIE
     Judge, you talk like Pillsbury was...
     was human. He isn't. He's a thing.
     You don't prosecute an adding machine
     if the spring goes busted and makes
     a mistake. You fix it. Well, I fixed
     him. I'm not a bit interested in
     Pillsbury. It's something much bigger
     than that.

          JUDGE
          (getting up)
     Yes, it is.

          JACK
     He's right, Judge. Can't you see
     that he's right?

          JUDGE
     He's right because you want him to
     be right. Because you're afraid to
     admit you've made a mistake. Do it
     now before it's too late.
          (to Willie)
     I'm offering my resignation as
     attorney general. You'll have it in
     writing by messenger in the morning...
     dated.

          WILLIE
          (softly)
     It took you a long time to make up
     your mind, Judge. A long time. What
     made you take such a long time?

          JUDGE
     I wasn't sure.

          WILLIE
     And now you are?

The Judge nods.

          WILLIE
     I'll tell you what you are. You're
     scared. You sat in that big easy
     chair of yours for thirty years and
     played at being a judge. Then all of
     a sudden I came along and put a bat
     in your hand, and I said, go ahead,
     Judge, start swinging. And you did.
     And you had a wonderful time. But
     now you're scared. You don't want to
     get your hands dirty. You want to
     pick up the marbles... but you don't
     want to get your hands dirty. Look
     at my whole program, Judge. How do
     you think I put that across?

          JUDGE
     I knew how, but I never knew why.

He starts to leave.

          WILLIE
     You're not by any chance thinking of
     going over to McMurphy's boys, are
     you?

          JUDGE
     I'm through with politics.

          WILLIE
     I'm happy to hear that.
          (extends his hand)
     No hard feelings.

          JUDGE
          (ignores the hand)
     Goodbye, Governor.
          (to Jack)
     Are you coming with me, Jack?

Jack turns away.

          JUDGE
     You're making a mistake.

He goes. Willie closes the door behind him.

          WILLIE
     Do you think he means it when he
     says he's through with politics,
     Sadie?

          SADIE
     No. No, I don't.

          WILLIE
     What about you, Jack?

          JACK
     I've known the Judge all my life.
     He's always meant everything he's
     said.

          WILLIE
     All right. All right. Take it easy.
     I'll take your word for it.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Willie's Hotel, Night

Willie's car draws up to the curb. Sugar Boy hops out to
open the door for Willie.

Sadie is watching him from a window upstairs in the hotel.
Anne is in the back seat; Willie leans down to talk to her.

          WILLIE
     Sugar, take Miss Stanton home.
          (to Anne)
     When am I going to see you again?

She doesn't answer.

          WILLIE
     What's the matter, Anne?

          ANNE
     Please take me home now, Sugar Boy.

          WILLIE
     You've got to understand me.

          ANNE
          (turns away)
     I understand you. It's myself I don't
     understand.

          WILLIE
     Do you think I like sneaking around
     corners any more than you do? But
     right now, with the Pillsbury business
     and with your uncle quitting... If I
     got a divorce...

          ANNE
     Maybe we'd better stop seeing each
     other.

          WILLIE
     No. No, we won't stop seeing each
     other, will we?

          ANNE
          (slowly)
     No.

          WILLIE
     Because you believe in what I tell
     you.

          ANNE
          (puts her hand on his)
     Because I believe what you tell me.

Sadie approaches.

          SADIE
     Good evening, Governor Stark.
          (looks at Anne, but
          talks to Willie)
     I thought you might like to know
     that Judge Stanton kept his promise.
          (directly to Willie)
     He gave the story to every paper in
     town.

          WILLIE
     Sugar, meet me at the hotel as soon
     as you can.

NEWSPAPER HEADLINE

ATTORNEY GENERAL RESIGNS:
STANTON ACCUSES STARK OF
QUASHING PILLSBURY GRAFT

Interior: State Legislature Assembly Room, Day

Duffy stands in the forground, looking in on the uproar and
confusion of the assembly.

          SENATOR
     These are serious charges that Judge
     Stanton has given to the press. This
     legislature is entitled to a complete
     and full report on the Pillsbury
     affair. Let the truth be known.

          2ND SENATOR
     Let it come out.

          3RD SENATOR
     I move that we adjourn.

          4TH SENATOR
     I second the motion.

          CHAIRMAN
     All those in favor, say aye... Motion
     carried. The house is adjourned.

As Duffy turns and walks away, other senators rise up in
their seats in protest.

MONTAGE: PILLSBURY SCANDAL

Sign on building reads: CITIZENS COMMITTEE MEETING, Subject:
PILLSBURY SCANDAL, 8 P.M. Tonight -- Town Hall.

A man pastes a strip across the sign: CANCELED.

A man is making a speech to a small group of people.

          MAN
     If you let Willie Stark get away
     with the Pillsbury graft, there's no
     telling...

Thugs break up the meeting. The speaker is beaten up. Jack
Burden turns through the pages of the little black book.

Interior: Stark's Hotel Suite, Day

Willie is lying on the bed. Jack is seated. Sadie and Sugar
Boy stand nearby.

          JACK
     But we beat the Pillsbury rap...
     It's over.

          WILLIE
     These things are never over. I'll
     tell you what I want you to do, Jack.
     I want you to start a new page in
     that black book of yours... under
     then name of Judge Stanton.

          JACK
     You're crazy. There's nothing on the
     Judge.

          SADIE
     Why? Because his name is Stanton?

          WILLIE
     Ssshhh, easy.

          JACK
     What if I won't do it?

          WILLIE
     You know, some of this has rubbed
     off on you.

          JACK
     What are you going to do? Have me
     shot?

          WILLIE
     No... no... but I'll have to get
     myself a new boy.

          JACK
     I tell you there's nothing on the
     Judge.

          WILLIE
     Jack, there's something on everybody.
     Man is conceived in sin and born in
     corruption.

          JACK
     It's a waste of time.

          WILLIE
     What's the matter, Jack? Are you
     afraid you might find something out?

Jack stares at him.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Burden's Landing Ferry, Night

Jack's car is seen coming across on the ferry.

          JACK
          (voice over)
     I kept saying to myself that Willie
     was wrong about the Judge. If there
     was anything left at Burden's Landing,
     it was honor. I had to believe that.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Stanton Living Room, Night

Jack and Anne stand together in the living room.

          JACK
     Anne, I want to ask you a question.
     Was the Judge ever broke? Really
     broke?

          ANNE
     Why do you want to know?

          JACK
     I don't want to know, but I've got
     to.

          ANNE
     Did he tell you --

          JACK
     Did who tell me?

          ANNE
     I don't know. I... how should I know
     if the Judge was ever broke?

She walks away from him. Adam enters, carrying bundles of
food and two wine bottles.

          STANTON
     Hello... Come on, Anne, take this
     food and start cooking. I'm hungry.

Anne takes the grocery bundles. Jack grabs the wine.

          JACK
     Me, I'm on the thirsty side. Bring
     some glasses, Anne, quick.

He joins Adam, who has opened the piano.

          STANTON
          (laughing)
     It's been a long time since I played
     this thing. What do you say we wake
     up the ghosts, huh?

          JACK
          (calling to Anne)
     Another glass, Anne, for a ghost.

          STANTON
          (starting to play)
     Remember the last time I played this?
     You and Anne were dancing?

Anne returns with three glasses. Jack grabs her around the
waist and whirls her around.

          JACK
     Shall we dance?

          ANNE
     Let's... let's have a drink first.

Adam starts to pour the wine.

          JACK
     No, no... keep playing. Anne and I
     want to hear this, don't we, Anne?
          (Jack pours the wine)
     Adam... ghost... and me.

          STANTON
     What shall we drink to?

          JACK
     To the ghost?... To Adam, to the
     director of the new medical center.

          STANTON
          (bangs the piano keys)
     Don't you ever stop working for him?

          ANNE
     Adam!

          STANTON
     I came up here to get away...

          JACK
     I'm sorry, Adam.

          ANNE
     Well, I'm not. What's wrong with
     being the director of the new medical
     center?

          STANTON
     Nothing, except that I'm not going
     to take it.

          JACK
     Why? Because your uncle resigned?

          STANTON
     That's partly it. There are other
     things.

          ANNE
     What other things?

          STANTON
          (looks at her)
     You too?

          ANNE
     Yes, me too.

          JACK
     Anne, if Adam doesn't want to discuss
     it, let's not.

          STANTON
     All right, let's discuss it.

          ANNE
     But calmly.

          STANTON
     Calmly. Go ahead, Jack. Why do you
     think he wants me?

          JACK
     Because you're the best man for the
     job.

          STANTON
     It could have nothing to do with my
     name being Stanton?

          JACK
     It could have. Let's grant that.

          STANTON
     That's your answer.

          JACK
     No, it's not. If that were the only
     answer I wouldn't be with him any
     more. There's another side of it.
     I've learned something from him. You
     can't make an omelet without cracking
     eggs.

          STANTON
     Or heads.

          ANNE
     But at least a hospital will be built,
     and the sick will be cared for.

          STANTON
     At what price?

          JACK
     At any price.

          STANTON
     Do you really believe that, Jack?

          JACK
     I really believe that Stark wants to
     do good. You do too. It's a matter
     of method. Many times out of evil
     comes good. Well, pain is an evil.
     As a doctor you should know that.

          STANTON
     Pain is an evil; it is not evil. It
     is not evil in itself. Stark is evil.

          JACK
     The people of the state don't think
     so.

          STANTON
     How would they know? The first thing
     he did was to take over the newspapers
     and the radio stations. Why be so
     afraid of criticism? If Stark is
     interested in doing good, he should
     also be interested in the truth. I
     don't see how you can separate the
     two. No, Stark is not for me.

          ANNE
          (upset)
     No, Stark is not for you. Well, what
     is for you? Pride. Pride, that's all
     it is... foolish, stupid pride. All
     you've ever talked about is what you
     could do if... if somebody would
     tear down and build. All right, all
     right, somebody has, and he's given
     it to you. But he's not for you. No,
     he's not for you.

She throws down her glass and runs crying from the room.
Adam goes after her.

          STANTON
     Anne... Anne...

Interior: Stanton Hallway and Stairs, Night

Anne runs upstairs and Adam follows. The Judge comes out of
his room to see what has happened, sees Jack standing at the
foot of the stairs, hesitates a moment, and then goes back
to his room without speaking.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: County Recorder Room, Day

Jack enters and speaks to a clerk, who then directs him to
one of the files. He starts to look through the files marked
MORTGAGES DEFAULTED.

          JACK
          (voice over)
     Will I find anything, Judge? Will I?
     I didn't find it all at once. It
     takes a long time to go through old
     courthouse records and musty deeds...
     a very long time. But it wasn't too
     hard for me. I was well trained in

He pulls out a file.

          JACK
          (voice over)
     I found what I didn't want to find.

He takes the file back to the clerk.

          JACK

Interior: Jack's Hotel Bedroom, Day

Jack is lying on his bed, looking over the documents that
relate to the Judge. He looks haggard and worried. There is
a knock on the door. Jack doesn't answer; the knock is
repeated.

          JACK
     Who is it?

          SADIE'S VOICE
     It's me, Sadie Burke.

          JACK
     Wait a minute.

He hides the documents under his pillow.

          JACK
     All right, come in.

She comes in, sniffs the air.

          SADIE
     Phew! Awful lot of smoke. Awful lot
     of whisky. You sober?

          JACK
     Stone.

          SADIE
     I'll have one with you.
          (starts tidying up
          the room)
     What are you hiding out for?

          JACK
     I'm not. I've been sleeping.

          SADIE
     For four days? You've been back in
     town for four days.

          JACK
     Willie knows everything.

          SADIE
     Willie's worried about his boy.

          JACK
     Willie's boy is worried about Willie's
     boy.

          SADIE
     Well, why don't you put something on
     the phonograph -- a low-down, mean
     blues. Play it over and over again
     until you're sick of it. Then crack
     it and go back to work.
          (sits down)
     I do it all the time.

          JACK
     That's not my problem.

          SADIE
     No, it isn't your problem.
          (gets up again)
     I'll wait for you if you want to
     powder your nose.

Jack goes into the bathroom.

          JACK
     I'll be with you in a minute.

Sadie wanders around. She goes to the dresser, upon which is
a photograph of Anne Stanton. She picks up the picture and
places it so she can see it in the mirror and compare it
with her own reflection.

          SADIE
     Hmmm. Yeah, I can see it. I've got
     to look in the mirror to be able to
     see it. Soft, white skin... not like
     mine.
          (runs her hand across
          her cheeks)
     I had smallpox when I was a kid.
     Where I lived it seemed nearly all
     the kids had smallpox...

Jack watches her through the open bathroom door.

          SADIE
     It leaves your face hard. Then she's
     got poise. Look at the way she holds
     her head... at just the right angle.
     That takes training. That takes years
     of training...

Jack, towel in hand, comes out and stands behind her. He
looks at her in the mirror, puzzled.

          SADIE
     I see what Willie sees. Willie's got
     big ideas, Jack.

          JACK
     What do you mean?

          SADIE
     A girl like that could be a governor's
     wife. Or even a President's.

          JACK
     What are you talking about?

          SADIE
     He ditched Lucy, he ditched me, and
     he'll ditch you.

          JACK
          (shaking her)
     Answer me!

          SADIE
     He'll ditch everybody in the whole
     world because that's what Willie
     wants. Nobody in the world but him.

          JACK
     What are you talking about?

          SADIE
     You and your high-tone friends. What
     do they know? What do they know about
     anything? Why did you have to mix
     her in?

          JACK
     You're crazy, Sadie. You're out of
     your mind.

          SADIE
     Am I? Well, why don't you go down
     and ask her. Or ask him. Ask Willie.

          JACK
     Shut up!

          SADIE
     Go ahead, ask him.

          JACK
     Shut up!

          SADIE
     Ask him!

He slaps her hard.

          SADIE
     Ow-oo... oh... oh.

She starts to laugh.

Exterior: Football Field, Day

A football team is practicing on the field. Willie watches
from the bench. A player kicks the ball and Tom misses it.
Jack walks over to Willie.

          JACK
     He's off today.

          WILLIE
     It's only practice. He'll be all
     right tomorrow... You been gone a
     long time, Jack.

          JACK
     Yeah. I figured if you needed me
     you'd yell.

          WILLIE
     Why'd you lay around the hotel?

          JACK
     Thinking.

          WILLIE
     About what?

          JACK
     Things.

          WILLIE
     What did you find on the Judge?

          JACK
     Nothing.

          WILLIE
     You sure you didn't find anything on
     the Judge?

          JACK
     Yeah, I'm sure.

          WILLIE
     You're going to keep trying, aren't
     you?

          JACK
     If you want me to.

          WILLIE
     I want you to. There's something
     else I want you to do too.

          JACK
     What? Bucket boy? Towel slinger?
     What?

          WILLIE
          (looks at him closely)
     What's eating you, Jack?

          JACK
          (avoiding it)
     What else do you want me to do?

          WILLIE
     If you've got something on your mind,
     boy, spit it out. We've been together
     too long to play games.

          JACK
     What do you want me to do?

          WILLIE
     I hear your pal Adam Stanton turned
     down the job as director of the
     hospital. That's bad. Especially at
     a time like this.

          JACK
     Oh? How did you hear it?

          WILLIE
     Why? What difference does it make?

          JACK
     I just wanted to know.

          WILLIE
     I heard it around.

          JACK
          (insistent)
     How did you hear he turned it down,
     Willie?

Out on the field the boys have stopped playing and are huddled
around the coach.

          WILLIE
     I'll be right back, Jack. I want to
     see what's happening here.

He goes over to the group on the field. The coach is talking
to Tom.

          COACH
     You going to practice the way I tell
     you.

          TOM
     I'm going to do it the way I want to
     do it.

Willie comes up to them.

          WILLIE
     Tom, come here. What's going on here?

          COACH
     I don't care if he is your son,
     Governor... No special rules for
     him.

          TOM
     It doesn't make any difference to me
     either way... whether I play or not.

          WILLIE
     Well, it does to me.
          (to coach)
     What do you want him to do?

          COACH
     To behave himself. Like the rest of
     the boys. Four times this season
     he's broken training. He comes on
     the practice field half potted.

          WILLIE
     Tom, you're going to have to obey
     the rules. Do you hear me? You're
     going to obey the rules.

          TOM
     I put 'em across, don't I? Every
     Saturday I put 'em across and I can
     still do it, drunk or sober. That's
     all you want, isn't it... for me to
     put 'em across so you can big-shot
     it around? Isn't that all you want?

He walks away.

          WILLIE
     Tom!
          (to coach)
     He's a little high-strung.

The car goes across a bridge, weaving. Two motorcycle cops

Tom's car swerves out of control and crashes through a fence.

The two motorcycle cops ride out to the field to the wrecked

     Willie, Mr. Hale's here to see you.

Willie comes to meet them, a drink in his hand. He is
obviously drunk.

          WILLIE
     Go on upstairs, Lucy. I have some
     business I want to talk over with
     Mr. Hale.

          HALE

     Get me another drink, Sugar.

     Wait a minute, Lucy. He's asleep.

     No thanks.

     Accidents will happen, you know.

          HALE
     Accidents? Your boy was drunk.

          WILLIE
     I saw the police report. There...
     there was nothing about drunkenness
     on the police report.

          HALE
     Whose police and whose report? I say
     the boy was drunk. And I know it.

Tom comes down the stairs, with Lucy.

          HALE
          (to Tom)
     Right here before your father... I

     I don't want you to take care of
     anything.

Tom looks ill; he presses his hand to his forehead.

          WILLIE
     Tom, go on upstairs and get some
     rest, boy. Go on... go on... go on.

Tom walks slowly toward the stairs.

          WILLIE

     wouldn't care for a drink, Mr. Hale?

Hale sits down, shakes his head.

          WILLIE
     What business are you in?

          HALE
     Trucking business.

          WILLIE
     Trucking business. Trucks run on
     state roads. If a man in the trucking
     business had a contract with the
     state, a big one, that would be pretty
     good, wouldn't it?

     happen.

Jack is silent.

     You're trying to bribe me, aren't
     you?

     No, no. No, I'm not trying to bribe
     you. I'm... I'm only talking things
     over with you, that's all.

     You're pretty good at talking. I
     remember when you first started
     talking. A place called Upton. You
     did a lot of talking then and the
     things you said made sense, to me

He walks out of the room.

Sugar goes, leaving just Jack and Willie. Willie, very drunk,
tries to get up but falls against the piano.

He staggers up the long stairway. Halfway up he tumbles,
groaning. Jack helps him to his feet.

          JACK
     There isn't a plane flying.

          WILLIE
     They gotta fly. This is my son. He's
     got to live.

Adam Stanton enters.

          STANTON
     I just got a call from Dr. Birnham.
     The earliest he can possibly get
     here will be tomorrow morning.

          WILLIE
     Isn't there anybody else we can get?

          JACK
     I still think Dr. Stanton should
     operate.

          STANTON
     That's up to Governor Stark. He wanted
     another doctor... a specialist. I
     sent for one.

          WILLIE
     How bad is it really, doctor?

          STANTON
     He's unconscious... and paralyzed.

Lucy slumps in her chair.

          WILLIE
     Has he got a chance?

          STANTON
     To live? Yes.

          WILLIE
     What do you mean?

          STANTON
     Even if the operation's successful --
     that is, if he lives -- I think he'll
     be paralyzed for life.

          WILLIE
     You'll do everything you can, won't
     you? Anything between you and me..
     that won't count, will it? It doesn't
     have to. Look, doc, anything you
     want in the world you just ask for
     it and you got it. Go on, doc... ask
     for it.

          STANTON
          (coldly)
     There are some things, Governor Stark,
     that even you can't buy. Do you want
     me to operate, or don't you?

          LUCY
     Yes... I want you to operate.
          (stands up)
     Please, may I see Tom now?

          STANTON
     Yes.

They leave together.

          WILLIE
          (to Jack)
     How much does the doc know?

          JACK
     About what?

          WILLIE
     Oh, you know what I'm talking about.

          JACK
     About what?

          WILLIE
     About Anne and me.

          JACK
          (after a pause)
     He doesn't know a thing... not a

Jack turns and walks away.

          ANNE
     Yes.

     Oh, thank God. How is --

     Willie?

          ANNE
     He blames himself, doesn't he?

     He'll find someone else to blame in

They walk together, along the waterfront.

     Anne... Anne, why did you do it?

          ANNE
     He wasn't like anybody I ever knew
     before.

          JACK
     You mean he wasn't like me.

          ANNE
     He wasn't like anybody I ever knew
     before. I love him, I guess. I guess
     that's the reason.

          JACK
     Everybody loves him.

          ANNE
     He wants to marry me.

          JACK
     Are you going to?

          ANNE
     Not now. It would hurt him. A divorce
     would hurt his career.

          JACK
     His career!

          ANNE
     Jack... Jack, what are you going to
     do? You can't leave him now. He needs
     you now more than he ever did before.

          JACK
     What Willie needs, Willie's got.

          ANNE
     You don't know him. You've known him
     all these years and you don't really
     know him at all.

          JACK
     What about Adam?

          ANNE
     Adam?

          JACK
     Well, you don't have to worry about
     him. If Adam finds out it'll be easy
     to prove a Stanton is no different
     than anybody else.
          (gives her the papers
          on the Judge)
     Just show him these. Willie was
     right... a man is conceived in sin
     and born in corruption. Even Judge
     Stanton. Show them to him, Anne.
     Change the picture of the world that
     Adam has in his head, just like our
     picture of it has been changed.

He grips her by the shoulders.

          JACK
     Wipe out everything he's ever believed
     in. It'll be good for him. There's
     no God but Willie Stark. I'm his
     prophet and you're his...
          (pushes her aside,
          then feels sorry and
          walks after her)
     Oh, Anne... Anne, I'm sorry. I didn't
     mean... Anne!

A policeman comes over.

          POLICEMAN
     What's going on here?

Jack catches up to Anne. He takes her arm and they start to
walk back together.

          JACK
     It's all right, officer... we both
     work for Willie Stark.

          WILLIE
     Why?

          STANTON
     My reasons are my own. Why are you
     building a hospital?

          WILLIE
     To do some good for the people of

          STANTON
     And get some votes.

     Oh, there are lots of ways to get

          STANTON
     Yes, I know... I won't stand for any

          NARRATOR'S VOICE
     And so the eyes of the entire nation
     are now focused upon Governor Willie
     Stark, an amazing phenomenon on the
     American political scene. The whole
     state is filled with his
     accomplishments -- each of them, of
     course, bearing his personal
     signature, to make sure that no one
     will ever forget who gave them to
     the state.

          NARRATOR'S VOICE
     This is the way the roads used to
     be. But there are those who claim
     that they were adequate for the
     people's needs, that you don't need
     a four- or six-lane highway for a
     horse and buggy.

Shot of horse pulling a plow.

The empty, untraversed STARK HIGHWAY.

          NARRATOR'S VOICE
     When Stark boasts of his great school
     system, his critics say: you can't
     go to school and work in the fields
     at the same time. And they question
     the benefit of these projects,
     charging that the need and the poverty
     of the people is as great as before.

Shot of large school. Camera cuts to men working in the field,

     supported him.

Willie talking to the farmers.

          NARRATOR'S VOICE

     For those who say that Willie Stark
     is a man of destiny, there are others
     who claim that he is a man of evil,
     a man who cares neither for the people
     nor the state, but only for his own
     personal power and ambition.

Willie making a speech to a huge crowd of cheering people.

Willie inspecting his police force.

Willie pounding the desk in the state legislature.

          NARRATOR'S VOICE

     Just how far, only time will tell.
     Meanwhile, he is here...

Big close-up of Willie as he delivers a speech.

The picture goes off and the lights in the room come on.

They start to leave. Willie stops for a moment.

     Oh, there's one thing in there I
     didn't like too well. That messiah
     or dictator.

          PRODUCER
     That's our point of view, Governor.
     And that's the way it stands.

There is a silence. Willie's face is hard. Then he grins.

up the steps to greet Lucy.

     Hello, Lucy... How are you making

Tom doesn't answer. Lucy offers her cheek to Willie. Sadie,
Jack, and Sugar Boy wait at the bottom of the steps, along

     It's not him they're after. It's me.

     you got the facts, you got the facts.
     The truth is sufficient... just like
     it says in the Bible.

          JACK
     That's the way it's going to be.

          WILLIE
     All right, boy... I'll trust you.
     Where are you going?

          JACK
          (on his way out)
     I'll be around.

Willie turns to go into his private office.

          SADIE
     Who else do you think he promised,
     Willie?

Willie shrugs.

          SADIE
     You'd be smart... play square with
     him. You're going to need people
     like us around.

          WILLIE
          (as he shuts his door)
     Are you sure?

MONTAGE: THE IMPEACHMENT

Willie's car speeding down a road.

Willie, with Lucy and Tom seated behind him, addressing crowd.

Willie speaking from the back of a train to a railroad station
audience.

          JACK
          (voice over)
     The chips were down, and Willie knew
     it. He was fighting for his life. He
     roared across the state making one
     speech after another. And all of
     them added up to the same thing...
     "It's not me they're after, it's
     you!"

Close-ups of Willie, speaking to the people.

          JACK
          (voice over)
     Willie hollered foul. Willie knew if
     you hollered long enough, hard enough,
     and loud enough, people begin to
     believe you. Just in case they didn't,
     he organized spontaneous
     demonstrations.

Sign on back of a car: FIGHT WITH WILLIE

Crowds carrying signs: WIN WITH WILLIE

Willie talking on the telephone. Sadie listens.

          WILLIE
     Tell the boys to get the hicks out.
     Bring 'em in from the sticks, empty
     the pool halls. Turn 'em out. Turn
     the yokels out.

More men with WIN WITH WILLIE signs. Man directing crowd
from top of bus. Other bus loads of people are seen, all of
them bearing signs.

          JACK
          (voice over)
     In case anyone hollered back, he
     organized spontaneous slugging. Willie
     pulled every trick he ever knew --
     and added a few more.

Crowd looks on as two uniformed police drag a man away.
Willie's car waiting. Two thugs talk things over with a man
on his doorstep.

Willie discussing matters with a man in his office. Two cops
stand with him.

Willie and Jack in the car. Sugar Boy drives. It is night.
Sugar Boy drives fast, and has to swerve to avoid colliding
with a truck.

          JACK
     Hey, Sugar!
          (To Willie)
     You'll never live to be impeached!

          WILLIE
     Boy, I'll live to be President...

Jack and Sugar wait in the car as Willie leans out the car
window to talk to a senator. He offers the man a piece of
paper.

          WILLIE
     I've got fourteen senators to vote
     against impeachment. If I win, you're
     out of politics.

          SENATOR
          (refuses to sign)
     I'll do whatever the Judge says.

As Willie's car stops and they all get out.

          WILLIE
     You sure you don't want me to go in
     with you?

          JACK
     I'm sure.

          WILLIE
     Well, hurry it up, boy. We've got
     places to go.

Jack goes into the house alone.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Judge Stanton's Study, Night

Jack and the Judge are seated opposite each other.

          JACK
     Judge, I beg you, as a favor to
     yourself, to me... call up, release
     your votes.

          JUDGE
     I made a mistake once, Jack... when
     I resigned. It was too easy then,
     just resigning, pulling out. No,
     Jack, I've made my choice. I have
     nothing more to lose.

          JACK
     Judge, you know what Stark is capable
     of. Think it over. I'll leave now.
     I'll come back tomorrow and we'll
     talk about it again. You can give me
     your answer then.

The door opens and Willie and Sugar Boy enter.

          WILLIE
     I can't wait until tomorrow. I'm a
     very impatient man.

          JACK
          (rising)
     I told you not to come in here.

          WILLIE
          (ignoring him)
     Is it true, Judge, that you're behind
     the impeachment proceedings?

          JUDGE
     Yes, it's true.

Willie takes a seat in an easy chair.

          WILLIE
     I wanted to hear you say it with
     your own silver tongue.

          JUDGE
     Well, you've heard it. If that's all
     you came to hear you could have saved
     yourself a trip.

Willie picks up a decanter off the table.

          WILLIE
     Mind if I pour myself a drink? How
     about you, Judge, will you have one?
     You better... You're going to need
     it.

Jack and Judge Stanton remain standing, silently watching
Willie.

          WILLIE
     What'd he say, Jack?

          JACK
     You'll get your answer tomorrow.

          WILLIE
     Are you kidding? Did you show it to
     him, or didn't you?

          JUDGE
     Show me what?

          WILLIE
     That's what I figured. Let's get
     down to cases, Judge. Do you remember
     a man with the name of Littlepaugh?

The Judge shakes his head. He doesn't.

          WILLIE
     Remember the Fortune Electric Company?

          JUDGE
     Of course. I was their counsel for
     over ten years.

          WILLIE
     Remember how you got the job?

          JACK
     How did you find out?

          WILLIE
          (hands the Judge some
          papers)
     Do you remember how you got the job?

The Judge examines the papers.

          WILLIE
     You know, Judge, dirt's a funny thing.
     Some of it rubs off on everybody.
     How did you get the job, Judge?
     Blackmail?

          JUDGE
          (to Jack)
     I swear I never even remembered his
     name. Isn't that remarkable, Jack? I
     never even remembered his name. It's
     all so long ago it's hard for me to
     realize it ever happened.

          WILLIE
     Yeah. But it did.

          JUDGE
     Yes, it did. But it's difficult for
     me to realize it.

          JACK
     For me too, Judge.

          JUDGE
     Thanks for that much.

          WILLIE
     Well, I guess you know what the next
     move is, don't you?

          JUDGE
     Yes, I do. Jack Burden. Willie Stark's
     hatchet man.

          JACK
          (to Willie)
     I asked you... how did you find out?

          JUDGE
     This would never stand at law, not
     for a minute. It happened over twenty-
     five years ago, and you could never
     get any testimony. Everybody is dead.

          WILLIE
     Everybody except you, Judge. You're
     alive. And people think you're a
     certain kind of man. And you just
     couldn't bear for people to think
     otherwise.

          JUDGE
     Ever since then I... I've done my
     duty. I... I'm responsible for many
     good things.
          (looks at the papers
          again)
     But I also did this.

          WILLIE
     Yes, yes, you did.

          JACK
     Judge, I beg of you, call and release
     your votes, for your sake.

          JUDGE
     You have tender sensibilities for a
     hatchet man.
          (goes to the door)
     Good night, gentlemen.

          WILLIE
     How about my answer?

          JUDGE
     You'll have it in the morning.

          WILLIE
     I want it tonight.

          JUDGE
     In the morning. Good night, gentlemen.

There is silence. Then the three men get up to go. The Judge
closes the door behind them.

Interior: Stanton Hallway, Night

As the three men walk to the front door.

          JACK
     How did you find out?

          WILLIE
     We've got a lot to do. It's getting
     late, Jack. Let's get back to town.

          JACK
     You know we're through, don't you?

          WILLIE
     Aw, you don't mean that, boy.

The front door opens, and Adam and Anne come in.

          STANTON
     What are you doing here?

          WILLIE
     It's all right, doc. Just here to
     discuss some politics with the Judge.

          STANTON
     Oh, I see.
          (starts upstairs)
     Well, good night.

          WILLIE
     Good night.

          JACK
          (to Anne)
     Did you give him --

          WILLIE
     Wait a minute, Jack --

          JACK
     Answer me. Did you give --

A shot is fired. They turn and rush into the Judge's study.
They find the Judge face downward in his leather chair. Adam
and Jack kneel beside him. Willie, holding on tightly to
Anne's arm, stands in the doorway. Jack picks up the Judge's
pistol and looks at Adam.

Exterior: Stanton Home, Night

Jack comes out of the house, followed by Anne and Adam.

          STANTON
     Aren't you going back with him?

          JACK
     No.

          STANTON
     Why not? You belong with him. Jack,
     how could you have done it? When
     Anne brought me those papers she
     told me you promised not to tell
     Stark until...

          JACK
     Yeah. I know.
          (walks away)
     Well, I kept my promise.

Adam looks unbelievingly at Anne. She looks away.

     Anne? Anne?

FADE IN:

Interior: Jack's Hotel Room (State Capital), Day

Jack looks out the window. A portable radio is blaring out
the news.

          ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
     From all over the state they're
     streaming in. From the hill country
     and farms, the lumber camps... by
     boat, by train, by horse, and on
     foot. Willie Stark's army.

Through Jack's window we see the street blocked with cars
and people, all headed for the State Capitol Building. Anne
is in the crowd, trying to get across the street. Seeing
Jack in the window, she pushes her way across and enters the
hotel. He slams the window shut and comes back into the room.

          ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
     The state capital is filled with
     rumors, one of which is that Stark
     is planning to seize power by force.
     As commander of the state militia,
     he has --

Jack turns it off. He goes over to his bed and starts putting
clothes into a valise. There is a knock on the door. He
ignores it. Another knock.

          JACK
     Come in. The door's open.

Anne enters.

          ANNE
     Jack...

          JACK
     What do you want?

She starts to cry. He grabs her, pulling her face close to
his.

          JACK
          (bitterly)
     No, I want to see you cry.

He lets her go and she falls to the bed, sobbing.

          JACK
     Stop it!

          ANNE
     I called you. All afternoon I've
     been calling you.

          JACK
     I know. I was here.

          ANNE
     You've got to tell Adam. You've got
     to see him.

          JACK
     Tell him what?

          ANNE
     He knows about me and...

          JACK
     About you and Willie?

          ANNE
          (nods)
     I tried to explain to him. I... I
     tried to explain to him that it wasn't
     the way he thought it was.

          JACK
     How was it, Anne? You tell me.

          ANNE
     He hit me, Jack. My own brother...
     he hit me.

          JACK
     Your brother is an old-fashioned
     man. He believes in his sister's
     honor. Me, I'm a modern man.
          (slams clothes into
          the valise)
     The twentieth-century type. I run.

          ANNE
          (rises)
     I'm frightened, Jack.

          JACK
     For who? Your brother, or Willie?

          ANNE
          (quietly)
     We're through.

          JACK
     Who's through with who?

          ANNE
     He called me this afternoon. He's
     going back to Lucy. He said it was
     better that way.

          JACK
     Better for who? Him.

          ANNE
     Both of us.

          JACK
     Did he tell you that too when he
     asked you to betray the Judge? At
     least I walked out on him.

          ANNE
     Oh Jack... help me, please, please.
     Adam's all I've got left now. Oh,
     Jack, if you ever loved me...

     If I ever loved you.
          (pause)

Adam enters, looks at the sign, and walks on.

Exterior: Street Near Capitol Building, Day

Crowds of people headed toward the building, some with WIN
WITH WILLIE signs. A marching band plays music for them.

Exterior: Capitol Building, Day

Crowd waiting outside the building. Mounted policemen keep
them in line. From a large platform, loaded with people,
comes the chant "We want Willie, we want Willie." Jack pushes
his way through the people and speaks to a policeman standing
guard on the Capitol steps.

          COP
     Where do you think you're going?

     Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize

     Do you know who Dr. Stanton is?

          COP
     Yes sir.

          JACK
     Did he try to come through here today?

          COP
     Haven't seen him, sir.

          JACK
     Well, can you check the other
     entrances?

          2ND COP
     There's no other entrances today.
     The other entrances are blocked off.
     Orders are to take no chances.

     If you care to come inside and wait,
     Mr. Burden, we can find you a seat.

     No, thanks. I'll wait out here. If
     Dr. Stanton shows up, let me know.
     Pass the word along to the boys,
     will you?

          COP
     Yes sir.

Jack turns and looks at the large crowd. A voice from a public
address loudspeaker begins to yell out commands to the crowd.

          LOUDSPEAKER
     All right now. Everybody... that
     means everybody... let's let Willie
     know we're here! All together: WE
     WANT WILLIE. WE WANT WILLIE.

The chant is picked up enthusiastically by the crowd.

Interior: State Legislature, Day

The speaker is trying to speak over the clamor of the
chanting.

          SPEAKER
     We will first proceed to take the
     judgment of the senate on the question
     of the impeachment of the governor.

          SENATOR
          (rising)
     Mr. Speaker, this is a farce to ask
     us to vote in the face of the kind
     of intimidation and pressure that
     has been exerted here in the past
     few weeks. Even that crowd outside,
     yelling on cue, is part of that
     pressure.

          CROWD NOISE
     We want Willie. We want Willie.

Willie gets up, and goes to the window.

Exterior: State Capitol, Day

The crowd, with Jack in the foreground. The crowd suddenly
goes wild as they see Willie appear at the window. In the
growing darkness he seems only a shadowy figure as he raises
his hands to wave to the crowd.

We see various shots of people straining to get a little
closer to the steps in order to see him better. Willie then
turns and goes back into the room.

     Attention, please. Attention, please.
     This is a special announcement from
     Willie Stark to you people out there.
     He doesn't want any one of you to

The camera moves over the faces of the people listening.

          ANNOUNCER
     He wants you to stay in front of
     this state Capitol until the fight
     is over. If you want Willie Stark to
     win, stay where you are.

They cheer. Camera picks up Jack watching the crowd's
reaction, then up to a plaque over the entrance to the Capitol
Building. It reads THE PEOPLE'S WILL IS THE LAW OF THIS STATE --
GOVERNOR STARK.

          ANNOUNCER
     Do you hear me... stay where you

Exterior: State Capitol, Night

Newsmen, photographers stand about, bored. The crowd, every
bit as large, is quiet but expectant. Everyone holds still
as the announcer's voice is heard again.

          ANNOUNCER
     Attention, please. Attention, please.
     The balloting on the impeachment
     proceedings against Governor Stark
     has just ended. This is the result:
     Willie Stark has won.

The crowd explodes. People break through the police barriers.
Mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot. Camera
picks up Anne in the crowd, trying to push through.

Jack stands on the steps of the Capitol, watching it all.
Suddenly Willie appears at the top of the steps, followed by
Sugar Boy. Sadie, Duffy, Pillsbury follow close behind. Willie
grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed
crowd.

          WILLIE
     They tried to ruin me. But they are
     ruined. They tried to ruin me because
     they did not like what I have done.
     Do you like what I have done?

Loud applause, and cries of "yes."

          WILLIE
     Remember, it's not I who have won,
     but you. Your will is my strength,
     and your need is my justice, and I
     shall live in your right and your
     will. And if any man tries to stop
     me from fulfilling that right and
     that will, I'll break him. I'll break
     him with my bare hands. For I have
     the strength of many.

Having finished, he waves at them all. Then he notices Jack
and comes down the steps to greet him.

          WILLIE
     Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're
     here. I knew you'd come back.

He walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders.
They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees
someone. He smiles and puts out his hand.

          WILLIE
     Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see
     you.

Adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. Before
Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him.
Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol
and fires at Adam. Three policemen with tommy guns open fire,
shooting into Adam's already fallen body. Then they turn and
point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie,
forcing them back.

          COP
     Stand back, everybody. Stand back.

Sugar Boy kneels beside Willie. Sadie stands against a pillar,
looking down on him.

          SUGAR BOY
          (nearly crying)
     D-does it hurt m-much, boss? D-d-
     does it hurt much?

Jack looks up to see Anne struggling through the screaming
mob to get to Adam. She looks at Adam for a moment, then
turns away.

          JACK
     Anne, Anne... Where are you going?

She doesn't answer, only walks away. He runs after her and
catches hold of her arm.

          ANNE
     I don't know. Leave me alone.

          JACK
     To do what?

          ANNE
     I don't care.

          JACK
     No, that's too easy.

          ANNE
     I don't know, I don't know, I don't
     know.

          JACK
     I do.

          ANNE
     Leave me alone, please.

          JACK
     No, no more.

          ANNE
     He's dead.

          JACK
     We're alive.

          ANNE
     My brother's dead.

          JACK
     We've got to go on living.

          ANNE
     How?

          JACK
     So that Adam's death has meaning, so
     that it wasn't wasted. Anne, our
     life has to give his death meaning.
     Don't you see that? Look at those
     people...

He turns her around so that she can see the crowds still
struggling to get a look at Willie.

          JACK
     Look at them! They still believe in
     him. And we've got to make them see
     Willie the way Adam saw him, or
     there's no meaning in anything...
     anything.

A policeman approaches.

          POLICEMAN
     Mr. Burden... the governor's asking
     for you. You better hurry. He's going
     fast.

          JACK
          (to Anne)
     Will you wait here?

No reply.

          JACK
     Will you wait here?

She nods her head slowly. Jack walks through the building to
the pillar against which Willie has been propped. Sugar Boy
is still beside him. He stands behind Sadie and Duffy, looking
down at Willie.

          WILLIE
     It could have been the whole world,
     Willie Stark. The whole world...
     Willie Stark. Why did he do it to
     me... Willie Stark? Why?

His head droops to the side and he dies.

FADE OUT
THE END
