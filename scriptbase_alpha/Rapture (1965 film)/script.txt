INTERIOR: TELEPHONE COMPANY INFORMATION OFFICE. DAY. 
We move slowly through a crowded office. A hundred 
information operators in booths. SHARON works at a computer 
terminal. Close on her. She's on a kind of autopilot as she 
does her job, and the people talking to her hear so little 
personality that her humanity barely registers. That she 
might have a beauty that is becoming hollow, or a private 
life that would astonish them -- this, no one thinks about. 
She watches the clock. Five minutes to six.

               SHARON 
     Please hold for the number. 
     Operator 134, what city please? 
          (Pause, as she 
          types in the name.) 
     Is that a business or residence? 
     Please hold for the number. 
          (Pause.) 
     Operator 134. What city please? 
          (Pause.) 
     How do you spell that?

The clock. Two minutes to six.

               SHARON 
          (pause)
     Please hold for the number. 
          (Pause.) 
     Operator 134. What city please? 
          (Pause.) 
     Is that a business or residence? 
          (Pause.) 
     Please hold for the number. 

Pause. Behind her, a woman, another OPERATOR, waits for the 
chair. 

Six o'clock.

SHARON gets up. The other OPERATOR takes her place and takes 
her headphones. SHARON starts to stand as she begins the 
next sentence. Pause.

               SHARON 
     Operator 134. Is that a business or
     residence? ... 

And the other OPERATOR takes her headset and completes the 
number as SHARON leaves her post.

               OPERATOR
     Please hold for the number. 

SHARON walks away. 

Cut to:



EXTERIOR: STREET. NIGHT.
And now we see her sitting in the back of a Jaguar 
convertible. VIC is driving the car. VIC looks to someone 
offscreen. 

               VIC 
     What about them?

               SHARON 
     No. He's wearing a rug, and she has 
     a nose job. 

               VIC 
     It's not a bad nose job. 

               SHARON 
     They're all bad.

Now we see VIC. He is a beardless werewolf [I mean, 
spiritually]. SHARON is excited. She likes danger. 
Underneath, we feel her deep exhaustion. 

               SHARON 
     Let's go to the Continental Club. 

               VIC 
     Really?

               SHARON 
     Come on, Vic, you don't want to go 
     back to the airport. 

He's thinking. 

               VIC 
     I like the airport. I like the bars 
     at the airport hotels. I like 
     tourists. 
          (Meaning the bar:) 
     I don't want that tonight.

               SHARON 
     What's the matter, are you scared 
     of getting dirty? 

               VIC 
          (uncertain)
     Maybe.

               SHARON 
     C'mon, Vic. That's the place to 
     start. Let's have some fun.

From her challenging smile, his laugh, we cut to:



INTERIOR: BAR. NIGHT.
A rummy's bar in Hollywood. SHARON and VIC lean against a 
wall, drinking from bottles. VIC studies a couple sitting 
alone at a table, side by side. Sharp-featured, long-haired, 
not talking, they are smoking.

               SHARON 
     I like them. 

               VIC 
     You would.

SHARON and VIC walk across the floor to the table. They 
slide into the seat facing the couple. Call her DIANA. 
Call him RANDY.

               VIC 
     I'm Vic.

               SHARON 
     I'm Sharon. 

               VIC 
     Hi.

RANDY and DIANA are quietly amused.

               RANDY 
     What brings you to this side of 
     town? 

               SHARON 
     We got tired of shooting the dogs
     where the rich people live.

               DIANA 
     What are you looking for now?

               SHARON 
     Now we're looking for something a 
     little less obvious.

               VIC 
     But fun. Definitely fun. We're very 
     social people. 

               RANDY 
     You might be asking for something 
     you couldn't handle.

               SHARON 
     I can handle  it.

               RANDY 
     What if things go out of control? 

               SHARON 
     What's control got to do with it?

               VIC 
     I think he wants to find out if 
     you have any limits. 

               SHARON 
     Tell him that I haven't found them 
     yet. 

               VIC 
     Sharon hasn't found her limits yet.

               DIANA 
     Talk, talk, talk. 
          (To RANDY:) 
     Let's go somewhere. 

               VIC 
     I have a store. Let's go to the store.

They stand up. VIC takes DIANA'S hand. RANDY and SHARON 
follow. 

Cut to:



INTERIOR: VIC'S STORE. NIGHT.
VIC leads the others in, turning on lights and slow dance 
music (Little Richard singing "Directly from My Heart"). We 
move through the store to a far corner, to a model bedroom.

SHARON reaches out to RANDY and pulls him to her. RANDY lets 
go of DIANA and dances with SHARON. They dance to be watched. 
They are moving toward a bed. DIANA takes VIC'S hand. They 
dance. A blues song plays.

               RANDY 
     Come here. Come here and have a seat. 

               SHARON 
     Come on, let's fool around. 

RANDY lifts SHARON into his arms. 

               SHARON 
     Ohh. What a man.

               RANDY 
     Nice store you got here, Vic. Nice.

SHARON dances slowly with RANDY; they grind into each other, 
putting on a show. SHARON and VIC watch each other.

               DIANA 
     Come on. Show me what you mean by 
     fun. 

               VIC 
     Unnh-uhh.

SHARON sees this and shakes her head. DIANA goes to RANDY 
and SHARON.

               SHARON 
     Vic likes to watch. 

               RANDY 
     Watch this.

And we stay with Vic's face as the other three fall on the 
bed. 

Dissolve to:



INTERIOR: VIC'S STORE. NIGHT.
SHARON, RANDY, and DIANA on a bed. Their sex is a ritual, 
and the surprise here is their need. SHARON is the subject. 
They finish. They are still for a moment. SHARON gets up. We 
watch RANDY watching her.

SHARON sits on the arm of a leather couch, smoking. RANDY 
comes over to her. Behind them, Vic begins fucking DIANA. 
SHARON looks grim. RANDY studies her.

               RANDY 
     Was that far enough? 

SHARON turns to look at him.

               SHARON 
     Randy, right?

               RANDY 
     Hey, you remembered my name. 

               SHARON 
     Hi, Randy. 

               RANDY 
     Was it enough?
          
               SHARON 
     That was ... interesting.

The camera pulls back. We hear DIANA as VIC tries to come. 

Cut to:



INTERIOR: TELEPHONE COMPANY INFORMATION OFFICE. DAY. 
SHARON works at a computer terminal. Close on her. 

               SHARON 
     Operator 134, what city please? 
          (Pause, as she 
          types in the name.) 
     Is that a business or residence? 
          (Pause.) 
     Hold for the number. 
          (Pause.) 
     This is operator 134. What city? 
          (Pause.) 
     Can you spell that? 
          (Pause.) 
     Is that D as in Dick? 
          (Pause.) 
     Please hold for the number. 

Cut to:



INTERIOR: TELEPHONE COMPANY VENDING-MACHINE ROOM. DAY. 
Coffee break. Move through the room. Everyone sits alone, 
recovering from the phones. SHARON enters staring into space. 
Behind her are a group of workers, talking quietly but 
passionately. At first, SHARON doesn't listen. Bits of the 
following drift into consciousness. 

               WORKER #1
     Hi, Wayne. It was much stronger last 
     night, wasn't it?

               WORKER #2
     By a factor of five.

               WORKER #3
     It was almost like the first time, 
     I mean, it was that clear.

               WORKER #1
     And the horn, the sound of a horn, 
     that was new.

               WORKER #2
     One note, a very clear tone. I found 
     it on my piano; it's B flat.
      
               WORKER #1
     What do you think?

SHARON has leaned back in her chair to eavesdrop.

               WORKER #3
     I think it's going to happen, and 
     soon. Have you been praying?

WORKER #2, facing SHARON'S back, sees her leaning in and 
puts a finger to his lips.

               WORKER #2
     Yes, as much as I can.

The other two glance over their shoulders at SHARON. She 
looks over her shoulder and sees them look at her. She pulls 
her chair forward.

               WORKER #3 
     What does The Boy say? 

               WORKER #1
     Not yet.

Cut to:



INTERIOR: SHARON'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.
She is in bed with RANDY. Under the sheet, he strokes her. 
She comes, pushing his hand away.

               SHARON 
     Tell me a story. 

               RANDY 
     Hmmm. 

He tries to start again.

               SHARON 
     No, no, no. I already know that 
     story. Tell me something new.

He thinks about it.

               RANDY 
     I've done things for money. 

               SHARON 
     Like what?

               RANDY 
     Things I wish I hadn't. 

               SHARON 
     Like what?

               RANDY 
     I killed a man once. 

               SHARON 
     For how much? 

               RANDY 
     For a thousand dollars. 

               SHARON 
     That's not very much money.

               RANDY 
     It was a lot then. All I can say 
     now is, I wish I hadn't.

               SHARON 
     Why?

               RANDY 
     'Cause it stays with me. I mean, I 
     killed a man. I took his life, his 
     only life. That's bad. 

               SHARON 
     Did you know him? 

               RANDY 
     No.

               SHARON 
     Well, why did the people who paid 
     you want him dead?

               RANDY 
     There are some questions you don't 
     ask. After that, they offered me 
     another job, the same kind of job, 
     better money.

               SHARON 
     And did you do it?

               RANDY 
     No. But I think about that killing a 
     lot. I think, you know, if we weren't 
     taught that killing is bad, would I 
     still feel as bad?

               SHARON 
     I don't know.

               RANDY 
     You don't know. Are you scared of me 
     now? 

               SHARON 
     Did anyone pay you to kill me?

A long pause.

               RANDY 
     That was not a good year. 1975, that 
     was my best year. I was nineteen. 
     What was your best year? 

               SHARON 
     Hmmm. I guess I'm still waiting. I 
     don't know. I don't know. Everything 
     just seems so empty. Time passes so 
     quickly.

               RANDY 
     Yeah? I think it's kind of slow.

               SHARON 
     No, I mean, like a day. You know, a 
     day is always just over ... I don't 
     know what I'm trying to say. 

               RANDY 
     I think I understand.

               SHARON 
     Oh really? Why don't you let me in 
     on my secret. 

               RANDY 
     I think that you are depressed, and 
     I think that you should see a 
     therapist.

               SHARON 
     Oh, that's great. That's fucking 
     brilliant. 

Cut to:



INTERIOR: SHARON'S APARTMENT. DAY.
SHARON pulls subscription cards out of magazines. A door 
bell rings; then there's a knock at the door. SHARON answers 
it. Two men wearing suits, white shirts, and dark ties are 
there.

Both are in their late thirties or early forties. In New 
York, you would assume they were bankers or painters trying 
to look like bankers. They are evangelists. None of the 
evangelists in this film sound like TV preachers or have a 
hint of the South in their accents. 

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
     You understand that these are the 
     last days. It can't go on like this. 
     God is coming back. His prophecies 
     are now being fulfilled.

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     You have to accept Jesus as your 
     Lord and Savior.

               SHARON 
     Otherwise ...

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
     You won't be saved.

She shuts the door. Pause. She opens it again. The men are 
still there, still smiling.

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     We're not trying to scare you. 

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
     No.

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     Do you understand the difference 
     between righteousness and faith? 

               SHARON 
     Why don't you tell me.

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     It's only by the grace of God you'll 
     be saved.

               SHARON 
     But what if I lead a good life? 
     Does it still matter if I don't 
     believe?

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
     Do you really lead a good life? 

               SHARON 
     No.

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     You have to believe. If you don't, 
     you go to Hell.

               SHARON 
     Well, that doesn't seem fair.

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
     I used to think that. But then I met 
     Him. 

               SHARON 
     Who?

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     That's what we're trying to tell you. 

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
          (from John 3:16) 
     For God so loved the world that he 
     gave his only begotten Son. That 
     whosoever should believe in Him 
     should not perish but have 
     everlasting life.

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     You can have what we have. 

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
     A personal relationship with the 
     Son of God.

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     It's hard to believe unless you 
     believe it. But when you believe it, 
     then it's easy. You just know. 

               SHARON 
     What?

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
     Him. 

               SHARON 
     How?

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
     Who knows? It just is. 

               SHARON 
     Right. And I'm supposed to buy this? 

He hands her a small Bible.

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
     No. It's a gift.

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     We know what you're thinking ... It 
     doesn't make sense. 

               SHARON 
     No.

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     I was like you. 

               SHARON 
     I doubt it.

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     No, really. 

               SHARON 
     And, like I said, I doubt it.

The men turn and leave. As they walk away, SHARON speaks:

               SHARON 
     I heard someone talking about The 
     Boy? Who's The Boy?

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     Some people say that he's a prophet 
     in the old tradition.

               FIRST EVANGELIST 
     And some people say there are others 
     like him, all around the country. 

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     All around the world. 

               SHARON 
     And what do you say? 

               SECOND EVANGELIST 
     I say trust in God. 

The SECOND EVANGELIST gives SHARON a warm smile.

               SHARON 
     Excuse me. 

And she shuts the door.

EXTERIOR/INTERIOR: SHARON'S APARTMENT. DAY.
The phone rings. She picks up, and we hear VIC on the line.

     Hello?

               VIC 
          (voice-over)

     Hi, Vic.

               VIC 
          (voice-over) 
     I dropped by a few of the hotels 
     near the airport today. You'll never 
     guess who I found. The most 
     fascinating couple, really. They're 
     from Philadelphia. Well, he's from 
     Pennsylvania and she's from Florida 
     and they're married. Isn't that 
     romantic? 

She sees evangelists pass outside on bicycles. 

               SHARON 
     What time?

               VIC 
          (voice-over)
     Pick you up at nine.

               ANGIE
     Don't you have, uhh, 
          (to her husband while 
          she corners VIC) 
     something better to do? 

               EXECUTIVE
     I'm doing it.

ANGIE laughs as the Executive goes to SHARON. She declines. 

SHARON'S point of view as he walks back to the group. VIC 
dances with ANGIE while the EXECUTIVE gropes her a little. 
The EXECUTIVE unzips the back of ANGIE'S dress as he turns 
her around, and as the dress falls away, SHARON can see a 
tattoo through the veil of ANGIE'S long black hair.

The tattoo is not finished: we see a long boat with an angel 
blowing a horn on the bow. Behind the scene is a large pearl.

               SHARON 
     What is that?

               VIC 
     What are you talking about? 

               SHARON 
     She has a tattoo on her back. 

VIC looks. 

               VIC 
     Whoa.

               ANGIE
     I got it when I was a kid. 

               EXECUTIVE
     This was before she met me. 

               ANGIE
     I got drunk one night.

               SHARON 
     One night. You had it done in one 
     night? 

               EXECUTIVE
     Well, you know how kids are. I 
     almost got a tattoo once. She was 
     drunk.

ANGIE wraps herself around VIC. The naked EXECUTIVE fondles 
SHARON while she watches VIC and ANGIE kiss and laugh, the 
EXECUTIVE wants to get inside her, but she won't let him, he 
can only use his hands. For a moment, she enjoys it, but the 
pearl on ANGIE'S back is too compelling.

               SHARON 
     Angie, you got that in one night? 

               VIC 
     Maybe she doesn't want to talk about 
     it.

               ANGIE
     There's nothing to talk about. 

               SHARON 
     Why did you get it?

               VIC 
     Sharon? Can we talk about it later? 

               SHARON 
     I mean it must have been painful. 

ANGIE realizes she has to deal with SHARON'S curiosity.

               ANGIE 
          (facing SHARON)
     I don't remember, and I don't know 
     why I got it.

She looks at the EXECUTIVE. He gives her a compassionate look. 

               EXECUTIVE
     Its okay, Angie. I'm here. I'm with 
     you. 

               SHARON 
     Why would you get a tattoo that you 
     didn't really want? I'm sorry, I 
     don't want to make you unhappy, but 
     I really need to know. 

               ANGIE
     Why?

               SHARON 
     I don't know. I don't know. It's 
     important. 
          (She asks again:) 
     What is it?

               ANGIE
     Don't you know what's going on? 

               SHARON 
     What?

               ANGIE
     The dream? The Pearl? 

               SHARON 
     What dream? 

               EXECUTIVE
     Tell them.

Cut to:



INTERIOR: TELEPHONE COMPANY VENDING-MACHINE ROOM. DAY. 
The three workers are sitting together, drinking coffee. 
SHARON comes into the room and walks over to them, then sits 
down. She acts as though she's seen the light, but she's 
heavy-handed and obvious. 

               SHARON 
     Hi, it's a beautiful day, isn't it? 
     How are you? 

               WORKER #1 
          (cautious) 
     We're fine. And you? 

               SHARON 
     I'm fine. Now that I dream about the 
     Pearl. 

Silence. The men watch her carefully. She becomes 
uncomfortable, but they don't release her from their hard 
stares. She is being evaluated.

               WORKER #2
     What dream would that be? 

               SHARON 
     The Pearl. I dream about the Pearl. 

               WORKER #3
     Tell us about it. 

               WORKER #1
     What does it look like?

               SHARON 
     You know. The Pearl. It's a big 
     pearl by a river. 

               WORKER #3
     No, it's not.

               WORKER #1
     You haven't seen it. 

               SHARON 
     Yes, I have.

               WORKER #2
     You can't fake it.

SHARON slumps, defeated.

               WORKER #1
     It's a message from God. If you 
     really want it, all you have to do 
     is pray. 

               SHARON 
          (disdainfully)
     Pray. 

               WORKER #2
     He's coming back.

               SHARON 
     Slow down. If everybody is getting 
     this dream, how come it isn't on 
     the news?

               WORKER #2
     Those who need to know, know. 

               WORKER #1
     And those who don't believe won't 
     get the dream.

               SHARON 
     There are five billion people on the 
     planet. There's I-don't-know-how-
     many religions. Why does the God of 
     some little country on the 
     Mediterranean have to be the God for 
     everyone? Isn't that a little 
     arrogant? I mean, really? The 
     Buddhists get along okay without 
     Jesus Christ. The Hindus get along 
     okay without Jesus Christ. The 
     Moslems seem to be getting along 
     okay without Jesus Christ.

               WORKER #1
     But none of them are saved.

INTERIOR: SHARON'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.
SHARON comes in. She goes to the bedroom. VIC is in bed with 
a woman.

               VIC 
     Sharon, this is my friend Andrea.
     Andrea is from Nebraska. Come and 
     join?

SHARON leaves and slumps down a wall in the next room.



EXTERIOR: SHARON'S APARTMENT. DAY.
SHARON smokes on the balcony. Something has changed.



INTERIOR: SHARON'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
SHARON wakes up. She shakes RANDY. 

               SHARON 
     Get up. 

               RANDY 
     What?

               SHARON 
     Get up, or get out. 

               RANDY 
     What did I do?

               SHARON 
     I have to make the bed.

               RANDY 
     Come on, look, no, it's three 
     o'clock in the morning.

               SHARON 
     Get out of bed, or get out of the 
     house. 

               RANDY 
     Why?

               SHARON 
     This bed is unclean.

               RANDY 
     I'm out, I'm out. Unclean ... you 
     changed the sheets yesterday. 

               SHARON 
     Shut up!

And he gets out of bed. She rips the sheets off the bed and 
then we cut to:

Close-up of clean sheets being put over the bed. RANDY isn't 
helping; he leans against a wall, trying to sleep. 

               SHARON 
     I'm starting over, Randy. I've had 
     enough. 

               RANDY 
     Enough what?

               SHARON 
     I need a new direction in my life. 
     There is a God, I know it, there is 
     a God, and I'm going to meet Him.

               RANDY 
     When did you get religion?

               SHARON 
     I am trying, Randy. I want my 
     salvation. 

               RANDY 
     Sharon, you're fine the way you are. 

               SHARON 
     You just want to live in sin, don't 
     you? 

               RANDY 
     That's right. I just want to live in 
     sin. 

               SHARON 
     Fine, be a slave to the Devil.

               RANDY 
     Devil? Do you remember where we met? 
     Don't start asking me now to 
     apologize for who I am or what I 
     believe in.

               SHARON 
     Oh, and what do you believe in? 

               RANDY 
     There is no God. There's only chaos.



INTERIOR: SHARON'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. 
SHARON takes a shower. RANDY talks to her through the glass. 

               SHARON 
     And why do we have such guilty 
     consciences? Answer that?

               RANDY 
     You're the one with the guilty 
     conscience. I sleep really well, or 
     at least I used to. 
          (He tests the 
          shower water.) 
     Jesus Christ, that's hot.

               SHARON 
     Don't take the Lord's name in vain, 
     Randy. That's one of the 
     commandments, it even comes before 
     theft and adultery, it even comes 
     before murder. That's how important 
     it is not to take the Lord's name in 
     vain. 

               RANDY 
     Since when have you known the Lord? 

               SHARON 
     I am trying to.

               RANDY 
     And what does a shower at three in 
     the morning have to do with eternal 
     salvation?

SHARON is washing herself in a steaming hot shower. She 
scrubs herself with a hard brush. She gets out of the shower. 

               SHARON 
     I want to be clean. Am I clean?

RANDY watches in silence as she dries herself with a towel, 
cleans her fingernails, and brushes her teeth. She speaks to 
him in her reflection.

               RANDY 
     Yeah, you're clean.

               SHARON 
     When you do something wrong, we 
     feel bad, and that's because there's 
     a little bit of God in all of us, 
     telling us to change our ways before 
     it's too late. Isn't that right?

               RANDY 
     No, it's not right. It's just 
     conditioned by society. All we are 
     is animals whose brains have become 
     too big and too complicated for the 
     purposes of satisfying our animal 
     needs, which are food and sex.

               SHARON 
     There is a spiritual need which is 
     just as real as hunger, just as real 
     as the need for love.

               RANDY 
     Sharon, don't you understand what's 
     going on? The world's a disaster. 
     We have no power to make it better. 
     You hate your job. You hate your 
     life. But you want to feel special. 
     But instead of letting me do that, 
     you're rushing off to something 
     that's not even there. There's no 
     Pearl, there's only us.

SHARON flosses her teeth.

               SHARON 
     I feel sorry for you, Randy, I 
     really do. But you have to leave.

               RANDY 
     I don't want to leave. I want to 
     stay here with you. You know me. We 
     know each other. We know each 
     other's secrets, that's something. 
     I think we can love each other, and 
     I think you feel that too. 

               SHARON 
     There has to be something more. 

               RANDY 
     Why?

SHARON cries.

               SHARON 
     I'm tired of the pain in my life. 
     I'm tired of feeling empty all the 
     time. 

               RANDY 
     Let me help you.

               SHARON 
     Why can't we let God help both of us? 

               RANDY 
     Because there is no God. 

And he is out the door. Hold on SHARON.



EXTERIOR: DRIVEWAY. NIGHT.
RANDY gets into his truck. 

Cut to:



INTERIOR: SHARON'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.
SHARON reads the Bible the EVANGELISTS gave her and then 
simply clutches it.

She tries to sleep, to relax. 

Her eyes close.

Whatever it is, self-consciousness or doubt, she can't force 
herself to believe.

               SHARON 
          (whisper) 
     God, please, please, please help me. 
     God, I'm lost.

EXTERIOR: ENDLESS BOULEVARD. DAY.
SHARON drives aimlessly. She stops for a hitchhiker named 
TOMMY, rough-looking, with a bedroll and a rucksack. 

Cut to:



INTERIOR: SHARON'S CAR. DAY.

               TOMMY
     Chicks don't usually stop for me. 
          (No response 
          from SHARON.) 
     In fact, I think they think I'm 
     dangerous. 
          (Pause, again 
          no response.) 
     They're probably right. I'm not as 
     dangerous as some guys I know, but 
     I would never give myself a lift, 
     that's for sure. No way. If I was a 
     chick, no double-fucking way would I 
     give me a lift. I've looked in the 
     mirror. I've seen myself. I mean, 
     with my thumb out, if I was a chick 
     and I saw me, no sir. On the other 
     hand, if I was a, if I was the one 
     who was hitching and I was a chick, 
     I'd stop for me in a second. In 
     fact, I'd, I'd fuck me, too. In 
     fact, if I was hitching and I was a 
     chick, and I got stopped by a chick, 
     I'd fuck me that way, too. Yeah. In 
     fact, I wouldn't mind getting into 
     a bi-girl scene with myself. 
     Actually, you're the first chick 
     that has ever given me a lift. I 
     think other chicks don't pick me up 
     because they can tell I carry a gun 
     and I've been to prison in Vermont. 
     I don't think they can tell I've 
     been to prison, but that's where 
     I'm from. Vermont. You ever been to 
     Vermont? 
          (SHARON doesn't answer.) 
     I'm from the Lemon Fair Valley. 
     Actually, there's no lemons in 
     Vermont. Actually, it comes from the 
     French, Lay Moan Vayer, which means 
     the Green Mountains. Which is what 
     Vermont means. Green Mountains. Vert: 
     Green. Mont: Mountains. Vermont. 
     Green Mountains. Anyway, my father's 
     a farmer. I left home. What's your 
     name? I'm Tommy. 

               SHARON 
     Sharon.

               TOMMY 
     Oh yeah? With who? 

               SHARON 
     What?

               TOMMY 
     Who you sharin' it with? You gonna 
     share it with me?

Cut to:



EXTERIOR: ADULT MOTEL. DAY.
Tracking shot past the entrance. SHARON'S is not the only 
car parked at the motel.



INTERIOR: ADULT MOTEL. DAY.
TOMMY is on the round bed. He plays with a knife. We hear 
the shower running. The camera peeks into the bathroom.



INTERIOR: ADULT MOTEL. BATHROOM. DAY.
SHARON is in the shower, dressed. TOMMY'S rucksack is just 
outside the bathroom.

               TOMMY 
     Sharon? Did you know that the state 
     bird of Vermont is the Hermit 
     Thrush? I'll bet you didn't know 
     that. The state flower is the Red 
     Clover. Highest point is Mount 
     Mansfield, I believe, which is four 
     thousand three hundred ninety-three 
     something, I don't know. Hey, have 
     you got a quarter? Let's get some 
     magic finger going in here. How 
     would that be?



INTERIOR: ADULT MOTEL. DAY.
SHARON pulls a gun from TOMMY'S rucksack. He hears something, 
turns. SHARON is standing there dripping, with the gun. 

               SHARON 
     It's time for you to go. 

               TOMMY
     Uhhh?

               SHARON 
     You have to go, Tommy, and you have 
     to leave me your gun. 

               TOMMY 
     Ahhhh!

TOMMY raises his knife, she cocks the gun, and he plunges it 
into the bed.

EXTERIOR/INTERIOR: ADULT MOTEL. LATER.
SHARON is in bed, the blankets pulled up over her head. She 
pulls the  blankets down. She reaches beside her for her 
bag. She opens her bag. A pint of pear schnapps.

She drinks half the schnapps. She takes the gun and puts it 
under her chin. She closes her eyes and holds the gun for a 
long moment. She opens her eyes.

The disorder of the room bothers her.

She gets out of the bed and puts everything from the bag but 
the gun back into it. The ashtray on the night table is 
filled with crushed butts. She pulls the drawer open to hide 
the ashtray, and she finds the Gideon Bible. She puts the 
ashtray on top of the Bible. 

She is a bit disgusted with herself; disappointed at her 
lack of resolve. Then she takes the Bible out of the drawer 
and opens it. 

She starts to read the Gospels. 

A golden light fills the room.

SHARON is thrown backward by it, and before she's eclipsed 
by its brilliance: 

Dissolve to:

Extreme close-up: a pearl.

You've never seen a pearl this close, so close that we lose 
its shape. All we can see of it is the color: the changing 
white, silver, and pink. It is beautiful. You don't want it 
to go away. 

Dissolve to:



INTERIOR: SHARON'S APARTMENT. DAY.
SHARON is sleeping, smiling, at peace. She wakes up. 
Everything is different. 

She gets up. She goes to her closet and takes a simple 
dress from a hanger.

She hears a door. VIC is behind her. She covers herself 
with the dress. 

               SHARON 
     Can I get dressed? 

               VIC 
     Where were you? 

               SHARON 
     Turn around. 

               VIC 
     Really?

She nods. He does while she puts on the dress.

               VIC 
     C'mon. Where have you been? 

               SHARON 
     I went away for a few days. 

               VIC 
     Who'd you go with? 

               SHARON 
     No one. 

               VIC 
     Meet anyone?
          
               SHARON 
     Yes, yes, I did. I did meet 
     someone. 

VIC can sense that something is different about her by the 
way she talks to him so directly and so calmly, and by her 
placid smile. VIC lies on the bed. She comes out from 
behind the door.

               VIC 
     Are you okay?

               SHARON 
     I'm fine, Vic. I'm really, really 
     fine. 

               VIC 
     Unnh-uhh. No you're not. Something's 
     going on. You've changed. You've got 
     this look right now. 

               SHARON 
     What look? 

               VIC 
     That goofy smile.

               SHARON 
     If I tell you, you're not going to 
     believe me. But I have to tell you, 
     so it really doesn't matter if you 
     don't believe me. It doesn't matter 
     to me. I mean it matters to me, but 
     you're the one who really needs to 
     hear this now. 

               VIC 
     You met a guy.

               SHARON 
     Well, guy is not exactly the word 
     I'd use for Him. 

               VIC 
     You fox, you fell in love. 

               SHARON 
          (deadly serious)
     Yes. 

               VIC 
     Wait until he finds out about you. 

               SHARON 
     Well, He knows all about me. 

               VIC 
     Is he as bad a boy as I am? 

               SHARON 
     I think you should meet Him. 

               VIC 
     Did you tell him about me? 

               SHARON 
     I told you, He knows everything.

               VIC 
     He's rich, right? He's some rich 
     guy, and you fell for some line of 
     his.

               SHARON 
     You could love Him, too.

               VIC 
          (laughing)
     Oh, no, you fell in love with some 
     rich homosexual.

               SHARON 
     He's the Lord Jesus Christ, Vic. 
     He's the Son of God.

VIC jumps off the bed.

               VIC 
     Sharon, did you quit your job? 

               SHARON 
     Why would I do that?

               VIC 
     So you can go to the airport and 
     sell flowers, or do whatever the 
     cult wants you to do.

               SHARON 
     You can't understand, but I know 
     what that's like. Until it happens 
     to you, until you accept God into 
     your heart, it's like a fairy tale,
     it's like some joke that you just 
     don't get.

               VIC 
     I think you need to be deprogrammed. 

               SHARON 
     There's no cult, Vic. There's only 
     God, and his message of Love. 

               VIC 
     Love.

               SHARON 
     Love.

               VIC 
     Look, you'll give this up, someday. 
     I know you, you'll give this up. 

               SHARON 
     This is forever. 

               VIC 
     Everybody says that. 

               SHARON 
     This is different.

               VIC 
     Everybody says that, too. 
          (He is heading 
          out the door.) 
     Sharon, call me when this is over.

SHARON is alone, content.

INTERIOR: TELEPHONE COMPANY INFORMATION OFFICE. DAY. 
Go down the rows of computer terminals, hearing other 
operators. Stop at SHARON.

               SHARON 
     Hold for the number. Hi. Who's this? 
     ... Hi, Susanna, this is Sharon. 
     Have you met Jesus? ... Well, I'm 
     sure you're in a hurry, but don't 
     you think you could take time out 
     to get to know your Lord and Savior? 
     ... well okay, well, you have a good 
     day too. What was the number you 
     wanted? Here you go ... 
          (Pause.) 
     Hi, this is Sharon. Who's this? Hi, 
     Maria. Have you met God? You have? 
     Isn't He wonderful?

She looks up and sees HENRY, her supervisor. 

Cut to:



INTERIOR: TELEPHONE COMPANY. HENRY'S OFFICE. DAY. 
The door is closed.

               HENRY 
     You're supposed to spend a maximum 
     of fifteen seconds on each call. Do 
     you know what your average has been? 

               SHARON 
     No.

               HENRY 
     Take a guess.

               SHARON 
     Twenty seconds? Twenty-five?

               HENRY 
     Two minutes. You were clocked on one 
     call at seven minutes fifteen.

               SHARON 
     I am just trying to do my job. 

               HENRY 
     It seems like you're trying to do 
     two jobs. 

               SHARON 
          (a little defiantly) 
     We only have one job. 

               HENRY 
     That's right. And you're not doing 
     the one you're being paid for.

               SHARON 
     Henry, God made me an information 
     operator for a reason. I'm in a 
     position to spread His word to 
     hundreds of people every day, 
     personally. One-to-one. 

               HENRY 
     God.

               SHARON 
     I know you can't believe this, but 
     God is coming back to judge the 
     world. And it's important, I have to 
     tell people. We have to prepare for 
     His return. 

HENRY takes his time before speaking.

               HENRY 
     When did you first see the light? 

               SHARON 
     A few days ago. 

               HENRY 
          (neutral) 
     Mmm-hmm. 

               SHARON 
     You don't believe me.

               HENRY 
     Sometimes people have heard about 
     the Pearl and they try to pretend 
     like they've seen it, but you can 
     always tell when they're lying. You 
     just can't fake it. 

               SHARON 
     You?

SHARON puts her hand on her heart. 

               HENRY 
     When they first meet Him, everyone 
     thinks that Judgement Day is just 
     around the corner. I remember that 
     feeling very well; it's a powerful 
     feeling. But ... that sense that 
     it's going to happen tomorrow 
     passes when tomorrow comes and He 
     doesn't. And then you understand 
     that those feelings, as powerful as 
     they are, and the dreams, as real as 
     they are, are still just shadows of 
     the real thing, and no one can say 
     how far away that real thing really 
     is.

               SHARON 
     The feeling is so strong.

HENRY studies her.

               HENRY 
     I don't know you, but I know you. A 
     lot of people who have come to God 
     are broken. They've been messed up 
     by life. The unbelievers try to make 
     it seem like there's something wrong 
     with us, that we're stupid, but only 
     the humble hear the voice of God. 
     You're alone, aren't you?

               SHARON 
          (tears forming) 
     Yes.

               HENRY 
     It's hard at the beginning. You give 
     up your old life, and it's like 
     you've come to a new country. Your 
     old friends can not really be your 
     friends anymore. 

               SHARON 
     What do I do?

               HENRY 
     Trust in God, and take it easy on 
     the phones.

SHARON smiles.

               SHARON 
     Who's The Boy?

He looks at her. 

Cut to:



INTERIOR: CHURCH. DAY.
A small, spare room. No pews, only a circle of folding 
chairs. Perhaps twenty people are there. We're watching 
HENRY and his son, THE BOY, about ten years old. He never 
speaks out loud; he whispers behind a cupped hand into his 
father's ear. 

On SHARON, across from them, watching.

On THE BOY: he cups a hand and speaks to HENRY. HENRY 
addresses the room.

               HENRY 
     God is coming back. There are wars 
     and rumors of wars, and a curse 
     devours the Earth, and those who 
     live in it are held guilty.

THE BOY again whispers to his father. 

               HENRY 
     We have to wait. 

An OLDER WOMAN in the circle.

               SHARON 
     For how long? 

THE BOY whispers to his father.

               HENRY 
     Probably a few years. Five years, 
     six years. 

The people in the room hug each other. SHARON gives herself 
to the hugs and gives hugs. Love without sex. 

Dissolve to:



INTERIOR: RANDY'S WORKPLACE.
RANDY sprays coating on a metal gate. SHARON arrives. 

               SHARON 
     Hi, Randy.

               RANDY 
          (pretends to struggle 
          to remember her name)
     Ohh, uhh, Sharon. Sharon. How's that 
     apartment coming? Is it still 
     unclean? 

               SHARON 
     No.

               RANDY 
     So you found your salvation. 
     Congratulations. 

               SHARON 
     I found God.

               RANDY 
     Oh yeah? Is he going to move in, or 
     did he keep his own place, or are 
     you going to do that commuting 
     thing? You've got to watch that; 
     it's very tough on a relationship. 
     Why are you here? 

They walk into an adjoining woodshop. 

               SHARON 
     I know you are as lost as I was, 
     Randy, and I wanted to tell you that 
     you could know God. If you just 
     surrender your pride, you can know 
     God. 

               RANDY 
     Sharon, it's just a drug. Instead of 
     doing heroin, you're doing God, and 
     I need sandpaper.

               SHARON 
     Randy, God is real. God is not make-
     believe, and you know that. You 
     don't want to admit that, because 
     you're afraid.

               RANDY 
     What am I afraid of?

               SHARON 
     What we are all afraid of: God's 
     judgement. 

               RANDY 
     No. I'm not.

               SHARON 
     I don't want to lose you.

               RANDY 
     You just want to save my soul. 

               SHARON 
     At least you know you have one. 

               RANDY 
     I don't want to tell my secrets in 
     church. 

               SHARON 
     I'll pray for both of us.

               RANDY 
     You'd stay with me even if I didn't 
     pray? 

SHARON kisses RANDY. They hug.



TITLE SUPERIMPOSED: SIX YEARS LATER



INTERIOR: CHURCH. NIGHT.
There are more people in the room now. THE BOY is older now; 
and although HENRY is beside him, he speaks directly. 

               THE BOY 
     So far, we're still in the realm of 
     signs and wonders ... But the Rapture 
     is coming. It says so in the Bible. 
     Our bodies will be transformed into 
     spirit. And then we will be caught 
     up in a cloud to meet God. The end 
     is coming soon ... This year ... 

RANDY takes SHARON'S hand.

INTERIOR: SHARON AND RANDY'S TOWN HOUSE. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
The bedroom is now filled with Christian icons. SHARON and 
RANDY wake up together, shaken by the same image.

               RANDY 
     Ever since I was a kid, I've had the 
     feeling that something was going to 
     happen to me. I always knew that 
     when it happened, I would recognize 
     it, and that I wouldn't mistake it 
     for something else. I wouldn't have 
     something happen to me and I would 
     say, this is it! and then later on 
     say, no, that wasn't it. It was a 
     secret feeling, and I never told 
     anybody about it. 

               SHARON 
     And what's the feeling now? 

               RANDY 
     Something's going to happen.



INTERIOR: RANDY AND SHARON'S KITCHEN. DAY.
SHARON and her daughter, MARY, six years old, sit at the 
kitchen table.

               MARY 
     Where's Heaven? 

               SHARON 
     It's in the sky. 

               MARY 
     Why can't we see it? 

               SHARON 
     You will.

               MARY 
     But why can't we see it now? 

               SHARON 
     Mary? Do you love Baby Jesus? 

               MARY 
     Yes.

               SHARON 
     Then you'll see him really soon. 

Slowly dissolve to:



EXTERIOR: SWIMMING POOL.  DAY.
We move through the water, and the change from the light is 
easy, gradual. The water is ethereal; we don't even know 
this is a pool yet; it could be a body of heavenly water.  
The calm surface of the pool explodes as a six-year-old-
girl, MARY, bursts to the surface. SHARON moves through the 
water. Her friend PAULA floats on a raft. 

               PAULA 
     What does the Bible say?

               SHARON 
     We who are alive who are saved will 
     be taken bodily into Heaven.

               PAULA 
     Ohhh, Sharon ... Sharon ... 

               SHARON 
     You can't accept God, can you? 

               PAULA 
     No.

               SHARON 
     Well, maybe we should talk about 
     that for a minute.

               PAULA 
          (smiling)
     Okay, do you mean that if you're a 
     Christian and you're ironing your 
     shirts and the Rapture happens, 
     you'll be taken to Heaven in the 
     middle of doing the laundry? Or does 
     God give you time to turn off the 
     iron, or do your shirts burn?

               SHARON 
          (joking but deadpan)
     I wear permanent press. 

               PAULA 
     Well, I mean what's supposed to 
     happen? You are supposed to float 
     up into the sky?

               SHARON 
     In the twinkling of an eye. The body 
     will be transformed into spirit. And 
     there is a warning. If you listen, 
     if you pray for it. We'll hear the 
     sound of trumpets, God's angels.

MARY listens.



INTERIOR: RANDY'S WORKPLACE. DAY.
RANDY is now a supervisor in a large insurance office. He is 
well groomed; his hair is cut short; he is a few pounds 
lighter. Other workers are around. RANDY is arguing with 
LOUIS, another worker. A security officer stands behind 
RANDY.

               RANDY 
     Louis, I'm trying to say this 
     without causing you a lot of pain.

               LOUIS
     Any way you say it, I'm fired, 
     right? 

               RANDY 
     We have struggled together, but, you 
     have to admit, it hasn't worked out.

               LOUIS
     That's because I'm not kissing ass 
     around here, isn't it?

               RANDY 
     Louis, it's because you're not 
     doing your job. 

               LOUIS 
     You're not doing your job, banana-
     head. 

               RANDY 
     Louis, we've tried to help you, 
     haven't we? 

               LOUIS 
          (crying)
     I don't want your fucking help. 

               RANDY 
     We took you to a counselor. 

               LOUIS 
     You took me to a homo. 

               RANDY 
     I took you to an A.A. meeting.

               LOUIS 
     They were a bunch of a-holes. 
     A-holes Anonymous. And you're an 
     a-hole. And I'm tired of kissing 
     your Christian a-hole. 
          (To the security guard:) 
     What are you looking at?

               RANDY 
     Louis, I'll pray for you. 

               LOUIS 
          (wildly) 
     Yeah, well, fuck you!

INTERIOR: RANDY'S WORKPLACE. DAY.
We hear a blast. We see RANDY in his office at the corner of 
a hall. There are two bodies in the hall, and LOUIS walks 
down it with a gun. RANDY gets up from his desk and starts 
to come out. As he does, LOUIS shoots into an office. LOUIS 
goes into another office, and we hear two more shotgun 
blasts. RANDY is now out of his office and turning down the 
empty hall when LOUIS comes back into the hall.

               RANDY 
     Louis.

               LOUIS 
     No speeches, preacher. 

               RANDY 
     I have a little girl.

INTERIOR: SHARON AND RANDY'S TOWN HOUSE. DAY. 
MARY opens the front door. 

               MARY 
     Come in.

The living room is filled with friends who have brought food 
to SHARON. MARY and other children play. SHARON talks to 
PAULA on a balcony. 

               PAULA 
     You see, now's one of those times 
     when I wish I was a believer. 

               SHARON 
     Why?

               PAULA 
     Because I would have a rock to stand 
     on, because I could tell myself that 
     everything was for the better 
     because God has a plan.

               SHARON 
     But it is, because He does.

               PAULA 
     It is so hard for me, Sharon. I try 
     to resist it as much as possible.

               SHARON 
     So you do feel something tugging at 
     you, don't you?

               PAULA 
     I tell myself it's just conditioning, 
     it's how I was raised. I tell myself 
     that if we didn't tell our children 
     about God, they wouldn't ask. It is 
     a story we tell ourselves so 
     everything makes sense. 

               SHARON 
     It's not.

               PAULA 
     But how do you know? 

               SHARON 
     The Bible.

               PAULA 
     Don't tell me the Bible. 

               SHARON 
     It's a question of faith. 

               PAULA 
     So there's no proof?

               SHARON 
     Paula, the universe you live in is 
     cold and filled with empty space. 
     The universe I live in is filled 
     with God.

SHARON and MARY kneel at MARY'S bed, praying. 

               MARY 
     Will we see Daddy again? 

               SHARON 
     Yes.

               MARY 
     When we die?

               SHARON 
     Or when God takes us to Heaven. 

               MARY 
     When the Rapture comes, does that 
     mean we die? 

               SHARON 
     Not exactly.

               MARY 
     So you can go to Heaven without 
     dying? 

               SHARON 
     Yeah.

               MARY 
     But if you die, you can still go to 
     Heaven. 

               SHARON 
     Yes.

               MARY 
     So Daddy is going to Heaven. 

               SHARON 
     No, Daddy's already in Heaven. 

               MARY 
     If we pray to Daddy, can he hear us? 

               SHARON 
     Well, we pray to God, and God tells 
     Daddy what we're saying. That way he 
     can hear everything.

EXTERIOR: MINIMALL STAIRCASE. DAY. 
SHARON comes down the stairs and stops. 

Pull back to reveal:

We are outside a Photolab in a corner pod mall. SHARON walks 
into view, looking at the snapshots of America rolling off 
the printer.

In the photographs, we see RANDY wearing the clothes in 
which he died, and he's trying to reach her, trying to say 
something to her. Her husband appears improbably in a 
picture at the beach, standing behind a typical family. Then 
RANDY is pictured in the desert, standing on a tall rock pile, 
his arm raised, calling her to him. He's pleading with her. 

Cut to:



INTERIOR: CHURCH. DAY.
The room is filled; people are standing on chairs at the 
wall. There's still a circle in the middle, but it's smaller. 
HENRY and THE BOY are flanked by the two EVANGELISTS. SHARON 
is across from them, with MARY. Now THE BOY speaks.

               THE BOY 
     This is from the Book of Revelation, 
     chapter 12, verse 6. It says, "And 
     the woman fled into the desert where 
     she had a place prepared for her by 
     God." Is anyone else getting visions 
     that tell us we have to go to the 
     desert?

               SHARON 
     You don't believe me. 

               THE BOY 
     I do.

               SHARON 
     What does it mean?

               THE BOY 
     You're the only one who can hear 
     these calls. It could be Satan.

               SHARON 
     I don't think so.

               THE BOY 
     Then God wants you for His special 
     purpose. 

               SHARON 
     Please, come with me. 

               THE BOY 
     We haven't been invited.

SHARON wants to cry. She gets up and takes Mary's hand. The 
crowd parts for her, making a path to the door. She starts 
walking toward it, about ten feet.

               SHARON 
     But I'm scared.

               THE BOY 
     Don't ask God to meet you halfway. 

               SHARON 
     What does that mean? 

THE BOY shakes his head no.

               HENRY 
          (to THE BOY)
     What does that mean?

THE BOY shakes his head. No, he won't answer. SHARON is 
scared. She opens the door.



EXTERIOR: OUTSIDE THE CHURCH. SUNSET.
SHARON and MARY are framed in the church door, the faithful 
behind them. They walk out into the sunset.

EXTERIOR: SHARON AND RANDY'S TOWN HOUSE. DAY.
SHARON is packing a sports bag while PAULA watches her. 
PAULA is desperate. SHARON is calm. SHARON holds up a few of 
MARY'S dresses while she studies the clothes in her closet. 
PAULA has a shopping bag filled with food.

               PAULA 
     Sharon, you can't just leave like 
     this. 

               SHARON 
     Yes, I can. God is calling me.

               PAULA 
     No, no, no ... Sharon ... what 
     about Mary? 

               SHARON 
     God is calling her too.

               PAULA 
     Why don't you sell the house? You 
     can't just walk away from it.

               SHARON 
     Of course, I can. There's a better 
     house waiting for me. God is 
     building me a mansion, right now. 
     What should I wear?

She takes out a few dresses.

               PAULA 
     God won't come, the bank will own 
     your home, and what are you going to 
     do then?

               SHARON 
     I'm going to Heaven, Paula. I'm 
     going to Heaven. Mary and I are 
     going to Heaven. And we'll wear 
     these dresses, together, when we 
     finally meet God. Randy always liked 
     this dress. I'll wear it for him. 
     I'll be seeing him soon. And he 
     always loved to see Mary in this. 

PAULA sits on the bed. 

               PAULA 
     Don't you get a white robe and 
     wings? 

               SHARON 
     Angels don't have wings. And I don't 
     know about the robes. I don't know 
     what they wear, but I guess I'll 
     find out.

SHARON packs a sweater.

               PAULA 
     Then what's the sweater for?

               SHARON 
     It gets cold at night in the desert.

               PAULA 
     Winter is coming. You'll need more 
     than a sweater.

               SHARON 
     He's taking us soon, very soon. 

               PAULA 
     How do you know? 

               SHARON 
     He told me.

               PAULA 
     Sharon, Sharon, listen to me. I 
     don't know if you can hear me, but 
     listen to me. You need food. 

               SHARON 
     Not that much.

               PAULA 
     You need a tent. I don't want you 
     guys sleeping out in the car. Okay. 
     Candle, matches, flashlight. 

PAULA pulls the named items out of the bag.

               SHARON 
     Thank you, Paula.

               PAULA 
     You need something else. You can't 
     go out to the desert alone, there's 
     a lot of creeps out there, Sharon, 
     and a woman alone, I'm scared. 

               SHARON 
     God will take care of us. 

               PAULA 
     Maybe. Insurance. 

She takes out a small handgun.

               SHARON 
     Oh, Paula, no.

               PAULA 
     You don't have to use it. But you 
     have to take it. And you can bring 
     it back to me when you come home. 

SHARON holds PAULA'S hand, and she looks at the gun.

               SHARON 
     I'm not coming home.

EXTERIOR: DESERT CAMPGROUND. DAY.
SHARON and MARY drive into a campground somewhere in the 
high desert. There are Joshua trees, yuccas, and large rocks 
and rock piles. 

               MARY 
     Mom?

               SHARON 
     Yes, Mary.

               MARY 
     This doesn't look like Heaven, Mom. 

               SHARON 
     This isn't Heaven, honey. 

               MARY 
     Then why stop here?

               SHARON 
     Think of Heaven as a great big hotel 
     or a big office building.

               MARY 
     Yeah.

               SHARON 
     Well, this is the lobby, this is 
     where we have to wait.

               MARY 
     For what?

               SHARON 
     The elevator.

Another car pulls up.

INTERIOR: TENT. NIGHT.
SHARON and MARY sleeping. We go into SHARON'S dream. She is 
dreaming of the Pearl. 

Cut to:



EXTERIOR: DESERT CAMPGROUND. DAY.
ROCK CLIMBERS are high on the sheer face of a rock wall. 
MARY watches them. One CLIMBER rappels down the rock and 
lands beside them. He is lean, muscular, cool.

               MARY 
     Are you waiting for God, too?

               CLIMBER 
     Oh, is that what you guys are doing 
     here? 

               MARY 
     God is coming back. 

               CLIMBER 
     Sounds good. 

               MARY 
     He really is. 

               CLIMBER 
     Okay.

               MARY 
     He's coming tomorrow.

               SHARON 
     No, soon, Mary. He's coming soon. 

They look up at the sky.



EXTERIOR: DESERT CAMPGROUND. NIGHT. 
SHARON puts MARY to sleep in the tent.



EXTERIOR: DESERT CAMPGROUND. LATE DAY.
There isn't much food left or water. We hear a loud siren. 
SHARON grabs MARY. MARY grabs for her toy panda.

               SHARON 
     That's it! That's it, Mary, here it 
     comes, here it is, he's calling us, 
     come on, hurry, hurry ...

She runs with MARY up a rock formation, higher and higher. 
The sound continues. MARY drops her panda and screams out:

               MARY 
     Panda!

               SHARON 
     Mary, come on ... 

               MARY 
     No, Panda!

SHARON scrambles back to get the doll. It is out of reach. 
She gets it. MARY hugs her panda, and they continue on up 
the rock until we have a good view of the whole campground.



EXTERIOR: TOP OF ROCK PILE. DAY.
The horn is still loud and clear. SHARON holds MARY, their 
faces lifted to the sky, waiting for the Rapture. We see a 
CLIMBER running across the parking lot to his car. He turns 
off the alarm, and the sound stops. SHARON remains frozen 
for a second; then she sits down. For the first time, we see 
real doubt and the beginning of defeat. MARY starts to cry.

               MARY 
     I miss my Daddy.

               SHARON 
     Honey, I miss your Daddy, too. 

               MARY 
     I want to see him again.

               SHARON 
     You will, you will see him in 
     Heaven. 

               MARY 
     Why can't we go to Heaven? Mommy, I 
     want to go to Heaven.

               SHARON 
     We have to wait until God calls us. 

               MARY 
     Did God call Daddy? When you die is 
     that when God calls you? 

               SHARON 
     Yes.

               MARY 
     Then I want to die. 

               SHARON 
     No, sweetie, no.

               MARY 
     You want to go to Heaven, don't you? 

               SHARON 
     Yes.

               MARY 
     And you believe that when we die 
     we'll go to Heaven, because we're 
     saved, right? 

               SHARON 
     Yes.

               MARY 
     Then why can't we just die and go 
     there really quickly and be with 
     Daddy again? Why do we have to stay 
     here and just hang around and wait 
     for God? Come on, Mom, let's die.

SHARON puts her arm around her. She is too young to really 
understand what she's asking for.

               SHARON 
     Let's give God one more chance.

EXTERIOR: DESERT CAMPGROUND. DAY.
A county sheriff's car drives into the campground. FOSTER 
MADISON gets out of it. MARY and SHARON pray at a picnic 
bench. Something about SHARON attracts him. He could be hard, 
but he is curious, soft. 

               FOSTER 
     Howdy. 

               SHARON 
     Hello.

               FOSTER 
     I'm Foster Madison. 

               SHARON 
     Sharon. And Mary. 

FOSTER crouches to be closer to MARY. 

               FOSTER 
     Oh yeah? I have a sister named Mary. 
     She's all grown-up now.

               MARY 
     Are you with God? 

               FOSTER 
     I'm with the sheriff. 

               MARY 
     We're waiting for our father. 

               FOSTER 
     Where is he? 

               MARY 
     Heaven.

               FOSTER 
     Don't you go to school? 

               MARY 
     I don't have to go to school. 

FOSTER looks at SHARON.

               SHARON 
     I'm not asking you to understand, or 
     to have faith, but the end of the 
     world is coming, and we're a lot 
     safer out here. 

MARY walks away.

               FOSTER 
     Well, there's a two-week limit on 
     staying here. 

               SHARON 
     Is that a limit on how long I can 
     stay in the park, or how long I can 
     use this campsite?

               FOSTER 
     Actually, it's just a limit on how 
     long you can use this particular 
     campsite.

               SHARON 
          (points to different 
          campsites)
     So if I move over there, or over 
     there, or over there ... I can stay 
     for another two weeks.

FOSTER wants to be fair; he sees a woman in need. 

               FOSTER 
     Technically. I can't stop you. 

               SHARON 
     Thank you.

               FOSTER 
     Could I ask you a question? 

               SHARON 
     Sure.

               FOSTER 
     Is this good for your little girl? 

               SHARON 
     Have you been saved? 

               FOSTER 
     No.

               SHARON 
     Do you know what that means? 

               FOSTER 
     Yeah.

               SHARON 
     Would you like to be?

               FOSTER 
     Oh yeah, yeah sure, who wouldn't. 

               SHARON 
     Why is it so hard for you to pray? 

               FOSTER 
     You have to surrender to God, don't you? 

               SHARON 
          (not fully certain) 
     That's right. 

               FOSTER 
     It's in my training. I don't give 
     up my gun. 

               SHARON 
     But you'd like to believe. 

               FOSTER 
     That these are the last days?

               SHARON 
     You know they are. God is coming 
     back to judge the world. A lot of 
     people are going to suffer. 

               FOSTER 
     I hope that's not true; but if 
     there's no law against it, my hands 
     are tied. 

SHARON smiles a little. 

               SHARON 
     I bet with a little prayer you'd be 
     on my side in an hour.

               FOSTER 
     Well, then it's time for me to go. 
     Watch out for the coyotes. 
          (To MARY:) 
     Good-bye. 

               MARY 
     Good-bye.

FOSTER gets back into his car. When he is gone, SHARON 
breaks down and cries.

          (impatient)
     Who?

               MARY 
     God. You said you'd give God one 
     more chance, and if we didn't get 
     the Rapture that we could die. 
     That's what you said. You promised.

               SHARON

          the question) 
     Baby ...

     Don't you believe in God? 

               SHARON Yes.

               MARY 
     Don't you love God? Then why can't 
     we just go to God? Go now. Now.

SHARON doesn't answer immediately.

               FOSTER 
     Yeah, I know, I, it's just that 
     sometimes you want to sit on the 
     ground, you don't want to get dirty, 
     it s nice to have a blanket. 

               SHARON 
     Thank you.

               FOSTER 
     I, I brought your little girl a 
     candy bar. I know moms are worried 
     about cavities, so if you don't want 
     to give it to her, you know, I'll 
     understand.

     I'll give it to her.

Close on MARY. She cries out in her sleep.

     Mom! You have to make up your mind, 
     now! Gabriel is coming, Mom, Gabriel 
     is coming.

          is in a kind of trance, 
          staring at her mother, 
          afraid for her.) 
     He's God, Mom, He's God. Don't ask 
     God to meet you halfway. 
          (A final cry.) 
     Mommy!

               SHARON 
     Wake up, Mary, wake up. It's okay, 
     baby, it's okay.

MARY wakes up, and she cries deeply. Her face tells us 
everything: she has given up hope.

               SHARON 
     Come on, baby, you're just hungry; 
     we'll get something to eat. Come on, 
     let's go to town. 

               MARY 
     No, we can't leave. 

               SHARON 
     Yes, we can.

               MARY 
     But we don't need any food. God will 
     give us food when we get to Heaven. 
     I'll be in Heaven tonight. There was 
     a river. And I was in Heaven. 

               SHARON 
     Where was I? 

               MARY 
     You were there. 

               SHARON 
     Good.

               MARY 
     Sort of. You were there, but only 
     sort of. 

SHARON tries to make sense of this. She can't; she's too 
tired right now for tests of faith. She smiles and looks her 
daughter in the eye.

               SHARON 
     It's almost morning. As soon as the 
     sun comes up, we'll go get something
     to eat.

     Do you love Jesus? 

               MARY 
     Yes.

               SHARON 
     You know, in Heaven there's Jesus 
     and Baby Jesus, together, and Baby 
     Jesus has the special job, has the 
     special job 
          (breaking down) 
     of looking out for all the children. 
     Mary, do you love Baby Jesus? 

               MARY 
     Yes.

               SHARON 
     It's not fair to make you pay 
     because I'm lost. If God loves us, 
     He'll understand. We're going to 
     Heaven now.

               MARY 
     We're going together? 

               SHARON 
     Together.

Now we see the gun that PAULA gave her before she left home. 
The sun is going down. 

               MARY 
     And Daddy? Daddy's in Heaven.

               SHARON 
          (this thought 
          comforts her) 
     Daddy. We'll see Daddy. Yes. And 
     we'll be together forever because 
     nothing is broken in Heaven. I love 
     you. 

               MARY 
     Daddy.

               SHARON 
     You have to love God, Mary, do you 
     love God? 

               MARY 
     Yes.

MARY makes a face as though she's about to enter icy water. 
With her panda tucked under her arm, she clasps her hands in 
prayer even harder.

               SHARON 
     Tell Him that. Don't be afraid. 

SHARON pulls the trigger, and the gun fires. MARY is dead. 

SHARON takes the gun and puts it to her head.

She holds the gun. We watch. We wait. Will she? Can she? She 
empties the gun into the air, screams at the sky; then she 
sits down on the ground; then she lies down beside MARY and 
goes to sleep. 

Fade-out. 

Fade-in:



EXTERIOR: BURNED HILL. LATER. NIGHT.
SHARON places a cross on the panda on top of the grave and 
then gets up. She walks away, empty.

We hear hoofbeats, one horse, distant. The sound gets louder.



INTERIOR: SHARON'S CAR. NIGHT.
SHARON speeds down the highway, and everywhere she looks she 
sees a white horse flashing in her vision. 

Cut to:



EXTERIOR: FREEWAY. NIGHT.
SHARON keeps speeding. The white horse is gone. And then the 
red lights of a sheriff's police car appear in the mirror. 
The siren is close. She is sure she has been caught. She 
pulls over. The sheriff's OFFICER MADISON from the 
campground. He shines his searchlight on SHARON'S car. Then 
he walks to the car and knocks on her window. 

               FOSTER 
     Could you get out of the car, please? 

SHARON gets out of the car.

               FOSTER 
     What happened to God? 
          (He can see she is 
          in some kind of 
          distress.) 
     What's wrong? 

She doesn't answer.

               FOSTER 
     I have to see your license and 
     registration, please. 

               SHARON 
     They're in the car.

She gets them. She holds the license and registration out in 
her hand.

               FOSTER 
     Thank you. Could you step over into 
     the light, please?

He takes the identification and goes back to his bike. 
SHARON nods yes. He studies the license. We look at him for 
a moment. He is not a bad man, and he is studying SHARON, 
less as another speeder than as a woman in obvious trouble.

In the beginning, SHARON is catatonic; her answers are short 
and sparse. As FOSTER continues to press her, she starts to 
unravel. She realizes what she has done.

               FOSTER 
     Here. Where's your little girl? 

               SHARON 
     She's with God. 

               FOSTER 
     She died? 

               SHARON 
     Yes. 

               FOSTER 
     Mary. 

               SHARON 
     Yes. 

               FOSTER 
     How?

               SHARON 
     I killed her. I was going to kill 
     myself too, but you can't get into 
     Heaven if you kill yourself. You can 
     get into Heaven if somebody else 
     kills you but not if you kill 
     yourself. Life is some kind of 
     punishment, isn't it? You have to go 
     through with it, even when you know 
     what life is for.

               FOSTER 
     What is life for? 

               SHARON 
     Ask God.

               FOSTER 
     What does he say?

               SHARON 
     I think He says that, basically, you 
     have to love Him, no matter what. But 
     I don't love Him, not anymore. He has 
     too many rules. He told me to meet 
     Him in the desert. And I did and I 
     waited. He didn't come. He broke His 
     promise. He let me kill my little 
     girl. And He still expects me to love 
     Him? I'm afraid of Hell, so I have to 
     wait out my life, waiting for God. 
     Now: He'll forgive me and He'll let 
     me join my daughter and my husband 
     in Heaven, but first I have to say I 
     love Him. You can send me to the gas 
     chamber, and if I let God into my 
     heart before I die, then I can go to 
     Heaven, because God is merciful. How 
     fast was I going?

               FOSTER 
     A hundred miles an hour.

               SHARON 
     A hundred miles an hour. If I had 
     gone off a bridge and died, would I 
     have gone to Heaven? 

               FOSTER 
     I don't know. 

               SHARON 
     Neither do I.

Dissolve to:



INTERIOR: PRISON. DAY.
A guard leads SHARON down a row of cells. A door is opened 
and then locked behind her. A woman on the next bed is 
reading the Bible, and when she lowers the book, we see it 
is ANGIE, the swinger with the tattoo. SHARON says nothing 
to her.

               ANGIE
     I know you. I should be embarrassed 
     to even tell you where we met, but 
     I'm not ashamed, I'm not ashamed of 
     anything anymore, I found God, God 
     found me. I was preaching the word 
     of God at a shopping mall in Palm 
     Springs, and they had me kicked out. 
     So I went back in, and they had me 
     arrested. Have you heard the word 
     of God? 
          (No reply.) 
     It's the greatest gift of all time. 
     You have to trust completely in God. 
     He'll forgive all your sins.

               SHARON 
     Who forgives God? 

And she turns away from her. 

Fade-out.



INTERIOR: PRISON CELL. NIGHT.
SHARON hears a sound from her cell. A flaming sword slices 
the air. The sword stops flaming when it cuts through the 
air. The sword is held by the ARCHANGEL MICHAEL. ANGIE 
sleeps.

Another angel drifts into this scene outside the cell. MARY 
appears dressed as she was when she died.

               MARY 
          (sincerely, with a 
          little difficulty)
     God is coming back, Mommy. There 
     are wars and rumors of wars, Mommy, 
     and a curse devours the Earth, and 
     those who live in it are held guilty.

               SHARON 
     He said He was going to take us to 
     Heaven. 

               MARY 
     Mother, listen to me. The living 
     outnumber the dead. The Armies of 
     the Lord are waiting for the Day of 
     Judgement. Don't you still love God, 
     Mommy? 

               SHARON 
     He left us, alone, in the desert. 
     He let me kill you. 

               MARY 
     Do you still love Him?

               SHARON 
     How can I love a God who let me kill 
     my baby? 

               MARY 
     God loves you because you love Him. 

               SHARON 
     Why?

               MARY 
     I know you want me back, but I can't 
     come back, Mommy. I'm dead.

SHARON looks as they vanish, then, after a beat, looks down. 

Cut to:



INTERIOR: PRISON. NIGHT.
We move through the cells. A trumpet plays one long, 
extended note. The prisoners look outside.

               ANGIE
     That's the first call. It's Gabriel 
     blowing his trumpet. There will be 
     six more calls. We have until the 
     last call to repent. After that, 
     it's too late. After that, it's too 
     late.

We hear the hoofbeats again, getting louder. People look up. 
The sound seems to be in the middle of the room. The sound 
of the hoofbeats is impossibly loud, and we see on the TV 
screen the faint image of a white horse over a ballgame. 
Then the game disappears, and we see the feet of the horse.

               ANGIE
     It's God. He's giving us a last 
     chance to save ourselves. At war, 
     the First Horseman of the 
     Apocalypse. 

The horse is replaced by a trumpet. The channels are changed, 
and the golden trumpet blowing the pure tone is seen across 
every channel. It is a long trumpet raised high before a 
deep blue background. A hand holds the trumpet, but we don't 
see the angel's face. ANGIE begins to sing:

               ANGIE 
          (sings)
     Hark! the herald angels sing, 
     Glory to the newborn King; 
     Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
     God and sinners reconciled! 
     Joyful all ye nations rise, 
     Join the triumph of the skies; 
     With th' angelic host proclaim 
     Christ is born in Bethlehem.

As she sings, the trumpet sounds again. The hoofbeats grow. 
The blast gets louder. Prison bars start to collapse. All of 
the bars fall out of the walls, collapse to the floor with a 
great noise. Women step slowly out of their cells. A 
helicopter sounds in the background. Everyone sits quietly. 
No one knows what to say. 

               ANGIE
     What more do you need? 

               SHARON 
     Get out of here.

ANGIE leaves. SHARON is alone in the cell. FOSTER walks 
down the corridor. 

               SHARON 
     What are you doing here? 

               FOSTER 
     I want to know what happens next. 

               SHARON 
     Are you scared?

               FOSTER 
     I don't know. I never had any faith. 
     But you did. 

               SHARON 
     Yep. 

               FOSTER 
     So? 

               SHARON 
     So.

               FOSTER 
     Well, if the world is coming to an 
     end, this isn't the place to be. 
     Let's go.



EXTERIOR: ROAD. DAY.
SHARON rides behind FOSTER on his motorcycle.

Hoofbeats are closer. The red horse ridden by a rider 
wielding a long sword chases them. The rider holds a pair 
of scales. The trumpet continues to sound. 

Cut to:



EXTERIOR: THE ROAD. NIGHT.
SHARON and FOSTER are on the bike. The night sky is filled 
with the image of a huge bull ridden by a ghostly woman 
holding an immense candelabra. 

Cut to:



EXTERIOR: FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD. DUSK. 
The motorcycle comes to the crest of a hill.

Smoke surrounds the two. It is impossible to go ahead. They 
stop driving. The smoke obscures everything now. Hoofbeats. 
The world is dissolving. The FOURTH HORSEMAN, DEATH, riding 
the pale horse, appears in the fog of smoke and comes slowly 
toward them. 

SHARON and FOSTER get off their motorbike and watch the 
horseman. Then, they begin to rise slowly into the smoke. 
She doesn't want this. 

               SHARON 
     No! No, I don't want to go. 
          (To FOSTER:) 
     Don't let me go. No!

They disappear into the smoke.

Dissolve to:



EXTERIOR: LIMBO. NIGHT.
We are in the dark. The noise has stopped. Then we see them, 
barely lit, a hint of something like moonlight on them. A 
voice, MARY'S: 

               MARY 
     Mom? 
          (MARY walks out of 
          the darkness. She is 
          beside them, holding 
          her panda.) 
     Hi, Mom. 

               FOSTER 
     Is this Hell?

               SHARON 
          (tenderly) 
     Hello, Mary.

SHARON walks to her, but MARY is just out of reach and 
stays there.

               FOSTER 
     That's your daughter. 

               SHARON 
     Mary? Where are you? 

               MARY 
     I'm here.

               SHARON 
     Where are we?

               MARY 
     You know when you hear those songs 
     about the river that washes away all 
     your sins? Well, here it is. Heaven 
     is on the other side of the river. 

               FOSTER 
     We're in Heaven. Why are we in 
     Heaven? 

               MARY 
     You're not in Heaven. Heaven is 
     over there. 

She points to the distance, into the darkness. 

               FOSTER 
     I can't see it.

               MARY 
     It's there. If you love God, it's 
     there. Foster. Do you love God for 
     giving you the gift of life? 

               FOSTER 
          (whispers) 
     Yes.

Then he smiles, and then he disappears.

               SHARON 
     No!

               MARY 
     Mommy! Gabriel is coming. You have 
     to make up your mind.

               SHARON 
     There's nothing more to say. Take 
     me to God, Mary. I have to speak to 
     Him. 

               MARY 
     You have to love God. 

               SHARON 
     I love you, Mary. 

               MARY 
     That isn't enough.

               SHARON 
     Baby, it's all I have. If life is a 
     gift, if it really is a gift, and 
     there really is a Heaven ... 

               MARY 
     There really is a Heaven.

               SHARON 
     Then why should I thank Him for the 
     gift of so much suffering, Mary, so 
     much pain on the Earth that He 
     created. Let me ask Him why? 

               MARY 
     Tell God you love Him. 

               SHARON 
     I can't.

               MARY 
     If you don't tell God that you love 
     Him, you can't go to Heaven. Tell 
     God that you love Him. Mommy! 

               SHARON 
     No.

And then we hear Gabriel's final call. Gabriel's melody is 
like the infinite regression of an image in parallel mirrors, 
and the melody stretches into the end of time. While they 
listen, a gold light, as though a sun is setting, fills 
SHARON'S face. MARY takes her hand and stands beside her. 
The gold light shines on both of them.

               MARY 
     Do you see Heaven? 

               SHARON 
     Yes.

               MARY 
     Isn't it beautiful? 

               SHARON 
     Yes.

MARY lets go of SHARON.

               MARY 
     Do you know how long you have to 
     stay here? 

               SHARON 
     Yes. 

MARY fades away. 

               MARY 
     How long?

And to the darkness, SHARON says:

               SHARON 
     Forever. 

She is alone. We pull back.
