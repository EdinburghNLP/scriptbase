Note from poster to Kubrick newsgroup:

I found this on a bbs a while ago and I thought I'd pass it along to all 
of you Kubrick freaks out there.

Transcriber's note:

For all you Clarke/Kubrick/2001 fans,

I found the original paper copy of this screenplay a while back and felt 
compelled to transcribe it to disk and upload it to various bulletin 
boards for the enjoyment of all.

The final movie deviates from this screenplay in a number of interesting 
ways. I've tried to maintain the format of the original document except 
the number of lines per page of the original. In order to reduce the 
length of this file I've used a bar of "------" to delimit the pages as 
there was a lot of whitespace per original screenplay page.

VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT

The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years,
and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter-
rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent
which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival
had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not
yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or
the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.

INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER

The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and
they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.
About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking
a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.

The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.
As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher
discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know
the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond
his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-
iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then
he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the
hyenas.

Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly
five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over
a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,
and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is
low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he
unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As
he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already

something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those
dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-
tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another
two million years.

EXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS

As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach
the shallow stream.

The Others are already there. They were there on the other
side every day - that did not make it any less annoying.

There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish
them from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As
they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and
shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply
In kind.

The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies
out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of
the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has
staked its claim to its own territory.

EXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES

Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit
and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around
them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential
source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet
all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched
savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;
the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are
slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.

EXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION

The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-
side foraging for roots and occasional berries.

Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,
about fifty feet apart.

The ground is flat for miles around.

Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking
them about 300 yards away.

Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all
directions, but the lion brings one to the ground.

EXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY

It had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no
real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day
with another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a
hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the
finest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he
also collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices
them. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever
likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually
weak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could
hope for.

INT & EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS

Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down
from the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -
but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;
it was merely part of the background of life.

This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,
was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher
crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides
the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.
If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back
to the relative safety of the cave.

Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher's
race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,
and though he could not remember it, when he was young,
Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.
Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high
enough.

He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from
one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the

occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down
there in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,
and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses
Moonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out
such fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.

And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and
fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations
yet to come.

EXT  THE STREAM - INVASION

The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of
the valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that
Moonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the
night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When
they meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a
deeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy
but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds
before the invasion begins.

In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,
shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led
by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.

Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first
advance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations
at the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a
mist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own
territory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.
He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his
experience.

Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing

down, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they
move from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy
they become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original
drive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.

As he sees this, Moonwatcher's own morale immediately
revives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make
reassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill
his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and
leadership.

Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and
the two tribes come to a halt many paces away.

The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended
quickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this
innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the
future. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and
scratch and try to bite each other.

Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,
and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,

he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp,
and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is
so satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening
In Big - Tooth's resistance, that he quickly repeats it.

Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-
watcher keeps up the exhilirating game.

With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the
stream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as
The water's edge.

EXT  CAVE - NEW SOUND

Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is
startled by a sound.

He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his
senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.
Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of
his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The
great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that
betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional
cracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise
that grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous
beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at
concealment, and ignoring all obstacles.

And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not
possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before
in the history of this planet.

EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK

Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he
leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.
He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing
had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even
associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There
is nothing in the least alarming about it.

It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of
some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy
to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.
There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can
compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious
of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.
As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,
hard surface.

After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a
brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it
must have grown during the night. There are many plants
that do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that
seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that
they are small and round, whereas this is large and square;

CONTINUED

but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be
prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.

This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher
to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,
round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few
that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?

A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.
There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he
continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.

EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON

They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the
sound begins.

It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they
stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,
maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube
and hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first
time - and the last, for two million year - the sound of
drumming is heard in Africa.

The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the
hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards
the source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little
dancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that
their descendants will not create for ages yet.

Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting
the hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,
and the hunger in their bellies.

Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes
fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,

rotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-
eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.

Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all
that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It
is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and
shifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four
hominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher's
own tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog
lies near them.

This little family of male and female and two children is gorged
and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a
condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From
time to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the
entrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.
The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally
different scene.

The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;
it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.

CONTINUED

A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids
without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been
the slightest danger to its species.

But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male
suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -
and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon
its skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had
produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.
And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one
amazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.

Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds
itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement
can be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the
pig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene
freezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless
above the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.

The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a
glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if

awakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle
back to their caves.

They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that
night, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears
attuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher
feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge
to kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.

EXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia

Babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-
year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others
threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.
In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions
had changed almost beyond recognition.

They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no
longer haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons
well; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that
the Cube had revealed to them.

They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they
had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.
Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they did
not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing
outside their cave.

But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The
first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids
seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better
nourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for

EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION

With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the
ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-
watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two
consecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,
betraying his presences by a small pebble slide.

When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,
they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound
of the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave
against the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their
strength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.

The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these
creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost
him his life; he goes back to his meal.

The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with
amazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about
fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.

Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps
away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the

onrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-
confidence and bad luck.

The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They
also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to
see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small
rock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to
pay for such a great victory.

                           * * * * * * * *

And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even
Moonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly
unaware of all that it had done.

EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD

From their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of
their own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen
males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-
looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.

The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today
something is different, though the Others do not immediatly
recognize this fact.

Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,
Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and
begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness
never befor seen.

As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the
morning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness
of this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to
an uneasy silence.

At the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They
carry their bone clubs and bone knives.

Led by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-
chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts
the sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their
hearts.

Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who
walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his
hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is
the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,
displaying its frightful fangs.

The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.

Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high.
Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled
standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed
by his band.

The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even
the ability to flee.

Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands

unsurely in front of his band.

Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge,
One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first
displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked
with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club
until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness
down around him.

The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power.

Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the
world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would
think of something.

                             too inquisitive, but perhaps
                             you can clear up the mystery
                             about what's been going on up
                             there.

                             I know what you mean.

                             some extremely odd things
                             happening at Clavius.

                             whenever you phone the base,
                             all you can get is a recording
                             which repeats that the phone
                             lines are temporarily out of

                             that was the explanation, but
                             it's been going on for the past

                             How did they manage to do that
                             without any communication?

                             Clavius Control came on the
                             air just long enough to transmit
                             their refusal.

                             FLOYD
                             Well, that does sound very odd.

                             SMYSLOV
                             Yes, and I'm afaid there's
                             going to be a bit of a row about
                             it. Denying the men permission
                             to land was a direct violation of
                             the I.A.S. convention.

                             FLOYD
                             Yes... Well, I hope the crew
                             got back safely.

                             SMYSLOV
                             Fortunately, they did.

                             FLOYD

                             Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing
                             you on a point you seem reticent
                             to discuss, may I ask you a
                             straightforward question?

                             FLOYD
                             Certainly.

                             SMYSLOV
                             Quite frankly, we have had some
                             very reliable intelligence reports
                             that a quite serious epidemic
                             has broken out at Clavius.
                             Something, apperently, of an
                             unknown origin. Is this, in

                             This epidemic could easily

                             by low-thrust plasma jets which
                             would continue the mild acceler-
                             ation for fifteen minutes. Then
                             the ship would break the bonds of
                             gravity and be a free and indepen-

                             people talk of an epidemic.

                             PILOT
                             I suppose it was bound to happen
                             sooner or later.

                             CO-PILOT
                             Berkeley told me that they think
                             it came from contamination on a
                             returning Mars flight.

                             PILOT
                             Yes, well, whatever it is, they're
                             certainly not fooling around. This
                             is the first flight they allowed
                             in for more than a week.

                             I was working out what this trip

                             by himself and coming back empty.

                             the security arrangements?

                             the ship when we land at Clavius.
                             We have to stay inside for the
                             time it take to refit - about
                             twenty-four hours. And then
                             we're going to back empty.

                             the Auditing Department of the
                             Territorial Administrator and I
                             haven't been able to get her on
                             the phone for the past week or so,
                             and with all these stories one
                             hears, I'm a little concerned
                             about her.

                             FLOYD
                             I see. Well, I'm sorry about that.
                             I wouldn't think there's any cause
                             for alarm.

                             PILOT
                             Yes, well, I wouldn't have been
                             too concerned about it, except
                             I've heard these stories about the
                             epidemic and, as a matter of fact,
                             I've heard that ten people have
                             died already.

                             not apply here, this world had been
                             shaped and molded by other than
                             terrestrial forces, operating over
                             aeons of time unknown to the young,
                             verdant Earth, with its fleeting
                             Ice-Ages, its swiftly rising and
                             falling seas, its mountain ranges
                             dissolving like mists before the
                             dawn. Here was age inconceivable
                             - but not death, for the Moon had
                             never lived until now.

                             Mr. Halvorsen has made known
                             to me some of the conflicting
                             views held by many of you
                             regarding the need for complete
                             security in this matter, and
                             more specifically your strong
                             opposition to the cover story
                             created to give the impression
                             there is an epidemic at the Base.
                             I understand that beyond it being
                             a matter of principle, many of
                             you are troubled by the concern
                             and anxiety this story of an
                             epidemic might cause your
                             relatives and friends on Earth.

                             I can understand and sympathize
                             with your negative views. I have
                             been personally embarrassed by
                             this cover story. But I fully
                             accept the need for absolute
                             secrecy and I hope you will.

                             It should not be difficult for all
                             of you to realise the potential for
                             cutural shock and social
                             disorientation contained in the

                             check out?

                             MICHAELS
                             Yes, it does. The sub-surface
                             structure shows that it was
                             deliberately buried about four
                             million years ago.

                             FLOYD
                             How can you tell it was
                             deliberately buried?

                             FLOYD
                             Any clue as to what it is?

                             MICHAELS
                             Not really. It's completely
                             inert. No sound or energy
                             sources have been detected.
                             The surface is made of
                             something incredibly hard
                             and we've been barely able
                             to scratch it. A laser drill

                             don't want to be too rough until
                             we know a little more.

                             The only thing about it that we are
                             sure of is that it is the first direct
                             evidence of intelligent life beyond
                             the Earth.

                             Four million years ago, something,
                             presumably from the stars, must
                             have swept through the solar
                             system and left this behind.

                             Was it abandoned, forgotten, left
                             for a purpose?

                             The moon would have made an
                             excellent base camp for
                             preliminary Earth surveys.

SOME MORE SILENCE

                             FLOYD
                             Any ideas about the colour?

                             MICHAELS
                             Well, not really. At first glance,
                             black would suggest something
                             sun-powered, but then why would
                             anyone deliberately bury a sun-
                             powered device?

                             FLOYD
                             Has it been exposed to any sun
                             before now?

                             MICHAELS
                             I don't think it has, but I'd
                             like to check that. Simpson,
                             what's the log on that?

                             kept watch on strange stars that
                             no human eye would eever see;
                             magnetometers observed the

                             winds, as the sun breathed million

                             into the faces of its circling

                             strange - the faint yet
                             unmistakable distrubance rippling
                             across the solar system, and
                             quite unlike any natural phenomena
                             it had ever observed in the past.

                             It was also observed by Orbiter

                             artificial Comet-5, heading out
                             into the cold wastes beyond
                             Pluto, along an orbit whose
                             far point it would not reach for

                             All noticed the peculiar burst of
                             energy that leaped from the face
                             of the Moon and moved across
                             the solar system, throwing off a
                             spray of radiation like the wake of

                             Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like
                             your advice on something.

                             BOWMAN
                             Sure, what is it?

                             POOLE
                             Well, it's nothing really important,
                             but it's annoying.

                             BOWMAN
                             What's up?

                             POOLE
                             It's about my salary cheques.

                             BOWMAN
                             Yes?

                             POOLE
                             Well I got the papers on my
                             official up-grading to AGS-19
                             two weeks before we left.

                             I got mine about the same time.

                             POOLE
                             That's right. Well, naturally,
                             I didn't say anything to Payroll.
                             I assumed they'd start paying me
                             at the higher grade on the next pay
                             cheque. But it's been almost
                             three weeks now and I'm still
                             being paid as an AGS-18.

                             BOWMAN
                             Interesting that you mention it,
                             because I've got the same problem.

                             POOLE
                             Really.

                             BOWMAN
                             Yes.

                             POOLE
                             Yesterday, I finally called the
                             Accounting Office at Mission
                             Control, and all they could tell me
                             was that they'd received the AGS-19
                             notification for the other three but
                             not mine, and apparently not yours
                             either.

                             this?

                             POOLE
                             Not really. They just said it might
                             be because we trained at Houston and
                             they trained in Marshall, and that
                             we're being charged against differ-
                             ent accounting offices.

                             BOWMAN
                             It's possible.

                             POOLE
                             Well, what do you think we ought
                             to do about it?

                             BOWMAN
                             I don't think we should make any
                             fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll
                             straighten it out.

                             POOLE
                             I must say, I never did understand
                             why they split us into two groups
                             for training.

                             BOWMAN
                             No. I never did, either.

                             I have trouble keeping their names
                             straight.

                             BOWMAN
                             I suppose the idea was specialized
                             training.

                             POOLE
                             I suppose so. Though, of course,
                             there's a more sinister explanation.

                             BOWMAN
                             Oh?

                             POOLE

                             rumour that went around during
                             orbital check-out.

                             BOWMAN
                             No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.

                             POOLE
                             Oh, well, apparently there's
                             something about the mission that
                             the sleeping beauties know that
                             we don't know, and that's why we
                             were trained separately and
                             that's why they were put to sleep
                             before they were even taken aboard.

                             mission we weren't told.

                             BOWMAN
                             That seems very unlikely.

                             Yes, I thought so.

                             Of course, it would be very easy

                             they might keep something from
                             us, but they'd never keep anything

                             I guess it isn't.

                             the mission are: where are we
                             going, what will we do when we
                             get there, when are we coming
                             back, and... why are we going?

                             (after long silence) Well, as far as
                             I'm concerned, there isn't a damn
                             thing wrong with these units. I
                             think we've got a much more serious
                             problem.

                             I wouldn't worry too much about
                             the computer. First of all,
                             there is still a chance that he
                             is right, despite your tests,
                             and if it should happen again,
                             we suggest eliminating this
                             possibility by allowing the unit
                             to remain in place and seeing
                             whether or not it actually fails.

                             If the computer should turn out
                             to be wrong, the situation is
                             still not alarming. The type
                             of obsessional error he may be
                             guilty of is not unknown among
                             the latest generation of HAL
                             9000 computers.

                             It has almost always revolved
                             around a single detail, such as
                             the one you have described, and
                             it has never interfered with the
                             integrity or reliability of the
                             computer's performance in
                             other areas.

                             No one is certain of the cause
                             of this kind of malfunctioning.
                             It may be over-programming,

                             Sure, Dave, what's up?

                             You know that we checked the two

                             You probably also know that we
                             found them okay.

                             Yes, I know that. But I can
                             assure you that they were about
                             to fail.

                             They are perfectly all right. We

                             capable of being wrong.

                             BOWMAN
                             Hal, is there anything bothering

                             for this problem?

                             HAL
                             Look, Dave, I know that you're

                             to do a competent job, and that
                             you're trying to be helpful, but
                             I can assure the problem
                             is with the AO-units, and with
                             your test gear.

                             an unalterable fact that I am
                             incapable of being wrong.

                             are going to wait and see if it
                             fails, but we are quite sure
                             there is nothing wrong with
                             the unit.

                             If a reasonable waiting period
                             proves us to be correct, we
                             feel now that the computer
                             reliability has been seriously
                             impaired, and presents an
                             unacceptable risk pattern to
                             the mission.

                             We believe, under these
                             circumstances, it would be
                             advisable to disconnect the

                             Dave, but it would be a crying
                             shame, since I am so much
                             more capable of carrying out
                             this mission than you are, and
                             I have such enthusiasm and confi-

                             follow every order I give from

                             the Hal 9000 computer.

                             We believe it all started about two
                             months ago when you and Frank
                             interrogated the computer about
                             the Mission.

                             we've been running through all
                             the monitor tapes. Do you

                             more than to carry out a
                             continuation of the space program
                             and further our general knowledge
                             of the planets. Is this true?

                             HAL'S VOICE
                             That is true.

                             Well, I'm afaid Hal was lying.
                             He had been programmed to lie
                             about this one subject for secur-
                             ity reasons which we'll explain
                             later.

                             The true purpose of the Mission
                             was to have been explained to you
                             by Mission Commander Kaminsky,
                             on his revival. Hal knew this and
                             he knew the actual mission, but
                             he couldn't tell you the truth when
                             you challenged him. Under orders

                             from earth he was forced to lie.

                             In everything except this he had
                             the usual reinforced truth program-
                             ming.

                             We believe his truth programming
                             and the instructions to lie,
                             gradually resulted in an
                             incompatible conflict, and
                             facedc with this dilemman, he
                             developed, for want of a better
                             description, neurotic symptoms.

                             It's not difficult to suppose that
                             these symptoms would centre on
                             the communication link with
                             Earth, for he may have blamed
                             us for his incompatible program-
                             ming.

                             Following this lin of thought, we
                             suspected that the last straw for him
                             was the possibility of disconnection.
                             Since he became operational, he had
                             never known unconsciousness. It
                             must have seemed the equivalent to
                             death.

                             At this point, he, presumably,
                             took whatever actions he thought
                             appropriate to protect himself
                             from what must have seemed to
                             him to be his human tormentors.

                             If I cane speak in human terms,
                             I don't think we can blame him
                             too much. We have ordered him
                             to disobey his conscience.

                             Well, that's it. It's very
                             speculative, but we think it is
                             a possible explanation. Anyway,
                             good luck on the rest of the 
                             Mission and I'm giving you back to

FLOYD'S RECORDED
BRIEFING

                             FLOYD
                             Good day, gentlemen. When you
                             see this briefing, I presume you
                             will be nearing your destination,
                             Saturn. I hope that you've had a
                             pleasant and uneventful trip and
                             that the rest of your mission
                             continues in the same manner. I
                             should like to fill you in on some
                             more of the details on which
                             Mission Commander Kaminsky
                             will have already briefed you.

                             Thirteen months before the launch
                             date of your Saturn mission, on
                             April 12th, 2001, the first evidence
                             for intelligent life outside the Earth
                             was discovered.

                             It was found buried at a depth of
                             fifteen metres in the crater Tycho.
                             No news of this was ever announced,
                             and the event had been kept
                             secret since then, for reasons which
                             I will later explain.

                             Soon after it was uncovered, it
                             emitted a powerful blast of

                             which seems to have triggered
                             by the Lunar sunrise.

                             Luckily for those at the site, it
                             proved harmless.

                             Perhaps you can imagine our
                             astonishment when we later found
                             it was aimed precisely at Saturn.
                             A lot of thought went into the
                             question of wether or not it was
                             sun-triggered, as it seemed
                             illogical to deliberately bury a
                             sun-powered device.

                             Burying it could only shield it
                             from the sun, since its intense
                             magnetic field made it otherwise
                             easily detectable.

                             We finally concluded that the only
                             reason you might bury a sun-
                             powered device would be to keep
                             it inactive until it would be
                             uncovered, at which time it would
                             absorb sunlight and trigger itself.

                             What is its purpose?  I wish we
                             knew. The object was buried on
                             the moon about four million years
                             ago, when our ancestors were
                             primative man-apes.

                             We've examined dozens of theories,
                             but the one that has the most
                             currency at the moment is that
                             the object serves as an alarm.

                             What the purpose of the alarm is,
                             why they wish to have the alarm,
                             whether the alarm represents
                             any danger to us?  These are
                             questions no one can answer.
                             The intentions of an alien world,
                             at least four million years older
                             than we are, cannot be reliably
                             predicted.

                             In view of this, the intelligence
                             and scientific communities felt
                             that any public announcment
                             might lead to significant cultural
                             shock and disorientation.

                             Discussion took place at the 
                             highest levels between govern-

                             only wise and precautionary
                             course to follow was to assume
                             that the intentions of this alien
                             world are potentially dangerous
                             to us, until we have evidence to
                             the contrary.

                             This is, of course, why security
                             has been maintained and why

                             men.

                             But when they looked out across
                             the deeps of space, they felt
                             awe and wonder - and loneliness.

                             In their explorations, they
                             encountered life in many forms,
                             and watched on a thousand worlds
                             the workings of evolution.

                             They saw how often the first faint
                             sparks of intelligence flickered
                             and died in the cosmic night.

                             And because, in all the galaxy,
                             they had found nothing more
                             precious than Mind, they

                              planets, paused briefly above the
                              deserts of dying Mars and
                              presently looked down on Earth.

                              For years they studied, collected
                              and catalogued.

                              When they had learned all they
                              could, they began to modify.

                              They tinkered with the destiny
                              of many species on land and in
                              the ocean, but which of their
                              experiments would succeed
                              they could not know for at least
                              a million years.

                              They were patient, but they were
                              not yet immortal. There was
                              much to do in this Universe of a
                              hundred billion stars. So they
                              set forth once more across the
                              abyss, knowing that they would
                              never come this way again.

                              Nor was there any need. Their
                              wonderful machines could be
                              trusted to do the rest.

                             secret.

                             With a yet slower rhythm than

                             NARRATOR
                             For a few thousand years, they
                             shared their Universe with their
                             machine children; then, realizing
                             that it was folly to linger when
                             their task was done, they passed
                             into history without regret.

                             Not one of them ever looked through
                             his own eyes upon the planet Earth
                             again.

                             But even the age of the Machine
                             Entities passed swiftly. In their
                             ceaseless experimenting, they
                             had learned to store knowledge
                             in the structure of space itself,
                             and to preserve their thoughts
                             for eternity in frozen lattices
                             of light. They could become
                             creatures of radiation, free
                             at last from the tyranny of matter.

                             Now, they were Lords of the
                             galaxy, and beyond the reach
                             of time.

                             They could rove at will among the
                             stars, and sink like a subtle mist
                             through the very interstices of
                             space.

                             But despite their God-like powers,
                             they still watched over the
                             experiments their ancestors
                             had started so many generations
                             ago.

                             The companion of Saturn knew
                             nothing of this, as it orbited
                             in its no man's land between Mimas
                             and the outer edge of rings.

                             It had only to remember and wait,
                             and to look forever Sunward with
                             its strange senses.

                             For many weeks, it had watched
                             the approaching ship. Its long-
                             dead makers had prepared it for
                             many things and this was one of
                             them. And it recognised what
                             was climbing starward from the
                             Sun.

                             If it had been alive, it would have
                             felt excitement, but such an
                             emotion was irrelevant to its
                             great powers.

                             Even if the ship had passed it by,
                             it would not have known the
                             slightest trace of disappointment.

                             It had waited four million years;
                             it was prepared to wait for
                             eternity.

                             Presently, it felt the gentle touch
                             of radiations, trying to probe its
                             secrets.

                             Now, the ship was in orbit and it
                             began to speak, with prime
                             numbers from one to eleven,
                             over and over again.

                             Soon, these gave way to more
                             complex signals at many frequen-
                             cies, ultra-violet, infra-red,
                             X-rays.

                             The machine made no reply. It
                             had nothing to say.

                             Then it saw the first robot
                             probe, which descended and
                             hovered above the chasm.

                             Then, it dropped into darkness.

                             The great machine knew that this
                             tiny scout was reporting back to
                             its parent; but it was too simple,
                             too primative a device to detect
                             the forces that were gathering
                             round it now.

                             Then the pod came, carrying
                             life. The great machine searched
                             its memories.

                             The logic circuits made their
                             decision when the pod had fallen
                             beyond the last faint glow of the
                             reflected Saturnian light.

                             In a moment of time, too short to
                             be measured, space turned and
                             twisted upon itself.
