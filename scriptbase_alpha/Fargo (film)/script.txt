Fargo (1996) movie scriptby Ethan Coen and Joel Coen.Final script.
More info about this movie on IMDb.com


The following text fades in over black:

This is a true story.  The events depicted in this film
took place in Minnesota in 1987.  At the request of the
survivors, the names have been changed.  Out of respect
for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it
occured.

FLARE TO WHITE

FADE IN FROM WHITE

Slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white
particles wave over a white background.  A snowfall.

A car bursts through the curtain of snow.

The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car,
a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales
sticker showing in its rear window.

As the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft,
the title of the film fades in.

     FARGO

Green highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD,
MINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities
diverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another
just after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412.

The car pulls into a Rodeway Inn.


HOTEL LOBBY

A man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch,
goes to the reception desk.  The clerk is an older woman.

          CLERK
     And how are you today, sir?

          MAN
     Real good now.  I'm checking in
     - Mr. Anderson.

The man prints "Jerry Lundega" onto a registration card,
then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print
"Anderson."

As she types into a computer:

          CLERK
     Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're
     still planning on staying with
     us just the night, then?

          ANDERSON
     You bet.


HOTEL ROOM

The man turns on the TV, which shows the local evening news.

          NEWS ANCHOR
     - whether they will go to summer
     camp at all.  Katie Jensen has
     more.

          KATIE
     It was supposed to be a project
     funded by the city council;  it
     was supposed to benefit those
     Fargo-Moorehead children who
     would otherwise not be able to
     afford to attend a lakeshore
     summer camp.  But nobody consulted
     city controller Stu Jacobson...


CHAIN RESTAURANT

Anderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner.  Muzak
plays.  A middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of
regular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other.

          WAITRESS
     Can I warm that up for ya there?

          ANDERSON
     You bet.

The man looks at his watch.


THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story
brick building.  Broken neon at the top of the building
identifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern.  A troll, also in
neon, holds a champagne glass aloft.


INSIDE

The bar is downscale even for this town.  Country music
plays on the jukebox.

Two men are seated in a booth at the back.  One is short,
slight, youngish.  The other man is somewhat older, and
dour.  The table in front of them is littered with empty
long-neck beer bottles.  The ashtray is full.

Anderson approaches.

          ANDERSON
     I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -

          YOUNGER MAN
     You're Jerry Lundegaard?

          JERRY
     Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -

          YOUNGER MAN
     Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
     What gives, man?

          JERRY
     Shep said 8:30.

          YOUNGER MAN
     We been sitting here an hour.
     I've peed three times already.

          JERRY
     I'm sure sorry.  I - Shep told
     me 8:30.  It was a mix-up, I
     guess.

          YOUNGER MAN
     Ya got the car?

          JERRY
     Yah, you bet.  It's in the lot
     there.  Brand-new burnt umber
     Ciera.

          YOUNGER MAN
     Yeah, okay.  Well, siddown then.
     I'm Carl Showalter and this is
     my associate Gaear Grimsrud.

          JERRY
     Yah, how ya doin'.  So, uh, we
     all set on this thing, then?

          YOUNGER MAN
     Sure, Jerry, we're all set.  Why
     wouldn't we be?

          JERRY
     Yah, no, I'm sure you are.  Shep
     vouched for you and all.  I got
     every confidence in you fellas.

They stare at him.  An awkward beat.

          JERRY
     ...  So I guess that's it, then.
     Here's the keys -

          CARL
     No, that's not it, Jerry.

          JERRY
     Huh?

          CARL
     The new vehicle, plus forty
     thousand dollars.

          JERRY
     Yah, but the deal was, the car
     first, see, then the forty
     thousand, like as if it was the
     ransom.  I thought Shep told you -

          CARL
     Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

          JERRY
     Well, okay, it's -

          CARL
     Except that you were gonna be
     here at 7:30.

          JERRY
     Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

          CARL
     Yeah, you already said that.

          JERRY
     Yah.  But it's not a whole pay-
     in-advance deal.  I give you a
     brand-new vehicle in advance and -

          CARL
     I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

          JERRY
     Okay.

          CARL
     I'm not gonna sit here and debate.
     I will say this though:  what Shep
     told us didn't make a whole lot
     of sense.

          JERRY
     Oh, no, it's real sound.  It's
     all worked out.

          CARL
     You want your own wife kidnapped?

          JERRY
     Yah.

Carl Stares.  Jerry looks blankly back.

          CARL
     ...  You - my point is, you pay
     the ransom - what eighty thousand
     bucks? -  I mean, you give us
     half the ransom, forty thousand,
     you keep half.  It's like robbing
     Peter to play Paul, it doesn't
     make any -

          JERRY
     Okay, it's - see, it's not me
     payin' the ransom.  The thing is,
     my wife, she's wealthy - her dad,
     he's real well off.  Now, I'm in
     a bit of trouble -

          CARL
     What kind of trouble are you in,
     Jerry?

          JERRY
     Well, that's, that's, I'm not go
     inta, inta - see, I just need
     money.  Now, her dad's real
     wealthy -

          CARL
     So why don't you just ask him
     for the money?

Grimsrud, the dour man who has not yet spoken, now softly
puts in with a Swedish-accented voice:

          GRIMSRUD
     Or your fucking wife, you know.

          CARL
     Or your fucking wife, Jerry.

          JERRY
     Well, it's all just part of this -
     they don't know I need it, see.
     Okay, so there's that.  And even
     if they did, I wouldn't get it.
     So there's that on top, then.  See,
     these're personal matters.

          CARL
     Personal matters.

          JERRY
     Yah.  Personal matters that
     needn't, uh -

          CARL
     Okay, Jerry.  You're tasking us
     to perform this mission, but you,
     you won't, uh, you won't - aw,
     fuck it, let's take a look at
     that Ciera.


MINNEAPOLIS SUBURBAN HOUSE

Jerry enters through the kitchen door, in a parka and a red
plaid Elmer Fudd hat.  He stamps snow off his feet.  He is
carrying a bag of groceries which he deposits on the kitchen
counter.

          JERRY
     Hon?  Got the growshries.

          VOICE
     Thank you, hon.  How's Fargo?

          JERRY
     Yah, real good.

          VOICE
     Dad's here.


DEN

Jerry enters, pulling off his plaid cap.

          JERRY
     How ya doin', Wade?

Wade Gustafson is mid-sixtyish, vigorous, with a full head
of gray hair.  His eyes remain fixed on the TV.

          WADE
     Yah, pretty good.

          JERRY
     Whatcha watchin' there?

          WADE
     Norstars.

          JERRY
     ...  Who they playin'?

          WADE
     OOOoooh!

His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.


KITCHEN

Jerry walks back in, taking off his coat.  His wife is
putting on an apron.  Jerry nods toward the living room.

          JERRY
     Is he stayin' for supper, then?

          WIFE
     Yah, I think so...  Dad, are you
     stayin' for supper?

          WADE
          (off)
     Yah.


DINING ROOM

Jerry, his wife, Wade and Scotty, twelve years old, sit
eating.

          SCOTTY
     May I be excused?

          JERRY
     Sure, ya done there?

          SCOTTY
     Uh-huh.  Goin' out.

          WIFE
     Where are you going?

          SCOTTY
     Just out.  Just McDonald's.

          JERRY
     Back at 9:30.

          SCOTTY
     Okay.

          WADE
     He just ate.  And he didn't finish.
     He's going to McDonald's instead
     of finishing here?

          WIFE
     He sees his friends there.  It's
     okay.

          WADE
     It's okay?  McDonald's?  What do
     you think they do there?  They
     don't drink milkshakes, I assure
     you!

          WIFE
     It's okay, Dad.

          JERRY
     Wade, have ya had a chance to
     think about, uh, that deal I was
     talkin' about, those forty acres
     there on Wayzata?

          WADE
     You told me about it.

          JERRY
     Yah, you said you'd have a think
     about it.  I understand it's a
     lot of money -

          WADE
     A heck of a lot.  What'd you
     say you were gonna put there?

          JERRY
     A lot.  It's a limited -

          WADE
     I know it's a lot.

          JERRY
     I mean a parking lot.

          WADE
     Yah, well, seven hundred and
     fifty thousand dollars is a lot
     - ha ha ha!

          JERRY
     Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -

          WADE
     I thought you were gonna show
     it to Stan Grossman.  He passes
     on this stuff before it gets
     kicked up to me.

          JERRY
     Well, you know Stan'll say no
     dice.  That's why you pay him.
     I'm asking you here, Wade.  This
     could work out real good for me
     and Jean and Scotty -

          WADE
     Jean and Scotty never have to
     worry.


WHITE

A black like curls through the white.  Twisting perspective
shows that it is an aerial shot of a two-lane highway,
bordered by snowfields.  The highway carries one moving car.


INT. CAR

Carl Showalter is driving.  Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly
out.

After a long beat:

          GRIMSRUD
     Where is Pancakes Hause?

          CARL
     What?

          GRIMSRUD
     We stop at Pancakes Hause.

          CARL
     What're you, nuts?  We had
     pancakes for breakfast.  I gotta
     go somewhere I can get a shot
     and a beer - and a steak maybe.
     Not more fuckin' pancakes.  Come
     on.

Grimsrud gives him a sour look.

          CARL
     ...  Come on, man.  Okay, here's
     an idea.  We'll stop outside of
     Brainerd.  I know a place there
     we can get laid.  Wuddya think?

          GRIMSRUD
     I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.

          CARL
     Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin',
     we'll stop for pancakes, then
     we'll get laid.  Wuddya think?


GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

Jerry is sitting in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just
off the showroom floor.  On the other side of his desk sit
an irate customer and his wife.

          CUSTOMER
     We sat here right in this room and
     went over this and over this!

          JERRY
     Yah, but that TruCoat -

          CUSTOMER
     I sat right here and said I didn't
     want no TruCoat!

          JERRY
     Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat,
     you don't get it and you get
     oxidization problems.  It'll cost
     you a heck of lot more'n five
     hunnert -

          CUSTOMER
     You're sittin' here, you're talkin'
     in circles!  You're talkin' like
     we didn't go over this already!

          JERRY
     Yah, but this TruCoat -

          CUSTOMER
     We had us a deal here for nine-
     teen-five.  You sat there and
     darned if you didn't tell me
     you'd get this car, these options,
     WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nine-
     teen-five!

          JERRY
     Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -

          CUSTOMER
     You called me twenty minutes ago
     and said you had it!  Ready to
     make delivery, ya says!  Come on
     down and get it!  And here ya are
     and you're wastin' my time and
     you're wastin' my wife's time and
     I'm payin' nineteen-five for this
     vehicle here!

          JERRY
     Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...

He rises, and, as he leaves:

          JERRY
     ...  See, they install that TruCoat
     at the factory, there's nothin' we
     can do, but I'll talk to my boss.

The couple watch him go to a nearby cubicle.

          CUSTOMER
     These guys here - these guys!
     It's always the same!  It's always
     more!  He's a liar!

          WIFE
     Please, dear.

          CUSTOMER
     We went over this and over this -


NEARBY CUBICLE

Jerry sits perched on the desk of another salesman who is
eating lunch as he watches a hockey game on a small portable
TV.

          JERRY
     So you're goin' to the Gophers
     on Sunday?

          SALESMAN
     You bet.

          JERRY
     You wouldn't have an extra ticket
     there?

          SALESMAN
     They're playin' the Buckeyes!

          JERRY
     Yah.

          SALESMAN
     Ya kiddin'!


JERRY'S CUBICLE

Jerry re-enters.

          JERRY
     Well, he never done this before,
     but seein' as it's special
     circumstances and all, he says I
     can knock one hunnert off that
     TruCoat.

          CUSTOMER
     One hundred!  You lied to me, Mr.
     Lundegaard.  You're a bald-faced
     liar!

Jerry sits staring at his lap.

          CUSTOMER
     ...  A fucking liar -

          WIFE
     Bucky, please!

Jerry mumbles into his lap:

          JERRY
     One hunnert's the best we can
     do here.

          CUSTOMER
     Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my
     goddamn checkbook.  Let's get this
     over with.


WIDE EXTERIOR:  TRUCK STOP

There is a restaurant with many big rigs parked nearby, and
a motel with an outsize Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox
flanking its sign:  BLUE OX MOTEL.


MOTEL ROOM

Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are in the twin beds
having sex with two truck-stop hookers.

          CARL
     Oh, Jesus, yeah.

          HIS HOOKER
     There ya go, sugar.

          GRIMSRUD
     Nnph.

          HIS HOOKER
     Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.


LATER

The couples like in their respective beds, gazing at the
offscreen TV.

          ED MCMAHON
     -  Johnny's guests tonight will be
     Lee Majors, George Wendt, and Steve
     Boutsikaros from the San Diego Zoo,
     so keep that dial -


LUNDEGAARD KITCHEN

We hear a morning show on television.  Jean Lundegaard is
making coffee in the kitchen as Scott eats cereal at the
table.

          JEAN
     I'm talkin' about your potential.

          SCOTT
          (absently)
     Uh-huh.

          JEAN
     You're not a C student.

          SCOTT
     Uhn.

          JEAN
     And yet you're gettin' C grades.
     It's this disparity there that
     concerns your dad and me.

          SCOTT
     Uh-huh.

          JEAN
     You know what a disparity is?

          SCOTT
          (testily)
     Yeah!

          JEAN
     Okay.  Well, that's why we don't
     want ya goin' out fer hockey.

          SCOTT
     Oh, man!

The phone rings.

          SCOTT
     ...  What's the big deal?  It's
     an hour -

          JEAN
     Hold on.

She picks up the phone.

          JEAN
     ...  Hello?

          PHONE VOICE
     Yah, hiya, hon.

          JEAN
     Oh, hiya, Dad.

          WADE
     Jerry around?

          JEAN
     Yah, he's still here - I'll
     catch him for ya.

She holds the phone away and calls:

          JEAN
     ...  Hon?

          VOICE
     Yah.

          JEAN
     It's Dad.

          VOICE
     Yah...

Jerry enters in shirtsleeves and tie.

          JERRY
     ...  Yah, okay...

          SCOTT
     Look, Dad, there is no fucking
     way -

          JEAN
     Scott!

          JERRY
     Say, let's watch the language -

He takes the phone.

          JERRY
     How ya doin', Wade?

          WADE
     What's goin' on there?

          JERRY
     Oh, nothing, Wade.  How ya doin'
     there?

          WADE
     Stan Grossman looked at your
     proposal.  Says it's pretty
     sweet.

          JERRY
     No kiddin'?

          WADE
     We might be innarested.

          JERRY
     No kiddin'!  I'd need the cash
     pretty quick there.  In order
     to close the deal.

          WADE
     Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk
     about it.  If your numbers are
     right, Stan says its pretty
     sweet.  Stan Grossman.

          JERRY
     Yah.

          WADE
     2:30.

Click.  Dial tone.

          JERRY
     Yah, okay.


GUSTAFSON OLD GARAGE

Jerry wanders through the service area where cars are being
worked on.  He stops by an Indian in blue jeans who is
looking at the underside of a car that sits on a hydraulic
lift with a cage light hanging off its innards.

          JERRY
     Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?

          SHEP
     Mm.

          JERRY
     Say, ya know those two fellas
     ya put me in touch with, up
     there in Fargo?

          SHEP
     Put you in touch with Grimsrud.

          JERRY
     Well, yah, but he had a buddy
     there.  He, uh -

          SHEP
     Well, I don't vouch for him.

          JERRY
     Well, that's okay, I just -

          SHEP
     I vouch for Grimsrud.  Who's his
     buddy?

          JERRY
     Carl somethin'?

          SHEP
     Never heard of him.  Don't vouch
     for him.

          JERRY
     Well, that's okay, he's a buddy
     of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm
     not worryin'.  I just, I was
     wonderin', see, I gotta get in
     touch with 'em for, I might not
     need it anymore, sumpn's happenin',
     see -

          SHEP
     Call 'em up.

          JERRY
     Yah, well, see, I did that, and
     I haven't been able to get 'em,
     so I thought you maybe'd know an
     alternate number or what have ya.

          SHEP
     Nope.

Jerry slaps his fist into his open palm and snaps his
fingers.

          JERRY
     Okay, well, real good, then.


CAR

Carl is driving.  Grimsrud stares out front.

After a beat:

          CARL
     ...  Look at that.  Twin Cities.
     IDS Building, the big glass one.
     Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.
     After the Sears, uh, Chicago...
     You never been to Minneapolis?

          GRIMSRUD
     No.

          CARL
     ...  Would it kill you to say
     something?

          GRIMSRUD
     I did.

          CARL
     "No." First thing you've said
     in the last four hours.  That's
     a, that's a fountain of conversation,
     man.  That's a geyser.  I mean, whoa,
     daddy, stand back, man.  Shit, I'm
     sittin' here driving, man, doin'
     all the driving, whole fuckin' way
     from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to,
     you know, tryin' to chat, keep
     our spirits up, fight the boredom
     of the road, and you can't say one
     fucking thing just in the way of
     conversation.

Grimsurd smokes, gazing out the window.

          CARL
     ...  Well, fuck it, I don't have
     to talk either, man.  See how
     you like it...

He drives.

          CARL
     ...  Total silence...


JERRY'S CUBICLE

He is on the phone.

          JERRY
     Yah, real good.  How you doin'?

          VOICE
     Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.
     You're damned hard to get on the
     phone.

          JERRY
     Yah, it's pretty darned busy here,
     but that's the way we like it.

          VOICE
     That's for sure.  Now, I just
     need, on these last, these financing
     documents you sent us, I can't
     read the serial numbers of the
     vehicles on here, so I -

          JERRY
     But I already got the, it's okay,
     the loans are in place, I already
     got the, the what, the -

          VOICE
     Yeah, the three hundred and twenty
     thousand dollars, you got the money
     last month.

          JERRY
     Yah, so we're all set.

          VOICE
     Yeah, but the vehicles you were
     borrowing on, I just can't read
     the serial numbers on your
     applicaton.  Maybe if you could
     just read them to me -

          JERRY
     But the deal's already done, I
     already got the money -

          VOICE
     Yeah, but we have an audit here,
     I just have to know that these
     vehicles you're financing with
     this money, that they really
     exist.

          JERRY
     Yah, well, they exist all right.

          VOICE
     I'm sure they do - ha ha!  But
     I can't read their serial numbers
     here.  So if you could read me -

          JERRY
     Well, but see, I don't have 'em
     in front a me - why don't I just
     fax you over a copy -

          VOICE
     No, fax is no good, that's what
     I have and I can't read the darn
     thing -

          JERRY
     Yah, okay, I'll have my girl
     send you over a copy, then.

          VOICE
     Okay, because if I can't correlate
     this note with the specific vehicles,
     then I gotta call back that money -

          JERRY
     Yah, how much money was that?

          VOICE
     Three hundred and twenty thousand
     dollars.  See, I gotta correlate
     that money with the cars it's being
     lent on.

          JERRY
     Yah, no problem, I'll just fax
     that over to ya, then.

          VOICE
     No, no, fax is -

          JERRY
     I mean send it over.  I'll shoot
     it right over to ya.

          VOICE
     Okay.

          JERRY
     Okay, real good, then.


CLOSE ON TELEVISION

A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a
kitchen set.

          HOST
     So I seperate the - how the heck
     do I get the egg out of the shell
     without breaking it?

Jean Lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of
coffee, watching the television.

          HOSTESS
     You just prick a little hole in
     the end and blow!

Jean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio
audience.  She hears something else - a faint scraping sound
- and looks up.

          HOST
     Okay, here goes nothing.

The scraping sound persists.  Jean sets down her coffee cup
and rises.

From the studio audience:

          AUDIENCE
     Awoooo!


KITCHEN

We track toward the back door.  A curtain is stretched tight
across its window.

Jean pulls the curtain back.  Bright sunlight amplified by
snow floods in.

A man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock.

Jean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into -

- a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house.

We hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed.

The tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jean's wrist.

She screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps
her gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites
down hard.

He drops her wrist.  As Carl enters, she races up the
stairs.

          GRIMSRUD
     Unguent.

          CARL
     Huh?

Grimsurd looks at his thumb.

          GRIMSRUD
     I need ... unguent.


UPSTAIRS BEDROOM

As the two men enter, a door at the far side is slamming
shut.  A cord snakes in under the door.


MASTER BATHROOM

Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess
phone.

The phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile
floor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its
cord ripped free.

With a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.


BEDROOM

Grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door
and frame, and is working it.


BATHROOM

Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it
open.  Snow that had drifted against the window sifts
lightly in.  Jean steps up onto the toilet.

The door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.

Jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to
the tank.

The groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob
splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor.

The door swings open.

Grimsrud and Carl enter.


THEIR POV

Room empty, window open.

Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out.

Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps
aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent.

He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing
something in the mirror.

The shower curtain is drawn around the tub.

He steps toward it.

As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated
by thrashing limbs.

Jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its
rings and stumbles out into the bedroom.  Grimsrud follows.


BEDROOM

Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain
but awkwardly trying to push it off.


UPSTAIRS LANDING

Still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,
trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the
stairs.

Grimsrud trots down after her.


A PLAQUE:  WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED


INT. WADE'S OFFICE

Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry
enters.

          JERRY
     How ya doin' there, Stan?  How
     are ya, Wade?

Stan Grossman shakes his hand.

          STAN
     Good to see ya again, Jerry.  If
     these numbers are right, this
     looks pretty sweet.

          JERRY
     Oh, those numbers are all right,
     bleemee.

          WADE
     This is do-able.

          STAN
     Congratulations, Jerry.

          JERRY
     Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -

          WADE
     What kind of finder's fee were
     you looking for?

          JERRY
     ...  Huh?

          STAN
     The financials are pretty thorough,
     so the only thing we don't know
     is your fee.

          JERRY
     ...  My fee?  Wade, what the
     heck're you talkin' about?

          WADE
     Stan and I're okay.

          JERRY
     Yah.

          WADE
     We're good to loan in.

          JERRY
     Yah.

          WADE
     But we never talked about your
     fee for bringin' it to us.

          JERRY
     No, but, Wade, see, I was
     bringin' you this deal for you
     to loan me the money to put
     in.  It's my deal here, see?

Wade scowls, looks at Stan.

          STAN
     Jerry - we thought you were
     bringin' us an investment.

          JERRY
     Yah, right -

          STAN
     You're sayin' - what're you
     sayin'?

          WADE
     You're sayin' that we put in
     all the money and you collect
     when it pays off?

          JERRY
     No, no.  I - I'd, I'd - pay you
     back the principal, and interest
     - heck, I'd go - one over prime -

          STAN
     We're not a bank, Jerry.

Wade is angry.

          WADE
     What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted
     bank interest on seven hunnert'n
     fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest
     Federal.  Talk to Bill Diehl.

          STAN
     He's at Norstar.

          WADE
     He's at -

          JERRY
     No, see, I don't need a finder's
     fee, I need - finder's fee's, what,
     ten percent, heck that's not gonna
     do it for me.  I need the principal.

          STAN
     Jerry, we're not just going to
     give you seven hundred and fifty
     thousand dollars.

          WADE
     What the heck were you thinkin'?
     Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank
     interest, I'd look for complete
     security.  Heck, FDIC.  I don't
     see nothin' like that here.

          JERRY
     Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd
     guarantee ya your money back.

          WADE
     I'm not talkin' about your damn
     word, Jerry.  Geez, what the
     heck're you?...  Well, look, I
     don't want to cut you out of the
     loop, but his here's a good deal.
     I assume, if you're not innarested,
     you won't mind if we move on it
     independently.


PARKING LOT

We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.
Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly
out at his sides, his breath vaporizing.  He goes to his
car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper
and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice
that has developed on his windshield.

The scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air.

Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the
windshield and the hood of his car.

The tantrum passes.  Jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing
in particular.

Scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the
windshield.


FRONT DOOR

A beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock.

The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about,
holding a sack of groceries.

          JERRY
     Hon?

He shuts the door.

          JERRY
     ...  Got the growshries...

He has already seen the shower curtain on the floor.  He
frowns, pokes at it with his foot.

          JERRY
     ...  Hon?


UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

Jerry walks in.  He sets the groceries down on the toilet
tank.

He looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts
in.  He shuts it.

He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink,
frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.

He looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings.


FOYER

Once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain.

From another room:

          JERRY
     Yah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I.

Then, slightly more agitated.

          JERRY
     ...  Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's
     Jerry...

Beat.

          JERRY
     ...  Wade, it's Jerry, I - we
     gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible...

Beat.


LIVING ROOM

Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a
telephone.

After a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in
a number.

          JERRY
     ...  Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.


BLACK

Hold in black.

A slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large
paper-mache figure into frame.  It is a flannel-shirt
woodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder.  As
we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing
tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a
pedestal.

A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal:
WELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN.

The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the
background.  The two-lane highway is otherwise empty.


INT. CAR

Carl drives.  Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window.
From the back seat we hear whimpering.

Grimsrud turns to look.

Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a
tarpaulin.

          GRIMSRUD
     Shut the fuck up or I'll throw
     you back in the trunk, you know.

          CARL
     Geez.  That's more'n I've heard
     you say all week.

Grimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window.

At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear
window.  Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on
his gumballs.

Carl eases the car onto the shoulder.

          CARL
     Ah, shit, the tags...

Grimsrud looks at him.

          CARL
     ...  It's just the tags.  I never
     put my tags on the car.  Don't
     worry, I'll take care of this.

He looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on
the gravel shoulder.

          CARL
     ...  Let's keep still back there,
     lady, or we're gonna have to, ya
     know, to shoot ya.

Grimsrud stares at Carl.

          CARL
     ...  Hey!  I'll take care of this!

Both cars have stopped.  Carl looks up at the rear-view
mirror.

The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them,
writing in his citation book.

Carl watches.

We hear the trooper's door open.

The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly
on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night
air.

Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up.

          CARL
     How can I help you, officer?

The trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time.

Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.

Finally:

          TROOPER
     This is a new car, then, sir?

          CARL
     It certainly is, officer.  Still
     got that smell!

          TROOPER
     You're required to display
     temporary tags, either in the
     plate area or taped inside the
     back window.

          CARL
     Certainly -

          TROOPER
     Can I see your license and
     registration please?

          CARL
     Certainly.

He reaches for his wallet.

          CARL
     ...  I was gonna tape up the
     temporary tag, ya know, to be
     in full compliance, but it, uh,
     it, uh ... must a slipped my
     mind...

He extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty-
dollar bill protruding from it.

          CARL
     ...  So maybe the best thing
     would be to take care of that,
     right here in Brainerd.

          TROOPER
     What's this, sir?

          CARL
     That's my license and regis-
     tration.  I wanna be in
     compliance.

He forces a laugh.

          CARL
     ...  I was just thinking I could
     take care of it right here.  In
     Brainerd.

The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold
and hands the billfold back into the car.

          TROOPER
     Put that back in your pocket,
     please.

Carl's nervous smile fades.

          TROOPER
     ...  And step out of the car,
     please, sir.

Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.

There is a whimpering sound.

The policeman hesitates.

Another sound.

The policeman leans forward into the car, listening.

Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair
and slams his head down onto the car door.

The policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and
throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car.

With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment.  He
brings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG -
into the back of the trooper's head.

Jean screams.

          GRIMSRUD
     Shut up.

He releases the policeman.

The policeman's head slides out the window and his body
flops back onto the street.

Carl looks out at the cop in the road.

          CARL
          (softly)
     Whoa...  Whoa, Daddy.

Grimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails
it out the open window.

          GRIMSRUD
     You'll take care of it.  Boy, you
     are smooth smooth, you know.

          CARL
     Whoa, Daddy.

Jean, for some reason, screams again.  Then stops.

          GRIMSRUD
     Clear him off the road.

          CARL
     Yeah.

He gets out.


EXT. ROAD

Carl leans down to hoist up the body.

Headlights appear:  an oncoming car.


INT. CIERA

Grimsrud notices.


EXT. ROAD

The car approaches, slowing.

Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen
in the headlights.

The car accelerates and roars past and away.  We just make
out the silhouettes of two occupants in front.


INT. CIERA

Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat.  He squeals into a U-
turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin.

Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead.  The pursued car
churns up fine snow.

Grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in
his ashtray.  We hear the churning of the car wheels and the
pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside.

In the back seat, Jean starts screaming.

Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights.

He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.

The red tail lights ahead start to turn.  With a distant
crunching sound, they disappear.

The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn.

Grimsrud frowns and slows.

His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled
around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn.

Grimsrud brakes.

Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell.

Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his
door and gets out.


EXT. ROAD

The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield
abutting the highway.  A young man in a down parka is
limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car.

Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy.  He
raises his gun and fires.

With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back
and he pitches into the snow.

Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open
door.

A young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage,
injured.

Snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck.

Grimsrud raises his gun and fires.


AN OIL PAINTING

A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland.  The
room in which it hangs is dark.  We hear off-screen snoring.

We track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half-
completed oil of a grey mallard.

The continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping.  The
man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied.  His
mouth is agape.  He snores.  His arms are flung over a woman
in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not
snoring.

We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and
snoring.

The phone rings.

The woman stirs.

          WOMAN
     Oh, geez...

She reaches for the phone.

          WOMAN
     ...  Hi, it's Marge...

The man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble.

          MARGE
     ...  Oh, my.  Where?...  Yah...
     Oh, geez...

The man sits up, gazes stupidly about.

          MARGE
     ...  Okay.  There in a jif...
     Real good, then.

She hangs up.

          MARGE
     ...  You can sleep, hon.  It's
     early yet.

          MAN
     Gotta go?

          MARGE
     Yah.

The man swings his legs out.

          MAN
     I'll fix ya some eggs.

          MARGE
     That's okay, hon.  I gotta run.

          MAN
     Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.
     I'll fix ya some eggs.

          MARGE
     Aw, you can sleep, hon.

          MAN
     Ya gotta eat a breakfast...

He clears his throat with another deep rumble.

          MAN
     ...  I'll fix ya some eggs.

          MARGE
     Aw, Norm.


PLATE

Leavings of a huge plate of eggs, ham, toast.

Wider, we see Marge now wearing a beige police uniform.  A
patch on one arm says BRAINERD POLICE DEPARTMENT.  She wears
a heavy belt holding a revolver, walkie-talkie and various
other jangling police impedimenta.  Norm is in a dressing
gown.

          MARGE
     Thanks, hon.  Time to shove off.

          NORM
     Love ya, Margie.

As she struggles into a parka:

          MARGE
     Love ya, hon.

He is exiting back to the bedroom; she exits out the front
door.


EXT. GUNDERSON HOUSE

Dawn.  Marge is making her way down the icy front stoop to
her prowler.


INT. GUNDERSON HOUSE

Norm sits back onto the bed, shrugging off his robe.  Off-
screen we hear the front door open.


FRONT DOOR

Marge stamps the snow off her shoes.

          MARGE
     Hon?

          NORM
          (off)
     Yah?

          MARGE
     Prowler needs a jump.


HIGHWAY

Two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of
the road, a pair of men inside each car.

The first car's driver door opens and a figure in a parka
emerges, holding two styrofoam cups.  His partner leans
across the seat to close the door after him.

The reverse shows Marge approaching from her own squad car.

          MARGE
     Hiya, Lou.

          LOU
     Margie.  Thought you might need
     a little warm-up.

He hands her one of the cups of coffee.

          MARGE
     Yah, thanks a bunch.  So what's
     the deal, now?  Gary says triple
     homicide?

          LOU
     Yah, looks pretty bad.  Two
     of'm're over here.

Marge looks around as they start walking.

          MARGE
     Where is everybody?

          LOU
     Well - it's cold, Margie.


BY THE WRECK

Laid out in the early morning light is the wrecked car, a
pair of footprints leading out to a man in a bright orange
parka face down in the bloodstained snow, and one pair of
footsteps leading back to the road.

Marge is peering into the car.

          MARGE
     Ah, geez.  So...  Aw, geez.
     Here's the second one...  It's
     in the head and the ... hand
     there, I guess that's a defensive
     wound.  Okay.

Marge looks up from the car.

          MARGE
     ...  Where's the state trooper?

Lou, up on the shoulder, jerks his thumb.

          LOU
     Back there a good piece.  In
     the ditch next to his prowler.

Marge looks around at the road.

          MARGE
     Okay, so we got a state trooper
     pulls someone over, we got a
     shooting, and these folks drive
     by, and we got a high-speed
     pursuit, ends here, and this
     execution-type deal.

          LOU
     Yah.

          MARGE
     I'd be very surprised if our
     suspect was from Brainerd.

          LOU
     Yah.

Marge is studying the ground.

          MARGE
     Yah.  And I'll tell you what, from
     his footprints he looks like a big
     fella -

Marge suddenly doubles over, putting her head between her
knees down near the snow.

          LOU
     Ya see something down there, Chief?

          MARGE
     Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.

          LOU
     Geez, you okay, Margie?

          MARGE
     I'm fine - it's just morning
     sickness.

She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees.

          MARGE
     ...  Well, that passed.

          LOU
     Yah?

          MARGE
     Yah.  Now I'm hungry again.

          LOU
     You had breakfast yet, Margie?

          MARGE
     Oh, yah.  Norm made some eggs.

          LOU
     Yah?  Well, what now, d'ya think?

          MARGE
     Let's go take a look at that
     trooper.


BY THE STATE TROOPER'S CAR

Marge's prowler is parked nearby.

Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch,
again looking at footprints in the snow.  She calls up to
the road:

          MARGE
     There's two of 'em, Lou!

          LOU
     Yah?

          MARGE
     Yah, this guy's smaller than
     his buddy.

          LOU
     Oh, yah?


DOWN IN THE DITCH

In the foreground is the head of the state trooper, facing
us.  Peering at it from behind, still on her hands and
knees, is Marge.

          MARGE
     For Pete's sake.

She gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out
of the ditch.

          LOU
     How's it look, Marge?

          MARGE
     Well, he's got his gun on his hip
     there, and he looks like a nice
     enough guy.  It's a real shame.

          LOU
     Yah.

          MARGE
     You haven't monkeyed with his car
     there, have ya?

          LOU
     No way.

She is looking at the prowler, which still idles on the
shoulder.

          MARGE
     Somebody shut his lights.  I guess
     the little guy sat in there, waitin'
     for his buddy t'come back.

          LOU
     Yah, woulda been cold out here.

          MARGE
     Heck, yah.  Ya think, is Dave open
     yet?

          LOU
     You don't think he's mixed up in -

          MARGE
     No, no, I just wanna get Norm some
     night crawlers.


INT. PROWLER

Marge is driving; Lou sits next to her.

          MARGE
     You look in his citation book?

          LOU
     Yah...

He looks at his notebook.

          LOU
     ...  Last vehicle he wrote in
     was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.
     Under the plate number he put
     DLR - I figure they stopped him
     or shot him before he could finish
     fillin' out the tag number.

          MARGE
     Uh-huh.

          LOU
     So I got the state lookin' for a
     Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.
     They don't got no match yet.

          MARGE
     I'm not sure I agree with you a
     hunnert percent on your policework,
     there, Lou.

          LOU
     Yah?

          MARGE
     Yah, I think that vehicle there
     probly had dealer plates.  DLR?

          LOU
     Oh...

Lou gazes out the window, thinking.

          LOU
     ...  Geez.

          MARGE
     Yah.  Say, Lou, ya hear the one
     about the guy who couldn't afford
     personalized plates, so he went
     and changed his name to J2L 4685?

          LOU
     Yah, that's a good one.

          MARGE
     Yah.


THE ROAD

The police car enters with a whoosh and hums down a straight-
ruled empty highway, cutting a landscape of flat and perfect
white.


EMBERS FAMILY RESTAURANT

Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit in a booth, sipping
coffee.  Outside the window, snow falls from a gunmetal sky.

          WADE
     -  All's I know is, ya got a
     problem, ya call a professional!

          JERRY
     No!  They said no cops!  They were
     darned clear on that, Wade!  They
     said you call the cops and we -

          WADE
     Well, a course they're gonna say
     that!  But where's my protection?
     They got Jean here!  I give these
     sons a bitches a million dollars,
     where's my guarantee they're gonna
     let her go.

          JERRY
     Well, they -

          WADE
     A million dollars is a lot a damn
     money!  And there they are, they
     got my daughter!

          JERRY
     Yah, but think this thing through
     here, Wade.  Ya give 'em what they
     want, why wont' they let her go?
     You gotta listen to me on this one,
     Wade.

          WADE
     Heck, you don't know!  You're just
     whistlin' Dixie here!  I'm sayin',
     the cops, they can advise us on
     this!  I'm sayin' call a professional!

          JERRY
     No!  No cops!  That's final!  This
     is my deal here, Wade!  Jean is
     my wife here!

          STAN
     I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin'
     to Jerry's viewpoint here.

          WADE
     Well -

          STAN
     We gotta protect Jean.  These -
     we're not holdin' any cards here,
     Wade, they got all of 'em.  So
     they call the shots.

          JERRY
     You're darned tootin'!

          WADE
     Ah, dammit!

          STAN
     I'm tellin' ya.

          WADE
     Well...  Why don't we...

He saws a finger under his nose.

          WADE
     ...  Stan, I'm thinkin' we should
     offer 'em half a million.

          JERRY
     Now come on here, no way, Wade!
     No way!

          STAN
     We're not horse-trading here, Wade,
     we just gotta bite the bullet on
     this thing.

          JERRY
     Yah!

          STAN
     What's the next step here, Jerry?

          JERRY
     They're gonna call, give me
     instructions for a drop.  I'm
     supposed to have the money ready
     tomorrow.

          WADE
     Dammit!


THE CASHIER

She rings up two dollars forty.

          CASHIER
     How was everything today?

          JERRY
     Yah, real good now.


PARKING LOT

Snow continues to fall.  Jerry and Stan stand bundled in
their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles.
Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for
Stan.

          STAN
     Okay.  We'll get the money together.
     Don't worry about it, Jerry.  Now,
     d'you want anyone at home, with you,
     until they call?

          JERRY
     No, I - they don't want - they're
     just s'posed to be dealin' with
     me, they were real clear.

          STAN
     Yah.

Jerry pounds his mittened hands together against the cold.

          JERRY
     Ya know, they said no one listenin'
     in, they'll be watchin', ya know.
     Maybe it's all bull, but like you
     said, Stan, they're callin' the
     shots.

          STAN
     Okay.  And Scotty, is he gonna
     be all right?

          JERRY
     Yah, geez, Scotty.  I'll go talk
     to him.

There is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the
Lincoln.

          STAN
     We'll call.

The Lincoln spits snow as it grinds out of the lot and
fishtails out onto the boulevard.


SCOTTY'S BEDROOM

Scotty lies on the bed, weeping.  Jerry enters and perches
uncomfortably on the edge of his bed.

          JERRY
     ...  How ya doin' there, Scotty?

          SCOTT
     Dad!  What're they doing?  Wuddya
     think they're doin' with Mom?

          JERRY
     It's okay, Scotty.  They're not
     gonna want to hurt her any.
     These men, they just want money,
     see.

          SCOTT
     What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?

          JERRY
     No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here.
     Grandad and I, we're - we're makin'
     sure this gets handled right.

Scott snorfles and sits up.

          SCOTT
     Dad, I really think we should call
     the cops.

          JERRY
     No!  We can't let anyone know about
     this thing!  We gotta play ball with
     these guys - you ask Stan Grossman,
     he'll tell ya the same thing!

          SCOTT
     Yeah, but -

          JERRY
     We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but
     we gotta play ball.  Ya know, that's
     the deal.  Now if Lorraine calls, or
     Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in
     Florida with Pearl and Marty...

Scotty starts to weep again.  Jerry stares down at his lap.

          JERRY
     ...  That's the best we can do here.


EXT. CABIN

It is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white.  A brown Ciera
with dealer plates is pulling into the drive.

Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out
of the driver's.  Grimsrud opens the back door and, with an
arm on her elbow, helps Jean out.  She has her hands tied
behind her and a black hood over her head.

With a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and
lurches away across the front lawn.  Grimsrud moves to
retrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his
shoulder.

          CARL
     Hold it.

They both look out at the front lawn, Grimsrud
expressionless, Carl smiling.

With muffled cries, the hooded woman lurches across the
unbroken snow, staggering this way and that, stumbling on
the uneven terrain.

She stops, stands still, her hooded head swaying.

She lurches out in an arbitrary direction.  Going downhill,
she reels, staggers, and falls face-first into the snow,
weeping.

          CARL
     Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Jesus!

Grimsrud, still expressionless, breaks away from Carl's
restraining hand to retrieve her.


BRAINERD POLICE HEADQUARTERS

We track behind Marge as she makes her way across the floor,
greeting various officers.  She holds a small half-full
paper sack.

Beyond her we see a small glassed-in cublcle.  Norm sits at
the desk inside with a box lunch spread out in front of him.
There is lettering on the cubicle's glass door:  BRAINERD
PD. CHIEF GUNDERSON.

Marge enters and sits behind the desk, detaching her walkie-
talkie from her utility belt to accomodate the seat.

          MARGE
     Hiya, hon.

She slides the paper sack toward him.

          NORM
     Brought ya some lunch, Margie.
     What're those, night crawlers?

He looks inside.

The bottom of the sack is full of fat, crawling earthworms.

          MARGE
     Yah.

          NORM
     Thanks, hon.

          MARGE
     You bet.  Thanks for lunch.  What
     do we got here, Arbie's?

          NORM
     Uh-huh.

She starts eating.

          MARGE
     ...  How's the paintin' goin'?

          NORM
     Pretty good.  Found out the Hautmans
     are entering a painting this year.

          MARGE
     Aw, hon, you're better'n them.

          NORM
     They're real good.

          MARGE
     They're good, Norm, but you're
     better'n them.

          NORM
     Yah, ya think?

He leans over and kisses her.

          MARGE
     Ah, ya got Arbie's all o'er me.

Lou enters.

          LOU
     Hiya, Norm, how's the paintin'
     goin'?

          NORM
     Not too bad.  You know.

          MARGE
     How we doin' on that vehicle?

          LOU
     No motels registered any tan Ciera
     last night.  But the night before,
     two men checked into the Blue Ox
     registering a Ciera and leavin' the
     tag space blank.

          MARGE
     Geez, that's a good lead.  The
     Blue Ox, that's that trucker's
     joint out there on I-35?

          LOU
     Yah.  Owner was on the desk then,
     said these two guys had company.

          MARGE
     Oh, yah?


EXT. STRIPPER CLUB

Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot.  Snow
drifts down.


INT. STRIPPER CLUB

Marge sits talking with two young women at one end of an
elevated dance platform.  The club, not yet open for
business, is deserted.

          MARGE
     Where you girls from?

          HOOKER ONE
     Chaska.

          HOOKER TWO
     LeSeure.  But I went to high school
     in White Bear Lake.

          MARGE
     Okay, I want you to tell me what
     these fellas looked like.

          HOOKER ONE
     Well, the little guy, he was
     kinda funny-looking.

          MARGE
     In what way?

          HOOKER ONE
     I dunno.  Just funny-looking.

          MARGE
     Can you be any more specific?

          HOOKER ONE
     I couldn't really say.  He wasn't
     circumcised.

          MARGE
     Was he funny-looking apart from
     that?

          HOOKER ONE
     Yah.

          MARGE
     So you were having sex with the
     little fella, then?

          HOOKER ONE
     Uh-huh.

          MARGE
     Is there anything else you can
     tell me about him?

          HOOKER ONE
     No.  Like I say, he was funny-looking.
     More'n most people even.

          MARGE
     And what about the other fella?

          HOOKER TWO
     He was a little older.  Looked like
     the Marlboro man.

          MARGE
     Yah?

          HOOKER TWO
     Yah.  Maybe I'm sayin' that cause
     he smoked Marlboros.

          MARGE
     Uh-huh.

          HOOKER TWO
     A subconscious-type thing.

          MARGE
     Yah, that can happen.

          HOOKER TWO
     Yah.

          HOOKER ONE
     They said they were goin' to the
     Twin Cities?

          MARGE
     Oh, yah?

          HOOKER TWO
     Yah.

          HOOKER ONE
     Yah.  Is that useful to ya?

          MARGE
     Oh, you bet, yah.


EXT. LAKESIDE CABIN

It is now dusk.  The brown Ciera with dealer plates still
sits in the drive.


INT. CABIN

We track in on Jean Lundegaard, who sits tied in a chair
with the black hood still over her head.  As we track in, we
hear inarticulate cursing, intermittent banging and loud
static.

We track in on Gaear Grimsrud, who sits smoking a cigarette
and expressionlessly gazing offscreen.

We track in on Carl Showalter, who stands over an old black-
and-white television.  It plays nothing but snow.  Carl is
banging on it as he mutters:

          CARL
     ...days ... be here for days with
     a - DAMMIT! - a goddamn mute ...
     nothin' to do ... and the fucking -
     DAMMIT!...

Each "dammit" brings a pound of his fist on the TV.

          CARL
     ...  TV doesn't even ... plug me
     in, man...  Gimmee a - DAMMIT! -
     signal...  Plug me into the
     ozone, baby...  Plug me into the
     ozone - FUCK!...

With one last bang we cut:


BACK TO THE TELEVISION SET

In extreme close-up an insect is lugging a worm.

          TV VOICE-OVER
     The bark beetle carries the worm
     to the nest ... where it will feed
     its young for up to six weeks...

A pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's
house.

Marge and Norm are watching television in bed.  From the TV
we hear insects chirring.

After a long beat, silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs,
still looking at the set:

          MARGE
     ...  Well, I'm turnin' in, Norm.

Also looking at the TV:

          NORM
     ...  Oh, yah?

Marge rolls over and Norm continues to watch.

We hold.


BLACK

Hold.

A snowflake drops through the black.

Another flake.

It starts snowing.


BRAINERD MAIN STREET

The lone traffic light blinks slowly, steadily, red.  Snow
sifts down.  There is no other movement.


PAUL BUNYAN

We are looking up at the bottom-lit statue.  Snow falls.


HIGH SHOT OF MARGE'S HOUSE

Snow drops away.


HIGH SHOT IN MARGE'S BEDROOM

The bedroom is dark.  Norm is snoring.

The phone rings.

Marge gropes in the dark.

          MARGE
     Hello?

          VOICE
     Yah, is this Marge?

          MARGE
     Yah?

          VOICE
     Margie Olmstead?

          MARGE
     ...  Well, yah.  Who's this?

          VOICE
     This is Mike Yanagita.  Ya know
     - Mike Yanagita.  Remember me?

          MARGE
     ...  Mike Yanagita!

          MIKE
     Yah!

Marge props herself up next to the still-sleeping Norm.

          MARGE
     Yah, yah, course I remember.
     How are ya?  What time is it?

          MIKE
     Oh, geez.  It's quarter to eleven.
     I hope I dint wake you.

          MARGE
     No, that's okay.

          MIKE
     Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities
     and I was just watching on TV
     about these shootings up in
     Brainderd, and I saw you on the
     news there.

          MARGE
     Yah.

          MIKE
     I thought, geez, is that Margie
     Olmstead?  I can't believe it!

          MARGE
     Yah, that's me.

          MIKE
     Well, how the heck are ya?

          MARGE
     Okay, ya know.  Okay.

          MIKE
     Yah?

          MARGE
     Yah - how are you doon?

          MIKE
     Oh, pretty good.

          MARGE
     Heck, it's been such a long time,
     Mike.  It's great to hear from ya.

          MIKE

JERRY'S CUBICLE

He sits in and picks up his phone.

          JERRY
     Jerry Lundegaard.

          VOICE
     All right, Jerry, you got this
     phone to yourself?

          JERRY
     Well ... yah.

          VOICE

          JERRY
     Well, yah, I got an idea.  How's

          VOICE
     Circumstances have changed, Jerry.

          JERRY
     Well, what do ya mean?

          VOICE
     Things have changed.  Circumstances,
     Jerry.  Beyond the, uh ... acts of
     God, force majeure...

          JERRY
     What the - how's Jean?

A beat.

          CARL
     ...  Who's Jean?

          JERRY
     My wife!  What the - how's -

          CARL
     Oh, Jean's okay.  But there's
     three people up in Brainerd who
     aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.

          JERRY
     What the heck're you talkin' about?
     Let's just finish up this deal
     here -

          CARL
     Blood has been shed, Jerry.

Jerry sits dumbly.  The voice solemnly repeats:

          CARL
     ...  Blood has been shed.

          JERRY
     What the heck d'ya mean?

          CARL
     Three people.  In Brainerd.

          JERRY
     Oh, geez.

          CARL
     That's right.  And we need more
     money.

          JERRY
     The heck d'ya mean?  What a you
     guys got yourself mixed up in?

          CARL
     We need more -

          JERRY
     This was s'posed to be a no-rough
     -stuff-type deal -

          CARL
     DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY!
     JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!

          JERRY
     Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -

          CARL
     Look.  I'm not gonna debate you,
     Jerry.  The price is now the whole
     amount.  We want the entire eighty
     thousand.

          JERRY
     Oh, for Chrissakes here -

          CARL
     Blood has been shed.  We've incurred
     risks, Jerry.  I'm coming into town
     tomorrow.  Have the money ready.

          JERRY
     Now we had a deal here!  A deal's
     a deal!

          CARL
     IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three
     pour souls up in Brainerd if a
     deal's a deal!  Go ahead, ask 'em!

          JERRY
     ...  The heck d'ya mean?

          CARL
     I'll see you tomorrow.

Click.

Jerry slams down the phone, which immediately rings.  He
angrily snatches it up.

          JERRY
     Yah!

          VOICE
     Jerome Lundegaard?

          JERRY
     Yah!

          VOICE
     This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC.
     Sir, I have not yet recieved those
     vehicle IDs you promised me.

          JERRY
     Yah!  I ... those are in the mail.

          VOICE
     Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may
     be.  I must inform you, however,
     that absent the reciept of those
     numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I
     will have to refer this matter to
     our legal department.

          JERRY
     Yah.

          VOICE
     My patience is at an end.

          JERRY
     Yah.

          VOICE
     Good day, sir.

          JERRY
     ...  Yah.


WIDE ON THE CUBICLE

We are looking at Jerry's cubicle from across the showroom.
Noise muted by distance, we watch Jerry slam down the
reciever, rise to his feet, fling the phone to the floor,
raise his desk blotter high over his head with pens and
pencils rolling off it and slam it onto his desktop.

He stands for a moment, hands on hips, glaring.

He stoops and picks up the phone, places it back on the
desktop, starts picking up the pens and pencils.


TRACK

On steam-table bins of food, each identified by a plaque:
BEEF STROGANOFF, SWEDISH MEATBALLS, BROILED TORSK, CHICKEN
FLORENTINE.

A complementary track shows two rays being pushed along a
buffet line, piled high with many foods.


MARGE AND NORM AT A TABLE

They sit next to each other at a long cafateria-style
Formica table, silently eating.

A hip with a hissing walkie-talkie enters frame.

          GARY
     Hiya, Norm.  How ya doin', Margie?
     How's the fricasse?

          MARGE
     Pretty darn good, ya want some?

          GARY
     No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought
     you were goin' fishin' up at Mile
     Lacs?

          NORM
     Yah, after lunch.

He goes back to his food.

          MARGE
     Whatcha got there?

Gary hands her a flimsy.  Marge takes it with one hand and
looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food.

          GARY
     The numbers y'asked for, calls
     made from the lobby pay phone
     at the Blue Ox.  Two to Minneapolis
     that night.

          MARGE
     Mm.

          GARY
     First one's a trucking company,
     second one's a private residence.
     A Shep Proudfoot.

          MARGE
     Uh-huh...  A what?

          GARY
     Shep Proudfoot.  That's a name.

          MARGE
     Uh-huh.

          GARY
     Yah.

          MARGE
     ...  Yah, okay, I think I'll
     drive down there, then.

          GARY
     Oh, yah?  Twin Cities?

Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at
Marge with mild interest.  He stares for a beat as he
finishes chewing, and them swallows and says:

          NORM
     ...  Oh, yah?


KITCHEN OF LUNDEGAARD HOUSE

Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table.
It is night.  The scene is harshly toplit by a hanging
fixture.  On the table are the remains of coffee and a
cinammon filbert ring.

          WADE
     Dammit!  I wanna be a part a
     this thing!

          JERRY
     No, Wade!  They were real clear!
     They said they'd call tomorrow,
     with instructions, and it's gonna
     be delivered by me alone!

          WADE
     It's my money, I'll deliver it
     - what do they care?

          STAN
     Wade's got a point there.  I'll
     handle the call if you want, Jerry.

          JERRY
     No, no.  See - they, no, see, they
     only deal with me.  Ya feel this,
     this nervousness on the phone there,
     they're very - these guys're
     dangerous -

          WADE
     All the more reason!  I don't want
     you - with all due respect, Jerry
     - I don't want you mucking this up.

          JERRY
     The heck d'ya mean?

          WADE
     They want my money, they can deal
     with me.  Otherwise I'm goin' to
     a professional.

He points at a briefcase.

          WADE
     ...  There's a million dollars
     here!

          JERRY
     No, see -

          WADE
     Look, Jerry, you're not sellin'
     me a damn car.  It's my show here.
     That's that.

          STAN
     It's the way we prefer to handle
     it, Jerry.


THE DOWNTOWN RADISSON HOTEL

Marge is at the reception desk.

          MARGE
     How ya doin'?

          CLERK
     Real good.  How're you today, ma'am?

          MARGE
     Real good.  I'm Mrs. Gunderson, I
     have a reservation.

The clerk types into a computer console.

          CLERK
     You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

          MARGE
     Is there a phone down here, ya think?


LOBBY CORNER

Marge is on a public phone.

          MARGE
     ...  Detective Sibert?  Yah, this
     is Marge Gunderson from up Brainerd,
     we spoke -  Yah.  Well, actually
     I'm in town here.  I had to do a
     few things in the Twin Cities, so
     I thought I'd check in with ya about
     that USIF search on Shep Proudfoot...
     Oh, yah?...  Well, maybe I'll go
     visit with him if I have the...  No,
     I can find that...  Well, thanks a
     bunch.  Say, d'ya happen to know a
     good place for lunch in the downtown
     area?...  Yah, the Radisson...  Oh,
     yah?  Is it reasonable?


A GREEN FREEWAY SIGN

Through a windshield we see a sign for the MINNEAPOLIS
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.


ROOFTOP PARKING LOT

The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy S-curves around the
few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot.

It stops by one car and Carl emerges.  He quickly scans the
lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car
and starts unscrewing its license plate.


EXIT BOOTH

Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket.

          CARL
     Yeah, I decided not to park here.

The attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket.

          ATTENDANT
     ...  What do you mean, you decided
     not to park here?

          CARL
     Yeah, I just came in.  I decided
     not to park here.

The attendant is still puzzled.

          ATTENDANT
     You, uh...  I'm sorry, sir, but -

          CARL
     I decided not to - I'm, uh, not
     taking the trip as it turns out.

          ATTENDANT
     I'm sorry, sir, we do have to
     charge you the four dollars.

          CARL
     I just pulled in here.  I just
     fucking pulled in here!

          ATTENDANT
     Well, see, there's a minimum charge
     of four dollars.  Long-term parking
     charges by the day.

A car behind beeps.  Carl glances back, starts digging for
money.

          CARL
     I guess you think, ya know, you're
     an authority figure.  With that
     stupid fucking uniform.  Huh, buddy?

The attendant doesn't say anything.

          CARL
     ...  King Clip-on Tie here.  Big
     fucking man.

He is peeling off one dollar bills.

          CARL
     ...  You know, these are the limits
     of your life, man.  Ruler of your
     little fucking gate here.  There's
     your four dollars.  You pathetic
     piece of shit.


GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

Jerry is staring up, mouth agape, at the underside of a car
on a hydraulic lift.  Bewildered, he looks about, then asks
a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the
shop.

          JERRY
     Where's Shep?

The mechanic points.

          MECHANIC
     Talkin' to a cop.

Jerry looks.

          JERRY
     ...  Cop?

Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor
in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle.

          MECHANIC
     Said she was a policewoman.

Marge and Shep silently talk.

Jerry stares, swallows.


INSIDE THE CUBICLE

          MARGE
     - Wednesday night?

Shep is shaking his head.

          SHEP
     Nope.

          MARGE
     Well, you do reside their at
     1425 Fremont Terrace?

          SHEP
     Yep.

          MARGE
     Anyone else residing there?

          SHEP
     Nope.

          MARGE
     Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
     came in past three in the morning.
     It's just hard for me to believe
     you can't remember anyone calling.

Shep says nothing.

          MARGE
     ...  Now, I know you've had some
     problems, struggling with the
     narcotics, some other entanglements,
     currently on parole -

          SHEP
     So?

          MARGE
     Well, associating with criminals,
     if you're the one they talked to,
     that right there would be a
     violation of your parole and would
     end with you back in Stillwater.

          SHEP
     Uh-huh.

          MARGE
     Now, I saw some rough stuff on
     your priors, but nothing in the
     nature of a homicide...

Shep stares at her.

          MARGE
     ...  I know you don't want to be
     an accessory to something like
     that.

          SHEP
     Nope.

          MARGE
     So you think you might remember
     who those folks were who called
     ya?


JERRY'S OFFICE

Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk.  At a noise he
looks up.

Marge has stuck her head in the door.

          MARGE
     Mr. Lundegaard?

          JERRY
     Huh?  Yah?

          MARGE
     I wonder if I could take just a
     minute of your time here -

          JERRY
     What...  What is it all about?

          MARGE
     Huh?  Do you mind if I sit down
     - I'm carrying quite a load here.

Marge plops into the chair opposite him.

          MARGE
     ...  You're the owner here, Mr.
     Lundegaard?

          JERRY
     Naw, I...  Executive Sales Manager.

          MARGE
     Well, you can help me.  My name's
     Marge Gunderson -

          JERRY
     My father-in-law, he's the owner.

          MARGE
     Uh-huh.  Well, I'm a police officer
     from up Brainerd investigating some
     malfeasance and I was just wondering
     if you've had any new vehicles stolen
     off the lot in the past couple of
     weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass
     Ciera?

Jerry stares at her, his mouth open.

          MARGE
     ...  Mr. Lundegaard?

          JERRY
     ...  Brainerd?

          MARGE
     Yah.  Yah.  Home a Paul Bunyan and
     Babe the Blue Ox.

          JERRY
     ...  Babe the Blue Ox?

          MARGE
     Yah, ya know we've got the big
     statue there.  So you haven't had
     any vehicles go missing, then?

          JERRY
     No.  No, ma'am.

          MARGE
     Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch.  I'll
     let you get back to your paperwork,
     then.

As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on
the desk in front of him.

          JERRY
     ...  Yah, okay.

He looks up at Marge's retreating back.  He looks back down
at the papers.  He looks over at the phone.

he picks up the phone and dials four digits.

          JERRY
     ...  Yah, gimmee Shep...  The
     heck d'ya mean?...  Well, where'd
     he go?  It's only...  No, I don't
     need a mechanic - oh, geez - I
     gotta talk to a friend of his, so,
     uh ... have him, uh ... oh, geez...


HOTEL BAR

Marge enters.  She looks around the bar, a rather
characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people.

          VOICE
     Marge?

It is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising
from a booth halfway back.  His features are broad,
friendly, Asian-American.

          MARGE
     Mike!

He approaches somewhat carefully, as if on his second drink.
They hug and head back toward the booth.

          MIKE
     Geez!  You look great!

          MARGE
     Yah - easy there - you do too!
     I'm expecting, ya know.

          MIKE
     I see that!  That's great!

A waitress meets them at the table.

          MIKE
     ...  What can I get ya?

          MARGE
     Just a Diet Coke.

Again she glances about.

          MARGE
     ...  This is a nice place.

          MIKE
     Yah, ya know it's the Radisson,
     so it's pretty good.

          MARGE
     You're livin' in Edina, then?

          MIKE
     Oh, yah, couple years now.  It's
     actually Eden Prarie - that school
     district.  So Chief Gunderson, then!
     So ya went and married Norm Son-of-
     a-Gunderson!

          MARGE
     Oh, yah, a long time ago.

          MIKE
     Great.  What brings ya down - are
     ya down here on that homicide -
     if you're allowed, ya know, to
     discuss that?

          MARGE
     Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva
     lot to discuss.  What about you,
     Mike?  Are you married - you have
     kids?

          MIKE
     Well, yah, I was married.  I was
     married to -  You mind if I sit
     over here?

He is sliding out of his side of the booth and easing in
next to Marge.

          MIKE
     ...  I was married to Linda
     Cooksey -

          MARGE
     No, I -  Mike - wyncha sit over
     there, I'd prefer that.

          MIKE
     Huh?  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

          MARGE
     No, just so I can see ya, ya know.
     Don't have to turn my neck.

          MIKE
     Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't
     mean to -

          MARGE
     No, no, that's fine.

          MIKE
     Yah, sorry, so I was married to
     Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?
     She was a year behind us.

          MARGE
     I think I remember Linda, yah.
     She was - yah.  So things didn't
     work out, huh?

          MIKE
     And then I, and then I been workin'
     for Honeywell for a few years now.

          MARGE
     Well, they're a good outfit.

          MIKE
     Yah, if you're an engineer, yah,
     you could do a lot worse.  Of
     course, it's not, uh, it's
     nothin' like your achievement.

          MARGE
     It sounds like you're doin' really
     super.

          MIKE
     Yah, well, I, uh ... it's not that
     it didn't work out -  Linda passed
     away.  She, uh...

          MARGE
     I'm sorry.

          MIKE
     Yah, I, uh...  She had leukemia,
     you know...

          MARGE
     No, I didn't...

          MIKE
     It was a tough, uh ... it was a
     long -  She fought real hard,
     Marge...

          MARGE
     I'm sorry, Mike.

          MIKE
     Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what
     can I say?...

He holds up his drink.

          MIKE
     ...  Better times, huh?

Marge clinks it.

          MARGE
     Better times.

          MIKE
     I was so...  I been so ... and
     then I saw you on TV, and I
     remembered, ya know...  I always
     liked you...

          MARGE
     Well, I always liked you, Mike.

          MIKE
     I always liked ya so much...

          MARGE
     It's okay, Mike -  Should we get
     together another time, ya think?

          MIKE
     No - I'm sorry!  It's just -  I
     been so lonely - then I saw you,
     and...

He is weeping.

          MIKE
     ...  I'm sorry...  I shouldn't a
     done this...  I thought we'd have
     a really terrific time, and now
     I've...

     You were such a super lady ...
     and then I...  I been so lonely...

          MARGE
     It's okay, Mike...


CARLTON CELEBRITY ROOM

Carl Showalter is sitting at a small table with a tarty-
looking blonde in a low-cut gown.  Each holds a drink.

          CARL
     Just in town on business.  Just
     in and out.  Ha ha!  A little of
     the old in-and-out!

          WOMAN
     Wuddya do?

Carl looks around.

          CARL
     Have ya been to the Celebrity Room
     before?  With other, uh, clients?

          WOMAN
     I don't think so.  It's nice.

          CARL
     Yeah, well, it depends on the artist.
     You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no
     complaints.  Waiter!

The reverse shows a disappearing waiter and the backs of
many, many people sitting at tables between us and the very
distant stage.  Jose Feliciano, very small, performs on a
spotlit stool.  The acoustics are poor.

Carl grimaces.

          CARL
     ...  What is he, deaf?...  So,
     uh, how long have you been with
     the escort service?

          WOMAN
     I don't know.  Few munce.

          CARL
     Ya find the work interesting, do ya?

          WOMAN
     ...  What're you talking about?


A DIRTY BEDROOM

Carl is humping the escort.

We hear the door burst open.

The escort is grabbed and flung out of bed.

          CARL
     Shep!  What the hell are you doing?
     I'm banging that girl!  Shep!  Jesus
     Ch -

Shep slaps him hard, forehand, backhand.

          SHEP
     Fuck out of my house!

He hauls him up -

          CARL
     Shep!  Don't you dare fucking hit
     me, man!  Don't you -

- punches him and flings him away.

Carl hits a sofa and we see his bare legs disappear as he
flips back over it.

Shep enters frame to circle the sofa and kick at Carl behind
it.

          SHEP
     Fuck outta here.  Put me back in
     Stillwater.  Little fucking shit.

There is a knock at the door.

          VOICE
     Hey!  Come on in there!

Shep strides to the door, flings it open.

A man in boxer shorts stands in the doorway.

          MAN
     C'mon, brother, it's late -  Unghh!

Shep hits him twice, then grabs both of his ears and starts
banging his head against the wall.

The hooker runs by, clutching her clothes, and Shep kicks
her in the ass as she passes.

He spins and goes back into the apartment.

Carl is hopping desperately into his pants.

          CARL
     Stay away from me, man!  Hey!
     Smoke a fuckin' peace pipe, man!
     Don't you dare fuckin' -  Unghh!

After hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out
of his dangling pants and strangles him with it.  Carl
gurgles.  Shep knees Carl repeatedly, then dumps him onto
the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the
belt.


CHAIN RESTAURANT PHONE BOOTH

Carl listens to the phone ring at the other end.  His face
is deeply bruised and cut.

Finally, through the phone...

          VOICE
     ...  Yah?

          CARL
     All right, Jerry, I'm through
     fucking around.  You got the
     fucking money?


JERRY'S KITCHEN

Jerry is at the kitchen phone.  Through the door to the
dining room we see Wade picking up an extension.

          JERRY
     Yah, I got the money, but, uh -

          CARL
     Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.
     I want you with this money on the
     Dayton-Radisson parking ramp, top
     level, thirty minutes, and we'll
     wrap this up.

          JERRY
     Yah, okay, but, uh -

          CARL
     You're there in thirty minutes or
     I find you, Jerry, and I shoot
     you, and I shoot your fucking wife,
     and I shoot all your little fucking
     children, and I shoot 'em all in the
     back of their little fucking heads.
     Got it?

          JERRY
     ...  Yah, well, you stay away from
     Scotty now -

          CARL
     GOT IT?

          JERRY
     Okay, real good, then.

The line goes dead.

A door slams offscreen.


EXT. HOUSE

Wade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the
door and peels out.


INT. CAR

Wade's jaw works as he glares out at traffic.  He mumbles to
himself as he drives.

          WADE
     Okay ... here's your damn money,
     now where's my daughter?...
     Goddamn punk ... where's my damn
     daughter...

He pulls out a gun, cracks the barrel, peers in.

          WADE
     ...  You little punk.


JERRY'S HOUSE

Jerry sits in the foyer, trying to pull on pair of galoshes.
Scotty's voice comes from upstairs:

          VOICE
     ...  Dad?

          JERRY
     It's okay, Scotty.

          VOICE
     Where're you going?

          JERRY
     Be back in a minute.  If Stan
     calls you, just tell him I went
     to Embers.  Oh, geez -

Thunk! - his first boot goes on.


RADISSON

Marge sits on the bed in her hotel room, shoes off,
massaging her feet.  The phone is pressed to her ear, and
through it, we hear ringing.

          VOICE
     ...  Hello?

          MARGE
     Norm?


MILLE LACS LAKE

It is late evening, blowing storm.  A leisurely pan across
the bleak gray expanse finds a little hut in the middle of
the frozen lake with a pickup truck parked next to it.

          MARGE'S VOICE
     They bitin'?


INT. HUT

Norm has a cellular phone to his ear.  His feet are
stretched out to an electric heater.  The interior is bathed
in soft orange light.

          NORM
     Yah, okay.  How's the hotel?

          MARGE
     Oh, pretty good.  They bitin'?

          NORM
     Yeah, couple a muskies.  No pike
     yet.  How d'you feel?

          MARGE
     Oh, fine.

          NORM
     Not on your feet too much?

          MARGE
     No, no.

          NORM
     You shouldn't be on your feet too
     much, you got weight you're not
     used too.  How's the food down
     there?

          MARGE
     Had dinner at a place called the
     King's Table.  Buffet style.  It
     was pretty darn good.

          NORM
     Was it reasonable?

          MARGE
     Yah, not too bad.  So it's nice
     up there?

          NORM
     Yah, it's good.  No pike yet, but
     it's good.


DAYTON-RADISSON RAMP

The top, open, level.  Snow blows.  A car sits idling.

Another car pulls onto the roof.  It creeps over to the
parked car and stops.  It continues to idle as its door
opens and Wade steps out, carrying the briefcase.

The door of the other car bangs open and Carl bounces out.

          CARL
     Who the fuck are you?  Who the
     fuck are you?

          WADE
     I got your goddamn money, you
     little punk.  Now where's my
     daughter?

          CARL
     I am through fucking around!  Drop
     that fucking briefcase!

          WADE
     Where's my daughter?

          CARL
     Fuck you, man!  Where's Jerry?  I
     gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -

          WADE
     Where's my damn daughter?  No
     Jean, no money!

          CARL
     Drop that fucking money!

          WADE
     No Jean, no money!

          CARL
     Is this a fucking joke here?

He pulls out a gun and fires into Wade's gut.

          CARL
     ...  Is this a fucking joke?

          WADE
     Unghh ... oh, geez...

He is on the pavement, clutching at his gut.  Snow swirls.

          CARL
     You fucking imbeciles!

He bends down next to Wade to pick up the briefcase.

          WADE
     Oh, for Christ ... oh, geez...

Wade brings out his gun and fires at Carl's head, close by.

          CARL
     Oh!

Carl stumbles and falls back, and then stands up again.  His
jaw is gouting blood.

          CARL
     ...  Owwmm...

One hand pressed to his jaw, he fires down at Wade several
times.  Blood streams through the hand pressed to his jaw.

          CARL
     ...  Mmmmmphnck!  He fnkem shop me...

He pockets the gun, picks up the briefcase one-handed,
flings it into his car, gets in, peels out.


DOWN RAMP

Carl screams down the ramp.  He takes a corner at high speed
and swerves, just missing Jerry in his Olds on his way to
the top.


INT. JERRY'S CAR

Jerry recovers from the near miss and continues up.

          JERRY
     Oh, geez!


EXIT BOOTH

Carl squeals to a halt at the gate, still pressing his hand
to his bleeding jaw.

          CARL
     Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!

          ATTENDANT
     May I have your ticket, please?


RAMP ROOF

Jerry pulls to a halt next to Wade's idling Cadillac.  He
gets out and walks slowly to Wade's body, prostrate in the
swirling snow.

          JERRY
     Oh!  Oh, geez!

He bends down, picks Wade up by the armpits and drags him
over to the back of the Cadillac.  He drops Wade's body,
walks to the driver's side of the car, pulls the keys and
walks back to pop the trunk.  He wrestles Wade's body into
the trunk, slams it shut and walks back to the scene of the
shooting.

He kicks at the snow with his galoshed feet, trying to hide
the fresh bloodstains.


EXIT BOOTH

Jerry approaches in the Cadillac.

The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away.  The
booth is empty.

Jerry eases toward the street, looking over at the booth as
he passes.

Inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a
prostrate body.


EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE

The car pulls into the driveway.


FOYER

Jerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his
galoshes.

          SCOTT'S VOICE
     ...  Dad?

          JERRY
     Yah.

          SCOTT'S VOICE
     Stan Grossman called.

          JERRY
     Yah, okay.

          SCOTT'S VOICE
     Twice.

          JERRY
     Okay.

          SCOTT'S VOICE
     ...  Is everything okay?

          JERRY
     Yah.

Thoonk - the first boot comes off.

          SCOTT'S VOICE
     Are you calling Stan?

          JERRY
     Well...  I'm goin' ta bed now.


CARL'S CAR

Carl mumbles as he drives, underlit by the dim dash lights,
one hand now holding a piece of rag to his shredded jaw.

          CARL
     ...  Fnnkn ashlzh...  Fnk...


ROAD

Carl's car roars into frame, violently swirling the snow.
Its red tail lights fishtail away.

FADE OUT

HOLD IN BLACK

HARD CUT TO:  BRIGHT - LOOKING THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

It is a starky sunny day.  We are cruising down a street of
humble lookalike houses.

We pan right as we draw toward one house in particular.  In
its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow.  He
notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave.

The driver is Gary, the Brainderd police officer.  He gives
a finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over.


OUTSIDE

Gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel
in the snow.


          MAN
     How ya doin'?

          GARY
     Mr. Mohra?

          MAN
     Yah.

          GARY
     Officer Olson.

          MAN
     Yah, right-o.

The two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and
without standing particularly close.  They stand stiffly,
arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their
parka hoods.  Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head
drawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face
from protruding into the cold.

          MAN
     ...  So, I'm tendin' bar there at
     Ecklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday
     and this little guy's drinkin'
     and he says, 'So where can a guy
     find some action - I'm goin' crazy
     down there at the lake.'  And I
     says, 'What kinda action?' and he
     says, 'Woman action, what do I
     look like,'  And I says 'Well,
     what do I look like, I don't
     arrange that kinda thing,' and he
     says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there
     at the lake' and I says, 'Well,
     this ain't that kinda place.'

          GARY
     Uh-huh.

          MAN
     So he says, 'So I get it, so you
     think I'm some kinda jerk for
     askin',' only he doesn't use the
     word jerk.

          GARY
     I unnerstand.

          MAN
     And then he calls me a jerk and
     says the last guy who thought he
     was a jerk was dead now.  So I
     don't say nothin' and he says, 'What
     do ya think about that?'  So I
     says, 'Well, that don't sound like
     too good a deal for him then.'


          GARY
     Ya got that right.

          MAN
     And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead
     and I don't mean a old age.'  And
     then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin'
     crazy out there at the lake.'

          GARY
     White Bear Lake?

          MAN
     Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's
     closer ta Moose Lake, so I made
     that assumption.

          GARY
     Oh sure.

          MAN
     So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I
     don't think a whole great deal of
     it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the
     homicides out here and she thought
     I should call it in, so I called
     it in.  End a story.

          GARY
     What'd this guy look like anyways?

          MAN
     Oh, he was a little guy, kinda
     funny-lookin'.

          GARY
     Uh-huh - in what way?

          MAN
     Just a general way.

          GARY
     Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr.
     Mohra.  You're right, it's probably
     nothin', but thanks for callin'
     her in.

          MAN
     Oh sure.  They say she's gonna
     turn cold tomorrow.

          GARY
     Yah, got a front movin' in.

          MAN
     Ya got that right.


CLOSE ON CARL SHOWALTER

In his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to
his mangled jaw.  He is staring down at something in the
front seat next to him.

His other hand holds open the briefcase.  It has money
inside - a lot of money.

Carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and
looks at it.

          CARL
     ...  Mmmnphh.

He paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling
for the amount.

          CARL
     ...  Jeshush Shrist...  Jeshush
     fuchem Shrist!

Excited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto
the back seat.

He starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer
pressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to
his skin by clotted blood.

He pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow
again.

He carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it
remains adhering to his jaw.


EXT. CAR

It is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road.  THe
door opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase.

He slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the
embankment to a barbed-wire fence.  He kneels at one of the
fence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare
hands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up.

He stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his
red, frozen hands.

He looks to the right.

A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
against unblemished white.

He looks to the left.

A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
against unblemished white.

He looks at the fence post in front of him.

          CARL
     Mmmphh...

He looks about the snowy vastness for a marker.  Finding
none, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to
scar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up
against the post.

He bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it
against his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car.


HOTEL ROOM

Marge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed.
She is ready to leave, already wearing her parka, but is on
the phone.

          MARGE
     No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back
     up to Brainerd.

          VOICE
     Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.

          MARGE
     Mm.  But ya think he's all right?
     I saw him last night and he's -

          VOICE
     What'd he say?

          MARGE
     Well, it was nothin' specific
     he said, it just seemd like it
     all hit him really hard, his
     wife dyin' -

          VOICE
     His wife?

          MARGE
     Linda.

          VOICE
     No.

          MARGE
     Linda Cooksey?

          VOICE
     No.  No.  No.  They weren't -
     he, uh, he was bothering Linda
     for about, oh, for a good year.
     Really pestering her, wouldn't
     leave her alone.

          MARGE
     So ... they didn't...

          VOICE
     No.  No.  They never married.
     Mike's had psychiatric problems.


          MARGE
     Oh.  Oh, my.

          VOICE
     Yah, he - he's been struggling.
     He's living with his parents now.

          MARGE
     Oh.  Geez.

          VOICE
     Yah, Linda's fine.  You should
     call her.

          MARGE
     Geez.  Well - geez.  That's a
     suprise.


MARGE'S CAR

Marge drives, gazing out at the road.


MARGE AT A DRIVE-THROUGH

She leans out of her open window and yells at the order
panel:

          MARGE
     Hello?


MARGE AT THE GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich.


JERRY LUNDEGAARD'S OFFICE

Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers
onto a form.  Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper
and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically
checks.  The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible
entries.

Jerry hums nervously.

Glass rattles as someone taps at his door.

Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit
with worry.

Marge sticks her head in the door.

          MARGE
     Mr. Lundegaard?  Sorry to bother
     you again.  Can I come in?

She starts to enter.

          JERRY
     Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda
     busy -

          MARGE
     I unnerstand.  I'll keep it real
     short, then.  I'm on my way out
     of town, but I was just -  Do you
     mind if I sit down?  I'm carrying
     a bit of a load here.

          JERRY
     No, I -

But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a
sigh of relieved weight.

          MARGE
     Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you
     about yesterday.  I was just
     wondering -

          JERRY
     Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had
     any vehicles go missing.

          MARGE
     Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean,
     how do you know?  Because, see,
     the crime I'm investigating, the
     perpetrators were driving a car
     with dealer plates.  And they
     called someone who works here, so
     it'd be quite a coincidence if
     they weren't, ya know, connected.

          JERRY
     Yah, I see.

          MARGE
     So how do you - have you done any
     kind of inventory recently?

          JERRY
     The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

          MARGE
     but do you know that for sure
     without -

          JERRY
     Well, I would know.  I'm the
     Executive Sales Manager.

          MARGE
     Yah, but -

          JERRY
     We run a pretty tight ship here.

          MARGE
     I know, but - well, how do you
     establish that, sir?  Are the
     cars, uh, counted daily or what
     kind of -

          JERRY
     Ma'am, I answered your question.

There is a silent beat.

          MARGE
     ...  I'm sorry, sir?

          JERRY
     Ma'am, I answered your question.
     I answered the darn -  I'm
     cooperating here, and I...

          MARGE
     Sir, you have no call to get
     snippy with me.  I'm just doin'
     my job here.

          JERRY
     I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here.
     I'm cooperating...  There's no, uh
     - we're doin' all we can...

He trails off into silence.

          MARGE
     Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

Jerry stares at her.

          MARGE
     ...  Mr. Lundegaard?

Jerry explodes:

          JERRY
     Well, heck, if you wanna, if you
     wanna play games here!  I'm
     workin' with ya on this thing, but
     I...

He is getting angrily off his feet.

          JERRY
     Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!

          MARGE
     Sir?  Right now?

          JERRY
     Sure right now!  You're darned
     tootin'!

He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door
and grabbing a pair of galoshes.

          JERRY
     ...  If it's so damned imporant
     to ya!

          MARGE
     I'm sorry, sir, I -

Jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes
pinched in his hand.

          JERRY
     Aw, what the Christ!

He stamps out the door.

Marge stares.

After a long moment her stare breaks.  She glances idly
around the office.

There is a framed picture facing away from her on the
desktop.  She turns it to face her.  It is Scotty, holding
an accordion.  There is another picture of Jean.

Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the
ceiling.

She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her.

She fiddles idly with a pencil.  She pulls a clipboard
toward her.  It holds a form from the General Motors Finance
Corporation.

She looks idly around.  Her look abruptly locks.

          MARGE
     ...  Oh, for Pete's sake.

Jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the
building.

Marge's voice is flat with dismay:

          MARGE
     ...  Oh, for Pete's sake...

She grabs the phone and punches in a number.

          MARGE
     ...  For Pete's s- he's fleein' the
     interview.  He's feelin' the
     interview...

Jerry makes a left turn into traffic.

          MARGE
     ...  Detective Sibert, please...


POLICE OFFICER

We are looking across a steam table at a man in blue.  He
moves slowly to the right, pushing his tray along a
cafeteria line.  Behind him, in the depth of the room, is an
eating area of long Formica tables at which sit a mix of
uniformed and civilian-clothed police and staff.

We are listening to an offscreen woman's voice.

          WOMAN
     Well, so far we're just saying he's
     wanted for questioning in connection
     with a triple homicide.  Nobody at
     the dealship there's been much help
     guessing where he might go...

The woman is entering frame sliding a tray.  Marge enters
behind her, sliding her own.  We move laterally with them as
they slowly make their way along the line.

          MARGE
     Uh-huh.

          WOMAN
     We called his house; his little
     boy said he hadn't been there.

          MARGE
     And his wife?

          WOMAN
     She's visiting relatives in Florida.
     Now his boss, this guy Gustafson,
     he's also disappeared.  Nobody at
     his office knows where he is.

          MARGE
     Geez.  Looks like this thing goes
     higher than we thought.  You call
     his home?

          WOMAN
     His wife's in the hospital, has
     been for a couple months.  The big C.

          MARGE
     Oh, my.

          WOMAN
     And this Shep Proudfoot character,
     he's a little darling.  He's now
     wanted for assault and parole
     violation.  He clobbered a neighbor
     of his last night and another
     person who could be one of your perps,
     and he's at large.

          MARGE
     Boy, this thing is really ... geez.

          WOMAN
     Well, they're all out on the wire.
     Well, you know...

          MARGE
     Yah.  Well, I just can't thank you
     enough, Detective Sibert, this
     cooperation has been outstanding.

          DETECTIVE SIBERT
     Ah, well, we haven't had to run
     around like you.  When're you due?

          MARGE
     End a April.

          DETECTIVE SIBERT
     Any others?

          MARGE
     This'll be our first.  We've been
     waiting a long time.

          DETECTIVE SIBERT
     That's wonderful.  Mm-mm.  It'll
     change your life, a course.

          MARGE
     Oh, yah, I know that!

          DETECTIVE SIBERT
     They can really take over, that's
     for sure.

          MARGE
     You have children?

Detective Sibert pulls an accordion of plastic picture
sleeves from her purse to show Marge.

          DETECTIVE SIBERT
     I thought you'd never ask.  The
     older one is Janet, she's nine, and
     the younger one is Morgan.

          MARGE
     Oh, now he's adorable.

          DETECTIVE SIBERT
     He's three now.  Course, not in that
     picture.

          MARGE
     Oh, he's adorable.

          DETECTIVE SIBERT
     Yah, he -

          MARGE
     Where'd you get him that parka?

They have reached the end of the cafeteria line.  With a nod
to the cashier, Detective Sibert indicates hers and Marge's
trays.

          DETECTIVE SIBERT
     Both of these.

          MARGE
     Oh, no, I can't let you do that.

          DETECTIVE SIBERT
     Oh, don't be silly.

          MARGE
     Well, okay - thank you, Detective.

          DETECTIVE SIBERT
     Oh, don't be silly.


GAEAR GRIMSRUD

He sits eating a Swanson's TV dinner from a TV tray he has
set up in front of an easy chair.

He watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it
might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and
diffused by snow.  The audio crackles with interference.
Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds
Grimsrud's complete attention.

At the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up.

Carl enters, his face suppurating and raw.

He reacts to Grimsrud's wordless look with a grotesque
laugh.

          CARL
     You should she zhe uzher guy!

He glances around.

          CARL
     ...  The fuck happen a her?

Jean sits slumped in a straight-backed chair facing the
wall.  Her hooded head, resting on her chin, is motionless.
There is blood on the facing wall.

          GRIMSRUD
     She started shrieking, you know.

          CARL
     Jezhush.

He shakes his head.

          CARL
     ...  Well, I gotta muddy.

He is plunking down eight bank-wrapped bundles on the table.

          CARL
     ...  All of it.  All eighty gran.
     Forty for you...

He makes one pile, pockets the rest.

          CARL
     ...  Forty for me.  Sho thishuzh
     it.  Adiosh.

He slaps keys down on the table.

          CARL
     ...  You c'n'ave my truck.  I'm
     takin' a Shiera.

          GRIMSRUD
     We split that.

Carl looks at him.

          CARL
     HOW THE FUCK DO WE SHPLITTA FUCKIN'
     CAR?  Ya dummy!  Widda fuckin'
     chainshaw?

Grimsrud looks sourly up.  There is a beat.  Finally:

          GRIMSRUD
     One of us pays the other for half.

          CARL
     HOLD ON!  NO FUCKIN' WAY!  YOU
     FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH?  I GOT FUCKIN'
     SHOT INNA FAISH!  I WENT'N GOTTA
     FUCKIN' MONEY!  I GET SHOT FUCKIN'
     PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR
     THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH!  I'M
     TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR!  THAT
     FUCKERZH MINE!

Carl waits for an argument, but only gets the steady sour
look.

Carl pulls out a gun.

          CARL
     ...  YOU FUCKIN' ASH-HOLE!  I
     LISHEN A YOUR BULLSHIT FOR A WHOLE
     FUCKIN' WEEK!

A beat.  Carl returns Grimsrud's stare.

          CARL
     ...  Are we shquare?

Grimsrud says nothing.

          CARL
     ...  ARE WE SHQUARE?

A beat.

Disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door.

          CARL
     ...  Fuckin' ash-hole.  And if
     you shee your friend Shep Proudpfut,
     tell him I'm gonna NAIL hizh
     fuckin' ash.


OUTSIDE

We are pulling Carl as he walks toward the car.  Behind him
we see the cabin door opening.  Carl turns, reacting to the
sound.

Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's
cap, but no overcoat.  He is holding an ax.

Carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun.

Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the ax in Carl's neck.


MARGE

In her cruiser, on her two-way.  Through it we hear Lou's
voice, heavily filtered:

          VOICE
     His wife.  This guy says she was
     kidnapped last Wednesday.

          MARGE
     The day of our homicides.

          VOICE
     Yah.

Marge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through
the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs
down to a large frozen lake.

          MARGE
     And this guy is...

          VOICE
     Lundegaard's father-in-law's
     accountant.

          MARGE
     Gustafson's accountant.

          VOICE
     Yah.

          MARGE
     But we still haven't found Gustafson.

          VOICE
          (crackle)
     -  looking.

          MARGE
     Sorry - didn't copy.

          VOICE
     Still missing.  We're looking.

          MARGE
     Copy.  And Lundegaard too.

          VOICE
     Yah.  Where are ya, Margie?

We hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as
of a chainsaw or lawnmower.

          MARGE
     Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving
     around Moose Lake.

          VOICE
     Oh.  Gary's loudmouth.

          MARGE
     Yah, the loudmouth.  So the whole
     state has it, Lundegaard and
     Gustafson?

          VOICE
     Yah, it's over the wire, it's
     everywhere, they'll find 'em.

          MARGE
     Copy.

          VOICE
     We've got a -

          MARGE
     There's the car!  There's the car!

We are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down
to a cabin.  Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera.

          VOICE
     Whose car?

          MARGE
     My car!  My car!  Tan Ciera!

          VOICE
     Don't go in!  Wait for back-up!

Marge is straining to look.  The power-tool noise is louder
here but still muffled, its source not yet visible.

          VOICE
     ...  Chief Gunderson?

          MARGE
     Copy.  Yah, send me back-up!

          VOICE
     Yes, ma'am.  Are we the closest PD?

          MARGE
     Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich
     and he takes February off to go to
     Boundary Waters.


ROAD EXTERIOR

Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin.
She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-
lined hood.

For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of
the power tool.  Then, with one curved arm half pressing
against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly
steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the
trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the
grinding noise.

She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her
downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the
next.


The roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree,
her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squints
down toward the cabin's back lot.

A tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted
jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a
large power tool which his body blocks from view.

Marge advances.

The man is forcing downward something which engages the
roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.

The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the
cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams
as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a
shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.

The roar is very loud.

Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.

Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we
can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.

Marge's eyes shift.

A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.

Grimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends
down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.
He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.

Marge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward
Grimsrud, who is still turned away.

Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

Marge closes in, grimacing.

Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log
that pushes down into the machine.

The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of
Carl Showalter's body.

Marge has drawn to within twenty yards.  When she bellows it
sounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the
roar of the power tool.

          MARGE
     Stop!  Police!  Turn around and
     hands up!

Startled, Grimsrud scowls.  He turns to face her.

He stares.

Marge bellows again:

          MARGE
     ...  Hands up!

Conscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her
shoulder the armpatch insignia.

          MARGE
     ...  Police!

Grimsrud stares.

With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at
Marge and then starts running away.

Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.

No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands
in the snow several feet short of her.

Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep
snow.

Behind him:

          MARGE
     ...  Halt!

She fires in the air.

She lowers the gun and carefully sighs.

          MARGE
     ...  Halt!

She fires.

Grimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss.

Marge sights again.

          MARGE
     ...  Halt!

She fires again.

Grimsrud pitches forward.  He mutters in Swedish as he
reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.

Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand
reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.

It comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with
a snap of the wrist.

          MARGE
     ...  All right, buddy.  On your
     belly and your hands clasped
     behind you.


THE CRUISER

Marge drives.  Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed
behind him.

For a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and
the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge
grimly shakes her head.

          MARGE
     ...  So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
     in there?

She glances up in the rear-view mirror.

Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the
road.

Marge shakes her head.

At length:

          MARGE
     ...  I guess that was your
     accomplice in the wood chipper.

Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is
motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.

          MARGE
     ...  And those three people in
     Brainerd.

No response.

Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.

          MARGE
     ...  And for what?  For a little
     bit of money.

We hear distant sirens.

          MARGE
     ...  There's more to life than money,
     you know.

She glances up in the rear-view mirror.

          MARGE
     ...  Don't you know that?...  And
     here ya are, and it's a beautiful
     day...

Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out.

The sirens are getting louder.  Marge pulls over.

          MARGE
     ...  Well...

She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling
WHOOPS on her siren.

She turns on her flashers.

She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.

She stares forward, shakes her head.  We hear the dull click
of her flashers.

          MARGE
     ...  I just don't unnerstand it.

Outside it is snowing.  The sky, the earth, the road - all
white.

A squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white.
It approaches in slow motion.

An ambulance punches through after it.

Another squad car.

                          FADE OUT:


FADE IN:



HIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL

It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain.
One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling
police cruiser.


MOTEL ROOM DOORWAY

We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen
who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting
lightly on their holstered sidearms.  One of them raps at
the door.

          COP ONE
     Mr. Anderson...

A title fades in:  OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA

After a pause, muffled through the door:

          VOICE
     ...  Who?...

          COP ONE
     Mr. Anderson, is this your burgundy
     88 out here?

          VOICE
     ...  Just a sec.

          COP ONE
     Could you open the door, please?

          VOICE
     ...  Yah.  Yah, just a sec.

We hear a clatter from inside.

          VOICE
     ...  Just a sec...

One of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone
whose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys.
This man turns a key in the door and then stands away.

The two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel
room.

The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two
men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns.

The room is empty.

Cop one indicates the open bathroom door.

          COP ONE
     Dale!

The two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the
ready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace.

A man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window.

The policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and
drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room.

His flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short,
piercing screams.

The cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing
continues.  The policemen struggle to restrain him.

          COP ONE
     Call an ambulance!

          COP TWO
     You got him okay?

Cop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts
into uncontrolled sobbing.

          COP ONE
     Yah, yah, call an ambulance.

Jerry sobs and screams.


A BEDROOM

We are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.

After a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and
climbs into bed, with some effort.

          MARGE
     Oooph!

Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television.

At length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV.

          NORM
     They announced it.

Marge looks at him.

          MARGE
     They announced it?

          NORM
     Yah.

Marge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay
fixed on the television.

          MARGE
     ...  So?

          NORM
     Three-cent stamp.

          MARGE
     Your mallard?

          NORM
     Yah.

          MARGE
     Norm, that's terrific!

Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure.

          NORM
     It's just the three cent.

          MARGE
     It's terrific!

          NORM
     Hautman's blue-winged teal got the
     twenty-nine cent.  People don't
     much use the three-cent.

          MARGE
     Oh, for Pete's - a course they do!
     Every time they raise the darned
     postage, people need the little
     stamps!

          NORM
     Yah.

          MARGE
     When they're stuck with a bunch a
     the old ones!

          NORM
     Yah, I guess.

          MARGE
     That's terrific.

Her eyes go back to the TV.

          MARGE
     ...  I'm so proud a you, Norm.

Norm murmurs:

          NORM
     I love you, Margie.

          MARGE
     I love you, Norm.

Both of them are watching the TV as Norm reaches out to rest
a hand on top of her stomach.

          NORM
     ...  Two more months.

Marge absently rests her own hand on top of his.

          MARGE
     Two more months.

Hold; fade out.
