The husband of aviation engineer Kyle Pratt has just died in Berlin.
Now she is flying back to New York with his coffin and their six-year-old daughter Julia.
Three hours into the flight Kyle awakens to find that Julia is gone!
It's a big double-decker plane, so very concerned mother has a lot of territory to cover in order to find her daughter.
But as Kyle fights to discern the truth, she takes matters into her own hands.
