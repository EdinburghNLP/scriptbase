          FADE IN
          
          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT
          
          On a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land, 
          surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. The distant roar of battle 
          RUMBLES ominously. SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment. 
          
          Abruptly, the image springs to life. The gun FIRES deafeningly. The nearby 
          branches shake violently. Another set of TITLES appears. The image FREEZES 
          again as a lone bugle plays a charge. Again and again and again, the image 
          moves, the gun DISCHARGES noisily, the image FREEZES and more sets of TITLES 
          appear with every FIRING.
          
          On the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose:
          
          WAR MONTAGE
          
          Nothing but FAST, BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of:
          
          Cannon firing in all directions. 
          
          Massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night. 
          
          Troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water 
          towering into the sky. 
          
          An entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar 
          fire visible above them on the horizon.
          
          Brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their 
          muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. Men yelling.
          
          FASTER AND FASTER, MORE AND MORE CHAOTIC:
          
          Mortar fire, explosions, smoke.
          
          A machine gunner fires.
          
          A soldier falls.
          
          Infantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze.
          
          More machine gunning.
          
          More soldiers go down.
          
          A massive gun fires.
          
          SMASH CUT of a tank tread bearing down on the CAMERA, blacking out the screen.
          
          Infantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery, firing pistols, rifles.
          
          A bridge explodes. A building explodes. The ground explodes.
          
          A bomb drops from an airplane.
          
          Aerial view of an exploding building.
          
          Anti-aircraft guns at work.
          
          Planes in the air.
          
          A machine gun fires skyward.
          
          Planes circle, filling the air.
          
          A single bi-plane.
          
          The plane's gunner, SHEP LAMBERT, looks down, surveys the situation, breaks 
          into a grin.
          
          Shep nudges his pilot, CARY LOCKWOOD, and points. Cary looks down to see:
          
          Another plane below. In it, pilot BILL TALBOT waves and salutes. FRANCIS, the 
          gunner, opens his mouth, smiles and nods up at them.
          
          An enemy plane arrives.
          
          The enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns.
          
          Bill and Francis' plane spins away.
          
          Bill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it, much to 
          Francis' amusement.
          
          The planes circle in the air.
          
          The enemy plane trails Shep and Cary. Shep FIRES his machine gun to no avail 
          as Cary watches.
          
          The enemy pilot returns fire.
          
          The two planes tango in mid-air.
          
          Shep FIRES.
          
          The enemy pilot grins and FIRES.
          
          Bullet holes riddle the side of Shep and Cary's plane.
          
          Cary warns Shep they've been hit.
          
          From the enemy plane's POV, Shep and Cary's plane streams black smoke.
          
          The two planes. Shep and Cary's plane goes into a steep dive, spinning out of 
          control.
          
          Cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him.
          
          Flames fill the cockpit as Cary's gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of 
          the red hot controls.
          
          The plane, streaming smoke, spins wildly downward.
          
          Shep, surrounded with smoke, looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry.
          
          Above, Bill and Francis watch. Bill returns the salute with a smile and waves. 
          Francis, though, doesn't look happy.
          
          Shep twists in his seat and looks around.
          
          Cary's hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit.
          
                              SHEP (o.s.)
                    Level off, Cary! Level off!
          
          Despite the flames, Cary pulls back on the control stick.
          
          From the plane's POV: The landscape rushes by.
          
          The plane, now level, crashes into the ground and comes to an abrupt stop.
          
          Smoke. Flames.
          
          Cary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to Shep who is struggling to 
          clamber out.
          
                              CARY
                    Shep! Shep, are you all right?
          
                              SHEP
                    Can't make it, Cary. Can't make it.
          
                              CARY
                    Here, give me your arm! I'll get 
                    you out of here! Hang on there, 
                    Shep! Get a hold - Just hold tight, 
                    old fella.
          
          Cary pulls Shep out and hauls him away from the burning wreckage where the two 
          of them collapse to the ground, half-conscious.
          
          Flames consume the plane.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          A TEMPERATURE CHART
          for Lieutenant Shep Lambert, a patient at U.S. Army A.E.F. Base Hospital 145. 
          Shep's temperature readings for October 11th to October 26th are indicated by 
          a line on a graph, near a level marked CRITICAL. The distant sound of battle 
          continues to RUMBLE.
          
          ANOTHER CHART
          swings into view. This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for 
          October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line 
          continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is 
          marked NORMAL.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
          The battle sounds are now joined by a loudly TICKING clock. With no sign of
          energy or emotion, Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital cot in full 
          uniform. Shep wears dark eyeglasses. Cary has a coat draped over his hands. He 
          glances off. We follow his gaze, PANNING past other patients in the hospital 
          to a wall clock and calendar. It is November 11th and the time is almost 
          eleven A. M. The battle's RUMBLE drones on.
          
          SHEP AND CARY
          stare up at the clock. Behind his dark glasses, Shep's left eye twitches.
          
          THE CLOCK 
          slowly DISSOLVES to one last BRIEF BATTLE MONTAGE: soldiers yelling and 
          running, guns firing noisily, a plane crashing, explosions. The final image is 
          of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a 
          stop as we DISSOLVE BACK TO the clock face. The center of the clock is lined 
          up exactly with the center of the propeller -- the slowing propeller blades 
          are replaced by the clock's hands -- as if to symbolically suggest that the 
          war has ended but time goes on. The NOISE of battle fades and only the TICKING 
          of the clock remains. DISSOLVE TO the calendar: November 11th, 1918 -- 
          Armistice Day. 
          
          SHEP AND CARY
          sit motionless side-by-side on the cot. Shep has a hand over his left eye.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, the old guerre is finie.
          
                              SHEP
                    That's right.
          
                              CARY
                    What are ya gonna do now, Shep?
          
                              SHEP
                    Get tight.
          
                              CARY
                         (turns to him)
                    And then what?
          
          Shep lets go of his eye and looks at Cary as if the answer were obvious.
          
                              SHEP
                    Stay tight.
          
          Cary grins wryly.
          
                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NOT LONG AFTER
          A nurse opens a door for Shep and Cary who enter. Shep wears his dark glasses. 
          Cary carries his coat to hide his hands. They pause as the doors they have 
          passed through close behind them.
          
          Their distinguished-looking doctor, a medical officer with a white gown over 
          his uniform, sits at his desk studying their papers.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood. 
                         (rises, joins them)
                    You two leaving us, eh? In a way, 
                    I'm sorry to release you two. I have 
                    no choice in the matter.
          
          Shep removes his glasses and presses his hand to his eye.
          
                              SHEP
                    What am I going to do, Major, about 
                    my-- oh, this rotten business?
          
          The doctor examines Shep's eye more closely.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Mm? Spasmodic twitching of the 
                    muscles under the eye, eh, 
                    Lieutenant?
          
                              SHEP
                    Mm hm.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    What the French call a tic. T-I-C, 
                    tic. Little bothersome, isn't it?
          
          Shep puts his glasses back on.
          
                              SHEP
                    Yes, sir.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    I'm afraid time'll have to take care 
                    of that. Time and normal living. 
          
          Shep's lips tighten skeptically.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    You two are returning to the United 
                    States, I presume?
          
          Shep glances at Cary.
          
                              CARY
                    Ah, we haven't decided.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    I'd take the first boat home. Well, 
                    here you go.
          
          The doctor gives Shep his release form and shakes his hand, then turns to 
          shake Cary's. Cary merely looks down darkly and raises a bandaged hand at him.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Oh, I forgot your burnt hands. 
          
          The doctor folds up the release and stuffs it in Cary's breast pocket.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Neither of you is fully hospitalized. 
                    I'd undertake a systematic course of 
                    finger exercises -- to, uh, stretch 
                    them and loosen them up. In time, 
                    you'll regain their full use.
          
                              CARY
                    Thank you, sir.
          
          The doctor gives Cary a pat on the shoulder. 
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Bye, Lieutenant. 
          
          Cary manages a smile and salutes. Shep moves to the door, saluting the doctor.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Bye, Lieutenant. Good luck.
          
          Shep opens the door and he and Cary head out. After the door closes, the 
          doctor rubs his head thoughtfully. He talks, apparently, to an offscreen aide.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Well, there they go. Out to face 
                    life. 
                         (shakes his head)
                    And their whole training was in 
                    preparation for death.
          
          He moves off as we
          
                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
          Shep and Cary exit the building but pause outside the doorway. They've seen 
          something coming toward them and glance at one another before clearing out of 
          its path. They watch glumly as a small group of wounded soldiers enter through 
          some metal gates, walk slowly past Shep and Cary without acknowledgment, and 
          head into the hospital. 
          
                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - PERHAPS SIMULTANEOUS
          The office window opens. The doctor -- no longer in white but wearing his 
          uniform -- and his aide take a break, standing in the window frame for a 
          little fresh air. The doctor smokes a cigarette as they discuss Shep and Cary.
          
                              AIDE
                    Why can't they go on with flying? 
                    You know, the air mails or 
                    something?
          
                              DOCTOR
                    I'm afraid they're unfit for further 
                    service in that direction. 
          
          The aide looks at him, quizzically.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    They fell, you know -- six thousand 
                    meters. 
                         (shakes his head, sadly)
                    Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on 
                    the pavement. Shattered both of them. 
                    Their nervous systems are deranged, 
                    disorganized, brittle.
          
                              AIDE
                    Spent bullets.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Spent bullets. That's it. 
                         (nods)
                    They're like projectiles, shaped 
                    for war and hurled at the enemy. 
                         (gestures with cigarette)
                    They've described a beautiful,
                    high-arching trajectory. And now 
                    they've fallen back to earth. 
                    Spent. Cooled off. Useless.
          
          We slowly PULL BACK from the two men.
          
                              AIDE
                    Oh, well, if they take care of 
                    themselves, they'll pull through 
                    all right.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Even if they do take care of 
                    themselves, what good are they? 
                    What can you expect of them? 
                         (shakes his head)
                    I hate to think what may become 
                    of them.
          
          We have pulled back far enough and now we 
          
                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. HOSPITAL - NOT LONG AFTER
          Two uniformed men with familiar faces -- exuberant pilot Bill and reserved 
          gunner Francis -- arrive at the bottom of the stairs in front of the hospital. 
          Bill, with his arm in a sling, and Francis, using a cane, start up the stairs 
          and wave.
          
                              BILL
                         (Texas accent)
                    Hello, Cary!
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Hi, Cary!
          
          At the top of the stairs, Shep and Cary wave back, pleased to see them. 
          
                              CARY
                    Hello, Bill! Hiya, Francis!
          
                              SHEP
                    Hello, Bill! Francis!
          
          Unexpectedly, Shep and Cary hurry down the stairs past them.
          
                              CARY
                         (friendly)
                    Well, I see you got yours.
          
                              BILL
                         (pleasantly)
                    Yup. We crashed.
          
          Bill and Francis watch, surprised, as Shep and Cary hurry off.
          
                              BILL
                         (calls down, puzzled)
                    Hey! Where you going?
          
          Shep and Cary, already seated in the back of a waiting automobile, grin like 
          kids.
          
                              CARY
                    Paris!
          
                              BILL (o.s.)
                    Paris?! 
          
          From the stairs, Francis smokes a cigarette and looks down at Shep and Cary 
          uncertainly. But Bill takes the news in stride -- he smiles and waves his hat 
          at them.
          
                              BILL
                    See you in Paris!
          
                              FRANCIS
                         (waves his cigarette)
                    Yeah.
          
          Smiling, Shep and Cary wave back as their car drives off.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. THE EIFFEL TOWER - NIGHT
          A superimposed text reads:
          
                         PARIS -- 1919.
          
          Traffic noise, taxi horns squeaking.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. PARIS SIDEWALK - NIGHT
          Strolling down the sidewalk four abreast, as if they own the town, come our 
          heroes -- Bill, Shep, Francis and Cary -- in smart hats and dinner clothes. 
          
          Outwardly, they seem to have recovered from their wounds. But: 
          
          Shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally glimpse his eye 
          twitching. 
          
          Cary's bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of his hands. His 
          personality is dark and dry, more subdued than Shep's, and he comes across as 
          the most levelheaded, rational member of the group -- its unacknowledged 
          leader.
          
          Francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll psychologically. A 
          narcoleptic, strangely detached and unemotional much of the time, always on 
          the verge of dozing off, his speech slurs even when he isn't drunk.
          
          Only the athlete of the group, Bill -- a burly Texan whose full name is 
          William Talbot -- is in outstanding physical shape. But he is reckless, 
          restless, and temperamental, covering up unnamed insecurities with bravado and 
          forced exuberance.
          
                              CARY
                    How 'bout a cocktail?
          
                              SHEP
                    Not a bad idea at that.
          
          As a group, they turn and head into a nearby building.
          
                                   BRIEF DISSOLVE TO:
          
          A GLOWING SIGN 
          made of light bulbs, outside the building. It spells out CLARIDGE'S -- a 
          popular Parisian drinking establishment for Anglo-Americans.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. CLARIDGE'S - NIGHT
          Numerous shelves holding numerous bottles of liquor. Employees in white 
          jackets hurriedly rush in and pull down a few bottles.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. CLARIDGE'S BAR - LENGTHY PANNING SHOT
          The place is packed with well-dressed men and women. The bar is crowded with 
          men (and men only, for no women are allowed to sit at Claridge's bar) smoking, 
          drinking, conversing. At the end of the PAN, we discover our heroes entering, 
          greeted by an employee who takes their hats.
          
          ANOTHER VIEW - NEAR THE BAR
          An attractive young woman with a wide, vacant stare stands against a wall 
          opposite the bar holding a champagne glass in her hands. Her name is NIKKI and 
          she seems to be in a world all to herself.
          
          Our four handsome heroes file past her, intent on finding a table. Only Cary 
          pays any attention to Nikki. After they have all passed her, he pauses to turn 
          and stare. She's extremely nearsighted and doesn't notice him. He looks at the 
          glass in her hand, puzzled. He starts off but then pauses. 
          
          After a second uncertain look, he moves off to join his friends who stand 
          together and peer around the crowded room, unable to find a place to sit. Cary 
          keeps looking at Nikki. He glances at the others and they follow his gaze:
          
          NIKKI
          still wearing a blank expression, clutches the glass in two hands.
          
          THE GLASS
          in her hands. Between her fingers, we glimpse its contents -- a complete set 
          of men's false teeth.
          
          We PULL BACK to discover that Cary has approached her. He's standing right 
          next to her and is staring at the glass. She finally notices him.
          
                              CARY
                    I beg your pardon. But, if I'm not 
                    too inquisitive, would you mind 
                    telling me what IS that you're 
                    drinking?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Teeth.

                    Teeth?
          
          After another look, Cary turns to his friends.
          
                              CARY
                    Hey, it's teeth!
          
                              BILL (o.s.)
                    Teeth?!
          
          Shep, Bill and Francis hurry over like children and crowd around to stare in 
          amazement at the teeth. Nikki is unimpressed by all the attention.
          
                              SHEP
                    Teeth!
          
                              NIKKI
                    That's right.
          
                              BILL
                         (enthusiastic)
                    Yup. It's a full set -- upper and 
                    lower.
          
                              CARY
                         (to Nikki)
                    It's a nice expression. 
          
                              SHEP
                    Hey, how come you're with those 
                    teeth?
          
                              NIKKI
                    I was just standing here. And a nice 
                    gentleman came along and begged my 
                    pardon and asked would I mind 
                    holding his teeth for a minute.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, what did he want you to hold 
                    his teeth for?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Said he wanted to biff somebody.
          
                              BILL
                         (excited)
                    Biff somebody?! Which way did he go?!
          
                              NIKKI
                    Just around to the right.
          
                              BILL
                    Come on, men! We're liable to see a 
                    fight.
          
          As quickly as they arrived, Shep, Bill and Francis depart. Cary starts after 
          them but stops to politely address Nikki who has gone back into her trance.
          
                              CARY
                    Would you like to come along?
          
                              NIKKI
                         (as if it were obvious)
                    Oh, no. I have to stay here and mind 
                    the man's teeth.
          
          They glance down at the teeth.
          
                              CARY
                    Oh, of course.
          
          Cary hurries off as Nikki's empty eyes rise to the ceiling.
          
          FLASH CUT - A MAN'S FACE
          as it takes a combination one-two punch from a pair of fists.
          
          FLASH CUT - THE MAN'S BODY
          dropping unconscious to the floor.
          
          OUR FOUR HEROES
          enter a hallway just in time to see two Claridge's employees reach down and 
          haul away the unconscious body. Our heroes have missed the fight but Shep and 
          Bill are delighted anyway. Bill brushes his hands (one of his favorite 
          gestures) with satisfaction, as if he had thrown the punches himself:
          
                              BILL
                    Well. THAT'S all fixed.
          
          Bill straightens his bow-tie. Already the group seeks a new distraction.

                    Let's go back.
          
          They head back to the bar.
          
          THE BAR
          Nikki, no longer standing against the wall, sits on a bar stool with her back 
          to the countertop, smoking a cigarette and holding an empty champagne glass. 
          Our heroes enter and, glancing at the wall, fail to see her. After a moment of 
          searching, Cary spots her at the bar.
          
                              CARY
                    Oh, there she is.
          
          All four crowd around her, pleased to be in her company.

                    Well, we missed it.
          
                              NIKKI

                    Well, they carried a guy out.
                         (sees her empty glass)
                    Say! What's become of the teeth?

          Seats have opened up at the bar so they grab stools next to Nikki. Shep greets

                              SHEP
                    Martiniiii!
          
                              NIKKI
                    Could I have a champagne cocktail?
          
                              JEAN
                    Certainment, Mademoiselle. 
                         (calls off)
                    Quatre Martinis pour messieurs! 
                    Champagne cocktail pour Mademoiselle 
                    Nikki!
          
          The men are all excited to find out her name. Francis uses a pretzel as a 
          monocle to eye Nikki.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Nikki?!
          
                              BILL
                    Nikki?!
          
                              CARY
                    Nikki?!
          
          For the first time this evening, Shep takes off his dark glasses.
          
                              SHEP
                    Can you imagine that, fellas? Her 
                    name is Nikki!
          
                              CARY
                         (considers the
                         situation)
                    Her name is Nikki. She holds men's 
                    teeth. She sits at the bar and she 
                    drinks champagne.
          
                              BILL
                         (significantly)
                    Boys, she's gonna be a lot of 
                    trouble.
          
          Drinks are served. A moment of silence as they imbibe. Nikki's hand shakes as 
          she lifts her glass, spilling some champagne. She laughs, embarrassed.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, my, my!
          
          Shep, who has been watching her closely, also laughs.
          
                              SHEP
                    Poor sweet! She can't even hold her 
                    glass!
          
          Nikki notices Cary unsteadily using both his hands to hold his Martini.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (casually)
                    Oh, well, HE can't either. Besides, 
                    he has to use two hands.
          
          Nikki chuckles. A dark look crosses Cary's face as he looks at her and puts 
          down his drink. Seeing this, Bill and Francis exchange worried glances. Cary 
          abruptly rises and leaves the bar. Mystified, Nikki looks quizzically at Shep 
          who is suddenly grim and annoyed.
          
                              SHEP
                    Course he can't hold his glass. His 
                    hands are burned.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Burned?
          
                              SHEP
                    You have no right to spill YOUR 
                    drinks. He can't help himself.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Burned? How burned?
          
                              SHEP
                    He brought a plane down on fire.
          
                              NIKKI
                    An airplane? In the war?
          
          Shep demonstrates with his hands as he explains:
          
                              SHEP
                    He held the stick. But his hands 
                    began to slip. Then he held it 
                    inside his arms. He was trying to 
                    bring his rear gunner down alive.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Did he bring him down safe?
          
                              SHEP
                    Well... 
          
          Shep takes a swallow of his Martini, sets down the glass.
          
                              SHEP
                    Brought him down.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, so that's why--?
          
                              SHEP
                    Yes! That's why he can't hold a 
                    glass.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, I'm so ashamed. 
          
                              SHEP
                    Now, Cary's had a pretty thin time. 
                    His nerves are tricky. You should 
                    never call attention to his hands.
          
          AT A TABLE
          Cary sits with a fresh drink and is trying awkwardly to pick it up when a 
          handsome but humorless American journalist -- the unspeakable FRINK -- enters 
          and greets him casually.
          
                              FRINK
                    Hi, Cary.
          
                              CARY
                         (unhappily)
                    Oh, hello, Frink.
          
          Cary immediately turns his attention to a menu. Rebuffed, Frink wanders over 
          to the bar and sees the other men. He has a friendly pat on the back for 
          Francis and Bill.
          
                              FRINK
                    Hello, Francis. Bill. 
          
          Frink pauses to stare at Nikki's back, astonished to find a woman sitting at 
          the bar. Then he turns to Shep, amused.
          
                              FRINK
                    Shep. Drunk again?
          
                              SHEP
                    Say, don't you know any OTHER 
                    opening remarks? It's about all 
                    we've heard from you for a year.
          
                              FRINK
                         (signals the bartender)
                    Hi! Jean!
          
          Frink snaps his fingers at Jean and grabs a seat next to Shep. Jean asks for 
          Frink's order in French.
          
                              FRINK
                    Un sidecar.
          
                              JEAN
                    Sidecar ... [?]
          
          Jean moves off. Frink regards the others.
          
                              FRINK
                    Say, why don't you fellows go home 
                    and go to work?
          
                              SHEP
                    Work? What kind of work?
          
                              FRINK
                    Oh, anything useful.
          
                              BILL
                    What could we do? Sell washing 
                    machines? Drive a milk wagon? Mend 
                    old furniture or somethin'? Heh!
          
                              FRINK
                    Go back to flying. Fly the air 
                    mails. 
          
                              BILL
                    Aw, we couldn't fly a kite. 
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Maybe a small kite.
          
          Francis holds his fingers to indicate a very small kite. Bill chuckles.
          
                              FRINK
                    Well, there must be something you 
                    can do.
          
                              SHEP
                    We've got to tend to our drinking. 
                    We don't get much opportunity. 
          
                              FRINK
                    Lots of things going on outside. 
                    Sun shining, trees growing, people 
                    walking around.
          
                              BILL
                    Say! Is that STILL going on?
          
                              SHEP
                         (laughs) 
                    Sounds pretty pre-war to me.
          
          During all this, Nikki has been in her own little world. Frink leans over and 
          whispers to Shep.
          
                              FRINK
                    Hey. Don't I rate an introduction? 
                    Who's your swell friend?
          
                              SHEP
                    Oh, her? Just an old hussy we found 
                    scattered around. 
          
          Around her neck, on a slender chain, Nikki carries a small lorgnette. It opens 
          with a spring and has small rectangular lenses. She uses it frequently, 
          peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless, nearsighted way. On Shep's 
          remark, she whips it out to stare at him, mildly offended. He raises his drink 
          to his lips and turns to her, speaking out of the side of his mouth:
          
                              SHEP
                         (off Frink)
                    Pay no attention. Sometimes he goes 
                    away.
          
          Nikki looks away glumly as Shep grins at her. She turns and sees something. 
          She raises her lorgnette for a better look at:
          
          CARY
          who sits at his table, staring into space, holding his unread menu in his lap.
          
          NIKKI
          is pleased to see Cary.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh! He didn't go.
          
          She rises to join him.
          
          CARY
          startled, rises and stares at Nikki as she approaches.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, I'm so sorry. Your hands... 
          
          She tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror and stuffs them 
          in his pockets.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, your poor hands! Your poor, poor 
                    hands.
          
          Wildly uncomfortable, Cary glances around like a cornered animal and finally 
          stalks away without a word, hands still stuffed in his pockets. Stunned, Nikki 
          watches him exit the building. She realizes she's done something terribly 
          wrong and moves to follow him.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh!
          
          But Shep intercepts her. Upset, she whimpers. 
          
                              SHEP
                         (more in disbelief 
                         than anger)
                    If you aren't the WORST! First, you 
                    insult his hands and make him mad. 
                    Then you cry over them and make him 
                    self-conscious. Come on back here. 
                    Come on.
          
          He clasps her hand and leads her to:
          
          THE BAR
          Francis and Bill watch, disturbed, as Shep guides a crying Nikki onto a stool 
          beside them. Shep sits next to her as she continues to sob. She pulls out a 
          compact to fix her tear-stained face.
          
                              SHEP
                    Well, that's torn it. He'll never 
                    come back now.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Then we'll have to find him.
          
                              SHEP
                    What for?
          
                              NIKKI
                    To explain how sorry I am.
          
                              SHEP
                         (amused at her 
                         distress)
                    We-ell. You don't have to get so 
                    emotional about it.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Who's getting emotional?
          
                              SHEP
                    You are. You're coming all apart. 
                         (hands her a glass)
                    Here. Take a drink of this. Make 
                    you laugh and play.
          
          Nikki takes a sip, then busies herself with putting away her compact. 
          Meanwhile, Bill leans in.
          
                              BILL
                         (to Shep)
                    Say, what's she crying about?
          
                              SHEP
                    She's crying on account of they 
                    didn't wash her strawberries this 
                    morning.
          
                              BILL
                         (to Nikki)
                    Didn't they wash your strawberries 
                    this morning? Well, there ain't a 
                    whole hell of a lot that we can do 
                    about that now.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (agrees, sadly)
                    No.
          
          ANOTHER VIEW
          Frink watches suspiciously as Shep pays the tab, rises and whispers to Nikki.
          
                              SHEP
                    Let's go.
          
          Nikki obediently hops off her stool and Shep leads her away from the bar, 
          toward the exit. Bill and Frink are distressed to see her go. Bill calls after 
          Shep:
          
                              BILL
                    Hey! Where're you goin'?!
          
                              SHEP
                    Oh, out.
          
                              BILL
                         (rises)
                    Out where?!
          
                              SHEP (o.s.)
                    Out to get a drink.
          
          Bill gestures grandly toward the bar with its many shelves of liquor bottles.
          
                              BILL
                    Don't you suppose you could arrange 
                    that here?!
          
                              SHEP
                    Nope. We gotta go somewheres else.
          
                              BILL
                         (without missing a beat)
                    Okay. Come on, Francis. We got to go 
                    somewheres else to get a drink.
          
          Francis and Bill head out the door. After a moment, Frink follows behind.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. AVENUE DES CHAMPS ÉLYSÉES - LATER THAT NIGHT
          A taxi cab -- filled with Bill, Francis, Shep, Nikki and Frink -- pulls up to 
          a restaurant. As it stops, Bill rises and points to someone at a sidewalk 
          table.
          
                              BILL
                    Hey! There he is!
          
          The others look.
          
                              SHEP
                    Where?
          
                              BILL
                    Come on!
          
          The group cheers, spills out of the taxi and heads for:
          
          THE SIDEWALK TABLE
          where Cary sits reading a newspaper. 
          
                              SHEP (o.s.)
                    Cary!
          
          Cary looks up. He rises, a little startled, and politely removes his hat. The 
          others crowd around him.
          
                              BILL
                    Say, what are you tryin' to do, 
                    disown us?
          
                              CARY
                         (genuinely polite)
                    Hello. Won't you sit down?
          
                              BILL
                    Sure we'll sit down. What'd ya think 
                    we'd do? Stand around?
          
          They all take seats around the little table. During this, Frink brings a chair 
          for Nikki who grabs a seat of her own. When he tries to use it to sit next to 
          her, Bill commandeers it for himself.
          
                              BILL
                         (with a wave, to Frink)
                    Thank you. 
          
          A waiter joins them as they settle in.
          
                              SHEP
                    Hello, Cary.
          
                              CARY
                    Hello, Shep. Hello, Nikki. What will 
                    you have to drink? 
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Martini!
          
                              BILL
                    Martini!
          
                              SHEP
                    Martini!
          
                              FRINK
                    Martini!
          
                              WAITER
                    Quatre Martinis?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Uh, could I have champagne, please?
          
                              WAITER
                    Champagne? Oui.
          
          The waiter departs. Off her order, Bill gives Nikki a look.
          
                              BILL
                    Boys, she's goin' to be a problem.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (explains, to Bill)
                    That's what I started on. 
                         (to Cary)
                    It upsets me if I change over to 
                    anything else.
          
                              CARY
                         (to Bill)
                    There's a lot of things wrong with 
                    this one. 
                         (to Nikki)
                    What were you doing at the bar at 
                    Claridge's anyway? 
          
                              SHEP
                    Yes. Don't you know you're not 
                    supposed to be there?
          
                              FRANCIS
                    There's a sign on the wall says 
                    ladies must sit at the back.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Can't read signs.
          
                              SHEP
                    Well, we'll just have to take care 
                    of her, that's all.
          
                              BILL
                    Do you think she's good-lookin' 
                    enough?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, I know I'm not very good-
                    looking but--
          
                              CARY
                    But what?
          
                              NIKKI
                    But when I was a little girl, my 
                    mother always said I had the nicest 
                    hair-ribbon.
          
          Shep laughs derisively. The others give him a look and he shuts up. The drinks 
          arrive. All the men, save Cary, snatch up their glasses. Bill removes the 
          toothpicked olive and swallows his Martini whole. He watches Nikki rubbing her 
          champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a Boy Scout trying 
          to start a fire.
          
                              BILL
                    Then there's her drinking.
          
                              NIKKI
                    What's the matter with my drinking?
          
                              BILL
                    You're a sissy drinker.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well, maybe I can improve.
          
          Meanwhile, Cary attempts -- with some success -- to drink his Martini with one 
          unsteady hand. Bill inspects Nikki's mouth.
          
                              BILL
                    Then there's her teeth. Why, one of 
                    'em is turned sideways.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (points)
                    You mean this one?
          
                              BILL
                    That's it.
          
                              CARY
                    Why don't you have it turned around?
          
                              NIKKI
                    I don't have it turned around on 
                    account of it's a kind of help.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, in what respect does it kind 
                    of help?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well, you see, when anyone kisses me 
                    too hard, it splits my lip. And you 
                    could tell when anyone kissed me too 
                    hard on account of my lip would 
                    bleed. So now I don't let anyone 
                    kiss me -- hard. 
          
          The men are amused. Nikki sips her champagne.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, we'll let that pass.
          
          Bill chuckles. Shep abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Where's he gone?
          
                              CARY
                    Shep went off to sharpen his skates.
          
                              BILL
                    Now, about your nose.
          
                              NIKKI
                    What about my nose?
          
                              BILL
                    It isn't straight. It kind of turns 
                    up at the end.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well, when I was a little girl, I 
                    got bumped by a swing.

                    How'd you happen to get bumped?
          
                              NIKKI
                    I just walked through the gate. I 
                    was only seven.

                    I can't see very far.

                              NIKKI
                    It made me dizzy all day.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, I guess we can't hold that 
                    against her.
          
                              BILL
                    We all make mistakes.
          
                              CARY
                    That's right. Michelangelo painted 
                    Adam with a navel.
          
          Bill and Nikki laugh at this. Suddenly, Nikki grows thoughtful. 
          
                              NIKKI
                    All the same, he'd look funny the 
                    other way -- even in a painting.
          
          They all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of drinks arrives. Frink 
          abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Where's he gone?
          
                              BILL
                    He went off to shave a horse.

                    quite a long time.

                    Well, on account of my mother's name 
                    was Beulah. Now, you can't have a 
                    mother named Beulah. So I changed it 
                    to Jane. And that's how it all began.
          
          An odd CHIMING sound distracts them. They look off to see:
          
          FRANCIS
          the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. He awakes with a frown, 
          pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. The 
          chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits. 
          
          AT THE TABLE
          Nikki watches Francis' exit curiously. Bill waves her off before she can ask:
          
                              BILL
                    He's goin' off to tame an alligator.

                    Francis used to fly with us in the

                              CARY
                    He carries a chiming watch on 
                    account of he's always falling 
                    asleep in the daytime.
          
                              NIKKI
                    What kind of chimes?
          
                              CARY
                    Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and 
                    Whittington.
          
                              NIKKI
                    I'll take vanilla.
          
          Cary puts a fist on his hip and gives Nikki an exasperated look. Taxi horns 
          squeak. Francis, Shep and Frink return from their various adventures and sit 
          down as Bill gives Nikki his opinion of Francis.
          
                              BILL
                    I think he's a washout.
          
                              SHEP
                    Well, just because you're a big 
                    bombardier and an All-American--
          
                              NIKKI
                         (interrupts)
                    All-American what?
          
                              SHEP
                    Halfback.
          
                              FRINK
                    Where?
          
                              CARY
                    Oh, Montana State or somewhere. 
                    Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle 
                    Indians or something. Didn't you 
                    never read about Bill? Bronko Bill 
                    -- the Alabama Flash?
          
          Bill grins as Nikki inspects him closely through her lorgnette.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (skeptical)
                    I think it's a forgery.
          
          Bill's face falls. He looks at Nikki.
          
                              BILL
                    Say! What do you want me to do? 
                    Tackle a horse?
          
          She nods. Shep is amused.
          
                              SHEP
                    Sure. Go ahead. Tackle a horse.
          
                              BILL
                         (with a dismissive wave)
                    All right, all right, I'll tackle a 
                    horse.
          
          Shep looks down the street.
          
                              SHEP
                    Here comes one now.
          
          They all look to see:
          
          A HORSE-DRAWN CAB 
          rolling down the street in their direction.
          
          AT THE TABLE
          Everyone watches as Bill rises and suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab.
          
                              BILL
                    Look out, horse!
          
          THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB 
          rolling along as Bill runs in and tackles the horse, locking his big arms 
          around the animal's front legs to trip up the poor creature.
          
          ON THE SIDEWALK
          Cary, horrified, stands and yells:
          
                              CARY
                    Hey, Bill! Bill! Come back here!
          
          Cary runs off, toward Bill, leaving a thrilled Shep and a worried Francis with 
          a distressed Nikki. They all stare in concerned amazement as a crowd of 
          pedestrians stops to watch the excitement.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (distraught)
                    Oh, Bill!
          
          AT THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB 
          Cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins.
          
                              CARY
                    Hey! What's the idea -- runnin' 
                    down my friend like that? Here! 
          
          Cary forces a wad of francs into the driver's hand. The cabman protests in 
          French but takes the cash.
          
          WIDER VIEW
          of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab. Standing up now, Bill 
          tries to haul the horse to its feet while Cary tries to placate the driver.
          
                              CARY
                    Never mind. Look where you're going 
                    in the future now. You just watch out 
                    where you're going!
          
          ANOTHER VIEW
          Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up. The horse, sorely 
          annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive Bill away. 
          Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. Cary tries to pull Bill away as 
          Frink, Francis and the driver gather around. Bill is more interested in 
          petting the horse which understandably shies away from him.
          
                              CARY
                         (admonishes Bill)
                    Now listen, come on out here, you 
                    old fool. 
                         (to the shying horse)
                    Whoa, whoa. 
          
                              BILL
                    Nice horsie.
          
                              CARY
                         (to Bill)
                    Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed 
                    of yourself. You old fool! You know 
                    what you'll do? You'll kill yourself 
                    one of these days. Now, come on, get 
                    out of here. Now, listen--
          
          Satisfied with the outcome of all this, Bill heads back for the sidewalk.
          
                              CARY
                         (to the driver)
                    You all right now, brother?
          
          The driver nods but is more concerned with reining in his skittish horse.
          
                              CARY
                    All right. Now, you just keep your 
                    horse, see? You got your money.
          
          The cabbie salutes Cary but pays more attention to his horse.
          
          BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE
          The waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group returns. Bill happily 
          dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket. Cary, beside him, leads him to his 
          seat. They all sit down under the following:
          
                              CARY
                    Hey, listen, Bill, you're All-
                    American, see? You're TWO All-
                    Americans! The lady's convinced 
                    you're the whole team. You don't 
                    have to tackle any more horses. 
                    How 'bout that? Drink your drink.
          
                              BILL
                         (pleased with himself)
                    Ahhh. Wasn't that a great spill?
          
          Nikki abruptly rises.
          
                              SHEP
                    Hey! Where are you going?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Would you all excuse me for a 
                    moment?
          
                              CARY
                    Well, where are you going?
          
                              NIKKI
                         (a grave announcement)
                    To take a Chinese singing lesson.
          
          Francis immediately understands that she's become one of them. He raises an 
          olive in the air and cheers:
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Hooray!
          
          The men rise and all but Frink cheer her lustily as she departs:
          
                              MEN
                    Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
          
          NIKKI
          walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer. A smiling maitre d' 
          directs her to the ladies' room.
          
          BACK AT THE TABLE
          Frink watches Nikki disappear from view and, after a glance at the others, 
          rises and follows her. Shep, Bill and Cary remain at the table, laughing and 
          drinking. Bill turns to Cary with a smile.
          
                              BILL
                    Hey. What kind of a girl do you 
                    think Nikki is?
          
          Cary glances in Nikki's direction and tells Bill confidentially:
          
                              CARY
                    I think she's the kind that sits 
                    down on phonograph records.
          
          Bill thinks about this and nods.
          
          INSIDE THE RESTAURANT
          As Nikki returns from her Chinese singing lesson, Frink puts his arm against a 
          wall, blocking her way.
          
                              FRINK
                    Say, Nikki, let's ditch these 
                    drunks and go off somewhere by 
                    ourselves. These crazy fools are 
                    liable to do anything.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (hopeful)
                    Do you think so?
          
                              FRINK
                    Since the war, they don't care what 
                    happens.
          
                              NIKKI
                    And do you?
          
                              FRINK
                    I'll say so. I've got more 
                    important things to think of.
          
                              NIKKI
                    What more important things?
          
                              FRINK
                    Well, my work.
          
                              NIKKI
                    What kind of work?
          
                              FRINK
                    I'm the foreign correspondent for a 
                    New York newspaper syndicate.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (genuinely)
                    How nice for you!
          
          Nikki pushes his arm away and heads for the table. Frink watches her go, a 
          dark look on his face.
          
          BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE
          The men rise briefly as Nikki rejoins them and sits.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Nikki? Are you the kind of girl that 
                    sits down on phonograph records?
          
          Nikki lowers her eyes.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (a bit defensively)
                    People shouldn't leave their records 
                    lying about.
          
                              CARY
                         (to Francis)
                    What did I tell you?
          
                              NIKKI
                         (abruptly brightens)
                    Take me dancing?
          
                              BILL
                    What place you wanna go?
          
                              NIKKI
                    What places you got?
          
                              CARY
                    Well, we got Maxim's, only it's too 
                    early. We've got Florida, Perroquet, 
                    Pigalle, Le Rat Mort, Moulin Rouge, 
                    Bal Tabarin.
          
                              NIKKI
                    I'll take vanilla.
          
          Cary gives her a look. Bill clears his throat.
          
                              BILL
                    Somebody pay for the drinks!
          
          Bill rises and claps his hands with enthusiasm.
          
                              BILL
                    We're off in a "billizzard" of 
                    horse-radish!
          
          Whatever that means. The men rise and retrieve their hats.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. BAL TABARIN BALL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
          A festive Parisian night spot. Dance MUSIC plays while a floor show, lit by 
          moving spotlights, unfurls in the huge, darkened ballroom which is ringed with 
          crowded tables. A handsome male dancer, in tuxedo and top hat, whirls 
          exuberantly around the floor, surrounded by beautiful chorus girls. 
          
          Somewhere above all this, Nikki, lit by spotlight flashes, sits on the edge of 
          a ringside balcony observing the show with eager interest through her 
          lorgnette.
          
          The show continues: after a few twirls, the dancer links arms with the girls 
          to form a line and do some precision high-kicking. The music continues but the 
          dance apparently ends and the lights come up. Impressed, Nikki is breathless.  
          
                              NIKKI
                    My, my! Isn't this nice?!
          
          Nearby, the men sit at a roped-off table for six on a low balcony. Cary and 
          Francis sit glumly on one side of the table as Bill tries to tell a story to 
          the others (Frink; a nameless young woman nicknamed "Kiss-Me-Quick" who 
          appears in this scene only; Shep and Nikki). 
          
                              BILL
                    Now, listen, men. I'll tell ya 
                    something funny. 
          
          Cary and Francis look doubtful about this. Bill sits at the table. 
          
                              BILL
                    I was only four years old once.
          
                              FRANCIS
                         (to Cary)
                    What'd he say?
          
                              CARY

                    Amazing.
          
                              BILL
                    And my aunt had a very low-neck 
                    dress on.

                              BILL
                    And she sat right across the table 
                    in front of me. And I said, "Auntie 
                    -- I can see your knees!"
          
          Nobody laughs or even changes expression.

          Cary gives her a look, then rises and peers with one eye into the open bottle 
          of champagne on the table between him and Nikki. He gestures at the bottle as 
          he sits back down.

          Everybody cracks up -- except Nikki, who looks a little hurt. 
          
          An empty champagne bottle is placed on the floor.

          Nikki rises indignantly and turns on Frink.

          The other men seated at the table understand instantly what's going on and 
          stare darkly at Frink.
          
                              SHEP
                    You'll have to watch that lad, Nikki.

                    Society and he has a groping good

          Frink nervously adjusts his necktie. Cary glares at him.

          Frink, pretending chagrin, looks at Nikki.
          
                              FRINK

                    to us all now!
          
          Nikki laughs as they all depart. Frink rises wearily to follow them out.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. HOTEL CARLTON - LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT
          The group enters the spacious, empty lobby, laughing loudly. Someone says, 
          "Wheeee!" Others say, "Ssshhh!" They cross to the front desk.
          
          AT THE FRONT DESK
          The clerk is fast asleep, his head down on the desk. Nikki is about to wake 
          him when Bill bounds forward.
          
                              BILL
                         (quietly, to Nikki)
                    Sh! Let him sleep. What's your 
                    number?
          
                              NIKKI
                         (whispers)
                    Eighty-eight.
          
          Bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators. 
          
          Once they've gone, Bill, the athlete, vaults the front desk and lands -- with 
          a little noise -- on the other side, without waking the clerk. 
          
          He cautiously checks the clerk to make sure the sleeping man hasn't awakened, 
          then fetches Nikki's key from its cubbyhole. 
          
          Bill leaps up on top of the desk, landing on his rear end, swinging his legs 
          around -- nearly kicking the clerk in the process -- then silently slides off 
          the desk to the floor. 
          
          Watching the sleeping clerk warily, Bill tiptoes away. 
          
          At the last possible moment, Bill purposefully WHACKS the signal bell with his 
          hand, making it RING noisily. The clerk awakens with a start and grabs a 
          nearby telephone just as Bill disappears from view.
          
          IN THE HOTEL ELEVATOR
          Amused, the group piles into the "ascenseur". Last one in is Bill who shuts 
          the door and the metal safety gate behind him.
          
                              BILL
                    Here we are. Goin' up!

                    throttle?
          
          Bill looks for the controls as Cary turns playfully to the others.

                    Mm hmm.
          
          Bill finds the appropriate lever and grabs hold.
          
                              BILL
                    Here it is. Contact?

                    Contact!
          
          Bill pulls the lever and the car rockets up the shaft.
          
                              BILL
                    We're off!
          
          Most everybody cheers. They watch with great interest as the floors pass by 
          rapidly.

                    that.
          
          Bill brakes the car and starts it back down the shaft.
          
                              SHEP

                    Say! How do you stop this thing?
          
          Bill brakes the car too quickly -- it slams to a halt and everyone loses their 
          footing, nearly falling down. Part of the light fixture above them breaks 
          loose and crashes down on Frink's head, much to everyone's amusement -- they 
          laugh as Frink clutches his head, annoyed.
          
                              FRINK
                    That's right, laugh.

          Bill reaches for the controls but Shep grabs the tail of Bill's jacket and 
          pulls him away.
          
                              SHEP

          Bill brushes his hands, his pride a little hurt.

          The elevator door opens. Cary leads the way as everyone else spills out 
          happily into the hall. Shep puts a congratulatory arm around Cary.
          
                              SHEP

                    You deserve a medal.
          
          Bill pins Nikki's room key to Cary's vest pocket. Smiling, Cary holds it up 
          proudly to Nikki.
          
                              BILL
                    All right, come on, men.
          
          They head down the hallway in a drunken, disorganized fashion. Shep walks an 
          imaginary tightrope, wobbling spectacularly. Cary, bringing up the rear, shuts 
          the elevator door and escorts Nikki.
          
                              FRANCIS

          Francis drops into a handy chair and lights a cigarette but Bill immediately 
          hauls him up:
          
                              BILL
                    Come on, come on.
          
          Bill, whistling and pretending to ice skate, leads the group down the hall. 
          Francis tries to enter a room but Frink pulls him out of the doorway. Bill 
          backtracks to help Frink escort Francis. This allows Cary and Nikki to take 
          the lead. Nikki indicates the correct doorway to Cary.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Right here.
          
                              CARY
                    Oh! Eighty-eight! Here we are!
          
          The group cheers. Cary unlocks the door. The group enters Nikki's hotel room.
          
          INT. NIKKI'S HOTEL SUITE - SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          Laughing, the group files into the darkened room and spreads out.
          
                              SHEP
                    Wheeeee!
          
          Nikki switches on the lights. Bill marvels at the luxurious suite.
          
                              BILL
                    Well, for--! Well, I'll be a--!
                    Look! Nikki's got a whole apartment! 
          
                              SHEP
                    And a gramophone!
          
          Delighted, Shep starts to crank up the gramophone.
          
                              CARY
                         (unimpressed)
                    Yeah! And chairs and tables and 
                    floors and ceilings and everything.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    So THIS is where Nikki lives!
          
          Amused and pleased by their reaction, Nikki heads for her bedroom.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Yes, this is where Nikki lives.
          
          Shep picks up a book and admires it grandly.
          
                              SHEP
                    And she's got a book!
          
          The gramophone comes to life and MUSIC plays from a record. Nikki passes into 
          the bedroom and switches on a light.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Got all the comforts of home.
          
          Frink tries to follow Nikki into the bedroom but Bill pointedly intercepts 
          him. Disappointed, Frink looks past him into Nikki's bedroom and Bill follows 
          his gaze to see:
          
          PERFUME BOTTLES
          on Nikki's glass-topped dressing table -- dozens of them. 
          
                              BILL
                    Hey! Look at all the bottles! 
          
          Bill enters and inspects the table closely.
          
          NIKKI'S BEDROOM
          as the other four men respond to Bill's enthusiastic summons and enter.
          
                              BILL
                    Hey! Come on in and look at Nikki's 
                    bottles! 
          
          Cary joins Bill at the table as the Texan picks up one of the bottles and 
          reads the label.
          
                              BILL
                    Ylang! Ylang!
          
                              CARY
                    Hey, don't be handlin' her things. 
                    Put 'em down.
          
          But Bill goes right on, delighted. The others crowd around the table.
          
                              BILL
                    Chichi!
          
                              CARY
                    Leave 'em alone.
          
                              BILL
                    Salammbo! Chypre! Reve de Vestale! 
                    Jinko!
          
                              SHEP
                    Hey, you big bombardier--
          
                              BILL
                    Chiki chiki!
          
          During this, Francis has casually inspected a curtained walk-in closet near 
          the table. He pulls the curtain to reveal a rack of carefully hung dresses and 
          a floor covered with dozens of shoes organized in impeccably straight lines.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Say, I never saw so many shoes.
          
          The others gather to peer into the closet. Frink loses interest immediately 
          but whistles at the sight of Nikki's sheer nightgown draped across her bed. He 
          moves to it eagerly. 
          
          Nikki sits on the edge of the bed removing her shoes as Frink picks up her 
          silk bedclothes and examines them with a grin. Bill pointedly takes the gown 
          out of Frink's hand. Tight-lipped, Frink stares at him. Suddenly, Bill points 
          to a small wind-up clock on Nikki's night table. 
          
                              BILL
                    Look! 
          
          Bill drops the garment on the bed and moves to the night table.
          
                              BILL
                    She never winds her clock! 
                         (picks up the clock)
                    It says eleven and I've never been 
                    anywheres at eleven.
          
          Nikki removes her earrings as Frink walks off and Cary takes a seat at the 
          foot of the bed.
          
                              CARY
                         (dry, to Bill)
                    What time are you anywhere?
          
          Bill shakes the clock and puts it to his ear, listening.
          
                              BILL
                         (to Cary, ignoring Nikki)
                    Two o'clock. It's always two o'clock 
                    in my life. Hey, listen. Besides 
                    never having any matches and always 
                    spilling her drinks, she never winds 
                    her clock! Think I'll go in the 
                    bathroom and see if she leaves the 
                    cap off her tooth paste.
          
          Bill heads for the bathroom but then stops and turns back to Nikki.
          
                              BILL
                    Is it all right?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Help yourself.
          
          Bill disappears into the bathroom, leaving Nikki and Cary sitting on the bed. 
          Nikki peers at Cary through her lorgnette.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (friendly, sympathetic)
                    Hello.
          
                              CARY
                         (grins)
                    Hello, yourself.
          
          The phonograph MUSIC ends just as Bill's voice calls from the bathroom.
          
                              BILL (o.s.)
                         (excited)
                    TURTLES!
          
          Cary turns toward the bathroom.
          
                              CARY
                    Turtles?
          
                              SHEP (o.s.)
                    Turtles?
          
          Shep runs past and hurries into the bathroom. Cary rises from the bed to 
          follow. Nikki is perhaps mildly surprised by the excitement.
          
          HIGH ANGLE SHOT - TWO TURTLES
          swimming in shallow water at the bottom of a bathtub. A couple of decorative 
          lily pads lie next to the drain. The turtles' shells are inlayed with 
          brilliants.
          
          BATHROOM
          Bill kneels by the tub as Frink, Shep, Francis and Cary join him. Bill points 
          out his discovery to the others.
          
                              BILL
                    Turtles!
          
                              OTHERS 
                    Turtles?! 
          
                              SHEP 
                         (thrilled)
                    It IS turtles!
          
          Francis picks up a turtle and shows it to Cary.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Hey! Look, Cary! It's turtles!
          
          Cary examines the turtle for a moment, placing a finger on it.
          
                              CARY
                         (with a nod)
                    Nice work, boys. It's turtles.
          
          Cary and Francis inspect the turtle.
          
          BATHROOM DOORWAY
          Nikki enters and addresses the men.
          
                              NIKKI
                    And now do you suppose you could 
                    all excuse me? 
          
          Cary joins her.
          
                              NIKKI
                    On account of I'd like to go to bed.
          
                              CARY
                    Sure we'll excuse you. I'll clear 
                    everybody out of here. 
                         (to the others)
                    Come on, you fellas. Nikki wants to 
                    go to bed.
          
          AT THE BATHTUB
          The other men, still lined up at the tub enjoying the turtles, are 
          disappointed.
          
                              BILL
                    Go to bed?
          
                              SHEP
                    Awww! Bed?
          
          They rise reluctantly. Bill shakes water off his hand.
          
                              BILL
                    Yup, all right. 
          
          They file out of the bathroom.
          
                              SHEP
                         (waves to the turtles)
                    So long, turtles. 
          
                              BILL
                    Good night, turtles.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Night, turtles.
          
          Frink follows the others humorlessly, without a word to the turtles.
          
          TRACKING SHOT - THROUGH THE SUITE
          The entire group exits the bathroom, passes through the bedroom and heads into 
          the sitting room.
          
                              BILL
                    Poor Nikki. Do you wanna go to 
                    sleep?
          
                              NIKKI
                         (nods)
                    Mm hm.
          
                              SHEP
                    Sleep? You should NEVER go to sleep!
          
                              BILL
                         (with a wave, to Nikki)
                    Well, good night.
          
          As Bill enters the sitting room, he looks around and hurries away toward 
          something he sees off screen. Shep and Francis follow.
          
                              SHEP
                         (with a wave)
                    Nighty-night, Nikki.
          
          Francis says nothing.
          
                              FRINK
                    Good night, Nikki.
          
          Frink is the last out the bedroom door, though Cary stays behind to linger a 
          moment with Nikki.
          
          SITTING ROOM
          Bill takes a pillow from the sofa and tosses it across the room. He proceeds 
          to leap feet first onto the sofa, fall on his back with his feet in the air, 
          then stretch his legs out across the sofa, lying down to go to sleep. 
          
                              BILL
                         (satisfied)
                    Ah!
          
          Shep, watching this, scratches his head, confused, then moves to join him. 
          Frink watches Francis drag some sort of heavy fringed rug to the floor near 
          the sofa, apparently preparing to lie down on it.
          
          AT THE BEDROOM DOOR
          Nikki and Cary stand close, exchanging warm goodnights. 
          
                              NIKKI
                         (dead serious)
                    Good night, Cary.
          
                              CARY
                         (playful)
                    Good night, Nikki.
          
          Cary, perhaps pleased with Nikki's attention to him, watches her withdraw into 
          the bedroom and shut the door. He turns from the door to see:
          
          LOW ANGLE SHOT - SITTING ROOM
          Four men, happily situated, settling in for a night's sleep: Bill and Shep on 
          the sofa, Frink on a chair, their three pairs of feet propped up on a table. 
          Francis, his head on a pillow, lies on the floor, stretching his legs and 
          yawning as only a narcoleptic can.
          
                              BILL
                    Say! I like this place.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Say, I like this place, too.
          
                              SHEP
                    I think it's swell.
          
          CARY
          peers at them skeptically, hands on his hips.
          
                              FRINK (o.s.)
                    It suits me.
          
                              CARY
                    You fellas think you're gonna PARK 
                    here?
          
                              BILL (o.s.)
                    Sure!
          
                              FRANCIS (o.s.)
                    Sure.
          
          Cary hears the bedroom door open behind him and turns to see:
          
          NIKKI
          opening the door, wearing a robe, carrying a bottle of eau de Cologne and some 
          towels.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (innocently)
                    Will somebody please scrub my back?

          Excited again, Bill jumps to his feet, upsetting the others in the process.
          
                              BILL
                    Will somebody scrub your back?! Look 
                    out, boys!
          
          The men struggle to their feet and follow him to:
          
          NIKKI   
          holds the bottle in her hand. The men's hands reach for it but Bill is quicker 
          than the others and commandeers it with authority.
          
                              BILL
                    I got it, I got it, I got it.
          
          From over Nikki's nearly bare back, we watch Bill whistling jauntily as he 
          shakes eau de Cologne onto a towel.
          
          CARY
          now seated, watches this coolly as he takes out a cigarette and lights it.
          
          BILL AND NIKKI
          Bill examines Nikki's back with delight.
          
                              BILL
                         (impressed)
                    Mmmmmm mm!
          
          His eyes pop. For Nikki, though, this is an asexual activity.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Scrub hard.
          
          Bill places her head on his left shoulder and prepares to scrub with his 
          right.
          
                              BILL
                    Did anyone ever see such a back in 
                    their life? 
          
          He scrubs a little.
          
                              BILL
                    Did anyone ever HEAR of such a 
                    thing? 
          
          More scrubbing -- his tongue sticks out of his mouth as he studies his work.
          
          SHEP, FRINK AND FRANCIS
          watch all this with envy and interest.
          
                              BILL (o.s.)
                    Just look at that back. Just look at 
                    that thing, won't you?
          
          BILL AND NIKKI
          Bill keeps scrubbing, adopting the air of a professional back scrubber.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Harder.
          
          He lifts her hair to inspect her neck.
          
                              BILL
                    My, my! 
          
          He scrubs her neck.
          
                              BILL
                    I could go on doin' this a long time.
          
          More scrubbing and then an amusing pantomime: To Nikki's bewilderment, Bill 
          pulls back the hair over her ear, looks down into her ear, cleans it out with 
          his little finger, flicks wax off his finger daintily, buffs the ear with the 
          towel, and finally blows sharply into the ear, causing her to wince. She 
          places her head on his shoulder again. More scrubbing.
          
          TRACKING SHOT - SITTING ROOM
          We start on Cary, who sits rocking in a tilted chair and smoking, watching 
          Bill and Nikki with amusement. After a pause:
          
                              CARY
                    Nikki? Are you rich?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well, practically. Beulah is rich.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, just how rich IS your mother?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Leave a lady a few secrets, can't 
                    you?
          
          By now, we've pulled back far enough to take in the whole group. Bill finishes 
          his scrubbing and Nikki adjusts her robe.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Thank you, William. That was EVER so 
                    cool and nice. 
                         (takes bottle and 
                         towels from him)
                    Good night.
          
                              BILL
                    Good night.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (to the others)
                    Good night.
          
                              THE MEN
                    Good night, Nikki.
          
          They watch her move off. We hear the bedroom door close. Bill realizes 
          something, snaps his fingers, claps his hands and starts off.
          
                              BILL
                    Come on, fellas!
          
          He rushes off. Shep, Francis and Frink rise and follow. Cary merely collects 
          his hat and cane and heads for the front door.
          
          SITTING ROOM - ANOTHER VIEW
          Bill and Shep carry the sofa over and place it directly in front of Nikki's 
          closed bedroom door. Francis brings his rug and pillow. 
          
          CARY
          watches them, amused, from the front door.
          
                              CARY
                    You're gonna stay here, huh?
          
          SITTING ROOM - ANOTHER VIEW
          The men settle in for the night.
          
                              BILL
                         (to Cary)
                    That's right! She might need some 
                    more help!
          
          Bill waves good night and collapses on the sofa. Frink, glancing at Cary, 
          brings his chair and sits in it. Francis lies on the floor. Shep fluffs 
          pillows on the sofa, etc.
          
          CARY
          turns, shuts off the lights, opens the front door and exits the darkened room, 
          closing the door behind him.

          INT. CARLTON BAR - NEXT MORNING
          The drinking hole in Nikki's hotel. A French woman noisily arranges dirty 
          drinking glasses as Bill, Francis and Shep enter -- horribly hungover, moaning 
          and yawning -- and line up at the bar. A bartender greets them to take their 
          order.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Messieurs.
          
                              SHEP
                    Morning.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Morning.
          
                              BILL
                    Um, prairie oyster.
          
                              SHEP
                    Prairie oyster.
          
          Shep has to nudge Francis with an elbow.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Prairie oyster.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Prairie oyster for three.
          
          Bartender moves off. Shep puts on his dark eyeglasses.
          
          CARLTON BAR - ANOTHER VIEW
          We start on a CLOSE SHOT of three drinking glasses as the bartender breaks a 
          raw egg into one. Beside them are the other ingredients of a potent hangover 
          remedy. We PAN OVER to the three men:
          
                              SHEP
                    Say, we'd better get back to our 
                    hotel.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    There's no Nikki at our hotel.
          
                              BILL
                    That's right.
          
                              SHEP
                    And the bar doesn't open so early.
          
                              BILL
                    Say! Why don't we move in here?
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Sure. Let's stay here.
          
                              BILL
                    But - what about Cary?
          
                              FRANCIS
                         (to Shep)
                    What about Cary?
          
                              SHEP
                         (to Francis)
                    What ABOUT Cary?
          
          Francis shakes his head, he has no idea.
          
                              BILL
                    We can move him in, too.
          
          Francis nods in agreement. Shep thinks it over as the drinks arrive.
          
                              SHEP
                    Not a bad idea!
          
          Shep pays off the bartender who departs with a mumbled "thank you." The three 
          men each down their nasty hangover cures in a single swallow and move off one 
          at a time -- first Shep who exhales deeply, then Francis who takes it in 
          stride. Finally, Bill exhales happily and claps his hands as he follows the 
          others out, their hangovers apparently remedied.
          
                              BILL
                         (cheerfully)
                    Well, come on, men. Let's go.

          INT. NIKKI'S SUITE - LATER THAT DAY
          Phonograph music plays as an Asian maid, the hotel's specialist in Chinois 
          Pedicure, paints Nikki's toenails. We PAN UP to discover Nikki wearing a robe, 
          sitting in a chair next to the phonograph, smoking a cigarette and checking on 
          the progress of her paint job. A snappy knock at the door.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (wearily)
                    Entrez!
          
          THE FRONT DOOR
          opens and Bill, looking dapper, enters.
          
                              BILL
                    Hi, Nik!
          
          Then, Shep enters, wearing his dark eyeglasses and carrying a bouquet of 
          flowers.
          
                              SHEP
                    Hello, Nikki!
          
          Next, Francis enters, sleepily.
          
                              FRANCIS
                         (in mid-yawn) 
                    Hello.
          
          Finally, Cary, who closes the door behind him.
          
                              CARY
                    Good morning, Nikki.
          
          The men are all: wearing suits and ties, pleased to see her, and stone sober. 
          Francis finds his way to the sofa, which has been returned to its proper spot 
          in the room. He lies down and shuts his eyes.
          
                              NIKKI (o.s.)
                    Hello, Bill. Hello, Shep. Hello, 
                    Cary. Hello, Francis.
          
                              FRANCIS
                         (from the sofa)
                    Morning, Nikki.
          
                              NIKKI 
                    I didn't expect to see you all so 
                    early.
          
          Shep puts the flowers in a vase.
          
                              BILL
                    We camped on your doorsteps last 
                    night. And this morning we all moved 
                    in.
          
          Cary leans over her affectionately.
          
                              CARY
                    Despite your practically innumerable 
                    faults, we adore you. We've decided 
                    to adopt you.
          
          Bill and Shep kneel next to Nikki. Bill notices the toenail painting.
          
                              BILL
                    Well, for heaven's sakes! Look at 
                    Nikki! What are you having done to 
                    yourself, gal?
          
                              SHEP
                    Whatcha having your toes painted 
                    for, Nikki?
          
          Cary stands behind Nikki as she looks down at her toes.
          
                              NIKKI
                    I don't know. 
                         (looks at Bill and Shep)
                    Seemed like a good idea at the time.
          
          Cary smiles. Nikki, Bill and Shep share a laugh. The Asian woman goes right on 
          painting as Bill and Shep study Nikki's legs. During this, Nikki hands her 
          cigarette to Cary who moves to put it in an ashtray by the window.
          
                              BILL
                    Why, look at Nikki's legs, would 
                    you? That there is practically the 
                    loveliest pair of legs I ever saw in 
                    all my born days.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Like my legs?
          
          Cary stares out the window at a rainy day. 
          
                              SHEP
                    Look at those legs, Cary. My, they 
                    nearly match. 
          
          Cary turns from the window. 
          
                              SHEP
                    Did you ever see such a swell set of 
                    legs?
          
                              CARY
                    Well, what do you want me to do 
                    about it? Burst into tears?
          
                              SHEP
                    Would it embarrass you, Nikki, if 
                    Cary were to burst into tears?
          
                              NIKKI
                         (looks at her legs)
                    On account of my legs? Oh!
                         (turns to Cary,
                         heartfelt)
                    I think that would be sweet.
          
          Cary manages a slight grin. As he does, there's a knock at the door. Everyone 
          hollers, "Entrez!" Shep runs to the door and opens it.
          
                              SHEP
                    Oh, boy! Here come the drinks!
          
          The others cheer happily. Two hotel employees enter carrying trays loaded with 
          already poured drinks. Shep hands a glass to Nikki.
          
                              SHEP
                    Here, Nikki, drink this. 
          
                              CARY
                    Make you laugh and play.
          
                              NIKKI
                    That's what I want to do, laugh and 
                    play.
          
          Shep hands Bill a glass.
          
          Francis sits groggily on the sofa, a drink in each hand. He polishes off one 
          and then the other. He leans over and sets one empty glass on the floor but 
          holds on to the other as he puts his head to the nearby pillow and dozes off.
          
          Cary, Bill and Shep crowd around Nikki who is still seated -- all have drinks. 
          The tray-carrying hotel employees have apparently exited. Bill proposes a 
          toast.
          
                              BILL
                    Here's to Nikki's dainty legs. As 
                    smooth and hairless as an egg.
          
                              SHEP
                    Wheee!
          
                              CARY
                    Hurray!
          
                              NIKKI
                    'Ray!
          
          They drink. Another knock at the door. They all yell, "Entrez!" The door opens 
          to reveal Frink -- whose face falls when he sees the other men with Nikki. The 
          others are not happy to see him, either.
          
                              CARY
                    Well! Here comes that licentious 
                    old man. Who invited him?
          
          Cary hands his glass to Bill and moves to meet Frink as he enters.
          
                              FRINK
                         (sneering)
                    Still drinking?
          
                              CARY
                         (shakes his head 
                         mockingly)
                    How can you tell?
          
          Cary watches Frink approach Nikki.
          
                              FRINK
                    Morning, Nikki.
          
          After a pause, Nikki looks up at him uncertainly as if she doesn't recognize 
          him. Then she peers at him through her lorgnette.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, it's you. 
                         (after a pause,
                         reluctantly polite)
                    Won't you sit down?
          
                              FRINK
                    Thank you.
          
          Frink moves off to find a chair. Shep sets down his drink and follows him. 
          Frink starts to move a chair but Shep stops him.
          
                              SHEP
                    Say, I don't think Nikki likes you.
          
                              FRINK
                    Oh, no?
          
                              SHEP
                    No. What do you wanna hang around 
                    for?
          
                              FRINK
                    Well, what do YOU hang around for?
          
                              SHEP
                    Me? Why, I came to bring Nikki some 
                    posies. I'll bet you didn't bring 
                    Nikki any posies.
          
                              FRINK
                    I-- Well--
          
          During the above dialogue, Bill nudges Cary mischievously and they glance down 
          at the tray in front of them. They exchange knowing nods, pick up some drinks, 
          bring them over, and offer one to Frink.
          
                              BILL
                    Have a drink?
          
                              FRINK
                    No, thanks.
          
                              SHEP
                    Cure the shakes.
          
                              FRINK
                    I haven't got the shakes.
          
                              CARY
                    Let's see. Hold out your hands.
          
          Bill and Shep watch with interest as Frink holds out his hands, palms up.
          
                              CARY
                    No, turn them over.
          
          Frink turns them over, palms down. Cary looks at Frink's steady hands, 
          impressed.
          
                              CARY
                    Say, that's pretty good. 
          
          Cary looks down at the drink in his own hand.
          
                              CARY
                    Let's see if you can hold this.
          
          Cary sets the glass on top of Frink's downturned hand. Frink balances the full 
          glass with ease.
          
                              CARY
                    Say, that's great.
          
          Cary places a second full glass on Frink's other hand. Frink balances both 
          glasses with ease. Cary expresses keen admiration.
          
                              CARY
                    Steady as a rock!
          
          Frink looks at the others, a little smugly. Cary slowly backs away and walks 
          off, as do the others. Frink's face falls as he realizes he has been left 
          standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced on top of his 
          hands and no way to safely remove them.
          
          Cary, Shep and Bill return to Nikki and crowd around her.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, I guess that'll keep his hands 
                    out of mischief for a while.
          
          Frink, abandoned, reluctantly pleads with the others.
          
                              FRINK
                    Hey. Take these off.
          
          But the others simply ignore him.
          
                              CARY
                    Now, let's see. Where were we before 
                    we were so rudely interrupted?
          
                              BILL
                    We were talkin' about Nikki's legs.
          
                              CARY
                    That's right. We were talkin' about 
                    Nikki's legs. And havin' a fine time, 
                    too.
          
          The Asian maid who has been working on Nikki's feet abruptly rises.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Finis.
          
          The men cheer, "Yay!" and Nikki smiles at the woman as she exits with her 
          tools. The men crowd closer to peer down at Nikki's legs.
          
                              SHEP
                    Let's inspect the job.
          
          But Nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, my poor toes. Don't look too 
                    close.
          
          Nikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under body. Since she's 
          no longer using her footstool, Cary commandeers it and sits on it.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, what's the matter with your 
                    toes?
          
          Nikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story -- very slowly. Her 
          eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible sadness.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well... when I was a little girl...
          
          A worried look crosses Cary's face.
          
                              NIKKI
                    ... my mother bought me a new pair 
                    of shoes. ... And they were WAY too 
                    short. ...
          
          Shep and Bill listen soberly.
          
                              NIKKI
                    ... And I had to walk all the way to 
                    Sunday school and back. ... Down the
                     road. ... And it was hot and dusty.
          
                              BILL
                         (hand to his face)
                    Oh, take her away! She's breakin' 
                    my heart!
                         (sobs)
          
                              NIKKI
                    And when I got home ...  my toes 
                    were spoiled.
          
                              CARY
                         (on the verge of tears)
                    Oh, dear, oh, dear. 
          
                              SHEP
                    That's such a sad story. Let's all 
                    have a drink, quick!
          
          Their eyes pop. The men jump up eagerly and run off. Nikki, thoroughly 
          nonplussed by this, takes a sip of her drink. Shep, Cary and Bill crowd around 
          a tray and start imbibing. 
          
          Meanwhile, Frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to lose the two glasses 
          that are still balanced on his hands.
          
          For the first time in this scene, Nikki is on her feet. She walks over to the 
          drink tray and puts a friendly hand on the shoulders of Shep and Cary.
          
                              NIKKI
                    And now would you all excuse me? 
                    On account of I'm gonna put on a 
                    dress.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, why not?
          
          Nikki walks off, exiting into her bedroom. The men continue to stand around 
          the tray, drinking. In the background, Francis sleeps on the sofa.
          
          Over by the fireplace, a frustrated Frink, still balancing the two drinks, 
          casts a dirty look at the others. He angrily hurls the glasses into the 
          fireplace, smashing them loudly. Francis, startled awake by the noise, jumps 
          off the sofa. The others stare at him. 
          
                              SHEP
                    My, my. What's HE getting so excited 
                    about?
          
          Frink, furious, rubs his hands with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his 
          pocket. 
          
                              FRINK
                    You guys think you're so darn smart.
          
          Shep, Bill and Cary laugh at this. Cary consults his pocket watch.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, cheerio, fellas. I'm off. 
          
          Bill waves goodbye. Cary eats a last olive, tosses the toothpick and heads for 
          the front door.
                         
                              CARY
                    See ya later.
          
          Cary exits as Nikki's voice drifts in from:
          
          THE OPEN BEDROOM DOORWAY
          
                              NIKKI (o.s.)
                    What are the plans for the day?
          
          Shep, drink in hand, enters and leans on the wall outside the door.
          
                              SHEP
                    Well, on account of it's raining and 
                    everything, we thought we'd go over 
                    to the Cluny and play billiards and 
                    drink beer.
          
                              NIKKI (o.s.)
                    How about Cary?
          
                              SHEP
                    Went to get his hat and coat. He's 
                    going to Père Lachaise.
          
                              NIKKI (o.s.)
                    Père Lachaise? What's Père Lachaise?
          
                              SHEP
                    A cemetery. How 'bout you coming 
                    with us?
          
                              NIKKI (o.s.)
                    No. I'm going with Cary.
          
                              SHEP
                         (concerned)
                    You've been invited?
          
          Nikki appears in the doorway, dressed to go out.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Do you think Cary might object?
          
                              SHEP
                    Well, I have an idea he'd like to be 
                    alone.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Why alone?
          
                              SHEP
                    Well, Cary likes to be alone. He's 
                    as brittle as a breadstick. One 
                    silly crack from you and he might 
                    break up in sections.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (thinks about this)
                    Well, then, I don't think he should 
                    be left alone. 
                         (beat) 
                    Tell me, what's Cary doing in Paris?
          
                              SHEP
                    What are we all doing in Paris?
          
                              NIKKI
                    I know. But why doesn't he go home?
          
                              SHEP
                    Well, he's not ready to go home. 
                    What could he do if he went home? 
                    Have people cry over his hands?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well, it seems - a pity to go on 
                    like this. He's such a sweet soul.
          
                              SHEP
                    One of the best.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Isn't he just sort of wasting 
                    himself?
          
                              SHEP
                    On the contrary. He's trying awfully 
                    hard to get hold of himself. 
          
          Lost in thought, Nikki moves off and a worried Shep follows her to:
          
          THE FRONT DOOR
          Shep stops Nikki from leaving. She's a little downcast as he admonishes her:
          
                              SHEP
                    Now, listen. If you tag along, for 
                    heaven's sake, be careful what you 
                    say. Don't start getting sorry for 
                    him and don't cry over him. 
                         (with a chuckle)
                    And, above all, don't make any 
                    unfortunate remarks, hear?
          
                              NIKKI
                         (earnest)
                    Oh, I won't. Why, who ever heard of 
                    such a thing?
          
          Nikki opens the front door and exits into:
          
          THE HALLWAY
          where Cary -- carrying coat, hat and cane -- emerges from a suite across the 
          hall from Nikki's and heads for the elevator. He stops when he hears Nikki 
          calling to him. She runs to join him.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Cary?! Cary? I'm coming with you. 
          
          Without waiting for a reply, she starts for the elevator, then stops to look 
          down at her shoes.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oooh! 
                         (to Cary)
                    Ooh, wait for Nikki!
          
          She leaves him and runs back to:
          
          THE FRONT DOOR
          of her suite where Shep still stands. He watches with surprise as Nikki runs 
          in.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (calls back to Cary)
                    Wait for Nikki!
          
          Puzzled, Shep follows Nikki who rushes to:
          
          HER BEDROOM CLOSET
          Nikki draws the curtain to reveal her enormous collection of dresses and 
          shoes. Shep, drink in hand, wanders in slowly and leans against the doorjamb 
          as he watches Nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put on a seemingly 
          identical pair of red ones.
          
                              SHEP
                    What are you changing your shoes 
                    for?
          
                              NIKKI
                    On account of I can walk faster in 
                    red shoes.
          
          Shep watches her hop and scurry off.
          
                                   FADE OUT
          
          FADE IN
          
          EXT. AVENUE CASIMIR-PERIER - LATER THAT DAY
          Passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day. A taxi cab pulls up to a sidewalk 
          café -- LA REGENCE, according to the awning that covers the little iron 
          tables. Cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as Nikki hurries 
          under the awning. Cary joins her and, after a word to the driver ("Restez 
          ici."), looks at the rain.
          
                              CARY
                         (to Nikki)
                    Perhaps we'd better stay here a 
                    while till it clears up.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Could we sit down here, do you 
                    suppose?
          
                              CARY
                    I think so. Would you like something 
                    to drink?
          
          They move toward the café. As Cary hangs up his hat, a waiter arrives.
          
                              NIKKI
                    What should I drink now, do you 
                    suppose?
          
          Cary orders the drinks as Nikki moves to sit at a table.
          
                              CARY
                         (to the waiter)
                    Deux picon citrons.
          
          The waiter acknowledges this and heads inside, calling out the order to his 
          bartender. Cary joins Nikki at the table and sits down. She removes her gloves 
          and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights it under the 
          following:
          
                              NIKKI
                    Picon citrons?
          
                              CARY
                    Very refreshing. Make you laugh and 
                    play.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (amused) 
                    That's what you always promise. 
                         (suddenly serious) 
                    Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on 
                    drinking so desperately?
          
                              CARY
                    Don't we all?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Not like Shep.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, Shep has that tic under his 
                    eye, you know. Takes a lot of drinks 
                    to keep that quiet.
          
                              NIKKI
                    But isn't there some kind of 
                    treatment or something?
          
                              CARY
                    Shep could never stand a long course 
                    of treatment. Drinking's the only 
                    corrective so far as he's concerned. 
                    He's found out the tic doesn't work 
                    when he's tight. So he stays tight.
          
          The waiter arrives with the drinks. As he spritzes seltzer water into their 
          glasses, Cary leans over to light a cigarette for Nikki. The waiter leaves and 
          they drink.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Seems such a pity. How did he get 
                    the tic?
          
                              CARY
                    In the war.
          
                              NIKKI
                    I know. But how?
          
                              CARY
                    Well, it's not very romantic.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well, don't tell me if you don't 
                    want to.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, you see, a tic is a nervous 
                    habit.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Yes?
          
                              CARY
                    Lice under his bandages.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh.
          
                              CARY
                    He had the devil of a time. He 
                    nearly lost his mind. So you'll have 
                    to excuse him a little. 
          
                              NIKKI
                    I'm so sorry for Shep.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, don't let him know it.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well, isn't he going home? Not ever?
          
                              CARY
                    Not ever. Not in his dark glasses 
                    anyway.

                              CARY
                    Well, how are you going to end? How 
                    am I going to end? How is ANYONE 
                    going to end? How's your picon

                    Not now. A long time ago, perhaps, 
                    when I was a little boy.

                    That's right.
          
          Nikki exhales, drinks, looks at Cary and shakes her head.
          
                              NIKKI
                    But aren't you going back? Not ever?

          Nikki finishes the last of her drink.
          
                              NIKKI
                    No. I'm ready now.
          
          Cary leaves some money, Nikki gathers her things. They rise and walk off.

          Cary and Nikki stroll into view, arm in arm, and look around. The rain has

          They've paused. Cary looks around, points with his cane.

                    I'm sorry. I really didn't do it on 
                    purpose. It was on account of the

          They approach the large tomb which is fenced off by a low iron gate. Cary 
          removes his hat, Nikki peers at the double sepulchre through her lorgnette.

                              CARY
                    Whatever that is. He gained a 
                    footing in a certain household as 
                    tutor to a maiden called Héloïse.

          They crouch at the iron bars of the gate surrounding the tomb and take off 
          their gloves under the following:
          
                              NIKKI
                    Do you think I might find a heart-
                    shaped stone? You help me, Cary.

                    All right, Nikki. Only we have to 
                    leave soon.

                    Just as soon as we find our stones.
          
          They reach through the gate to poke at the rocks and gravel surrounding the 
          tomb. After a moment, Nikki rises and walks off excitedly with a stone in her 
          hand.
          
                              NIKKI
                    I found one! Where's yours?
          
          Cary, too, finds a stone and rises to join her.
          
          NIKKI AND CARY'S HANDS
          as the couple sits near the tomb. They show each other the stones in their 
          upturned hands. Nikki takes the heart-shaped stone from her palm and places it 
          in Cary's stiff, weathered hand. Then she transfers his stone to her hand.
          
                              NIKKI
                    And, now, you take mine. And I'll 
                    take yours. 
          
          They close their hands over the stones as we PULL BACK to a WIDER VIEW of 
          Nikki and Cary smiling at one another.
          
                              NIKKI

                    I can't help it. You MAKE me cry. 
          
          He stares at her, astonished, as she rambles on.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, don't look so troubled, Cary. 
                    I'm all right. I just want to cry 
                    for a minute. 
                         (puts a hand on 
                         his shoulder)
                    On account of you're so nice. You're 
                    so clean, Cary. And your teeth are 
                    so white. You're so civilized. You 
                    don't care about anything any more, 
                    nor anybody. Nothing makes any 
                    difference to you. Nothing can

                    Why, you're lost. You're ALL lost. 
                    You and Shep and the rest of you. 
                         (takes his hand)
                    Oh, I want to do something for you. 
                    I want to help you. 
                         (looks at his wrist)
                    Let me wash your bracelet, Cary. 
                         (points)
                    Why, see? The silver's all 
                    tarnished. The silver's all 
                    tarnished. 
                         (removes his bracelet)
                    I'll take it with me and scrub it 
                    when I get home. I'll polish it 
                    with my nail-brush.
          
          Nikki turns to put the bracelet in her purse. Thoroughly unnerved by this 
          emotional outburst, Cary looks around.
          
                              CARY
                    It's getting dark.
          
          Cary rises, deeply uncomfortable. Nikki tries to make amends.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well ...

                    Anyway, we found a name for my 
                    turtles!
          
          Cary turns and looks at her, amazed.
          
                              CARY
                    Héloïse and Abélard? A name for 
                    your turtles? So that's what you 
                    were looking for. I might have 
                    known how it would end.
          
          He looks down at the heart-shaped stone held awkwardly in his stiff hand. His 
          thumb brushes the stone and it falls to the ground.

          INT. NIKKI'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
          Nikki sits, soberly polishing Cary's bracelet with her nail brush. Shep 
          enters, drink in hand.
          
                              SHEP
                    Hi, Nik.
          
          She looks at Shep forlornly.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (sadly) 
                    Hello.
          
          Shep walks over and confronts her.
          
                              SHEP
                    Cary's in a state. Says he's going 
                    away. Can't stand it any longer and 
                    all that sort of thing. 
                         (sits on the bed)
                    What happened between you two, 
                    anyway?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Cary seemed so sad and everything -- 
                    on account of I'd taken up his whole 
                    afternoon. 
                         (sighs)
                    So little Nikki said, all merry and 
                    bright, "Well, anyway, we'd found a 
                    name for my turtles."
          
                              SHEP
                    A name for the turtles? 
          
          Shep cracks up with laughter and falls backward on the bed, his head dangling 
          over the edge.
           
                              SHEP
                    That's funny! 
          
          Shep keeps laughing, twists around on the bed and sits up again.
          
                              SHEP
                    Name for the turtles! That's so 
                    funny, all right! 
          
          Shep holds a hand to his head and catches his breath as Nikki joins him on the 
          bed.
          
                              SHEP 
                    Why do you always HAVE to be funny 
                    at the wrong time? Didn't I tell you 
                    Cary was brittle? How did he respond 
                    to THAT line?
          
                              NIKKI
                         (morosely) 
                    Pulled down the iron curtain.
          
          Shep cracks up again. Worried, Nikki tugs at his sleeve.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Did he say he was going away?
          
                              SHEP
                         (through his laughter) 
                    Yup. Gotta get away from it all.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Then, you've got to go to him right 
                    now! 
          
          Nikki rises and urgently pulls Shep, helpless with laughter, to his feet.
          
                              NIKKI
                    And explain that I didn't mean 
                    it! Tell him how it was and 
                    everything!
          
                              SHEP
                    Listen--
          
                              NIKKI
                    No, go on. You go right now before 
                    it's too late!
          
          She pushes him toward the door.
          
                              SHEP
                    But Nikki--!
          
                              NIKKI
                    You go right straight to Cary.
          
          They exit.

          INT. CARY'S ROOM - LATER
          Cary removes clothes from a rack as a now serious Shep, drink in hand, stands 
          nearby trying to reason with him.
          
                              SHEP
                    Now, listen, Cary, you don't have to 
                    behave like an old Easter egg. 
                    You're breaking Nikki's heart. She 
                    doesn't know any better.
          
                              CARY
                    She doesn't know any better? Well, 
                    whether she does or not, I'm going 
                    a long ways away from Nikki. Nikki 
                    and her turtles. 
          
                              SHEP
                    Whew! You sure are in an uproar. 
                    What YOU need is a drink!
          
          Cary packs a weathered suitcase.
          
                              CARY
                    I need more than a drink. I need a 
                    lot of geography between me and that 
                    girl.
          
                              SHEP
                    Where do you want to go?
          
                              CARY
                    Anywheres. So long as it's a long 
                    way from Nikki. 
                         (pauses, looks at Shep)
                    You know -- that girl does things to 
                    me. 
                         (back to packing)
                    I've got to get away.
          
                              SHEP
                    Well, I wonder what's happening in 
                    Portugal tonight.
          
          Cary stops packing and gives Shep a look.
          
                              CARY
                    Say ... 
                         (thinks it over)
                    I wonder what IS happening in 
                    Portugal tonight.
          
          Shep stares at Cary, astonished, and moves off. Cary sets his packed suitcase 
          upright.

          INT. NIKKI'S SUITE - LATE THAT NIGHT
          Bill and Shep set a large steamer trunk upright.
          
                              BILL AND SHEP
                    Heave ho!
          
          Bill opens the trunk.
          
                              BILL
                    Ah! There you go.
          
          Nikki appears, carrying a suitcase.
          
                              NIKKI
                    If Cary's going to Portugal, why 
                    can't we go to Portugal, too? Ain't 
                    we got any rights?
          
                              BILL
                    Sure we got rights!
          
          Getting organized for their own impromptu Portuguese expedition, Bill, Francis 
          and Shep fill the trunk with Nikki's things as Frink leans on it, smoking a 
          cigarette and eyeing Nikki coolly.
          
                              SHEP
                    Cary better not think he can screw 
                    up in Portugal and leave old Shep 
                    behind.
          
                              FRINK
                    Say, when's he leaving?
          
                              SHEP
                    Ten-thirty in the morning. Sud 
                    Express.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Don't we have to have passports and 
                    things?
          
                              SHEP
                    Sure we gotta have passports!
          
          Bill joins Nikki.
          
                              BILL
                    What kind passports you like?
          
                              NIKKI
                    What kind passports you got?
          
                              BILL
                    We have ebony, cocoanut, 
                    thornberry passports.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (grandly)
                    I'll take vanilla.
          
          She brushes past him and crosses to a table where she is joined by Frink.
          
                              FRINK
                    Good night, Nikki. I'll see you on 
                    the train.
          
                              NIKKI
                    You're goin', too?
          
                              FRINK
                    Why not? 
                         (with a sly smile)
                    I might, uh, pick up a couple of 
                    features for my paper - in 
                    Portugal.
          
          Frink walks out the door. Nikki sighs a little and then busies herself with 
          carrying items the trunk. Shep arrives with a selection of dresses as the 
          group crowds together. Chaotic overlapping dialogue:
          
                              SHEP
                    Nikki, do you want --?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Did you put all my shoes in?
          
                              BILL
                    You bet. There they are--
          
                              SHEP
                    I don't know how you're going to get 
                    all these dresses in, Nikki.
          
          From the trunk, we
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. NIKKI'S SUITE - NEXT MORNING
          A mountain of trunks and other luggage piled on the floor. Nikki sits down 
          near Shep who finishes packing a suitcase on the floor.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Don't we have to go like anything? 
                    The train leaves in twenty minutes.
          
          Francis leans casually on the towering pile of luggage. Bill stands next to 
          him, smoking a cigarette and calling ironically to Nikki:
          
                              BILL
                    Are you SURE you have everything?
          
                              NIKKI
                         (misses the irony)
                    I - I think so.
          
          Francis clicks his tongue as he regards the pile.
          
                              FRANCIS
                         (dryly)
                    Hardly seems enough.
          
          Suddenly, Nikki gasps and rises.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, my turtles! My turtles!
          
          THE TURTLES
          are plucked from the tub and placed in ...
          
          ... A BASKET
          by Nikki's little Asian maid. The fancy beribboned wicker basket has an 
          oversized handle which makes it a rather improbable turtle carrier. Bill 
          secures a wire mesh covering over the basket and carries it out of the 
          bathroom, handing it grandly to Francis. 
          
                              BILL
                    Here you are, Francis! You're the 
                    custodian of the turtles! Now don't 
                    fall down on the job.
          
          Bill walks off. Francis calls after him, worried:
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Hey! I never tended turtles before.
          
          Nikki arrives with a bottle of water and soaks her hand.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Now, all you have to do - 
          
          She gives Francis the bottle and sprinkles the turtles with water from her wet 
          hand. 
          
                              NIKKI
                    - is to sprinkle 'em now and then, like 
                    this.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Oh, yeah. I see.
          
          Some of the water ends up in Francis' eye which he wipes with the basket's 
          ribbon. Nikki walks off and Francis practices soaking his hand and sprinkling 
          the turtles.
          
          IN THE BEDROOM
          Five bellhops march in and, under the direction of Nikki and the men, proceed 
          to carry off the luggage, chattering in French.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well, we're off. 
                         (to a bellhop, 
                         about the trunk)
                    Be careful of that one.
          
          Burdened with luggage, the bellhops file out through the suite. Bill, suitcase 
          in hand, follows them out, beckoning to Francis behind him.
          
                              BILL
                    Uh, come on, Francis! Take those 
                    turtles!
          
          Francis hurries along carrying the basket, followed by Shep and Nikki.
          
                                   FADE OUT
          
          FADE IN
          
          EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATER THAT MORNING
          A whistle BLOWS. Their luggage already aboard, Francis, Nikki, Shep and Bill 
          walk down the platform, parallel to the train. Bill claps his hands 
          exuberantly.
          
                              BILL
                    There she is, boys! The Sud Express!
          
                              SHEP
                    Can you imagine Cary tryin' to run 
                    away and leave us behind?
          
          Bill laughs. Nikki peers at the train through her lorgnette.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Do you suppose he's really gonna 
                    be here?
          
                              BILL
                    Sure he'll be here. He's never 
                    missed a train in his life.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Say, do you suppose the turtles'll 
                    be all right with that porter?
          
          Bill gives Francis a supportive pat on the back.
          
                              BILL
                    Aw, sure they'll be all right. All 
                    you got to do is -
                         (gestures with his hand)
                    - sprinkle 'em!
          
          Francis nods soberly. Bill laughs. Nikki points, excited.
          
                              NIKKI
                    There he is!
          
          FARTHER DOWN THE PLATFORM
          Cary buys a paper from a newsboy and steps onto his train.
          
                              BILL (o.s.)
                    Say, Cary!
          
          On the train steps, Cary stops and turns as his friends arrive and gather 
          around him, grinning.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Hello, Cary.
          
                              CARY
                         (surprised)
                    Well, hello. What are you all doing 
                    down here?
          
                              BILL
                    We just came down to see you off is 
                    all.
          
                              CARY
                    Well, that's darn decent of you.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Ya got a nice seat?
          
                              CARY
                    Yeah, right by a window.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, how nice for you!
          
                              BILL
                         (with childlike desire)
                    Come on! Show us your seat by the 
                    window!
          
                              SHEP
                         (cheerful, insistent)
                    Yeah, come on, Cary! We wanna SEE 
                    that seat by the window.
          
          Climbing the steps, Bill and Shep crowd a confused Cary and force him into the 
          train. Following the others, Francis helps Nikki up the steps.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Come on, Nikki.
          
          They all board the train and head for:
          
          INT. CARY'S COMPARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
          The group crowds into the small compartment.
          
                              BILL
                    My, my, what a swell train.
          
                              SHEP
                    Sud Express, Train de Luxe. Say, 
                    I wonder if a chap can get a drink 
                    on this train.
          
                              BILL
                    Sure! I don't see why not. Push the 
                    button.
          
          Bill pushes a button for the porter.
          
                              CARY
                         (flustered)
                    Well, I'm afraid you won't have time 
                    for a drink. We're gonna start in a 
                    minute. You'll have to get off.
          
          Everyone but Cary grabs a seat. Astonished, Cary stares at each as they speak: 
          
                              BILL
                    Get off?! Gosh, no. We LIKE this 
                    train!
          
                              FRANCIS
                    This is a Train de Luxe.
          
                              SHEP
                    Yes, we like trains de luxe, don't we, 
                    Nikki?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Sure! Trains de luxe is what we like.
          
          The whistle BLOWS. Cary panics.
          
                              CARY
                    Hey! He's blowing the whistle. 
                         (grabs Shep's shoulder)
                    Hey, we're gonna start.
          
                              SHEP
                    Well, let her start.
          
          The trains starts. Bill jauntily throws his hat up to the luggage rack above 
          and the others settle in for their journey.
          
                              BILL
                    Let 'er go Gallagher. Who cares?!
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Who cares?!
          
                              SHEP
                    Who cares?!
          
                              NIKKI
                    Who cares?!
          
          Frink enters casually.
          
                              FRINK
                    Hello, everybody.
          
          Cary is stunned. Frink sits down with the others.
          
                              CARY
                    And you, too?
          
                              FRINK
                    That's right.
          
          The group takes in the train's departure with perfect composure. Cary stands 
          and looks at them for a moment before breaking into a understanding grin.
          
                              CARY
                    That's right. Who cares?
          
          Cary sits. As the train hurtles out of the now empty station, Nikki suddenly 
          turns to the window and waves goodbye to no one at all:
          
                              NIKKI
                    Goodbye! Goodbye! Don't forget to 
                    write!
          
          Shep, Bill and Francis quickly join in, waving and shouting goodbye, much to 
          Cary's amusement. Even Frink manages a smile at this.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          THE TRAIN'S WHEELS
          racing down the track.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. CARY'S COMPARTMENT - IN THE HEAT OF THE EVENING
          The compartment doorway. We hear the men laughing. Bill -- drink in hand, his 
          necktie loosened and his coat off -- appears in the doorway, coming from the 
          train's corridor.
          
                              BILL
                    Hi, men! Look what I found.
          
          With a grand gesture, Bill presents an elderly British gentleman who follows 
          him into the little room, greeted with a cheer of "Hooray!" from the men who 
          sit around, similarly coatless (save Frink), smoking and drinking. 
          
          Various bottles stand on a central table. The old gentleman is greeted warmly 
          but it's never clear whether he is an old friend or a total stranger.
          
                              SHEP
                    Come in.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Sit down.
          
                              CARY
                    Have a drink.
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    Ah, thank you, no, not I. 
          
          Bill and the old gentleman sit down. Nikki dozes in her seat by the window. 
          The basket of turtles hangs from above.
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    I - I say, are you all going to 
                    Portugal?
          
                              SHEP
                    Yup. We're going down there to 
                    investigate conditions.
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    Investigate conditions?
          
                              BILL
                    Drinking conditions, mostly.
          
                              SHEP
                    By the way, what ARE conditions?
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    Don't you know what conditions are?
          
                              SHEP
                    No. Never saw one in my life.
          
                              BILL
                    The drinking conditions are pretty 
                    bad right here.
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                         (chuckles skeptically,
                         glancing at the bottles)
                    Ahh, indeed.
          
                              BILL
                    My beer's full of cinders.
          
                              CARY
                    Good for ya. Make ya lay hard-shelled 
                    eggs.
          
          The men laugh. A whistle BLOWS. The conductor appears briefly in the doorway 
          to announce in French that the mademoiselle's compartment is ready.
          
                              CARY
                    Nikki? The man says your 
                    compartment's ready.
          
          Nikki wakes, rises, and clutching her pillow, heads for the doorway.
          
                              NIKKI
                    I'm glad -- on account of it's been 
                    so hot and I'm so tired and I want 
                    to go to bed.
          
                              SHEP
                    Going to bed? Who ever heard of such 
                    a thing?
          
          Bill rises to confer with her at the door.
          
                              BILL
                    Can we help you undress?
          
                              NIKKI
                    No, thank you, William.
          
          The old gentleman looks rather astonished at this casual exchange.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Take off your shoes? 
          
                              SHEP
                    Undo your hair?
          
                              BILL
                    Scrub your back or something?
          
                              NIKKI
                    No, I can manage quite well by 
                    myself. Good night, everybody.
          
          The men say, "Good night." Frink, who has been watching Nikki with a predatory 
          eye, is the most polite:
          
                              FRINK
                    Good night, Nikki.
          
          Nikki turns and disappears down the corridor. The old gentleman mops his brow 
          with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his collar.
          
                              CARY
                    Can you imagine that ungrateful old 
                    trollop? She wouldn't let them help 
                    her undress.
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    Can't understand it at all.
          
                              CARY
                    You know, she's not very pretty. But 
                    when she was a little girl, her 
                    mother always said she had the nicest 
                    hair-ribbons.
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    Indeed?
          
                              CARY
                    She got one tooth turned around, she 
                    can't see very far, and she's ALWAYS 
                    speaking out of turn. Otherwise, 
                    she's a mighty fine piece of 
                    architecture.
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    Mm, seems to need a few repairs.
          
          During the next exchange, Frink, seated by the door, grins at Bill and Shep, 
          then notices Francis dozing off. Frink cautiously rises and exits into the 
          corridor without anyone noticing his departure.
          
                              SHEP
                    She's got eyes like an Assyrian 
                    Queen's got eyes.
          
                              BILL
                    You ain't never seen no Assyrian 
                    Queen! You're just a-makin' that up 
                    outta yore own head!
          
                              SHEP
                    I did SO see an Assyrian Queen.
          
                              CARY
                    In whose green hat?
          
                              SHEP
                    In the Metropolitan Museum's green 
                    hat, that's whose green hat.
          
          Francis' pocket watch CHIMES. He wakes, rises, puts on his hat and moves 
          absently toward the door. Seeing this, Shep, Bill and Cary shout at him: 
          "Whoa!" Francis pauses in the doorway and sleepily turns to the others.
          
                              CARY
                    Hold on there! Where you goin'?
          
                              SHEP
                    You're not going anywhere. You're on 
                    a train.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Sorry.
          
                              SHEP
                    You go back to your turtles, hear? 
                    You've been neglecting your 
                    assignment.
          
          Francis moves to the hanging basket of turtles, takes off his hat and, bottle 
          in hand, wets his fingers and sprinkles the turtles. Curious, the old 
          gentleman rises to join him. Francis explains as he works:
          
                              FRANCIS
                    I have to sprinkle the turtles, see?
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    Sprinkle the turtles?
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Sure. 
          
          The old gentleman nods and clicks his tongue with understanding.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Cool 'em off. 
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    Hm?
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Turtles get feverish on trains.
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    Ahh! Uh huh.
          
          A woman's SCREAM drifts in from the corridor.
          
                              NIKKI'S VOICE
                    Cary!
          
                              FRANCIS
                    What's that?
          
                              GENTLEMAN
                    Hm?
          
          The men hear Nikki SCREAMING. 
          
                              CARY
                    Nikki!
          
          Francis, Cary, Bill and Shep -- in that order -- scramble out the door,
          leaving the old gentleman behind.
          
                              NIKKI'S VOICE
                    Cary! Bill! Shep!
           
          The men rush down the corridor to:
          
          INT. NIKKI'S COMPARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
          Frink grapples with a half-dressed Nikki, his lips pressed to her neck as she 
          struggles to free herself from his grasp.

                    Cary!
          
          Energized by Nikki's peril, Francis bursts in and pulls Frink away from her.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Say! 
          
          Nikki grabs a wrap from the turned-down bed and covers herself as Frink pushes 
          Francis hard into a nearby wall, knocking him to the floor.
          
                              FRINK
                    Get out of here!
          
          Frink turns back to a defiant Nikki as Cary enters and sees a dazed Francis 
          slumped against the wall, clutching his head. Cary grabs Frink's shoulder and 
          spins him around.

                    is that of yours?
          
          By now, Bill and Shep have entered and joined the tense confrontation.

          Cary rolls his eyes at this remark and wisely holds Bill back.

          Distraught, Nikki sinks down on a chair.
          
                              NIKKI

          Frink turns to her in protest.
          
                              FRINK
                    I'm not gonna let these silly drunks

                    You will, eh?
          
          Frink starts to strong-arm Cary. Cary punches Frink in the jaw, knocking him 
          onto the bed.
          
                              SHEP
                    Socko!
          
          As Frink slumps down to floor and leans against the bed, half-conscious, 
          Francis rises and watches the proceedings with a hand on his head.

                    Oh, dear!
          
          Cary, fist still tightly clenched, stands over the dazed Frink as Bill 
          brightens considerably and wipes his hands with delight.
          
                              BILL

          Cary exits. Bill and Shep haul Frink to his feet.

          Bill and Shep carry Frink in and dump him on the seat opposite Francis. Bill 
          walks off, wiping his hands happily. The others are grim, furious at Frink for 
          his actions. Shep watches a disgusted Francis soak his hand and sprinkle Frink 
          as if he were one of Nikki's turtles. Frink snaps out of his daze.

                    might be different.
          
          Francis pointedly sprinkles Frink one last time. They give each other a dark 
          look. Francis fingers the neck of the water bottle as if he were going to use 
          it to smash Frink in the face. As they glare ominously at one another, we

          Crowded city street. A superimposed title reads: LISBON

          LISBON NIGHT MONTAGE
          Cocktail shaker in the hands of an expert who shakes it rhythmically as 
          appropriate Latin MUSIC begins. This DISSOLVES TO a kaleidoscopic VIEW of our 
          protagonists enjoying the night life: Nikki's image dominates at the center, 
          surrounded by images of the men in dinner clothes. Everyone drinks, except 
          Frink who smokes a cigarette and stares, desirous and snakelike, presumably at 
          Nikki. 
          
          DISSOLVE TO Nikki and her war birds (minus Frink) seated at a bar in an 
          otherwise empty club late at night, wearing goofy party hats. They swallow a 
          last drink and start to leave -- laughing, talking, merrily blowing little 
          party horns, taking a bottle or two with them, and waving to an unseen 
          bartender as they go. Someone says, "Good night." We TRACK IN for a closer 
          look at the bar, covered with many empty glasses.

          Cary, wearing a robe, sees Shep still asleep in bed. Cary puts on a party hat, 
          sits on the edge of his own bed opposite Shep's, picks up a party horn and 
          blows into it, hard. The horn SQUEALS horribly. Shep wakes with a start and 
          sits up in bed, completely unnerved. Cary laughs at him and, with his clenched 
          hands, picks up a bottle.

                              PEDRO
                    Right this way.
          
          Pedro leads and they happily follow.

          INT. THE BAR - MINUTES LATER
          Led by their guide, Pedro, the group files in and lines up at the bar. A tiny, 
          extremely drunken old man is the only other customer.

                         (to the bartender)
                    Hey! Vermouth!
          
          Bill, glass raised, proposes a toast. On the wall behind him is the shadow of 
          the drunken old man, standing in roughly the same pose.
          
                              BILL
                    Well, men, fire and fall back!
          
          As Bill drinks, the old man's shadow wobbles forward. Bill hears the sound of 
          liquid SPATTERING. He stops drinking and looks puzzled.
          
          A stream of liquid pours down onto Bill's right foot, soaking his sock and shoe.
          
          Bill turns to find the drunken old man leaning at an unsteady angle, the 
          alcohol spilling steadily out of a glass in the man's hand and onto Bill's 
          foot.
          
                              BILL
                    Hey! What's the idea?
          
          The others, lined up at the bar, see this and laugh. The drunken old man 
          brushes some lint off Bill's jacket as Bill shakes his pant leg, amused.
          
                              BILL
                    Well, I hope I don't catch a cold 
                    in my left ear.
          
          Band MUSIC plays. Cary looks up, concerned.
          
                              CARY
                    Hey, drink your drinks! We'll miss 
                    the parade!
          
          The group hurriedly finish and exit. Shep pays the tab. Bill, followed by the 
          old man, shakes his pant leg and limps along after the others.
          
                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. ARENA - MINUTES LATER
          The crowd CHEERS and the band PLAYS as a parade of matadors, picadors and 
          banderilleros enters the ring.
          
          Led by their guide, Pedro, the group takes seats in the front row, back of the 
          trenches. They have to sit close down so Nikki can see things. The drunken old 
          man from the bar tags along behind Bill like a puppy dog and tries to sit next 
          to him but Pedro pointedly directs him to a seat in the second row.
          
          When Bill rises to cheer the parade, the drunken old man also rises and taps 
          him affectionately on the shoulder. Bill turns and greets him pleasantly, 
          shaking his hand.
          
                              BILL
                    Well! My old pal!
          
          The old man tips his hat to Bill and sits. Bill shakes his pant leg and gives 
          the old man a wry look before also sitting. 
          
          IN THE RING
          The parade ends. A matador throws his montera (his black woolen hat) into the 
          crowd.
          
          IN THE FRONT ROW
          Cary catches the hat, much to the group's delight -- they shout "Hooray!" 
          Immediately, a cape is hurled at Bill who drapes it over the railing before 
          them. Cary offers the hat to Nikki.
          
                              CARY
                    Nikki, here's a present for you.

                    Oh, a hat!
          
                              PEDRO
                    Oh, señor, no, no, no -- you must 
                    not keep the hat. You must put a 
                    little present in it and return it 
                    to the matador after the fight.

                    What kind of present?
          
                              PEDRO
                    Well, eh - a little jewelry. 
                    Something you have like the chain or 
                    the watch or the - the - the 
                    cigarette case or the cuff links or 
                    - or the--

                    Vanilla?
          
                              PEDRO
                    Yes! Vanilla!
          
          A trumpet FANFARE. The crowd CHEERS. Bill points, excited.
          
                              BILL
                    Look! Here he comes!
          
          IN THE RING
          A bull charges into view. Bull-fighter and bull face off. The bull makes ten 
          passes, faster and closer each time.
          
          IN THE FRONT ROW
          Bill sits next to Pedro.
          
                              PEDRO
                    Nice work! Good work.
          
                              BILL
                    What's so good about it?
          
                              PEDRO
                    He works close to the bull.
          
                              BILL
                    Is that so dangerous?
          
                              PEDRO
                    Sure, it's dangerous. Bull-fighting 
                    is very dangerous. It takes a lot of 
                    courage to go into the bull ring.
          
          Bill scoffs and waves dismissively. Cary leans in with a query.
          
                              CARY
                    Is it true the bull is blind when he 
                    charges?
          
                              PEDRO
                    He sees only the cape -- perhaps.
          
          IN THE RING
          Bull-fighter and bull continue their duel. Finally, the bull gets the 
          advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull.
          
          IN THE FRONT ROW
          Bill is unimpressed.
          
                              BILL
                    Bet I could run that bull bow-legged. 
                    You know, I should have BEEN a 
                    bull-fighter.
          
                              PEDRO
                    You should have started at twelve 
                    years of old.
          
                              BILL
                    I bet I could start right now.
          
                              CARY
                         (puts a hand on 
                         Bill's shoulder)
                    Sit still and behave yourself.
          
                              PEDRO
                    Bull-fighting is not for Americans.
          
                              BILL
                    You think we haven't got the nerve 
                    or something?
          
                              PEDRO
                    Why, listen, bull-fighting is just 
                    for us, the Latins.
          
                              BILL
                    He thinks we're a-scared!
          
                              NIKKI
                         (helpfully)
                    He tackled a horse once.
          
                              PEDRO
                         (stares at Bill)
                    Tackle a horse? 
          
          Full of himself, Bill nods. 
          
                              PEDRO
                         (turns away; flatly)
                    Is not the same!
          
          Everyone suddenly stares in shock as:
          
          IN THE RING
          the bull knocks down the matador. Others rush in to distract the bull which 
          runs wild, out of control.
          
          IN THE FRONT ROW
          Frink nudges Francis awake and points out the carnage in the ring. Francis 
          glances at the spectacle briefly and then sleepily applauds. Frink gives him a 
          look and nudges him to stop clapping. Francis simply goes back to sleep.
          
          WILD BULL MONTAGE
          The toreros try to control the bull but it refuses to cooperate. 
          
          The crowd watches intently. Bill takes off his own hat and picks up the 
          matador's cap that Cary had caught.
          
          Toreros scramble and run for their lives. The bull chases them down, runs 
          across the ring, forcing them to jump the barrera, the protective wooden 
          barrier that circles the inside of the arena. 
          
          Bill, now wearing the cap, can't resist leaning over and mocking a group of 
          toreros who huddle in the callejon, the safe side of the barrier, just below 
          him.
          
                              BILL
                    Nice work, Tony! Nice work, Joe!
          
          The toreros look up at Bill in surprise. One of them responds in Portuguese 
          with a gesture toward the ring, as if to ask "If it's so easy, why don't you 
          try it?" The other toreros laugh.
          
          Bill stares into the ring, a savage look in his eyes. He puts a leg up on the 
          railing.
          
          He jumps down into the ring.
          
                              CARY'S VOICE
                    Hey! 
          
          Cary rises, stunned.
          
                              CARY
                    Bill! Come back here!
          
          But it is too late. Bill's coat is already off and he waves it like a cape as 
          he stalks after the bull.
          
          The bull turns and sees him.
          
          Bill moves toward it, waving his coat and grinning like a madman.
          
          Shep is frozen. Beside him, Nikki screams and turns away.
          
          The bull begins to charge.
          
          Cary climbs over the railing.
          
          The bull charges.
          
          TRACK FAST TOWARD Bill who holds the coat before him -- big eyes, big grin.
          
          The bull is on him. The bull roars.
          
          Bill's face snaps backward in a blur, his coat follows. 
          
          The bull gores him through his coat. His face twists in pain. 
          
          CUT WIDE as the bull knocks Bill's body around the ring like a rag doll. He 
          hits the ground hard. Screams from the crowd.
          
          Four toreros rush in.
          
          They surround and distract the bull. Bill lies motionless.
          
          Cary runs across the ring.
          
          More toreros and others rush in, surrounding the bull, finally leading away.
          
          In the front row, Shep, Nikki, Francis, Frink and Pedro watch with concern as 
          ....
          
          ... toreros converge on Bill and try to move his body. Cary joins them.
          
                              CARY
                    Bill!
          
          But Bill is unconscious. A torero says something to Cary in Portuguese. Cary 
          and the others lift Bill.
          
                              CARY
                    Take it easy! Take it easy!
          
          They carry Bill off.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. ARENA INFIRMARY - MINUTES LATER
          A group of toreros straighten their gleaming spangled jackets and walk off to 
          reveal Cary standing over a bloodied Bill and holding his hand as medical 
          personnel prepare to operate. Bill lies flat on a table and smiles, amused 
          with himself.
          
                              BILL
                    Cary? I slipped.
          
                              CARY
                    Too bad. You were doing fine.
          
                              BILL
                    Wasn't I, though? Heh. It's a cinch. 
                    Bull-fighting? Just as easy-- 
          
          Bill breaks off and raises his head to look at the doctor off screen.
          
                              BILL
                    Hey, Doc?! Be careful. What are you 
                    doing? 
          
          To distract him, Cary pulls out a handkerchief and mops Bill's brow which 
          glistens with sweat.
          
                              BILL
                    You know why I slipped, Cary? 
          
                              CARY
                    No, Bill. Why?
          
                              BILL
                    On account of that beer in my shoe. 
          
          Bill breaks off and raises himself up again.
          
                              BILL
                    Hey, Doc! 
          
          Cary gently eases Bill's head back down.
          
                              BILL
                    Cary, that bull certainly was 
                    hostile.
          
          Pedro escorts Shep (in his dark eyeglasses again) and Nikki into the room. The 
          doctor, in surgical gear, puts on gloves and looks annoyed by the intrusion.
          
                              SHEP
                    You hurt, Bill?
          
                              NIKKI
                    You all right, Bill?
          
                              BILL
                    Sure. I'm all right. I was a big 
                    success.
          
          The doctor has some sharp words for Pedro who acknowledges this and approaches 
          the others:
          
                              PEDRO
                    He wants that we should go right 
                    away.
          
          Pedro exits.
          
                              BILL
                    I'm sure glad that I - I wore my new 
                    blue shorts. I'll be a big success 
                    in the hospital.
          
          Nikki places a hand on his head.
          
                              NIKKI
                    I'll send you my turtles, Bill. And 
                    THEN you'll be a big success.
          
          She turns away, trying not to cry. Shep follows her as they leave.
          
                              SHEP
                    So long, Bill.
          
                              BILL
                    So long.
          
          Shep follows Nikki out.
          
                              CARY
                    Goodbye, Bill.
          
          Bill reaches up and pats Cary on the shoulder. Cary looks at the doctor, then 
          at Bill, before retreating to the door. He turns to look back at Bill who 
          grins at him.
          
                              BILL
                    See ya later - Cary.
          
          Cary can't return the smile. He turns and goes, closing the door behind him. 
          Bill's attention turns to the doctor whose approaching shadow is cast on the 
          wall behind him. Bill's smile fades.
          
                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. ARENA - MOMENTS LATER
          Cary emerges and joins the group who are gathered glumly on some steps.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    How is he?
          
                              CARY
                    They've just put him to sleep. 
          
          Nikki, emotionally fragile, hands Cary his hat.
          
                              CARY
                    Why, thank you, Nikki. There's 
                    nothing you can do. You'd better go 
                    back to the hotel. 
                         (to Francis)
                    Put Nikki in a taxi. We'll wait here.
          
          As Frink and Francis exit with Nikki, Pedro approaches Cary with a couple of 
          journalists.
          
                              PEDRO
                    Señor, the reporters want to know 
                    why your friend descend into the 
                    bull ring.
          
          Cary looks off and thinks for a moment.
          
                              CARY
                    Tell them -- that it seemed like a 
                    good idea - at the time.
          
          Pedro stares at Cary in astonishment. Cary joins Shep and the two of them 
          stand with their backs to the others as we
          
                                   FADE OUT
          
          EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT
          The amusement park at Port Mayer. Crowds, carnival NOISES, a carousel with 
          appropriate MUSIC.
          
          At a nearby refreshment stand, we find the group, minus Bill. Everyone is 
          unusually silent and wearing dinner clothes. Francis holds a mug upside-down. 
          Frink leers at Nikki who ignores him while she, Shep and Cary down their 
          drinks. They hear:
          
          GUNSHOTS. 
          
          They look over to see:
          
          A little shooting gallery where customers rent genuine guns to shoot various 
          colorful targets and win prizes. 
          
                              CARY
                    Sounds like old times.
          
                              SHEP
                    Let's go and shoot.
          
                              CARY
                    Not a bad idea. 
                         (to Nikki)
                    What say, Annie Oakley? Like to 
                    fire off a gun at something?
          
                              NIKKI
                    No objection.
          
                              SHEP
                         (to their bartender)
                    We'll be right back. Hold 
                    everything.
          
          The group starts over to:
          
          THE SHOOTING GALLERY
          where an assortment of rifles and pistols are neatly laid out. Cary and Shep 
          escort Nikki to the arsenal while Frink and Francis tag along behind. An 
          attendant joins them to collect their money and ready their weapons.
          
                              SHEP
                    First one to miss pays for the drinks.
          
                              CARY
                    What'll we shoot at?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Shoot one of those pussycats and see 
                    what happens.
          
                              SHEP
                    All right. Look out, pussycat.
          
          Shep FIRES and misses the moving cats that float across the base of the range 
          on an endless chain and disappear. But he hits a tinier target: a clay pipe 
          behind them.
          
          Shep's eyes pop with surprise.
          
                              SHEP
                    Well, that's what I was aiming at, 
                    a clay pipe. 
                         (stares in amazement)
                    Whole thing's been misrepresented 
                    to me.
          
          Cary laughs at him.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Cary, let's see you shoot something.
          
          Cary takes careful aim.
          
                              CARY
                    Look out, ball!
          
          He FIRES and hits a ball balanced atop a stream of water.
          
                              NIKKI
                    What'd YOU aim at?
          
                              CARY
                    Well, let's see you shoot something.
          
          Nikki awkwardly raises her little target rifle to her shoulder. The end of the 
          barrel describes uncertain circles in the air. A multiple exposure point-of-
          view shot of the targets reveals that Nikki is a little too tipsy to be 
          handling a gun. Cary moves to help her.
          
                              CARY
                    Oh, no, no, no, Nikki.
          
                              NIKKI
                    How do you hold it still?
          
                              CARY
                    Listen, Nikki, on your right 
                    shoulder. Now, put your hand out 
                    there and hold up-- No, don't cover 
                    up the site. No, no, no, that's 
                    right. Now just hold it evenly--
          
          Rapid GUNSHOTS. Cary looks up in surprise. He and Shep turn to watch in 
          amazement as Francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle, shattering a whole 
          row of pipes with split-second firing.
          
          The others cheer as Francis lowers the weapon and stares moodily at an 
          astonished and, apparently, very drunk Frink. Cary takes this moment to 
          encourage Nikki.
          
                              CARY
                    You can do better than that. Show 
                    him up.
          
          She again tries unsuccessfully to hold the rifle steady. Amused, Frink picks 
          up a pistol and imitates her.
          
                              FRINK
                    What are you waving at, Nikki?
          
          Cary sees Frink pointing his gun at Nikki and moves to intervene, grabbing 
          Frink's wrist with both hands.
          
                              CARY
                         (angry)
                    Look out! Why, you fool. Don't you 
                    know better than that?
          
          Shep and Francis move to shield Nikki.
          
                              FRINK
                    What's the idea?
          
                              CARY
                    Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki?
          
                              FRINK
                    Take your hands off me.
          
                              CARY
                    Put down that gun!
          
                              FRINK
                    Let go of my wrist!
          
          Frink violently pulls free of Cary's grasp and, as he does, the gun goes off 
          with a BANG. Francis hurries Nikki to safety in the opposite direction. Shep 
          backs away, clutching his side -- for a moment, it looks very much as if he's 
          been hit. Cary pursues and confronts Frink.
          
                              CARY
                    Put down that gun!
          
          Frink backs up to a nearby lamp post and, wielding the pistol, points it at 
          Cary. His face is tense, savage.
          
                              FRINK
                    Listen, you keep your hands off me! 
                    I've had enough from you! You try 
                    any more of your rough stuff on 
                    me--!
          
          A nervous crowd of passersby pauses to watch the showdown.
          
                              CARY
                    Oh, so that's how it is. I thought 
                    we taught you how to behave.
          
          Frink, drunk and frustrated, starts to lose it completely.
          
                              FRINK
                    You taught ME how to behave?! Listen, 
                    you'd better behave now or you'll 
                    get hurt!
          
                              CARY
                         (calmly)
                    I don't think so. I'll give you 
                    three to put down that gun. It'll be 
                    just too bad if you don't.
          
                              FRINK
                    Too bad for who?!
          
          Frink cocks the hammer.
          
                              CARY
                    One ...
          
          Cary moves slowly toward Frink.
          
                              FRINK
                    Keep away from me! I'll shoot, I 
                    tell ya! I'll shoot!
          
                              CARY
                    Two ...
          
          Frink and Cary are less than a yard apart.
          
                              FRINK
                    I'll shoot! I'll shoot!
          
          GUNSHOTS. Cary flinches. Frink drops the pistol, his face twisted in pain. He 
          starts to fall.
          
          Nearby, Francis coolly FIRES his rifle, pumping seven bullets into Frink.
          
          Members of the crowd SCREAM in terror. Instinctively, Shep (still clutching 
          his side) and Nikki each put a restraining hand on Francis' arm. Francis 
          lowers the rifle, staring in horror and amazement at what he's just done. 
          
                              CARY'S VOICE
                    Francis? 
          
          Cary rushes over and pulls the rifle out of Francis' hands.
          
                              CARY
                    Francis?
          
          Francis snaps out of his trance as Cary hurriedly returns the rifle to the 
          gallery. Shep and Nikki watch, stunned, as Francis immediately moves to Cary 
          and shakes his hand.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Goodbye, Cary. 
          
          Francis turns to Shep and Nikki for equally heartfelt handshakes, an odd look 
          on his face.
          
                              FRANCIS
                    Shep. Nikki.
          
          They realize he is saying a final goodbye. The crowd presses in as Francis 
          glances back at Frink before turning and hurrying off. 
          
          As a huge crowd rushes in the direction of the shooting gallery, Francis 
          threads his way through it in the opposite direction and, with only the 
          briefest glance backward, rounds a corner to disappear behind a building.
          
          Cary stares at Frink's body as the gathering crowd streams into view, then 
          quickly starts to lead a shaken Shep and Nikki away from the shooting gallery.
          
                              CARY
                    We've got to get out of here. Come 
                    on, Shep. Come on.
          
          They slip through the thick fringe of excited people fast gathering in front 
          of the shooting gallery and hurry off in the same direction as Francis who is 
          now:
          
          BEHIND THE CARNIVAL BUILDINGS
          on a dark, deserted street. Distant crowd NOISE and carnival MUSIC drifts in. 
          Under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival, Francis strolls 
          casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope, pausing 
          to glance backward. He sees ...
          
          ... Cary, Shep and Nikki as they round the corner and pause, a little 
          breathless, to lean against a wall. Shep, his fist still at his side, slumps 
          weakly as Cary and Nikki stare at ... 
          
          ... Francis who briefly makes eye contact and then, without a word, turns, 
          steps over the rope and, pulling his jacket collar up around his neck, walks 
          off, instantly swallowed up by the darkness.
          
          Cary and Nikki stare after him, astonished.
          
                              CARY
                    That's the last of Francis, I'm 
                    afraid. We'll never see him again.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Did you notice his eyes? That's the 
                    first time I ever saw Francis really 
                    happy. What'll happen to him, do you 
                    suppose?
          
                              CARY
                    Don't worry about, Francis. He'll 
                    take care of himself. Let's get out 
                    of here. Let's walk.
          
          Shep leans weakly against the wall, his eyes glassy.
          
                              SHEP
                    No. Don't want to walk. Let's take 
                    a cab.
          
          Cary quickly moves to a signal a cab parked nearby. Nikki rests a sympathetic 
          hand on Shep.

          THE BACK SEAT OF THE TAXI CAB - MOMENTS LATER
          As the cab jolts down an uneven street and drives slowly through the crowded 
          carnival, the MUSIC continues. Cary and Shep sit on either side of Nikki. Cary 
          is as edgy as Shep is subdued.
          
                              CARY

                    Nice shooting.

                    Those slugs went right past my ear. 
                    If I'd've moved an inch, I would've 
                    caught one of them myself.
          
                              SHEP
                    "Sudden Death," all right.
          
          Nikki takes out a cigarette.
          
                              CARY
                    What's the matter with you, Shep? 
                    I've never known you so quiet 
                    before.
          
                              SHEP
                    That's right. I am kind of quiet.
          
                              NIKKI
                         (holds her unlit 
                         cigarette)
                    Not smoking?
          
                              SHEP
                    No.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Your lighter working?
          
                              SHEP
                    Good ol', Nikki -- never has any 
                    matches.
          
                              NIKKI
                    No.
          
          As Shep puts his hand in his inside jacket pocket to pull out his cigarette 
          lighter, a strange look crosses his face.
          
                              SHEP
                    Sure you want a light?
          
                              NIKKI
                    That's what I want, a light.
          
          Shep pulls out the lighter and flicks it on -- revealing bloodstains on his 
          white shirt. Nikki stares down at the blood in horror.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Shep. Shep!
          
          Nikki jumps up and moves away from Shep, into a seat opposite.
          
                              CARY
                    What is it?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Shep's hurt!
          
          Cary turns to Shep, who slumps back weakly against his seat with a strange 
          look of release and satisfaction on his face.
          
                              SHEP
                    It's a forgery.
          
          Cary examines Shep, reaching in to feel his bloody wound.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Do something for him, Cary! Oh, 
                    Shepard!
          
                              CARY
                    He's been shot!
          
                              NIKKI
                    What can we do, Cary?! What can we 
                    do?!
          
                              CARY
                    Shep, why didn't you say you were 
                    hurt?
          
                              SHEP
                    Good old Cary. Sweet Nikki. You may 
                    not believe it but this is the best 
                    thing that ever happened to me.
          
                              CARY
                    Oh, Shep, Shep, don't say that. 
                    You'll be all right. We'll get you 
                    to a hospital.
          
          Shep puts a hand on Cary's arm as the taxi continues to jolt along down the 
          street. 
          
                              SHEP
                    No, no, Cary. Don't rush me anywheres.
                    Let's sit here for a while. The-- 
                    Hurts, the jolting.
          
          Urgently, Cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between themselves and the 
          cab driver.
          
                              CARY
                    Stop! Stop! 
          
          In front of the carnival's slowly revolving carousel, the cab rolls to a stop. 
          The carousel MUSIC drifts in. Shep hardly moves -- head back, blank eyes 
          staring, voice dreamy and weak. Cary puts his face close to Shep's, listening 
          intently.
          
                              SHEP
                    That's better. You know, Cary, I feel
                     - just like we're falling -- long 
                    time ago. Do you remember? Spinning 
                    ... spinning ... spinning. Only you 
                    brought me down safe. Oh, Cary. Good 
                    old Cary. 
                         (sighs)
                    Best flyer in the service.
          
          Nikki, seated opposite, is distraught.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
          
                              CARY
                         (reassuring)
                    We're gonna make a safe landing 
                    again, Shep.
          
                              SHEP
                    Not this time, Cary. Ol' Shep's 
                    gonna crash. 
                         (beat)
                    Say, but we're spinning fast. Level 
                    off. Cary, level off.
          
          Shep's head slumps down. His face presses against Cary's shoulder. 
          
                              NIKKI'S VOICE
                    Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
          
          Cary can't look at him. Eyes wide, Cary slowly presses his cheek to Shep's.
          
                              CARY
                    Shep? - Shep?! - Shep!
          
          Cary looks as if he is on the verge of tears. And yet he cannot bring himself 
          to cry.
          
                                   FADE OUT

          INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
          Nikki cranks her portable phonograph, turns it on and puts the needle to the 
          record -- Toselli's "Serenade," that strange, sad composition that haunted 
          Europe at the close of the Great War. 
          
          As the bittersweet romantic music plays, she listens for a moment. Then she 
          turns and sidles over to sit next to Cary who is seated by the window, 
          scribbling something on a piece of paper beside a small lamp.
          
                              NIKKI
                    What are you writing, Cary?
          
                              CARY
                    A letter. A letter to Shep's mother.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Mind if I read it?
          
                              CARY
                    Certainly not.
          
          Nikki reads the letter silently. A long pause.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Why, Cary. Cary, that's the most 
                    beautiful letter I've ever read. 
          
          Nikki turns away and begins to cry, quietly.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Please forgive me for crying, Cary. 
                    I can't help it. You don't mind if I 
                    cry just a minute, do you? 
          
                              CARY
                    No, Nikki.
          
          Cary puts aside the letter.
          
                              NIKKI
                    Can't you cry, Cary?

                    Why, Nikki. You're sweet.
          
          He kisses her hand. A strange, apprehensive look crosses her face as she turns 
          her hand over in his hands and opens it -- to reveal a heart-shaped stone. 
          Cary looks at her in surprise.
          
                              CARY
                    Why, Nikki, you kept it. You didn't 
                    forget.
          
          She lowers her eyes for a moment, then looks at him.
          
                              NIKKI
                    No harm can come to our true love.
          
                              CARY
                         (amused, skeptical)
                    No harm can come to our true love? 
                         (genuinely)
                    Oh, Nikki, you've become very dear 
                    to me. I want to help you. Can't I 
                    do something for you, too? What do 
                    you want? What can I get you?
          
                              NIKKI
                    Well, I've always wanted a pair of 
                    Spanish earrings.
          
          He gives her an uncomprehending look but then breaks into a smile as she 
          buries her head lovingly in his shoulder. He kisses her hand again.
          
                                   CUT TO
          
          THE TRAIN 
          in a dark, bleak landscape as it chugs away down the track.
          
                                   DISSOLVE TO
          
          THE END
