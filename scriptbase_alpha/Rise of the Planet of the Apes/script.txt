          EYES. Expressive, alive. Human?
           No. They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE: BRIGHT EYES.

          EXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAY

          She sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular,
          a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A

          SHOOTING STAR.
          Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF
          CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays.

          EXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY

          A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle.
          They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance.
          As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving
          quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready.

          EXT. CANOPY - DAY

          Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.
          He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR
          ignites the community - but too late.
          POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up
          dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.
          Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his
          teeth and sends her off.
          Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All
          around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.
          MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
          an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.
          Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
          CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER

          FROM HIS MOUNT.
          Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to
          rally a counter-attack.
          But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to
          the defense. It's chaos.
          SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by
          one. Others take off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a
          net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...

          A SHOT RINGS OUT.

          BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE

          AIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND. LIKE A STONE.

          FADE TO WHITE
          TWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us.
          FRANKLIN - broken horn-rimmed glasses - and CAROLINE - curly
          red hair under a sterile cap.

          subject Number four.
          Franklin reaches for us, smiles...

                         FRANKLIN
          Here we go, Bright eyes.
          A MIST fogs our view for a moment.

                         CAROLINE
          Not too much. She needs to be
          calm, but alert.

          VOICE THROUGH INTERCOM
          Go ahead - send her through.
          A LOUD HUM and we start moving, sliding into a tunnel a
          tubular CT SCAN - with a MIRROR on the top.
          Now WE SEE OUR FACE REFLECTED: A FEMALE APE IN A GAS MASK.
          Bright Eyes.

          INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

          WILL RODMAN - late twenties, lab coat over a T-shirt and
          jeans - stands at the glass, watching the terrified
          chimpanzee slide into the machine.
          The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress.

                         WILL
          Start the scan.
          A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         TECHIE
          Scanning.

          INT. WHITE ROOM -- DAY

          Another tech, DONNIE - skinny, tattooed - controls the
           machine, sending the restrained animal into the scanner.
          Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan. The bag's
          full of a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN LIQUID.

                         DONNIE
          Stuff looks like Kool-aid.

                         CAROLINE
          Go ahead, I'm sure you could use
          it.

                         (OPENING VALVE)
          Starting the therapy...

          INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

          Will looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP.
          The image starts to shake. Concerned, he looks to the other
          room - where he can see the CHIMP'S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR

          RESTRAINTS.

                         FRANKLIN
          She's convulsing.
          Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube, listens to Bright
          Eyes' heart.

                         WILL

                         (INTO INTERCOM)
          Please keep the monkey still.
          He focuses back on the monitor.

                         CAROLINE (INTERCOM)
          She's not a monkey.
          Will looks from the monitor to Caroline. His look is
          intense, tough to read. She blushes slightly at the heat of
          his gaze.

          CAROLINE (INTERCOM) (CONT'D)
          She's an ape. Chimpanzees,
          gorillas and orangutans, they're
          all apes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         WILL
          Good to know. Just keep it from
          moving.
          She's stung, wonders, why does he have to be such a jerk
          sometimes.
          He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan
          right. The green liquid moves through the chimp's neck...

                         TECHIE
          Here we go.
          Will stares at the scan, his eyes willing the test to
          succeed.. .the green liquid LIGHTS UP THE CHIMP'S BRAIN.

          CHEER FROM THE GROUP.
          Will fights a CONTRACTION OF EXTREME EMOTION that passes
          across his face. He quickly hides it - offers up a smile for
          the others.

                         WILL
          We're on our way.

                         (BEAT)
          Good work.

          INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY


                         CAROLINE
          What is this?
          Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who
          sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM, a lit-up board with
          colorful symbols.
          Bright Eyes presses a button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Tree.

          SUPER: "ONE MONTH LATER."
          Caroline holds up a picture of an acorn.

                         CAROLINE
          And this?
          The chimp presses another button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         CAROLINE
          Where does the acorn come from?
          Bright Eyes considers... then presses a button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         CAROLINE
          Yes, but where does the acorn come
          from?

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         CAROLINE

                         NO -
          Bright Eyes interrupts, now pressing three buttons.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn. Tree. Acorn.
          The chimp looks at Caroline, who's stunned, trying to process
          the ADVANCED THINKING JUST MANIFESTED. Then she presses
          another button.

          ELECTRONIC VOICE (CONT'D)
          Surprise.
          The unnatural voice - paired with Bright Eyes' eerily human-
          like gaze - is somehow CREEPY... The IMAGE FREEZES and we...

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WILL'S OFFICE
          Diplomas on the wall, books everywhere. Bright Eyes looks
          out at Will from a computer screen. He's got two CT SCANS
          sitting on the desk in front of him.

                         CAROLINE
          We started the therapy four weeks
          ago. This was yesterday.
          Will's studying the scans. They look good. Real good.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          There's been clear cell growth.
          Both on the frontal lobe and the
          neocortex.
          She's purposely standing close in order to point this out.
          He notices but doesn't respond - there's history between them
          and he's regretting that - gets in the way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         WILL
          I see that. But I don't understand
          the primate behavioral norms. She
          knows an acorn's a seed. Wouldn't
          any monkey know that?

                         CAROLINE
          No - it's conceptual. Acorn gives
          us a tree, which gives us an acorn.

                         WILL
          Abstract thought...

                         CAROLINE
          In a chimpanzee. Unheard of.
          Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline
          moves away from him. He barely notices her now.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          You're calling her a monkey just to
          piss me off, aren't you?

                         WILL
          Start the other's on the 112.

                         (BEAT)
          And double this one's dose.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DUSK

          Will climbs into his truck. Alone, he allows his excitement
          to show. Abstract thought!
          He pulls away from the BIO LAB, which is tucked in a corner
          of an old military base.

          EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DUSK (AERIAL)

           Will drives over the majestic Golden Gate Bridge.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Will pulls up in front of his house.
          Set in a hillside neighborhood, it's neat, nondescript. The
          home of a bachelor who hasn't given it much thought.
          As Will pulls into the driveway, WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVER

          AND OVER ON A PIANO.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          WALTER RODMAN, 60, sits at the piano dressed in a robe,
          stabbing at the key with his finger.
          Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the
          emotional weight of this man, his father.

                         WILL
          Hey Dad.
          Walter looks up, whispers...

                         WALTER
          John... is that you?

                         WILL
          It's me. Will.

                         WALTER
          As thou dost, Anthony.
          (staring at the keys)
          .he hears no music. No music...

                         VOICE
          (heavy Russian accent)
          He's been doing that all day.
          A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA.

                         IRENA
          He found an old book of his.
          She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's
          pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back.

                         IRENA (CONT'D)
          (shrugging on coat)
          I had no idea you liked Shakespeare
          so much, Mr. Walter.

                         WILL
          My mother was the one. She liked
          Shakespeare...

                         IRENA

                         (KISSES HIM)
          Good night, Walter, hone-ee.
          She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm.

                         I WILL
          Come on, Dad.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Will helps his father change into pajamas.

                         WILL
          Remember I told you we were using
          Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on
          the apes? Well the therapy seems
          to be working. We've seen definite
          signs of adult brain neurogenesis.
           Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Board of Directors is coming in a
           couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 -
          that's clinical trials.
          Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less
          understanding what Will's saying.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Human trials, Dad. Soon.

                         WALTER
          I rather tell that what is to be
          feared than what I fear: for
          always... I am Caesar...
          There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries..

                         WILL
          I'm going to make you better - I
          swear it.
          His father looks at him. A moment of recognition?

                         WALTER
          John... ?

                         WILL

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          No, Dad, it's me. Will.
          Will helps the old man under the bedcovers.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          John's gone.
           He moves to the door, pausing to take in the diplomas on the
          walls - Walter's name on all of them. (Physics, Astronomy.)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Will looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up
          at the ceiling. The once brilliant man now slipping away.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - LATE NIGHT

          It's late. Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk
          beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer.
          He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works.

          INT. PRIMATE LAB - DAY

          Franklin moves from cage to cage, greeting the apes.

                         FRANKLIN
          Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam.
          Monty. Hey - what's the matter,
          don't like my cooking?

          SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER
          He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her
          cage.

                         FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
          You okay back there?

                         CAROLINE
          Something wrong with Bright Eyes?

                         FRANKLIN
          I'll check on her when we're done.
          Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the
          next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner.
          Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his
          cranium.
          From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open
          door as Lucky's strapped down.

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - SAME

          Will - dressed in an ill-fitting suit off the rack, hair
          brushed in an attempt at neatness - meets STEVEN JACOBS as he
          steps from a beautiful BLACK JAGUAR.

                         JACOBS
          You could at least try to look
          excited.

          10.
          Will's too nervous to look excited. He eyes the FOUR SUITS
          disembarking from nearby TOWN CARS.

                         WILL
          I'm not good with this stuff.
          Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.

                         JACOBS
          You'll do fine. Just speak
          English. Keep the science simple.

          INT. LAB - SAME

          From the back of her cage, Bright Eyes watches through the
          open door as the ape on the table convulses.

                         CAROLINE
          Okay. Back it out...

                         DONNIE
          Your turn.
          Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD, HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO

          DONNIE CAN'T OPEN THE CAGE.

                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
          C'mon - Let go -
          She understands what he wants but she won't do it. THAT'S

          WHEN HE NOTICES: HER HANDS ARE BLOODY.

                         DONNIE (CONT'D)
           Hey! Something's wrong with number
          four!
          Franklin looks over - he's still dealing with Lucky on the
          table...

                         FRANKLIN
          Be right over -
          Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something
          different in her face today. Rage? Force of will?

                         DONNIE
          What's the matter with you?

          INT. BOARDROOM - SAME

          Will stands at the head of a table. A BIG PLASMA SCREEN
          behind him shows a BLOW UP OF A BRAIN SCAN. As Will speaks,
          he gestures at it with a LASER POINTER.

          INT. LAB - SAME

          Donnie and Bright Eyes are at a standoff. Once more he tries
          to open the cage, once more she yanks it shut.
          Again he tries... and is taken by surprise when SHE GRABS HIS

          HAND AND PULLS IT THROUGH THE BARS.

                         DONNIE
          Hey!!!
          Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other
          apes begin to SCREECH.
          Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to.

                         DONNIE (CONT'D)
          Someone get her off of me!

                         CAROLINE
          Hang on -
          Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries
          over. He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY.

          INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

           Will continues his presentation. Stevens looks around at the
          board members - they're lost.

                         WILL
          In the past, it's been impossible
          to target specific areas, both
          because of the Blood Brain Barrier -
          Jacobs stands, interrupting Will.

                         JACOBS
          What Dr. Rodman has done is to
          invent a virus that can, for the
          first time, cross the membrane that
          protects the brain and deliver a
          genetic, therapeutic, payload.

                         WILL
          (trying to sell)
          This 'payload' would directly
          affect the areas of memory, higher
          function - and, of course, the
          motherlode: intelligence.
          The board members stare, trying to comprehend.

                         BOARD MEMBER
          Meaning?

                         WILL
          Meaning.
          (deep breath here)
          If Phase 2 goes as planned, we're
           looking at a cure for Alzheimer's.
           With an elbow prompting from Jacobs, Will takes a SAMPLE VIAL
           from his jacket pocket and awkwardly holds it up for dramatic
          effect.

          INT. LAB - DAY


                          DONNIE
          She's breaking my hand!

                         CAROLINE
          Let go, Bright Eyes! You're
          hurting him!
          She tries to help pull Donnie away.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          Let go!
          In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own.

          LUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES' CAGE AND

          THE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY.

          HE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB, DRAGGING HIS LEASH.

                         FRANKLIN
          Lucky no! Stop!

                         (TO CAROLINE)
          Hit the alarm!
          Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it.

          DONNIE'S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO...

          INT. LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME

          LOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN
          of a corridor. They see Lucky dragging his leash as he
          scampers - unattended - down the hall.

                         GUARD #1
          Uh oh.
          Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN

          SILENT AGONY, PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE, CAROLINE TRYING TO

          GET HIM FREE.

                         GUARD #2
          Hey, Len...?
          Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket...
          Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet...

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - DAY

          Lucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the
          grounds. He leaps over a car, then heads for the nearest
          building.

          INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

          The room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will's
          pronouncement.

                         BOARD MEMBER
          What about the safety of the virus?

                         WILL
           Perfectly safe. We're using the
          most stable -
          A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS.
          Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

          NO!
          Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and
          pinning him to the wall. It happens fast.
          The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY

          INCISORS...
          â€¢ BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK.
          The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams -
          collapses on the boardroom table.

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - NIGHT

           Rain and fog. An AMBULANCE pulls out, past POLICE CRUISERS
          and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS.
          Will - face cut, clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE
          and walks through the chaotic aftermath. He watches Caroline
          walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie, his shoulder
          packed in ice.
          He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him.

                         WILL
          Are they gone?

                         JACOBS
          Long gone.
          Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway.

                         WILL
          Did they say anything before they
          left? I mean, about Phase 2.

                         JACOBS
          Look around you, for Christ sakes.
          We'll be lucky if we don't go to
          jail.
          Will's gutted - devastated.

                         WILL
          But we're so close.

                         JACOBS
          You think you're the only one who's
          got something at stake here? I've
          got my own skin in this game!

                         WILL
          What happened had nothing to do
          with the 112.
          (desperate to clarify)
          Take an already aggressive animal,
          make it smarter - you're going to
          get a potentially dangerous

                         SITUATION -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         JACOBS
          What makes you so damned positive
          about that?
          (pauses for emphasis)
          What if this drug does things you
          don't understand? Are you going to
          take responsibility for that?
          Because I'm sure as hell not going
          to.
          Here Will hesitates.

                         JACOBS (CONT'D)
          We're not ready for human trials.
          Hell, we weren't ready for monkey
          trials.

                         WILL
          They're apes.

                         JACOBS
          This is what we're going to do:
          You're taking a sabbatical. I'll
          let the board handle the lawsuit.
          When this blows over I'll bring you
          back and we'll start over - we'll
          do it right this time. With mice.
          Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody.
          Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say.

          INT. LAB REFRIGERATION ROOM - NIGHT

          Will stands at the fringes of the room, watching MEN IN
          HAZMAT SUITS pull down SHELVES OF METAL CANISTERS LABELED ADV

          112.
          His work - destroyed.

          EXT. BACK LOT, BEHIND THE LAB - NIGHT

          Will climbs into his truck and pauses. He reaches into a
          jacket pocket and brings out a VIAL - IT'S THE VIAL of 112 HE

          USED IN THE PRESENTATION - THE ONLY REMAINING ONE.
          TAP AT THE WINDOW. Franklin's face appears.
          Will shoves the VIAL back into his pocket, rolls down the
          window.

                         Â€¢ FRANKLIN
          Show you something, boss?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         WILL
          I don't work here anymore,
          Franklin.

                         FRANKLIN
          I just put down fifteen animals,
          Dr. Rodman. The least you could do
          is give me a moment of your time.
          Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long,
          devastating day.

                         WILL
          of course.

          INT. PRIMATE LAB - NIGHT

          The cages are empty, the doors open. Will notes used
          SYRINGES on the table, filled body bags lined up on the
          floor.
          It's a creepy, horrible scene.

                         FRANKLIN
          They're all gone.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry, Franklin. Genuinely
          sorry...
          What's he got to do to get the hell out of there?
          Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage. He
          moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket.
          At first Will doesn't understand what he's looking at. The
          lighting's dim and the thing's so small...
          But then IT MOVES AND WILL REALIZES HE'S LOOKING AT AN INFANT

          CHIMPANZEE.
          Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          It's impossible. How could a full-
          term gestation go unnoticed?

                         FRANKLIN
          They carry small. Must have been
          pregnant when they brought her in.
          Will tries to get his mind around the situation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         WILL
          Who else knows about this?

                         FRANKLIN
          No one.

                         (BEAT)
          I'd bring him home, but my brother-
          in-law works for security. He'd
          rat me out in a second.
          That's when will realizes.

                         WILL
          You want me to take him?

                         FRANKLIN
          He's an orphan now.

                         WILL
          I could be thrown in jail. He's a
          chimpanzee who's been exposed to a
          possibly dangerous drug.

                         FRANKLIN
          You don't believe that.

                         WILL
          Doesn't matter what I believe.

                         FRANKLIN
          Just for a couple days. Until I
          can find a sanctuary.

                         WILL
          That's not possible.

                         FRANKLIN
          I heard you outside, fighting to
          keep them alive.

                         WILL
          I was talking about the work, my

                         RESEARCH -

                         FRANKLIN
          she was just trying to protect him.

                         WILL
          What?

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         FRANKLIN
          Bright Eyes - the mother. That's
          why she wouldn't let anyone into
          her cage.
          Will looks down at the helpless baby.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry -
          but there's nothing I can do here.
          He's got to be put down like the
          others.

                         FRANKLIN
          Tell you what, Doc.
          (producing a syringe)
          I'm done for the day. So you be my
          guest.
          Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will.
          It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He
          enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his
          little hands.
          Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's
          belly... but there's no way he can go through with this.
          Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who
          watches from outside the cage.

                         WILL
          Two days. Then you have to figure
          it out.

          INT. WALMART - NIGHT

          A BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a
          cart.
          Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered
          in a blanket - plastered to his chest.
          He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array
          of choices.

          INT. WALMART CHECK OUT - NIGHT

          A TEEN rings up the baby goods.

                         TEEN CASHIER
          Hey man. Congratulations.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         WILL
          Huh?

                         (REALIZING)
          Oh. Thanks.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Will pulls up in his truck.

          EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

          Will's coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his
          chest. He barely has the key in the lock when Irena opens
          the door.

                         IRENA
          It's Friday night. I had a date.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry - there was -
          She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the
          walk, her footfalls pointed and angry.
           He pauses there. Apparently no end to this bad day.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Will dumps the baby goods on the counter, heads for the
          refrigerator. The infant's still plastered to his chest.
          He opens the fridge, grabs a crisper drawer, empties its
          contents in the sink.
          Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE

          VIAL OF 112. CAREFULLY HE PLACES IT INTO THE DRAWER AND

          ROLLS THE DRAWER BACK IN THE FRIDGE.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Will sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion. A HIGH PITCHED
          WAIL comes from another part of the house.
          Will sits up, remembering.

          INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

          Will enters, half asleep, turns on the light. The baby chimp
          lies in a cardboard box on the floor and he's obviously sick,
          making UNNATURAL WHEEZING NOISES.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          Will stares down at the little creature, trying to decide
          what to do.

          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Will turns on the HOT WATER. SHUTS the door. Holding the
          limp, feeble chimp in his arms, he puts down the toilet seat
          and sits.

                         WILL
          It's okay. It's going to be okay.
          Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit.
          Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The
          room fills with STEAM.

                         CUT TO:
          A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of
          a tree, an alpha male, eyeing the CHIMPS around him.
          In a sudden BURST of movement, the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF,
          FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force, a FREIGHT

          TRAIN OF THREAT, POWER AND VIOLENCE.
          Teeth bared in a terrifying display, the ape easily
          intimidates all the chimps around him.

          REVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL'S WATCHING

          THEM ON HIS LAPTOP.
          Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful
          in his arms.

          SUPER: "TWO YEARS LATER"
          SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          The chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the
          bathroom, hiking up a pair of shorts. WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH
          THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture.
          The house looks warmer, cluttered, more lived-in.
          The chimp arrives at a hallway, where he leaps into the air
          and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling.
          As his weight pulls it down, there's a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN
          LADDER opens from above. WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into...

          â€¢INT. ATTIC -- DAY

          .the attic. Beams of light streaming through a LARGE VENT
          TO THE OUTSIDE. Rings and pegs for climbing are set into the
          walls. Toys, books and puzzles scattered across the floor.
          SOUNDS of KIDS PLAYING and LAUGHING OUTSIDE.
          The chimp heads for the vent and peers through. WE GO OVER

          HIS SHOULDER TO SEE...

          EXT. THE OUTSIDE WORLD - DAY

          From up here, the chimp has a commanding view of the entire
          neighborhood. A group of CHILDREN rides bikes. A MAN mows
          his lawn.
          There's a HONK below, and the chimp watches as a TAXI pulls
          up to the HOUSE NEXT DOOR.
          HUNSIKER - A MAN in an AIRLINE PILOT uniform - kisses his
          WIFE and young DAUGHTER, ALICE, then climbs into the cab with
          his carry-on suitcase.
          Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy's
          Taxi disappear around the corner... Then TODD, the big
          brother, SWIPES THE DOLL FROM HER HAND and rides off on his
          bike. His FRIENDS LAUGH.
          The chimp watches, riveted, as the Alice BURSTS INTO OUTRAGED
          TEARS and runs after them.

          WILL (O.S.)
          Caesar! Breakfast!
          The chimp turns at Will's call. HIS NAME IS CAESAR.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          Will comes away from the ladder, heads for the kitchen.
          The living room floor is strewn with puzzles and games. One
          of them has been completed. Will considers it, looks around
          for the box, reads the side...
          AGES 12 and up. 12 and up.
          Caesar runs past, jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table,
          picks up a fork and starts eating his eggs and potatoes.
          Will walks over, sits across from him.

          Please pass the ketchup.
          Caesar slides the ketchup to Will.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Thanks.

                         CAESAR

                         LANGUAGE)
          You're welcome.
          NOTE: Whenever Caesar communicates he's signing and there
          will be subtitles.

          INT. GEN-SYS LAB - DAY

           A MOUSE moves through a maze as a LAB TECH marks its
          progress. Will - in a lab coat - watches with intensity.
          The mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it
          reaches an ORANGE CONE at a crossroads. The mouse stops,
          studies the cone.

                         LAB TECH
          Is he going to turn left or
          right...?
          The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a
          piece of cheese. Will does his best to hide the excitement
          blooming on his face.

                         WILL
          There it is. Restored cognitive
          function.

                         LAB TECH
          Same success rate as the primates.
          Congratulations.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

           VISITORS buy tickets at the entrance gates. Will pulls
           around to an Employee Parking Lot.

           INT. PRIMATE INFIRMARY, SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

          Dr. Molly Stewart - late 20's, pretty tomboy -- finishes
           taking Caesar's blood pressure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         Â€¢ STEWART
          He's right on target. Height.
          Weight...
          She checks Caesar's ears.

                         CAESAR
          Dairy Queen.

                         WILL
          After. Sit still.

                         STEWART
          What about diet?

                         WILL
          A healthy diet. Fruits,
          vegetables.

                         CAESAR
          Ice cream.
          Will ignores him.

                         STEWART
          What's he saying?

                         WILL
          He's hungry.
          Caesar's angling to climb off the examining table. Will
          sends him a look - out it out.

                         STEWART
          He seems extremely intelligent.
          How many words does Caesar sign?
          Beat.

                         WILL
          You know, the basics.

                         CAESAR
          Soft-serve.

                         STEWART
          I've heard of apes learning up to a
          hundred and fifty words. Is he
          good with puzzles?
          Will hesitates.

                         WILL
          He's pretty good.

                         STEWART
          Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously
          happy. You're doing a great job
          with him.
          (doesn't want to alarm)
          But there is an anomaly I noticed.

                         WILL
          Like what?

                         STEWART
          When I was examining his eyes, I
          noticed a strange green
          pigmentation.

                         WILL
          Green?
          His heart starts to pound.

                         STEWART
          Green. Never.seen it before.
          She hands Will an OTOSCOPE.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Take a look.
          Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds

          FLECKS OF BRIGHT GREEN PIGMENTATION - JUST LIKE THE 112.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          It's faint, can you pick it up?
          He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          You alright? Want a glass of
          water?

                         WILL
          No thanks.

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Sure, that would be good.
          She gets him one. Concerned, Caesar comes over.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Forgot to eat today. Not a big
          deal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          Stewart hands him the glass. He downs it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (TO CAESAR)
          I'm fine.
          Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck. Feels good.

                         STEWART
          Carotid pulse is running a little
          fast.

                         WILL
          For a human or a chimpanzee?
          First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face.

                         STEWART
          Gotta remember to eat.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Will drives Caesar, both of them licking soft-serve ice cream
          cones. He pulls up outside a store: "SMART CHILD"

          EDUCATIONAL TESTING TOYS.

          WILL (O.S.)
          You have to move the whole tower to
          another peg, one block at a time.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Walter's parked in front of the TV, not watching it.
          Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three
          wooden poles. There are four colored blocks threaded on the
          first pole, stacked biggest to smallest, making a 'tower'.
          Irena stands next to Will, watching Caesar. There's also a
          CAMCORDER on a tripod.

                         WILL
          Here's the hard part: you can't put
          a larger block on top of a smaller
          one.
          Caesar studies the puzzle.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Understand?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          Caesar's already started. He methodically begins moving
          blocks from one pole to another, pausing, backtracking,
          getting it right, never a bigger one on top of a smaller...
          Will watches, increasingly amazed, as he re-creates the tower
          on a different pole. It's easy for him.
          Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his
          pocket, HANDS CAESAR SOME M&MS.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (STUNNED)
          He did it in fifteen moves.

                         IRENA
          What's the best score?

                         WILL
          Fifteen.
          Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall.

                         IRENA

                         (AMAZED)
          I wonder where he gets such talent?

                         WILL
          (eyes on Walter)
          It was passed down from his mother.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT

          Will uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and
          prepares to record an AUDIO ATTACHMENT.

                         WILL
          (into computer mic)
          At age two Caesar appears to exceed
          his mother's aptitude. He signs
          over three hundred words. He
          exhibits no visible side effects
          from the therapy...

          INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Will flips on a light. Enters. Closes the door behind him.
           Taking a key from his pocket he approaches a SMALL, PADLOCKED
           REFRIGERATOR and unlocks it. Opens the door.
           Inside-WE SEE: THE SINGLE VIAL OF ADV 112.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Will sits on the edge of the sofa, the VIAL of 112 in his
          hand. He's deep in agonized thought.
          Finally he takes a SYRINGE and FILLS IT WITH THE GREEN
          LIQUID. Then he stands, walks to a closed door.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          The opening door sends a wash of light into the dark room.
          Walter's in bed. He opens his eyes, squinting at the
          brightness.

                         WILL
          (syringe in hand)
          Dad. I've got something that's
          going to make you better.
          Will closes the door behind him. WE HEAR A RHYTHMIC
          SQUEAKING NOISE as we...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The movement of a SWING. Caesar's strapped in it, and WE

          NOTICE IMMEDIATELY THAT HE'S GROWN OLDER.

          SUPER: TWO YEARS LATER
          Caesar's features are more mature. He appears more like a
          "little boy" - and his EYES HAVE TURNED A DEEP GREEN.
          Back and forth Caesar goes, as high as he can manage.
          At the height of his forward motion, he peers down into the
          neighbor's yard where, for just an instant, HE CAN SEE TODD

          PLAYING BALL WITH ALICE AND ANOTHER KID.
          At the height of his backward motion he catches another
          glimpse.
          Caesar pumps his legs, eager to get a better look...

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Will's making sandwiches, his eye on Caesar through the
          window.

                         WILL
          (to someone offscreen)

          WE FIND WALTER just sitting down on the piano bench. He
          begins playing a competent version of "CLAIR DE LUNE."

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Will pauses, listening to the MUSIC. He moves to the doorway
          to watch his father.
          The happiness - the relief - is clear on his face.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          SQUEAK.SQUEAK of the SWING, the PIANO FAINT from out here.
          Caesar studies the harness that's keeping him in the swing.
          There's a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back. He
          undoes the one on his right side. CLICK. Then the left
          side. CLICK.
          Caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the
          clamp on his back with his long chimpanzee arms.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Will returns to his sandwich making. It takes him a moment
          to notice that CAESAR HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SWING.
          The color drains from his face.

          EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

           Caesar stands at the edge of the yard, unsure what to do
          next. All three kids - Todd, Alice and Todd's buddy - have
          stopped playing to stare at him.
          Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass. He picks it up and
          tosses it to Todd's Buddy. The Boy catches it, throws it
          back to Caesar.

                         TODD'S BUDDY
          Check it. He wants to play.
          Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But
          Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile.
          Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her
          brother throws the ball to his Buddy OVER CAESAR'S HEAD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         TODD
          Monkey in the middle.
          Todd's Buddy LAUGHS. Caesar LAUGHS too, although he's not
          sure what's funny.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Will and Walter walk down the street looking for Caesar.

                         WALTER
          Caesar!

                         WILL
          He won't go far.

                         WALTER
          You don't know that.

                         WILL
          I do, Dad.

          INT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

          Todd and his buddy throw the ball over Caesar's head, while
          Caesar jumps to try and catch it.

          TODD AND FRIEND
          Monkey in the middle, monkey in the
          middle...
          Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep-
          away from him. Until he NOTICES ALICE'S EXPRESSION - SHE

          FEELS SORRY FOR HIM.

          THEN, IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT'S

          GOING ON: HE'S THE BUTT OF A JOKE.
          They're making fun of him.
          "MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in
          Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd,
          stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils.
          Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face.
          Alice runs inside.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Will and Walter search down the street. Then they hear it:
          â€¢ HUNSIKER'S YELL. Will runs for the neighbor's house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

          Hunsiker approaches Caesar with a raised bat. The terrified
          chimp backs toward his fence.

                         HUNSIKER
          Hah! Hah -
          Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER
          AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him.

                         WILL
          Hold on - it's okay - he's
          harmless!

                         HUNSIKER
          Your monkey came onto my property!
          Threatened my kids!
          By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head
          in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate.

                         WILL
          It won't happen again...

                         HUNSIKER
          Damn right it won't happen again!
          I'll press charges if it does!
          Will holds Caesar close and hurries home.

          INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY


                         STEWART
          What does he do for fun?
          Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little
          thrown by the question.

                         WILL
          Well we've got puzzles, games, a
          swing set...

                         STEWART
          My guess is he needs more. More
          exercise, more space.

                         WILL
          We'll work on that.
          Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen
          to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          He gets up his nerve.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          What about you?

                         (BEAT)
          What do you do for fun?
          She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't
          understand the question.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          How about dinner and a movie?
          Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears.

                         STEWART
          I'm sorry, did you say something?
          He starts to try again - but the moment's gone.

                         WILL
          No - nothing.
          Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed.
          Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something -
          but Will doesn't say more.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS, ESTABLISHING - DAY

          From high above, WE PASS OVER the Golden Gate Bridge, the
          link between the bustling city and a huge, green FOREST.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Caesar - driving with Walter and Will -- looks out the window,
          extremely excited.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DAY

          As Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS
          TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car.
          The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this
          place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar
          tugging at the leash.

                         WALTER
          Take him off the leash.

                         Â€¢ WILL
          There's a place up ahead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DAY

          They've walked deep into the park. No people here. Will
          kneels next to Caesar.

                         WILL
          Don't go far. Stay where I can see
          you.
          Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins
          flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's
          gratifying to see Caesar so happy.
          The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then
          another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A

          GROVE OF TREES.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (YELLING)
          Remember - stay where I can see you
          - if you got lost in these woods
          I'd never find you.

          BUT CAESAR BARELY HEARS HIM. HE'S UTTERLY CAPTIVATED. THE

          SPOT IS BEAUTIFUL, WITH GREEN, LUSH BRANCHES JOINING TO FORM

          A CANOPY OVERHEAD.

                         WALTER
          Go ahead. Climb!
          The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the
          branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element.
          Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is
          obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and
          Walter become smaller and smaller down below.

          SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER
          RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward. He moves with an easy
          grace, exhilarated by the freedom.
          At the TOP of the giant redwood CAESAR EMERGES THROUGH THE

          LEAVES - AND WE SEE THAT HE'S GROWN, FILLED OUT - THE CHIMP

          EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-BLOWN TEENAGER.

          HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOKS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED NOW: EYES A DEEP

          GREEN, FEATURES SOMEWHAT LESS SIMIAN, PERHAPS MORE HUMAN...
          Caesar looks across the bay to San Francisco, looks north at
          the mountains. Then down to Will below.
          Will's pointing to his watch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          â€¢ CLOSE ON A HARNESS. Will has it waiting as Caesar lands
          beside him on the forest floor.
          Will attaches the harness and they walk together. Caesar's
          much taller now - over five feet.

                         WILL
          Sorry to rush you - got to get home
          and check on Walter.
          They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT
          DANE. The dog BARKS, lunging menacingly. The Woman
          struggles to control him.

                         WOMAN

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          Is that a chimpanzee?

                         WILL
          Don't worry - he's harmless. Very
          sweet.
          The big dog keeps BARKING.
          Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE,

          CHIMPANZEE SNARL, BARING HIS TEETH.
          The Great Dane immediately WHIMPERS - terrified - and pulls
          the Woman away.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Guess he had it coming.
          Caesar watches as the Woman walks off with the dog, HIS GAZE

          LINGERING ON THE LEASH.
           THEN HIS EYES MOVE TO HIS OWN LEASH. Is he a pet too?

          EXT. ZOO - DAY

          Will drives up, Caesar in tow. The ZOO'S BEING RENOVATED -
          machinery everywhere.

          INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY

          Will leads Caesar inside the examination room - and finds
          himself face to face with a YOUNG MALE VETERINARIAN.

                         WILL
          Where's Dr. Stewart?

                         S VETERINARIAN
          She doesn't work here anymore.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          Doesn't work here anymore?

                         WILL
          Do you know where she went?

                         VETERINARIAN
          I'm sorry - I don't.
          Will's deeply disappointed.

          EXT. ZOO - DAY

          Disoriented because of the construction, Will makes a wrong
          turn as he leads Caesar to the car.
          They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE.
          Caesar goes rigid, staring at a DOZEN CHIMPS in the branches
          of the trees - behind bars. They stare back at him. One
          CHIMP, a GRIZZLED OLD MALE, STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS. HE

          LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL.
          Caesar's transfixed.
          Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.
          Neither makes a sound.

                         WILL
          Come on.
          As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb
          higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO

          SCREAM IN A DEAFENING CHATTER.

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood TEENAGERS
          walk home from school.
          One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to
          her chest. Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her. The girl
          smiles, flirts back.
          One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.
          The BOY SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER and returns to the girl.
          Caesar's fascinated by these antics. He wants to be with
          these teens. He wants to be one of them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          Caesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless.
          He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their
          posture, their gait.

          BUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A

          CHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES.

          THERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST

          LIKE ALPHA'S.
           He runs two fingers down the length of it.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Caesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's
          tension here, but we can't place it yet.
          Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S
          USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil,
          staring at it.

                         WILL
          Turn it around, Dad. You're using
          the wrong end.
          Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending.
          With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the
          old man, adjusting the spoon.
          Will watches. Heartbroken.

          INT. LAB - DAY

          A MOUSE runs through a MAZE. It reaches a fork in the path,
          leading to two different plastic objects, one green, one
          orange. The mouse hesitates, confused.
          He backs away from the cone.
          A LAB TECH makes a note. Will and Jacobs stand behind him,
          reading the number results on a monitor.
          Will's obviously discouraged.

                         WILL
          The drug's not staying ahead of the
          disease.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         JACOBS
          But we're still making progress,
          right?
          Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written
          all over his face.

                         WILL
          Sure. At this pace we'll get to
          trials by the time Hell freezes
          over.
          Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside.

                         JACOBS
          This isn't graduate school -
          there's a procedure we have to
          adhere to.

                         WILL
          It'll take forever. I need to
          start developing a primate version
          now.
          Jacobs looks at Will. He's known him a long time.

                         JACOBS
          How's your father? Haven't seen
          him in a while.

                         WILL
          This isn't about him.

                         JACOBS
          He's worse, isn't he?
          Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell
          him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't.

                         WILL

                         (EVASIVE)
          He's fine.

          WE HEAR A PERSISTENT C SHARP COMING FROM A DISTANT PIANO.
          It's a familiar, baleful SOUND that continues over the
          following...

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

          Will sits in front of the computer, looking at a file crammed
          with MPEGs of Caesar doing puzzles and games.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         WILL
          (into computer mic)
          Caesar continues to maintain a high
          level of cognition. But Walter's
          disease has caught up to the
          neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all
          initial improvement has been
          erased...
          Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Walter sits at the piano, hitting his one note.
          Caesar passes him, heads for Will's study.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

          Caesar enters, finds Will at the desk, head in hands. Will
          senses his presence. Looks up.

                         CAESAR
          Who Caesar.

                         WILL
          What do you mean?

                         CAESAR
          Who.
          With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and
          tries to understand what Caesar wants from him.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Who.

                         WILL
          Caesar is an ape.

                         (SIGNING)
          A chimpanzee.

                         CAESAR
          No "what". "Who".
          Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual
          leap Caesar's taken.

                         WILL
          Are you asking about your identity?
          That's abstract thought, Caesar.
          Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought.'

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         CAESAR
          Walter Will father. Will Caesar
          father?
          Will looks at the chimp - sees the intensity, the pain on his
          face. How to begin to answer?

          WILL (O.S.)
          This is where you were born. It's
          the place where I work.

          INT. MOVING CAR/PARKED CAR - DAY

          Will and Caesar are PARKED ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE GEN-SYS
          LAB GROUNDS, its buildings visible through the fencing.

                         WILL
          I never knew your father, but your
          mother came to live here. This is
          where you were born.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar mother?

                         WILL
          She was very very smart. And she
          passed that onto you through her
          blood.
          Caesar strains for a better view. Undoes his seatbelt.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar go. Caesar see.
          Will locks the car door.

                         WILL
          She's not here anymore. I'm sorry,
          Caesar - she died. That's when I
          brought you home to live with me
          and Walter.
          Caesar's getting worked up - he wants out of the car.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar mother...
          Will grows concerned.

                         WILL
          No. This is a bad place for you,
          Caesar. We're going to go now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          As Will pulls away Caesar strains for a last glimpse,
          twisting around to look out the back window.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Let's see if we can find something
          for you on the TV...

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Walter has a new HOME AIDE - a pale, hard-looking older
          woman. He sits on the sofa staring at the TV's moving images
          as she changes channels.
          The Aide settles on a news show covering preparations for a
          SPACE LAUNCH. ASTRONAUTS wave to the PRESS CORPS as they
          board a SHUTTLE.

                         TV REPORTER
          The Icarus crew is led by Commander
          Colonel George Taylor. This is his
          fifth space mission...

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          CLOSE ON a crude drawing of an ape. Caesar sits on the
          floor, working on its details. As he draws the white
          birthmark - like a falling star - WE REALIZE it's a self-
          portrait.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The Home Aide lights herself a cigarette, sits down on a deck
          chair.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          TV's still blaring, but the sofa's empty.
          REVEAL Walter, standing in the middle of the room, confused.
          As if he's not sure where he is.
          Abruptly he turns and heads across the room... and OUT THE

          FRONT DOOR.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Walter pauses on the porch, blinking in the sun. The street
          ahead of him is quiet. No one around.
          Walter wanders down the front path. When he arrives at the
          sidewalk he keeps on going, STEPPING OUT INTO THE STREET.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          He's immediately startled by a SUDDEN HONK, the SOUND of
          SQUEALING BRAKES, and a car fishtailing out of control. The
          car SMASHES into a nearby tree.

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          Hearing the CRASH, Caesar jumps to his feet, rushes to the
          vent. He sees Hunsiker emerge from the smashed car, unhurt.
          Caesar watches as Hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender,
          then turns to YELL at someone.
          That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view.
          He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker
          rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest.
          In a flash Caesar's down the attic stairs.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Walter backs up as Hunsiker approaches, still jabbing the
          menacing finger.

                         HUNSIKER
          Look at the front of my car you
          stupid, stupid old man! You should
          be locked up! Your son's going to
          pay for that damage -

          CAESAR EXPLODES OUT THE DOOR.
          No time for anybody to react. The chimpanzee BODY SLAMS
          HUNSIKER to the ground.

                         WALTER
          Caesar...
          Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his
          fists.

                         HUNSIKER
          Help! Get him off -

                         WALTER
          Caesar... no... Stop!
          Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back.
          But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old
          man off his back.
          Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE

          "JABBING" POINTER FINGER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         HUNSIKER
          Aaaaaaaah!
          Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE

          OF HUNSIKER'S BLOOD STREAKS ACROSS HIS NECK.

                         WALTER
          Caesar!
          Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks
          over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          Please stop.
          Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and
          sprints for his house.

          CAESAR CATCHES A GLIMPSE. ANIMAL INSTINCT TAKES OVER - IT'S

          TOO BIG TO FIGHT.
          He races after Hunsiker. WALTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. HIS
          HEAD HITS THE PAVEMENT, stunning him.

          EXT. HUNSIKER'S HOUSE - DAY

          Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar
          flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to
          block Hunsiker's entrance.
          White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to
          his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Hunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder -
          Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit.
          He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances
          over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in.
          Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to
          escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR

          HAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET.
          Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running.
          Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE

          LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH.
          Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree
          branch and swings from tree to tree.
          with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across
          the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey.
          Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front
          of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying.
          Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers.

                         HUNSIKER
          Please no...
          Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph.
          But then he sees something across the street that abruptly
          pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY -

          BEING HELPED TO HIS FEET.
          He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing.
          All at once CAESAR REALIZES WHAT HE'S DONE.

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          Will's car drives down a two-lane highway.

          REPORTER (V.0.)
          .chimpanzee named Caesar,
          terrorizing the quiet family
          enclave and mauling neighbor
          Douglas Hunsiker, a pilot for
          Global Airlines.

          INT. JACOBS' LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Jacobs watches the evening NEWS.

                         REPORTER
          The defense claimed the chimp was
          merely trying to protect its owner
          from perceived aggression.
          FOOTAGE OF WILL LEAVING A COURTHOUSE, avoiding News Crews.
          Jacobs sits forward, turns up the volume.

                         REPORTER (CONT'D)
          The chimpanzee's distraught owner,
          Wilson Rodman, has raised the
          animal since he was an infant.

          43.

                         REPORTER (CONT'D)
          He pleaded to keep Caesar at home,
          citing the ape's remarkable
          intelligence.
          Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded.

          INT. MOVING CAR Â»- DAY

          Will and Caesar drive. Caesar's dressed up - khaki pants and
          a Polo shirt.

                         WILL
          We're visiting a place called "The
          Ranch". They have animals.

                         CAESAR
          Real animals?

                         WILL
          You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees,
          gorillas, orangutans...
          Caesar GRUNTS, excited.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          It'll be good. You'll like it very
          much.
          Caesar looks at Will, picking up on something.

                         CAESAR
          Will sad?

                         WILL
          What? No, I'm fine.

          EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

          As Will pulls into the entrance, Caesar's glued to the
          window.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          They pull into a CLEARING. Ahead is a new world - CONCRETE
          AND STEEL BUILDINGS set incongruously into the bucolic
          countryside.
          A HOUSE/OFFICE, a LIVING QUARTERS, a HORSE PADDOCK - all
          cold, efficient structures.

                         CAESAR
          Where animals?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Will sees the PRIMATE CAGES in the distance, next to a GIANT

          RED METAL ATRIUM.

                         WILL
          Inside, I think...

          EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

          As they climb from the car, MR. LANDON, 50's, emerges from
          the office. DODGE, 20's, hangs back.

                         WILL
          You must be Mr. Landon.

                         (SHAKING HANDS)
          This is Caesar.

          MR. LANDON
          Nice to meet you, Caesar. This is
          Dodge, helps me run the place.

                         WILL
          I've been telling Caesar about the
          animals you have here. How much
          fun it is.

          MR. LANDON
          Yes, we have a big play center
          where the chimpanzees like to
          climb.

                         (TO CAESAR)
          Want to see the play center?
          Caesar nods. Absolutely.

          EXT. CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

          A HUGE CAGED STRUCTURE, the size of a gymnasium. Inside are
          climbing constructions, ropes, toys, and, in the middle, a
          LARGE TREE, reaching up through the top bars.
          A CAGED-IN BRIDGE leads to a row of DARK DENS. But for
          now... it's empty. No apes in sight.
          Caesar approaches with will and Mr. Landon.

          MR. LANDON
          What do you think, Caesar? Want to
          give it a try?
          Trying to mask his growing dread, Will removes Caesar's
          harness.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         WILL
          Go ahead.
          He watches Caesar - unsuspecting - move through AN OPEN, GATE-

          LIKE SLIDING DOOR.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar scampers up the ledges and leaps to a bar. He swings
          from bar to bar, then hits the ground and runs for the tree.

          EXT. OUTSIDE CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

          Will can barely watch AS DODGE ROLLS THE SLIDING DOOR CLOSED,

          LOCKING IT.
          He braces himself.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar joyfully climbs the sprawling tree until he HITS THE
          TOP OF THE CAGE. Branches continue through spaces in the
          bars, but HE'S REACHED...

          A DEAD END.
          CAESAR TURNS, FINDS WILL'BELOW. What he reads in Will's eyes
          gives him a sudden, sharp sense of dread.

          HE LOOKS TO THE CAGE ENTRANCE, SEES THAT THE GATE IS LOCKED.

          HE'S LOCKED IN. TRAPPED.
          Caesar SHRIEKS, speeds down the tree.
          Other SHRIEKS join in. EXCITED APE NOISES - coming from
          UNSEEN, CAGED APES - fills the atrium.
          The STRANGE ANIMAL VOICES FUEL CAESAR'S PANIC. He runs to
          the gate, tries to shake it open.

                         WILL
          It's okay, Caesar. It's going to
          be okay...
          The words are for him as much as Caesar.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You're going to live here for a
          while. This is what the Judge says
          we have to do.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          WHAT? Caesar can't believe what he's hearing! He
          frantically signs, desperate, pleading.
          The SHRIEKS of the UNSEEN APES continue, feeding Will's
          apprehension. Caesar doesn't belong here. It takes every
          bit of restraint he has not to take Caesar out, to run...

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          They'll take good care of you here.

                         DODGE
          That's about it for visiting hours.
          Will shoots him a look of daggers.

          MR. LANDON
          What Dodge means is, in our
          experience, longer you drag out the
          leave-taking, harder it is. On
          both of you.
          Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this
          doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry to trick you this way,
          but you would never have agreed. I
          was afraid they'd hurt you if they
          forced you -

          MR. LANDON
          He'll be fine.
          Will gives Caesar a last, long look. The pain in his eyes is
          matched only by Caesar's.
          WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away.
          Caesar's SHRIEKS build. The SURROUNDING APES chime in...a

          CACOPHONY OF PRIMAL ENERGY.

          CAESAR HURTLES HIS BODY AGAINST THE CAGE.

                         DODGE
          Caesar. Hey. I can get you out.
          Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          This way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Caesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then
          through the CAGED-IN BRIDGE. Will's almost out of sight.
          Caesar can see that he's nearly reached the car.
          He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into...

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

          .the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks.
          This is the source of the APE NOISE. It has an open, indoor
          area in the center, bordered by cages of CHIMPANZEES.
          Caesar's TAKEN ABACK BY THE LOUD, DARK FORMS POUNDING AROUND

          THEIR CAGES.

                         DODGE
          Caesar - over here.
          Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for
          salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE

          REALIZES IT'S A DEAD END.
          He turns, but DODGE SHUTS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND LOCKS IT.

          CAESAR FINDS HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A 10' BY 10' CAGE.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Stupid monkey.

          FOR A MOMENT CAESAR'S IN SHOCK, HIS MIND UNABLE TO PROCESS

          THE BETRAYAL.
          Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to
          the ceiling, searching for a way out.
          To his left: the faces of THREE HUGE, AGITATED CHIMPANZEES
          pound the concrete floor, YELLING at him. To his right:

          THREE MORE CHIMPANZEES.
          Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW
          THE SCREAM as it spreads out over the property...

          EXT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          .and finds the Will's car, driving down the winding road,
          away from the Ranch.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Will keeps driving, TEARS streaming down his face.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          INT. CAESAR'S CAGE -- LATER

          Time has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon.
          Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the
          cage, heavy head resting on his arms.
          He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE,
          followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up.
          In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR

          CHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD

          ACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN.
          This is ROCKET.
          He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage
          floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL.
          He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a
          challenging eye to Caesar.

          SCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM!
          A terrifying display of power and dominance.

          DODGE (O.S.)
          Okay, assholes. Dinner time.
          Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening
          look to Caesar - moves off.
          Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out.
          Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to
          cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in
          an occasional rotted vegetable.
          The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels
          food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-
          looking dog food.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow.
          Bet you don't get none of that in
          the suburbs.
          Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL
          IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney
          looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Think that's funny? That funny to
          you, you hairy prick?
          Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER.

                         RODNEY
          Look at that!
          Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.

                         DODGE
          One thing you can count on: Long as
          there are humans on this earth,
          you'll always be a monkey in a
          cage.
          The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards.
          Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his
          back as a shield.
          The water BLAST is relentless.
          Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a
          long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the
          floor.

                         RODNEY
          What about his clothes? Might
          cause problems with the other apes.

                         DODGE
          Leave 'em.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          Walter's frail hand runs along the cold rail of Caesar's
          swing set. Empty. Useless in the back yard.
           The Aide stands nearby, sending a text message.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY

          Will looks terrible. He's unshaven, pale, drawn. He sits on
          the sofa, surrounded by reminders of Caesar - puzzles, games,
          etc. The newspaper's unread beside him.

           WALTER (O.S.)
           John?
           Walter enters, looks at Will.

                         9

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          John - where's Caesar?
          The old man looks stricken.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          Shouldn't we look for him? Isn't
          there something we can do?
          Will looks up at his father. He's just had an idea.

          INT. LAB CAFETERIA - DAY

          WE FOLLOW Will as he strides purposefully into the cafeteria.
          He's shaved, pulled himself together.
          Will spots Jacobs,'lunching with his Blackberry, in a corner.
          He heads for him. Jacobs looks up, sees will coming.
          Will slides into the seat across from him.

                         JACOBS
          You've been gone a week.

                         WILL
          I was sick.

                         JACOBS
          Too sick to return my calls? You
          know it was a funny thing, but I
          was watching the news and they
          started talking about a seven-year-
          old chimpanzee that went nuts - and
          all of a sudden, there you were on
          the TV. A seven year old chimp,
          raised since birth.
          The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his
          voice. Neither man cares.

                         WILL
          He's the son of chimp 4. And he's
          smart. Off-the-charts smart.
          Because of the 112. The genetic
          therapy was passed in utero - from
          the mother to the son. Without a
          single negative side-effect.

                         JACOBS
          Aside from biting off a man's
          finger.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         WILL
          He was protecting my father. The
          same way his mother was protecting
          him.

                         JACOBS
          We've had this conversation
          already. We knew the 112 was
          making the apes smart -

                         WILL

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          I tried the 112 on my father.
          A conversation stopper. Jacobs is stunned. That's the
          effect Will was after.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I had a sample vial.

                         JACOBS
          You're out of your mind.
          Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit
          there. And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious.

                         WILL
          Don't you want to know if it
          worked?
          Jacobs can't resist...

                         JACOBS
          Did it?

                         WILL
          It was miraculous. Unquestionable
          adult neurogenesis - development of
          fresh nerve tissue.

                         (BEAT)
          It brought my father back.
          But Jacobs is confused.

                         JACOBS
          You told me he was failing.

                         WILL
          It's just like with the mice.
          Alzheimer's is a progressive
          disease, you need to keep it at bay
          â€¢ - you need boosters.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          Will can see Jacobs turning this over in his mind - the
          possibilities. The money.

                         JACOBS
          Why have you waited so long to tell
          me this?

                         WILL
          I couldn't risk losing him.

                         JACOBS
          'Him'?

                         WILL
          Caesar.

                         JACOBS
          The ape?
          Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.

                         WILL
          We've discovered a safe treatment.
          It's the payday you've been waiting
          for. I'll recreate the primate
          version of 112 for you.

                         (BEAT)
          But only under one condition.
          It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged.

                         JACOBS
          You're giving me conditions? I
          could have you arrested for what
          you've done.

                         WILL
          But you won't - you need me to
          build the drug. Here's what I
          need: I want you to get Caesar
          back.

                         JACOBS

                         (THROWN)
          How the hell can I do that?

                         WILL
          However they do things in your part
          of the world. Get attorneys into
          it. Write checks. Slip cash into
          the right pockets.
          (pausing for emphasis)
          Make it happen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CAESAR'S CAGE - MORNING

          Early morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage.
          He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages
          are empty - that his cage door is open.
          Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNING

          Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet
          floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.
          He can HEAR the APES in the distance.
          Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He
          pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.

          EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING

           Caesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to
          the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE

                         BRIDGE:
          THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.
          And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,
          BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT
          THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on
          toward the atrium.
          The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.
          Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around
          the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,
          orangutans with orangutans.
          They haven't noticed him yet.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take
          notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED

          LIKE A HUMAN.

          HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN

          EYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE

          MORE UPRIGHT...
          Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM.
          Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes
          follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.
           Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the
          ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then
          tosses it to Rocket.
          Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of
          trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.

          AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET

          SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.
          Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches
          out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the
          material. Caesar jerks his arm away.
          Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.
          Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can
          make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.
          Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws
          Caesar to the ground, pinning him.
          Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket
          across the face.
          OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts
          POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're
          coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.
          Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.
          Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs
          at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.
          He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's
          face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and...

          .ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.
          BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.
          Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S
          BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He
          pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.
          Caesar starts to move off -

          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF

          CAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS.

          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him.
          Out cold.

          INT. RANCH INFIRMARY - DAY

          Caesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED.
          His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants,
          now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST,

          PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE.
          It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment.
          Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing,
          restrained to a medical table.
          Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings.

                         VOICE
          Caesar.
          Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head.

                         STEWART
          Do you remember me? I'm Dr.
          Stewart.
          She hands him a cup of water with a straw.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Drink.
          Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly
          doesn't understand. He signs again.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I don't understand.
          Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW
          SOUND. She's taken aback - is he trying to speak?

                         STEWART (CONT-D)
          Can you show me? Show me what you
          need.
          Caesar pulls at the restraints.

                          STEWART (CONT'D)
           I can't take those off.
           Caesar sags with defeat, overcome with DESPAIR.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry this has happened,
          Caesar. So sorry.
          Stewart stares at him. Moved at the complexity of his
          emotion, the obvious intelligence behind his pain.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm here once a week. I'll do my
          best to look after you.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

          Dodge pulls heavy bags of Primate Chow from a truck, stacking
          them in a SHED. He spots Stewart striding towards him, and--
          Ducks out of sight, vainly brushing back his hair.

          STEWART (O.S.)
          What were you thinking?

                         DODGE
          oh, hey Doc.

                         STEWART
          That chimp needs protection.
          Dodge's face falls.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          You could've gotten him killed.

                         DODGE

                         (A LIE)
          I told Rodney not to open his cage.

                         STEWART
          Can't you see how sensitive he is?
          How intelligent?

                         DODGE
          Yeah, no, he's a real smart
          dresser.

                         STEWART
          I want him moved to the orangutan
          house. He'll be safe there until
          we re-introduce him to the group.

                         DODGE
          I'm sorry, since when do volunteer
          animal doctors make the rules
          around here?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         STEWART
          Please. Just do it.

                         DODGE
          Whatever you say, doc.
          Dodge returns to stacking the chow.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          You're the one with the college
          education.

          INT. 'VIRUS FACTORY', GEN-SYS LABS - DAY

          A spinning machine, test tubes, a giant propagation tank.
          Empty canisters labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
          REVEAL WILL in the doorway, watching it all very carefully.
          A VIRUS TECHNICIAN approaches him. He's tentative, nervous.

                         VIRUS TECHNICIAN
          Dr. Rodman - I think there's been a
          mistake.
          Will's been waiting for this observation - he's surprised it
          took so long to come up.

          VIRUS TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)
          I've double-checked the replication
          rate of the 113 - and it's
          enormously fast compared to the

          112.

                         WILL
          That's why we're using it. We need
          the drug quickly.

                         VIRUS TECHNICIAN
          But... isn't it risky? I mean, at
          this rate of propagation, we
          greatly increase the possibility of
          mutations that are out of our
          control. It's a highly unstable -

                         WILL
          I appreciate your concern - but
          it's going to be fine. We plan on
          taking precautions.
          The Technician pauses, not entirely satisfied. But Will's
          look tells him the conversation is over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          BEEP BEEP BEEP...

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES -- DAY

           A large truck backs onto a loading dock. Will watches as a
           NEW GROUP OF CHIMPANZEES are unloaded from the truck and
          brought into the lab.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT

           Will's in his sweats, working. DOORBELL.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Will opens the door to FIND STEWART STANDING THERE. For a
          moment he's too shocked to say anything.

                         STEWART
          Sorry to drop in on you like this.
          The clinic at the zoo gave me your
          address but they didn't have a
          phone number -

                         WILL

                         (RECOVERING)
          Don't worry about it. You want to
          come in?

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           They stand awkwardly by the door. She looks great.

                          WILL
          Can I - you want a cup of coffee or
          something?

                         STEWART
          No - thanks. I just wanted to let
          you know that I've seen Caesar.
          Seen Caesar?

                         WILL
          How?

                         STEWART
          I volunteer once a week at The
          Ranch.

                         WILL
          Is he alright?
          She hesitates, wanting to be honest but not alarming.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         STEWART
          Yeah. He had a rough start, but
          things should get smoother from now
          on...
          In the other room, Walter and his Aide become visible. Will
          follows Stewart's curious gaze.

                         WILL
          That's my dad. He's not doing too
          well.

                         STEWART
          Oh. Sorry.

                         (BEAT)
          Anyway, Caesar's going to be okay.
          I'm looking after him.

                         WILL
          Thank you... I appreciate that.
          Awkward beat.

                         STEWART
          Well. If you give me your number
          I'll let you know from time to time
          how things are going -

                         WILL
          Let's grab a drink.
          Takes her by surprise. Maybe takes him by surprise too.
          She's happy he asked.

                         STEWART
          Love to.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Nighttime.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          A repulsive bowl of primate chow. Caesar - bandaged, beat-up
          and miserable - picks at it. In the next cage, the
          orangutans sleep.
          ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck,
          windows down, radio blaring. Dodge gets out, cigarette in
          his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed.
          40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          Caesar watches as Dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee.

                         DODGE
          Want a beer?
          The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Here's a little taste of beer...
          He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH.
          Caesar watches, disgusted.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE -- MORNING


          A LEVER THROWN OPEN.
          Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages
          in succession.
          Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE

          ATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN.

                         DODGE & RODNEY
          Move it! Let's go!
          Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing
          ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move
          across the bridge.
          On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE,
          ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out,
          then moves off to join the others.
          Caesar maneuvers to get a better view.
          Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him
          push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his
          arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS

          HAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE.
          Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE.
          Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still
          alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable.
          Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out?
          Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S

          CAR'S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          His heart skips a beat. He moves to the bars, barely able to
          contain his excitement.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar
          on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured
          appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's
          clearly thrilled to see him.

                         WILL
          There you are! I heard what
          happened.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Home now. Caesar home.
          He tugs Will away from Dodge.

                         WILL
          I'm going to get you out of here,
          but not today. I'm working on it.
          Caesar's face falls.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Soon. I promise.
          Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Home.
          Still a question, a flicker of hope.

                         WILL
          (kills him to say it)
          Not yet. I can't yet.
          Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here.
          First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and
           starts walking back to his cage.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
          Wait a second - Caesar, where are
          you going?
          â€¢ Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking.
          Dodge catches up with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         DODGE
          (loud enough for Will)
          No place like home, huh monkey boy?

                         WILL
          Caesar - come back here!
          He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside
          him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run.

          EXT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - DAY

          Dodge locks Caesar in his cell. Then moves around to the...

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

           .storage shed. He notices Will's car still parked in front
          of the office... just as -
          BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the
          ground. Will stands over him, too livid to realize he
          might've just broken his hand.

                         WILL
          You son of a bitch.
          Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose.

                         DODGE
          That was not a smart thing to do.
          Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's
          too angry to care.

                         WILL
          If I find out Caesar's been hurt,
          if he's mistreated in any way, I
          swear I'll have you brought up on
          charges.
          Dodge looks towards Landon's house, restrains himself.

                         DODGE
          That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours
          any more. He's mine now.
          The truth of the statement is worse than any punch.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          And you're on private property.
          Now get the hell out of here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         WILL
          Forget jail. I'll come back and
          kill you.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - LATER

          A bag of CHIPS AHOY COOKIES. Caesar - looking morose -
          watches as Rodney pops a cookie in his mouth and stuffs the
          bag into the shed...

          STEWART (O.S.)
          Morning Caesar.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          The door slides open. Stewart enters, followed by Dodge.

                         STEWART
          How's your arm? Mind if I take a
          look?
          Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE
          PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS, cuts off his bandages.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Looking good...
          Caesar makes eye contact with Dodge over Stewart's shoulder.
          She pulls a harness from her bag.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm taking him out. Thought I'd
          cheer him up, show him the horses.

                         DODGE
          No way.
          As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG.

                         STEWART
          What are you going to do? Use a
          cattle prod on me?

                         DODGE
          If you're into that kind of thing.

                         STEWART
          I'm safer with him than I am with
          you.

                         DODGE
          Answer's no.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.
          Stewart turns to Caesar, who's retreated onto a bed of straw.

                         STEWART
          I can't take you.
          (glancing at Dodge)
          Maybe another time.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

          RAIN. The apes sleep. Except for Caesar.
          Standing in the corner of his cage, Caesar pulls STEWART'S
          SCISSORS and a roll of MEDICAL TAPE out from the STRAW.
          He kneels at his bedding, gathering sticks and straw. Then
          he begins weaving the tape through several sticks, binding
          them and extending them end to end.
          Caesar pauses, sensing something. He looks over his
          shoulder, discovers MAURICE THE ORANGUTAN watching him.
          They hold each others' gaze, Caesar taking his measure. Then
          Caesar puts a finger to his lips. "Shhhh."
          Maurice makes no movement, but the agreement is clear.
          Caesar returns to crafting the tool.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

          Dark FORMS in cages, illuminated by GREEN FLUORESCENT LIGHT.
          The DOOR OPENS. EYES OPEN, HEADS TURN.
          Will enters - WE SEE THAT HIS HAND HIS BANDAGED.
          The apes watch as he walks along the cages, eyes searching
          the dark chimpanzee faces.

          EACH LAB CHIMP HAS A DIFFERENT COLORED IDENTIFICATION WRIST

          BAND.

                         WILL
          Which one of you wants chocolate...
          Chimpanzees stare back at him, giving him nothing.
          NOISE FROM BEHIND. Will turns. Down the row, A CHIMPANZEE

          ARM EXTENDS FROM A CAGE, PALM UP - WITH A RED BAND.
          Will walks to the cage, chimp #11, reads the label beside it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          "Koba."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          He peers inside. Koba stares back, EYES MURKY AND SMALL

          BENEATH A HEAVILY PROTRUDING BROW, DARKENED PIGMENTATION

          STREAKS DOWN EACH CHEEK. A SINISTER FACE.
          He DROPS AN M&M INTO KOBA'S PALM. Eyes on Will, Koba secrets
          it to a "storage spot" inside the cage.
          Then he puts out his hand again.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Nanotherapy, beta version: Male
          Test Subject Number eleven.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Koba doesn't resist as Will straps him to the table.
          He watches as a HANDLER -- EVANS - moves into the next room,
          opens a refrigerator with a strange BIOHAZARD SYMBOL and
          pulls out CANISTER labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
           Evans and Will each slip on HAZMAT masks, making sure they're
          secure. Then Evans hands the 113 to Will.
           All of this avidly taken in by Koba's dark eyes.
          Will inserts the adenovirus 113 nozzle into a plastic oxygen
          mask.
          Koba's eyes are on him as he brings the mask toward the
          chimp's face.

                         EVANS

                         (THROUGH MASK)
          Boy, he's a calm one, isn't he?
          Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO

          KOBA'S NOSE AND MOUTH.

          THE CHIMPANZEE CONVULSES ON THE TABLE.

          INT. STEWART'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          CHOP STICKS digging into take-out Chinese. Stewart and Will
          sit in her kitchen, eating. It's clear from their state of
          dress (or undress) that they've been intimate.
          Because his hand is still bandaged, he's having a hard time
          with the chopsticks.

                         STEWART
          You actually punched him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         WILL
          I did.
          She thinks it's funny.

                         STEWART
          I've been wanting to do that since
          the day I met him.

                         WILL
          I don't advise it. My hand's
          killing me.

                         STEWART
          Here. Let me help you out.
          She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his
          chopsticks.

                         WILL
          I'm going to get him out of there.

                         STEWART
          I know you are.

                         WILL
          And I'm going to get my dad back
          too.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar tapes sticks together. WE SEE that he's created a
          THREE-FOOT LONG "ARM". He tapes the scissors firmly to its
          end, finger holes sticking out. Finished.
          Silently he moves to the edge of the cage. USING THE

          CONTRAPTION, HE LOOPS THE FINGER HOLES OVER THE LATCH.
          He tries once. Misses. Twice. Misses again. Caesar keeps
          trying... until finally the loop's in place.
          Then he begins to tug. Tug. Tug. CLICK - the LATCH OPENS.
          He glances over to Maurice, who silently watches.
          Caesar pushes open the cage door. MAURICE'S EYES FOLLOW HIM

          INTO THE NIGHT.

          EXT. BRIDGE AREA - NIGHT

          Caesar walks across the bridge. He passes the entrance to
          the chimpanzee house - and keeps going.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - NIGHT

          He arrives at the Gorilla House.
          Buck's visible in his cage, asleep on a bed of straw. Caesar
          unlocks the door latch and opens the cage door.
          He waits, but Buck doesn't budge. He's still fast asleep.
          Caesar hesitates. Then he slowly...

          INT. BUCK'S CAGE - NIGHT

          .enters the cage, edging up to the sleeping gorilla.
          From this vantage point, Buck looks enormous, his vast chest
          rising and falling with sleep. Caesar very carefully wiggles
          his toe.
          There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar
          finds himself staring into the huge, angry gorilla face.
          Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door.
           Buck understands but can't believe it. For a moment he
           doesn't move. Caesar makes the gesture again -- "Come on,
          let's go."
           Before he can finish, Buck bursts past him...

          EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

          .across the bridge...

          EXT. ATRIUM - NIGHT

          .and into the atrium. Caesar follows.
          The full moon shines down on Buck, the tree, the climbing
          structure.
          The gorilla feels his feet on the grass, savoring every step.
          Then he begins to run. He runs as fast as he can, all the
          way across the atrium, then all the way back.
          Back and forth, GORILLA WIND SPRINTS of freedom.
          Caesar stands back, silently watching.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - MORNING

          A morning like any other. Dodge goes through his routine:
          0 opening the door, wheeling out a wheelbarrow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          He makes his way to the ape houses.

          EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - MORNING

          Dodge and his wheelbarrow approach the Gorilla House. Closer
          and closer to the cage... until they're right in front.
          The CAGE DOOR'S CLOSED, BUCK INSIDE. Dodge shovels primate
          chow into the gorilla's trough.

          BUCK TAKES A HANDFUL AND LOOKS ACROSS TO CAESAR, WHO RETURNS

          HIS GAZE FROM THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - MORNING

          Caesar senses something: Maurice is staring at him. Caesar 's
          beginning to wonder what Maurice wants when the ORANGUTAN

          DOES SOMETHING REMARKABLE: HE USES SIGN LANGUAGE.

                         MAURICE
          Happy gorilla.
          Caesar's shocked.

                         MAURICE (CONT'D)
          Surprise.

                         CAESAR
          Signing orangutan.

                         MAURICE
          Maurice circus orangutan.

                         CAESAR
          More ape sign?

                         MAURICE
          No. Maurice alone.
          They HEAR DODGE'S WHEELBARROW APPROACH.

                         CAESAR
          Careful. Stupid human no like
          smart ape.
          Dodge begins shoveling primate chow into the troughs.
          Maurice and Caesar stop signing and blend in.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT

          Rocket sleeps. Pieces of primate chow hit him in the head.
          He wakes with a start. SEES THAT HIS CAGE DOOR IS OPEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Rocket gets to his feet, sees CAESAR STANDING IN THE COMMON

          AREA.
          Rocket GRUNTS and sprints after him - through the chimpanzee
          common area - toward the door -
          Where WHAM! CAESAR WHACKS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH ROCKET'S

          PLASTIC REFRIGERATOR.

          ROCKET STAGGERS, TRYING TO RECOVER, AND LANDS ON HIS BUTT.

          HE LOOKS UP TO SEE CAESAR... AND BEHIND HIM, STANDING LIKE A

          MOUNTAIN: BUCK.
          Buck raises his arms and SLAMS them down with a MIGHTY ROAR;
          Caesar slings the plastic refrigerator aside, sending it
          SKITTERING across the CONCRETE.
          The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen.
          Rocket looks from Buck to Caesar. He's beaten.

          STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND, PALM UP, ROCKET MAKES THE

          SUPPLICATING GESTURE. CAESAR RUNS HIS HAND - PALM DOWN -

          OVER ROCKET'S, SEALING HIS DOMINATION.
          A COLLECTIVE GASP OF AWE moves through the ho-use.
          Rocket crawls back to his cage, defeated. Caesar - walking
          at full height - follows. He CLOSES ROCKET'S CAGE DOOR AND

          LOCKS HIM IN.
          Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making
          eye contact with each and every chimpanzee. He exits with
          his Lieutenant, Buck, in tow.

          CHIMPANZEE HOUSE HAS A NEW ALPHA MALE.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Will and Evans (the handler) are wearing hazmat masks as they
          administer Adenovirus 113 to chimp after chimp.
          Chimp after chimp convulses on the table.
          They lead Koba to the table. Koba knows what to do. He lies
          down, allows himself to be strapped in.
          All routine. Everyone's guard is down.
          But as soon as the BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST is released, KOBA

          â€¢ THRASHES OUT AN ARM, HITTING EVANS IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         WILL
          Hold him steady!
          Evans tightens the straps on Koba's flailing arm.

          WE SEE THAT EVANS' MASK HAS BEEN KNOCKED ASKEW.
          Will finishes administering the drug. Koba goes limp on the
          table.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You okay Evans?

                         EVANS
          Yeah. I'm good.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Will demonstrates the "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle. Koba watches.

                         WILL
          You can't put larger blocks on top
          of smaller ones.
          (pointing to right side)
          Move the stack from here to here.
          Koba takes the puzzle and ROTATES IT 180 DEGREES CLOCKWISE,

          SO THAT THE LEFT STACK IS INDEED NOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
          Will looks at Koba. Koba looks back.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (DEMONSTRATING)
          You've got to take the blocks off
          and stack them again, like this.
          Will turns the puzzle back around.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Let's see you try.
          Koba puts out a palm - asking for an M&M.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I'll give you an M&M if you can get
          the blocks to the other side - but
          don't do it the way you did last
          time.
          Koba thinks, then ROTATES THE PUZZLE AGAIN - THIS TIME
          COUNTERCLOCKWISE. Ingenious in its own way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You know what I want. You're just
          not going to give it to me.
          Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT,

          DISQUIETING.

          AND SOMETHING ELSE: HIS EYES HAVE CHANGED. THEY LOOK

          SOMEWHAT LIKE CAESAR'S - GREENER, LESS SIMIAN...

          WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          What do you think of Koba?

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

           We look through cage bars at Will and Franklin, who stand far
          away, across the room.

                          FRANKLIN
           You wanna know if I think the 113's
           making him nuts.

                         WILL
          I know he's smart. But there's
          something else, something
          worrisome. He challenges me.
          Taunts me.
          Will looks toward us, toward the bars.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (almost to himself)
          I don't want to try it on...

                         (CATCHES HIMSELF)
          .I don't want to start human
          trials if there's any chance of
          danger.

                         FRANKLIN
          What you're seeing has nothing to
          do with the 113, Doc. The apes're
          just like us - they're complex.
          Some are loyal, some are selfish,
          some have a good sense of humor.
          And some are born rotten.
          Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of
          view, from inside the cage.
          Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his
          â€¢ face frame the two men across the room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
          This one's a bad apple, that's all.
          A chill runs down Will's spine.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES/MAIN GATE - DAY

          A car pulls up to the gate. Evans is driving. He looks ill.

                         GUARD

                         (OPENING GATE)
          Early day today, Evans?

                         EVANS
          Actually I'm not feeling too good.

          EVANS GETS A SHIVER.

                         GUARD
          You know what: Whiskey, lemon,
          honey and a cup of hot water.
          Never fails.

                         EVANS
          Thanks - I'm on it.
          Evans drives off.

          EXT. PADDOCK - DAY

          Stewart sits atop one of the ranch horses, looking down at
          the chimpanzee area.
          She watches CAESAR walking across the bridge. Caesar moves
          easily among the apes, his Alpha Male status clear as the
          others make way for him.
          Stewart's relieved - and a little surprised - to see Caesar
          so at ease with the other apes.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

          ROCKET'S MISERABLE. Dodge and Rodney watch him through the
          bars.

                         RODNEY
          Still won't eat, won't come out.

                         DODGE
          I can fix that.
          Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Get that monkey ass out of there!

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          Caesar watches Dodge BLAST Rocket with WATER. Rocket doesn't
          struggle, doesn't fight back. The harsh jet pelts his back.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT

          Rocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him.
          Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never
          seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes
          a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down.
          At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS.
          Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a
          cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - NIGHT

          Rocket exits warily, on his guard for anything...
          But Caesar simply stands with the cookie bag. No gorilla.
          No shovel.
          He hands the cookie bag to Rocket.
          Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER,

          OPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE.
          CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered.
          Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar
          makes a motion with his hand.
          Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest
          chimp. Then another one. Then another.
          The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND

          ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE

          MOMENT - ROCKET'S FOUND HIS FOOTING.
          Now Caesar opens the orangutan and gorilla cages. A moment
          of discomfort as Caesar leads the other apes in.
          Caesar pulls an orangutan over to Rocket. Rocket hands the
          orangutan a cookie. The other orangutans and Buck
          immediately line up. Discomfort's gone - now it's one big
          â€¢ party.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
           Caesar watches, satisfied, as the apes feast together.

          EXT. ATRIUM/TREE - DAY

          Caesar sits high in the tree, looking down at the apes.
          Rocket's part of the group again, but no longer the Alpha.
          Caesar's got his eye on CORNELIA, a FEMALE APE, standing with
          a group of females. He follows her movements with his
          eyes...
          Maurice climbs up next to Caesar.

                         MAURICE
          Why cookie Rocket?

                         CAESAR
          Need strong. All apes strong.

                         MAURICE
          No understand.
          Caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and BREAKS IT.

                         CAESAR
          Gorilla.
          He breaks another twig.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Orangutan.
          He breaks another.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Chimpanzee.
          He grabs a bunch of twigs and holds them together - now they
          can't be broken.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Apes.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Establishing shot. A beautiful morning.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Will's getting ready for his day. Hair wet from the shower,
          buttoning up his shirt, he pauses to pour himself a cup of
          coffee, look up at the clock.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          He takes a sip, heads down the hall to his father's room.

                         WILL
          Someone's sleeping late today -
          Will opens the door - and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Dad?

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          LONG SHOT of Will sitting at a gravesite service, surrounded
          by twenty-odd PEOPLE. WE RECOGNIZE Stewart, Jacobs, one of
          the Aides.

          EXT. RANCH - DAY

          Will waits at the picnic table. He's been there a while.
          Finally Rodney appears.

                         RODNEY
          Sorry - can't get him to come out.
          He won't budge.

                         WILL
          He knows I'm here?

                         RODNEY
          I told him.
          Will brushes by Rodney, heads for the cages.

                         RODNEY (CONT'D)
          Hey - you are not allowed back

                         THERE -
          Will ignores him, keeps going.

          EXT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          Caesar sees Will coming. He turns his back, heads to a
          common area away from the bars.
          Will runs up to the cage.

                         WILL
          Caesar - please! I've got
          something to tell you -

                         (BEAT)
          It's about Walter.

                         Â€¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          WE FIND CAESAR deep out of sight in the orangutan cage. He' s
          heard Will's words.
          Will waits. Caesar's not coming out.

          NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
          NASA has temporarily lost
          communication with the Icarus.

          INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Will sits with a glass of Scotch, watching TV. Stewart's
          looking at a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH.

                         NEWSCASTER
          Captain Taylor and his crew are
          navigating the ship around the dark
          side of Mars. Communication is
          expected to be reestablished -

                         WILL
          I was too late.
          She puts the photo down, cuddles against him.

                         STEWART
          You tried. You worked really hard.
          Walter knew that.

                         WILL
          Wasn't good enough though, was it.
          ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH. It shows a younger Walter and his
          two teenage sons...

          INT. LAB - NIGHT

          Franklin's on the phone.

                         FRANKLIN
          Just checking in. You didn't show
          up at work today.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. EVANS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Crummy little place. TV's on with no sound. WE HEAR
          FRANKLIN'S VOICE through the phone machine.

          FRANKLIN (O.S.)
          Hope you're feeling better - let me
          know if you need anything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          REVEAL EVANS, LYING IN BED, DEAD - a streak of brown dried
          blood across his cheek -- as if draining from his lifeless
          eye.

          EXT. RANCH - NIGHT

          Deep night at the ranch. A moon half-hidden by clouds.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

          Caesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage. Maurice
          grabs his arm.

                         MAURICE
          Where go?

                         CAESAR
          Find Mother.

          EXT. RANCH/PRIMATE HOUSES - NIGHT

          Caesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the

          GATE.
          As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL
          OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to
          go with him.
          Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER.
          To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he
          gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S

          EYES HAVE CHANGED.
          Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes
          Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE

          UNMISTAKABLY GREEN.
          Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he
          remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the
          wound on his arm, now nearly healed.
          Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket?
          Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for
          anything.

          EXT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Caesar and Rocket barrel across the ranch, past the living
          â€¢ quarters, past the barn, onto the winding road leading away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

          EXT. NEAR-DESERTED TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Middle of the night, only a few cars.
          Caesar and Rocket stick to bushes and shadows. They wait for
          a break in traffic, cross the highway.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT

          In the distance the LIGHTS of the TOWN give a glow to the
          night sky. Caesar and Rocket gallop toward it.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

          Dark, quiet. RUSTLING IN THE TREES, as if a storm is coming.

          SUDDENLY CAESAR BURSTS THROUGH, SWINGING FOR THE NEXT TREE
          A moment later ROCKET FOLLOWS.
          Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the
          suburban street.

          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


          CLOSE ON WILL'S SLEEPING FACE.

          CREAK, CREAK... CREAK, CREAK.
          WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE. What is that?

          CREAK, CREAK. . .CREAK, CREAK.
          It's coming from outside.
          REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed,
          moves to the window, looks into the back yard.

          THE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED.
          Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see.
          Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes.

          THAT'S WHEN A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE BED.
          It's CAESAR'S SILHOUETTE, noiselessly emerging from the
          darkness.
          He stands there, looking down at Will and Stewart.
          His face is impossible to read.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

          INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Rocket's fascinated by photos of Caesar with Will and Walter
          along the mantle.
          Caesar emerges from Will's room and makes his way down the
          hallway.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Stripped bed, a couple of packed boxes. Caesar stands at the
          doorway, taking it in.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Feet pounding the pavement, Caesar and Rocket head away from
          Will's house.

          EXT. OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

          GEN-SYS RESEARCH SIGN. The grounds are deserted. A SECURITY
          GUARD listens to RADIO in the guard kiosk.
          Caesar and Rocket - eyes on the Security Guard - stop at a
          spot hidden by a tree and scale the fence.

          EXT. LAB GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket drop down to the grass. They SNIFF THE
          AIR, head toward the Primate House.

          INT. SECURITY KIOSK - NIGHT

          The Security Guard yawns, checks his watch. Over his
          shoulder, on a monitor, WE SEE the dark forms of two
          chimpanzees run across the grounds.

          EXT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket arrive at the Primate House. Caesar tries
          the big double door - locked. He looks upward, spies a ROW
          OF AWNING WINDOWS near the roof.
          Rocket pushes a dumpster close to the building wall.
          Then Caesar jumps on the dumpster and catapults himself to
          the window's ledge. Hanging by one arm, he swings himself in
          through the window.
          Rocket follows.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE NIGHT

          Franklin's got the graveyard shift. He's watching a movie on
          the office computer - doesn't hear anything.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Eerie, darkly lit. SLEEPING CHIMPS stir. CAESAR and ROCKET
          drop to the cement floor.
          Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED
          FIGURES INSIDE. Caesar walks alongside them, peering into
          each one, studying the shadowy, simian faces.

          A HAIRY ARM EXTENDS THROUGH THE BARS, PALM UP - IT HAS A RED

          BAND AROUND ITS WRIST.

          IT'S OFFERING AN M&M.
          Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH

          KOBA.

          HIS EYES ARE BEADY, A STEELY GREY.

          THE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP. EACH SENSES

          SOMETHING IN THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
          Caesar moves on. HE'S INTENT, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.
          Rocket barrels forward, grabs the M&M from Koba's hand.
          Koba offers up ANOTHER M&M. But ROCKET'S EYES ARE ON THE RED

          IDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

          KOBA CAN SEE THIS. HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING

          HIS CAGE.

          ROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT, THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH.
          ANGLE ON Caesar.
          He's nearly reached the last of the cages, and the

          DISAPPOINTMENT IS PLAIN ON HIS FACE.
          These chimpanzees are distant, strange. No familiar face.

          NO CONNECTION.
          Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick,
          stares back at him.
          Caesar turns away, crestfallen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          He YELLS for ROCKET, and the two of them take off. The LAB
          CHIMPS start to SCREAM.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT

           HEARING THE COMMOTION, Franklin puts down his book, heads...

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          .into the Primate House. Where he stops in his tracks.

          KOBA STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, UPRIGHT.
          They stare at each other.
          Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM.

          EXT. LAB GROUNDS/GUARD KIOSK - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket head for the fence. A GUARD approaches on
          his nightly rounds.
          They look at each other, lay low.
          To protect Caesar, Rocket takes off running. The SHOCKED

          SECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE-

          TALKIE.
          But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight.

          EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

          Caesar's waiting when Rocket runs up. They take off
          together.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S

          KHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN.
          Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes
          behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted.
          Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night
          swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep,
          oblivious.
          Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him.

           INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The apes have calmed down. Koba slips back into his cage and
          â€¢ closes the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          CLICK. It locks into place.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING

          Dawn of a new day.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CORNELIA'S CAGE - EARLY MORNING

          Sunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across Caesar's
          face. He opens his eyes. Looks at Cornelia, still asleep.
          Caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - EARLY MORNING

          Caesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still
          asleep.
          There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS.
          Caesar freezes.
          Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the
          shovel. Locks the door behind him.
          He hasn't seen Caesar yet.

                         DODGE
          Rise and shine, assholes.
          The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in
          the common area.

          THEN DODGE SEES HIM.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          What the hell -
          (seeing Cornelia's open

                         CAGE)
          You sly son of a bitch. How'd you
          do that?
          Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds
          it in front of him.
          He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're gonna go slow here, alright?
          You're gonna go back in your cage,
          you're not going to give me no
          trouble.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          The apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent,
           riveted, waiting to see what will happen.
          Cornelia stands, watching.
          Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is
          unreadable.
          Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL

          AGAINST THE BARS.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Back!
          Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips.
          Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples,
          Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT.
          Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward
          the orangutan cage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're going to have you fixed,
          Einstein, that's for damn sure...
          But first we're going to figure out
          how you pulled this off...

          CAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Go on. Get in that cage.
          Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          I said get!
          But Caesar doesn't move.
          Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement
          floor.
          He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel
          handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Get in that cage, you damn dirty
          ape!

          â€¢ CAESAR'S EYES NARROW. HE STANDS TALL, STRETCHING TO HIS FULL

          HEIGHT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          THEN HE STARES DODGE FULL IN THE EYES, DIGS DEEP, AND WITH

          TREMENDOUS EFFORT... SPEAKS.

                         CAESAR
          (with his voice)
          No!

          STUNNED SILENCE.

          THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING.
          Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance.
          Caesar has spoken. Actually uttered a word.
          Maurice, Rocket, Buck, and all the apes stare, dumbfounded,
          trying to comprehend what has just happened.
          And then... they go nuts.

           SCREAMING. YELLING. JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
           That's when Caesar attacks.
           He rushes Dodge, wrestling the shovel from his hands.
           Dodge spins around to defend himself - and CAESAR HITS HIM IN

           THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.
          Dodge staggers back.
          Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach.
          Dodge crumples forward.

          CAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP, SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD.
          Lights out.
          Caesar drags Dodge to Rocket's cage and opens the door.
          Rocket helps pull him inside.

          THEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE

          APES COME STREAMING OUT.
          They gather around Caesar, who holds up STEWART'S SCISSORS

          AND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM.
          Then he walks to Rocket, who gets down on his knees and puts
          out his hand in the supplicating gesture. CAESAR TAKES THE

          SCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET'S PALM, THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO

          HANDS TOGETHER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          He moves to Maurice, who offers up his hand. Caesar slices
          the palm and places his hand against it.
          Then he turns to Buck - who stands up tall, beats his chest
          and YELLS... BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND.
          And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR

          OPEN PALMS WAITING.

          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAWN

          Will wakes, climbs out of bed, careful not to wake Stewart.

          INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

          He moves down the hallway, approaching Walter's room. He
          pauses, puzzled, at the door - which is AJAR.
          Strange.

          THE PHONE STARTS TO RING.
          Will ignores it -- slowly pushes the door open... AND SEES

          CAESAR'S TATTERED PANTS LAID ACROSS THE STRIPPED BED.
          He stands there, stunned.

          JACOBS (O.S.)
          Will? Hello? Will pick up the
          goddamned phone!

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING


                         WILL
          Hello?

          INTERCUT WITH JACOBS AT THE LAB.

                         JACOBS
          The animal handler - Franklin - was
          killed last night. In the primate
          house.

                         WILL
          Franklin's dead?

                         JACOBS
          Something very powerful broke his
          neck. Snapped it in two.

                         WILL
          Could it have been one of our
          chimps?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         JACOBS
          All our apes are accounted for - â€¢
          secured in their cages. But here's
          the kicker: One of our security
          guards swears he chased a
          chimpanzee off the grounds last
          night.
          Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's
          swing.

                         JACOBS (CONT'D)
          Where in the hell did that chimp
          come from?!

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE -- MORNING

          Will speeds out of the driveway, Stewart by his side. She's
          dialing her cell phone.

          INT. RANCH HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Mr. Landon answers the RINGING PHONE. He's in his pajamas.

          MR. LANDON
          The Ranch. Landon speaking.

                         (LISTENING)
          Hey Stewart.

                         (LISTENING)
          Caesar? Dodge fed them breakfast
          about half an hour ago...
          He holds up a PAIR OF BINOCULARS, looks toward the atrium and
          ape houses. Can't see anything wrong.

          MR. LANDON (CONT'D)
          Let me call you back...
          He HEARS THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. RUSTLING NOISES in the
          kitchen. Opening and closing of cabinets.

          MR. LANDON (CONT'D)
          Hey Dodge - Stewart just called -
          WE FOLLOW HIM out of the living-room, into the...

          INT. RANCH/KITCHEN - MORNING

          .kitchen.

          MR. LANDON
          She said that -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Landon goes pale. ROCKET AND TWO OTHER CHIMPANZEES ARE

          STANDING IN THE KITCHEN.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - MORNING

          The two CHIMPANZEES drag Mr. Landon toward the Ape Houses.
          Rocket follows, munching cereal from a box of Cheerios.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          Rodney's visible, being dragged, SCREAMING.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          Will's car speeds up to the gate and stops.

                         STEWART

                         (ON PHONE)
          No one's answering.
          In the distance they can HEAR the PHONE RINGING at the ranch
          house. From where the car is, nothing out of the ordinary is
          visible.
          Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car.

                         WILL
          You go get help.

                         STEWART
          Not a way in the world. I'm coming
          with you.

          EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

           They sneak into the back of the ranch house. All is quiet.

          INT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

          But once inside, the level of destruction is immediately
          visible: Overturned table and chairs, plates smashed,
          cupboards emptied.

                         STEWART
          Oh my God... I'm calling 911..
          Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window.
          HE SEES: Debris everywhere. Apes free, wandering... DODGE,
          LANDON and RODNEY BATTERED AND IN CAGES.

          AND - IN THE ATRIUM - SURROUNDED BY HIS CLOSEST FOLLOWERS...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          .CAESAR. CLEARLY THE ALPHA MALE. Clearly in control.

                         WILL
          Caesar.
          Will lowers the binoculars as Stewart rushes in. She's
          trembling.

                         STEWART
          It's going to take them at least
          half an hour to get here.
          He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an
          empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a
          couple of stray COOKIES.
          He has an idea.
          Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                         WILL
          I'm going to kill him.

                         STEWART

                         (HORRIFIED)
          Caesar?

                         WILL
          He's dangerous.

                         STEWART
          You're wrong - he can't have been
          the one who killed that man -

                         WILL
          There is no other explanation.
          A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart
          turns. Now there's another.
          They're surrounded. She SCREAMS.
          Will barricades the back door with a table.
          Chimpanzees at every window BANGING ON THE GLASS, wanting in.

          GLASS SHATTERS.
          Will and Stewart run to the front room, just as the door

          CRASHES OFF ITS HINGES - REVEALING BUCK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

           INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY


                          WILL
           Caesar! I need to talk to you!
           Dodge, Rodney and Landon watch as Will and Stewart are pushed
          into the cage next door.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
          Caesar!

                         DODGE
          Welcome to the mad house.

                         STEWART
          I called Animal Control - they'll
          be here soon -

                         WILL
          (through the bars)
          I just want to talk to you!

                         DODGE
          Well this'll be interesting because
          your freak'll talk back.

                         RODNEY
          Dodge thinks he spoke to him.

                         DODGE
          He did! He said the word "no" -
          right to my face.

                         WILL
          What do you mean?

                         DODGE
          He can talk.

                         STEWART
          That's impossible.

                         DODGE
          Then he must have a voicebox in his
          ass, because I heard him!
          Caesar walks up.
           Will steels himself, feels in his pocket - the POISONED
          COOKIE is ready.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         WILL
          Caesar - people are coming. People
          with guns. You've got to make the
          apes go back in their cages.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Apes no belong in cage. Human put
          apes in cage.
          Will's heart sinks as he sees that Caesar is intransigent.
          He means what he's saying.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)

                         (SIGNING)
          Never again.
          Will takes a moment, DIGS DEEP TO MAKE HIMSELF DO WHAT MUST

          BE DONE.
          Finally he brings the POISONED COOKIE from his pocket, holds
          it out.

                         WILL
          I brought this for you.
          Caesar eyes the cookie but doesn't take it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (it's killing him)
          Don't you want it?

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Never.
          They look at each other. Two creatures once so close, but
          now with a vast chasm between them.

                         WILL
          You went to the lab last night. I
          know it was you.
          Caesar doesn't deny it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (emotion spilling over)
          How could you kill that man,
          Caesar? Once you kill you can't it
          back - that man's gone forever.

          WILL SEES A GENUINE LOOK OF BEWILDERMENT CROSS CAESAR'S FACE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          It gives him pause.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Caesar no kill.

                         WILL
          But...

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Caesar no kill!
          Caesar SLAPS the COOKIE from Will's hand.
           Rocket immediately comes over to stand by Caesar, but Caesar
          doesn't want to fight. He's done - disgusted - with Will.
          He turns, begins to walk off.

                         WILL
          Don't walk away. We need to talk.

          CORNELIA FALLS IN STEP WITH CAESAR, BUT PAUSES TO SNIFF AT

          THE COOKIE ON THE GROUND.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Don't - !

          TOO LATE - SHE GOBBLES IT UP.

          FOR GOOD MEASURE, ROCKET GIVES THE BARS A THREATENING SHAKE,

          AND THAT'S WHEN WILL SEES IT: KOBA'S RED WRISTBAND WRAPPED

          AROUND KOBA'S ARM.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (SHOCKED)
          Where'd he get that wristband,
          Caesar? That's Koba's band...

                         (REALIZING)
          Did Koba get out of his cage??
           Yelling after Caesar.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Caesar wait!
           But Caesar's not waiting.

           EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

           Caesar climbs onto the open tailgate of a pick-up truck.
          â€¢ Apes gather around, expectant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         CAESAR

                         (VOICE STRAINING)
          No.
          At the sound of Caesar's voice, the apes rise tall.
          FROM THE CHIMPANZEE HOUSE Will and Stewart watch, stunned.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          C...Cage!
          The humans' jaws drop, petrified.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)

          NO CAGE! NO MORE'.

          CAESAR FIERCELY POUNDS HIS CHEST. EXACTLY LIKE ALPHA.

          THE APES SHRIEK TO HEAVEN.
          BEAT OF JUNGLE DRUMS as CAESAR BOLTS FROM THE TRUCK BED.

          APES RACE TO FOLLOW HIM OFF THE RANCH.
          Will - and the other humans - are blown away.

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          The pack of apes, led by Caesar, emerges from the ranch gate
          and moves out over the countryside.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          ANIMAL CONTROL, AMBULANCE, POLICE VEHICLES stream onto the
          ranch.

                         VOICE
          They could be spread out all over
          the County by now.
          Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER
          HUFFS. Dodge, Rodney, and Landon huddle nearby.

                         WILL
          No - they'll stick together.

                         DODGE

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          They're following one ape. You
          kill him, you stop them all.

                         HUFFS
          There's a leader?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         DODGE

                         (POINTING)
          Ask him - he raised him.
          All eyes to Will.

                         WILL
          His name is Caesar. If I can
          reason with him, I know I can put
          an end to this.

                         HUFFS
          Reason with him?
          Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad
          car. Will follows, Stewart on his heel.

                         WILL
          You don't understand - this chimp
          is smart - he'll listen to me

                         HUFF
          (to nearby JUNIOR OFFICER)
          Get on the horn with every agency
          you can think of! We've got to
          track down these monkeys before
          they do major damage!
          The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge
          follows.

                         DODGE
          You need me riding with you. I've
          got experience with these animals.
          (eye on Will)
          I can point out the one you want.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DAY

          An AMBULANCE pulling away. Two POLICE CARS out front.
          Jacobs stands talking with a couple of POLICE OFFICERS.

                         OFFICER
          (handing Jacobs a card)
          If you think of anything else, this
          is where I can be reached -
          A RUMBLING SOUND from behind.
          They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way.
          Shocked, they leap out of the way as best they can.

                         Â€¢
          The apes STAMPEDE past them and SWARM INTO THE LAB.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

          Caesar and his chimps BURST THROUGH THE DOOR.
          No time is wasted. Cages are opened, LAB CHIMPS liberated.
          Koba steps from his cage slowly, measuring the situation as
          apes around him go crazy.

          EXT. LAB - DAY

          A stunned officer gets to his squad car walkie-talkie.

                         OFFICER
          We have a situation at Gen-Sys
          Laboratory! Approximately two
          dozen apes, gorillas, I don't know
          what the hell they are -
          AUDIBLE CHAOS from inside the lab. YELLING, SCREAMING,

          DESTRUCTION.

          INT. MOVING SQUAD CAR - DAY

          Huffs drives - Will in the front, Stewart in back. They can
          hear everything through the radio.

                         WILL
          The lab.

                         HUFFS
          You know anything about this?

                         WILL
          That's where I work.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE/TREATMENT ROOMS- DAY

          ANARCHY OF MOVEMENT, BLURS of BLACK FUR running amok through
          white rooms, tearing everything up.
          EMPLOYEES SCATTER - running for the exits. Some duck behind
          desks.

          ANGLE ON REFRIGERATED CANISTERS OF 113.
          Like everything else in the lab, torn down, stomped on,
          thrown against the wall.
          Caesar and Buck walk through the lab, eyeing the destruction.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          EXT. LAB - DAY

          Jacobs, a Security Guard and the two Officers are huddled
          behind a squad car. Other Employees are hiding and watching
          from the safety of the parking lot. They suddenly realize
          that everything has GONE SILENT.
          A moment later, LAB DOORS FLY OPEN.

                         OFFICER #1
          Here they come!

          A MASS OF PRIMATES BARREL TOWARD THEM.

                         OFFICER #2
          There's more of them!

                         JACOBS

                         (REALIZING)
          Those are my chimps...
          They duck as the apes run by - some of them right up and over
          the car they're crouched behind.
           BAM! BAM! BAM! as the chimp's hit and leapfrog over the squad
          car - and their heads.
          The apes stampede across the parking lot, where several use
          Jacobs' BLACK JAGUAR to VAULT OVER THE FENCE.
          The last is BUCK, whose weight CRUSHES the car.
          And then they're gone. Every last one of them.
          Quiet now, except for CAR ALARMS.

          INT. LAB - DAY

          Jacobs enters the lab. In front of him is utter silence and
          devastation. Like the morning after a huge, destructive
          party.
          Out of the quiet there's the PADDING SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON

          BROKEN GLASS.
          Jacobs freezes.
          KOBA APPEARS from around a doorway. He and Jacobs look at
          each other for a long moment.
           Then Koba calmly walks past him.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Once outside Koba GALLOPS OFF. Jacobs can see him through
          the open doorway disappearing in the direction of the others
          Jacobs takes a stumbling step backwards, KICKING SOMETHING

          THAT GOES LOUDLY ROLLING ALONG THE CEMENT FLOOR.

          IT'S A CRUMPLED CANISTER OF ADENOVIRUS 113. THE NOZZLE'S

          BROKEN OFF.

          EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

          Four HELICOPTERS wait. Hoff s, Will and Stewart climb into
          one of them.

          INT. ASCENDING HELICOPTER - DAY


                         HOFFS
          Any idea where they're headed?
          Will sees Dodge joining SHARPSHOOTERS in another helicopter
          below. He doesn't like it.

                         WILL
          No.

                         HOFFS
          They were seen heading north from
          the lab - let's start with that.

          EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

          A hillside park overlooking San Francisco bay. THICK FOG
          moving in.
          KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures.
          A LITTLE GIRL plays in a sandbox. Her MOTHER reads on a
          bench nearby. The Girl looks up, claps her hands.

                         GIRL
          Monkey!
          OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then
          another. And another.

          REVEAL THREE DOZEN APES EMERGING FROM THE FOG, MAKING THEIR

          WAY DOWN THE SLOPE.
          suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure.

          PEOPLE START TO NOTICE - GRAB THEIR KIDS.
          The Mother looks up from her book. SOMEONE SCREAMS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         GIRL (CONT'D)
          Mommy?
          The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't
          get to her.

                         MOTHER
          April!
          Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up
          and puts her down out of harm's way.
          Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where
          he's going.
          SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Fog rolls in off the bay. Will's strapped into his seat,
          looking down at the city below.

                         HUFFS
          You see them?

                         WILL
          No, I can't see -

                          STEWART
          Oh my god.
          Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW:
          it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl -
          chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along
          parallel streets...
          She realizes something.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I know where they're going.

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY


          A SIGN: THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOO.
          FAMILIES. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors.
          The fun is interrupted by the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS sweeping
          low overhead. Faces turn skyward...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          A moment later, Caesar and his apes RUMBLE IN. Chaos.
          PEOPLE scatter. SCREAM.
          Released balloons float lazily upward.

          INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY

          Will watches Caesar moving the apes down the zoo's pathways,
          dodging people, jumping over benches.

                         WILL
          He's going to release the apes.
          Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off -
          but hesitate.
          The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS.

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

          As the apes pass other enclosures, the ANIMALS GO NUTS.
          Lions ROAR. Giraffes run back and forth.

          INT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO/APE ENCLOSURE - DAY


                         WRANGLER
          What the hell am I supposed to do
          when they get here?!
          An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape
          Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know
          something's coming.
          Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers,
          turns to see Caesar and his apes.
          Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth.
          The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys.

          SOUND OF BOLTS AND LOCKS CLICKING OPEN.

           INT./EXT. APE ENCLOSURE/ZOO - DAY

          All kinds of apes - Chimps, Orangutans, Gorillas - rush from
           their separate enclosures.
           Caesar's apes are waiting for them.
           Caesar makes eye contact with the GRIZZLED OLD MALE
          CHIMPANZEE. Then - as a unit - they all run for the exit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          By now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY.
          Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some
          News Crews.

          INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY

          Apes are visible streaming from the zoo and emptying onto the
          street.

                         DODGE
          That's him! The one with the white

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - DAY

          Apes leap over cars, run in and out of traffic. PEDESTRIANS
          take cover.
          SNIPER FIRE RINGS OUT from helicopters above - an APE FALLS.
          Caesar's leading, running alongside Cornelia. She falters.
          Caesar slows with her, concerned.
          SHE LOOKS ILL. But Cornelia digs deep and picks up her
          speed.
          Caesar continues on.

          INT. HELICOPTER- DAY

          Will's plastered to the window, anxiously watching Caesar's
          progress.
          Below, the BLACK LOCUST that is the pack of apes has grown
          larger, but they stay together, moving implacably North
          through the San Francisco streets.
          Up ahead, the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE COMES INTO VIEW - majestic,
          shimmering in the afternoon light.
          And Will realizes the moment he sees it.

                         WILL
          They're going to Muir Woods.
          (turning to Huffs)
          I'm sure of it. He doesn't want to
          hurt anyone - he's just trying to

          The apes arrive at the shadow of the great bridge - a
          stampeding phalanx with Caesar at the lead.
          But Cornelia can't keep up any more. Losing her balance, she
          stumbles, falls.
          Caesar rushes to Cornelia's side. By the time he reaches
          her, she's dead - a WHITE FOAM has formed at her lips.
          She's been poisoned.

          He looks up as one of the HELICOPTERS BUZZES LOW - HE SEES

          WILL. THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT.
          Caesar struggles to his feet with Cornelia in his arms - he's
          going to carry her across the bridge.
          Other helicopters BUZZ low, SHOTS RING OUT, SIRENS CLOSE IN.
          Apes take cover around trees and structures, but they're

          TRAFFIC slams to a halt.
          PEOPLE are STUNNED as chimps, gorillas, orangutans VAULT OVER
          THEIR CARS, run down the middle of the traffic - stampeding
          across the bridge.
          Helicopters BUZZ around like flies - SHARPSHOOTERS unable to
          get a safe shot.

          AT THE NORTH END OF THE BRIDGE
          Blocked off by CHP, all traffic stopped.
          A few helicopters touch down - SHARPSHOOTERS jump out, rifles
          ready, and follow on foot behind SQUAD CARS, FOUR ACROSS,

          THAT SLOWLY DRIVE ACROSS THE BRIDGE - TOWARD THE APES.

          DODGE IS AMONG THEM.

          AT THE SOUTH END OF THE BRIDGE
          Caesar and his apes race forward.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Will and Stewart watch from above as the apes stream
          Northward, over and around stopped cars.

                         HUFFS

                         (INTO HEADSET)
          Tell them to hold their fire until
          they get past the traffic!
          WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a
          place on the bridge where there are no more cars.
          Then they'll be open season.
           Then HE SEES the FOUR SQUAD CARS slowly approaching from the
          north end of the bridge, SHARPSHOOTERS - and DODGE - on foot
          behind them.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          Caesar looks ahead - realizes that he's at the end of the
          bridge traffic.
          Ahead is empty roadway. And the slowly approaching squad
          cars.
          He looks up at the helicopters, rifles at the ready.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          He sees the FOG, swirling in and out of the SUSPENSION

          CABLES.
          Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE.
          Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and
          swirls hundreds of feet below.
          Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing,
          taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him.
          Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car
          with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps.
          Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into
          the fog. Rocket's right behind.
          The remaining apes follow.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          From the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army.
          Chimps ascend cables, disappearing in and out of patches of
          fog.
          Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck.
          And Buck with his gorilla, take refuge in the stalled
          traffic.

          BELOW THE BRIDGE
          Maurice finds bars and support beams. He and the below-deck
          apes begin swinging their way toward the.north end.

                         ABOVE BRIDGE
          Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at
          the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top.
          They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND

          SWIRLING, CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM.
          A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT.
          A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH. It's a long fall, until - SPLASH
          the chimp hits the water.
          They keep moving.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The
          Sharpshooters line up their rifles, ready to shoot.

          DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND

          LOADS.
          They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the
          apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them.
          BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.
          Another chimp falls to its death.
          Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
          of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's
          practically zero.

          NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM

          IN THE FOG.

                         OFFICER
          They're all around us!
          Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH -

          WHOOSH...
          DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful
          of some visibility.
          That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG,

          CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE.

          WITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK.
          There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through
          the fog.
          He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main
          cable.
          ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE
          AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar.
          Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES

          CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL.

          ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR

          UP.
          Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO

          THE MAIN CABLE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          BAM!
          Rocket's hit in the back!
          He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE

          BRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH.
          Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again.
          But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON

          THE BRIDGE.
          The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD

          THE BARRICADE.
          Like a freight train of menacing power.
          Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to
          back up.
          A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming.
          And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade --
          MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in.
          Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.

          BELOW THE BRIDGE
          Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle
          waged above is audible.
          He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge.

                         AERIAL VIEW
          As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON

          CABLES, APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, AND

          APES SCAMPERING BELOW.
          Vanquishing the humans.

          ON THE BRIDGE

          THE GORILLAS RUN UP, OVER THE BARRICADE, CRUSHING GUNS AND

          CARS.

          BUCK'S EYES ARE ON ONE THING.

          DODGE.
          Terrified but refusing to run, Dodge fires, reloads, fires

                         Â€¢
          again, his face red with the tension of what's to come.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          BUCK ARRIVES AT DODGE, PUTS HIS HUGE HANDS ON DODGE'S BODY,

          PICKS HIM UP, AND THROWS HIM OFF THE BRIDGE.
          Dodge's body twirls through the air -

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Will, Stewart and Huffs watch, dumbstruck, as DODGE'S BODY

          HITS THE WATER.
          Below, the victorious ape army finishes off the battle of the
          bridge and follows Caesar through the north exit...
          .disappearing into the dense park.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS PARK/PARKING LOT - DUSK

          POLICE REINFORCEMENTS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES arrive.
          HELICOPTERS above.
          Will's helicopter has set down. He and Stewart stand near an
          ASSEMBLING ARMY -- an amalgamation of 'human special forces.'
          Huffs and a small GROUP OF OFFICERS debate nearby.

                         OFFICER #1
          We can't gas the forest! The
          slightest wind would take it over
          to Tiburon.

                         OFFICER #2
          Well it'll take us months to find
          them in there.

                         OFFICER #3
          Not to mention rounding them all
          up.
          Will approaches the group.

                         WILL
          I know where they are.
          The Officers look at him. Who the hell is this guy?
          Huffs - embarrassed - gestures toward Will.

                         HUFFS
          This man owns one of the chimps.

                         (BEAT)
          The so-called "leader". Says he
          can reason him out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         WILL
          His name is Caesar. I think he'll
          listen to me. If he comes out, the
          other apes will follow.
          Sounds pretty far-fetched.

                         OFFICER #1
          You think you know where to find
          this monkey?
          Will starts to correct him - lets it go.

                         WILL
          I do. I used to bring him here.
          The Officers look at each other.

                         OFFICER #1
          We don't have a lot of options.
          Let's give it a try.

                         WILL
          But you have to promise me - if I
          can get them out, you'll take them
          peacefully. Tranquilize them, cage
          them. No killing.
          Beat.

                         HUFFS
          Whatever it takes.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS/EDGE OF FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

          Will and Stewart stand at the edge of the woods. They're at
          the path Caesar and Will used to take.
          She's terrified, trying to mask it.

                         WILL
          You think this is a bad idea?

                         STEWART
          Definitely.
          He thought so.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          He's never going to agree to come
          out with you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         WILL
          I know. Got to try, right? I owe
          him that much.
          Will kisses her. Heads off down the path. Then he pauses,
          turns to look at her.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (YELLING BACK)
          Think he'll forgive me?

                         STEWART
          (can't quite hear him)
          What?
          Will waves it off - never mind.
           Stewart watches him walk down the trail... and disappear into
          the woods.

          EXT. DEEP WOODS - DUSK

           Will walks. FLASH OF BLACK up ahead. His pulse quickens -
          he follows it.
          CRACKLING of BRANCHES.
          More BLACK, swinging through the trees. Is it Caesar?
          Will follows.

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

          Will enters the clearing.
          He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the
          CANOPY that Caesar always loved.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS/PARKING LOT - DUSK

          Huffs stands looking at his watch. He looks up, turns to an

          ASSEMBLED GROUP OF ARMED MEN.

                         HUFFS
          Follow me.
          Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S

          DIRECTION, GUNS READY.

                         STEWART
          Hang on a second...
          (to nearest Officer)
          Where are they going?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Looks are exchanged. Someone grabs Stewart, who struggles
          with all her might.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)

          WHERE ARE THEY GOING?!

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

          Quiet here. Will heads toward the Grove of Trees.

                         WILL
          Caesar! ...
          He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN

          FRONT OF HIM.

          IT'S KOBA.
          Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his
          neck.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You.
          Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will.
          He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of
          this... He walks towards will, bares his teeth.
          Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him
          away.

          ENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST

          STARES HIM DOWN.

          KOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS.
          Which leaves just Will and Caesar.

                         CAESAR
          Humans coming.

                         WILL
          No. I'm alone.
          Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I owe you an apology.

                         CAESAR
          Will want Caesar dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         WILL
          I thought you had killed a man.
          But I should have known better.
          Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's
          thinking.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I want you to know that all of this
          is my fault. My responsibility.

                         (BEAT)
          Can you forgive me?
          BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path.
          Will realizes he's been betrayed.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)
          Wait - no -

                         CAESAR
          Will leave.

                         WILL
          I won't -

                         CAESAR
          Will leave now.

                         WILL
          No. I'm staying with you.
          Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down.
          At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing.
          Huffs takes aim at Caesar.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

          NO!

          HE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER. THE BLAST

          OF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST'S SILENCE.

          AT THAT SAME MOMENT APES DROP FROM THE TREES -- IT'S AN AMBUSH
          - a COUNTERATTACK.
          Huffs and his men are taken by surprise. SHOTS are fired,
          but not fast enough.

          UNLIKE ALPHA'S BATTLE IN THE AFRICA, IT'S A SLAUGHTER IN THE

          APES' FAVOR.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          AS THE APES MAUL THE MEN, CAESAR CARRIES WILL THROUGH THE

          CARNAGE.

          EXT. WOODS - DUSK

          Caesar lays Will out on the forest floor. There's a lot of
          blood.
          Will tries to speak. He looks up at Caesar.
          Caesar takes him in his arms, cradles him with love.
          Will looks into Caesar's green eyes. He relaxes. Lets go.
          Then the life passes out of him.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DUSK

          Stewart sits in the back of a locked Police Car, looking out
          at the forest in the gathering darkness.
          All is quiet.
          The forest is vast, dark, green. Impenetrable.

          HONK OF A HORN.

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          Hunsiker - Will's neighbor - exits his house with a small
          rolling suitcase. He's wearing his pilot's uniform.

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Hunsiker enters, settles into the seat.

                          TAXI DRIVER
           Where to, my man?
          It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT

          GAVE JACOBS A RIDE HOME.

                         HUNSIKER
          SFO. International terminal.

                         TAXI DRIVER
          You got it.
          The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his
          forehead - he doesn't look too good.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

          INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON WHEELS TURNING. Hunsiker pulls his suitcase on
          wheels through the airport terminal.
          It's teeming with TRAVELERS. Holding on to the bannister,
          Hunsiker takes the escalator up.

          INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

          Hunsiker says hello to the FLIGHT STAFF and moves to the
          front of the plane.

          INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

          Hunsiker shakes hands with his CO-PILOT and sits. He flicks
          a switch.

          EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

          The airplane takes off into the sky.

          NEWSCASTER VOICE #1 (O.S.)
          As the ape search continues, a
          virulent flu strain has exploded in
          and around San Francisco, sending
          shock waves and panic throughout
          the community.

          EXT. CLEARING - DAY

          We move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy
          of trees. As we get closer, we notice flashes of movement.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #2
          Authorities suspect the origin of
          the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys
          Laboratories - the same private
          company from which several
          laboratory chimpanzees escaped
          earlier this week -
          We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see
          it's filled with apes - chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas.
          We keep pushing in, closer and closer to the trees. As we
          move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK. MAURICE. AND, SITTING

          APART FROM THE OTHERS... KOBA.
          All of them have eyes in varying shades of GREEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #3
          As the death toll rapidly rises,
          Hospitals are desperately trying to
          meet the growing demand...
          Caesar sits alone, staring straight at us.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #4

                         (INCREASINGLY DESPERATE)
          Although isolated in the western
          region of the country, the numbers
          are catastrophic and quickly
          rising...
          Push in on CAESAR'S FACE.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #5
          Efforts to quarantine appear to
          have failed. The strain has been
          spotted as far away as Singapore
          and Australia...

          CLOSER AND CLOSER ON CAESAR'S FACE.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #6

                         (RAGGED)
          Casualties have reached apocalyptic
          levels. Authorities urge you to
          stay inside your homes...

                         (LONG BEAT)
          For those of you who can hear me, I
          say...

                         (VOICE BREAKING)
          God's speed and so long to you all.
          The NEWSCASTER'S VOICE is replaced by the WHITE NOISE OF A

          SNOWY TELEVISION SET.

          CAESAR'S EYES FILL THE SCREEN.
