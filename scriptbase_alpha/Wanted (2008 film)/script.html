<b>                                                      12/1/2005         
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          FADE IN:
</b>          CLOSE ON the face of WESLEY GIBSON, 25, STARING AT THE.

<b>          CAMERA.
</b>
<b>          WESLEY (V.O.)
</b>          Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and
          pathetic.
          His wry smile gives way to...
          Black. And then...

<b>          INT. APPLEBY'S - DAY
</b>
          The CAMERA STARTS FROM THE CEILING, pointing straight
          down, overlooking a table of twenty-five people dressed
          in business casual, pretending to have a good time at
          lunch in. this cookie-cutter crappy restaurant.
          At the end of the table, a bowl of spinach dip is in.
          front of Wesley,'and the CAMERA STARTS descending
          directly for it, slowly, as we hear...

<b>          WESLEY (V.O.)
</b>          It was Rochelle's birthday, which meant
          there was a certain amount of inter-
          office pressure to go to Appleby's and
          sit at a table of twenty-five with my
          boss Janice presiding at the head even
          though she's too tight to pick up the
          bill. Which meant, the poor bastard
          waiting on us had to split the check
          twenty-four ways -- everyone contributing
          to Rochelle's free meal -- surf and turf,
          no less -- don't do us any favors,
          Rochelle. Anyway, I ate a plate of
          extreme nachos and then polished off a
          bowlful of spinach dip pretty much single-
          handedly...
          The CAMERA DISAPPEARS in the bowl of spinach dip and
          we...

<b>          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. WESLEY'S CUBICLE - DAY
</b>
          .where Wesley drops his head down on his desk.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          2.
</b>
<b>          WESLEY
</b>          .so by the time I got back to my
          cubicle, my eyelids were so damn heavy, I
          had to put my head down, even if it was
          just for a wink.

<b>          SMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</b>
          A sharply dressed man, MR. X, wearing a dark .Armani suit,
          enters a skyscraper through the lobby. He's a shade
          taller than most of the office workers who are coming and
          going.

<b>          INT. LOBBY - DAY
</b>
          He heads to an elevator and presses a button for the top
          floor.
          And as his finger presses the button, just where the
          thumb meets the forefinger, we see a TATTOO of a three-
          headed dog.
          Soon...

<b>          INT. TOP FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
          .the doors open again and he finds himself in an
          opulent corridor -- sleek and expensively designed.
          Only one office is at the end of the hall.
          Expressionless, he makes his way toward it. Without
          knocking, he steps inside...

<b>          INT. PUJA'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          .an office fit for a king. Or a queen. Because behind
          a glass desk sits a beautiful Indian woman dressed
          traditionally in a serape, with a red bindi on her
          forehead, the holy third eye. Her name is PUJA.
          Mr. X sits in the single chair opposite her.
          After a moment, Puja looks up.

<b>          PUJA
</b>          I didn't expect for you yourself to come.
          One of the heads, in the flesh.

<b>          MR. X
</b>          You're an important fence.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>
<b>          PUJA
</b>          I'm flattered.
          She reaches over to an attachâ‚¬ case and removes a file.

<b>          PUJA (CONT'D)
</b>          The name of the target is Henry Helms.
          Carrying the file, she moves around the desk and stands a
          few feet away from Mr. X, who rises so that they are both
          standing. She really is quite beautiful, exotic even,.
          with piercing eyes.

<b>          PUJA (CONT'D)
</b>          He's a journalist who stumbled on to a
          story exposing a lot of powerful people,
          people who don't like having their power
          threatened.
          MR. x
          Poor Helms.

<b>          PUJA
</b>          There.have been five attempts on his
          life, but he has been well protected...
          and well hidden. Turns out his wife's
          family has a lot of money. He's in town
          to accept an award.

<b>          MR. X
</b>          We'll see to it that it never makes his
          mantle.

<b>          PUJA
</b>          And for that, my clients will pay
          handsomely.
          Mr. X is looking at Puja when a curious thing happens...
          .he notices that the red bindi on he r forehead tarts
          to move a little, like a second dot is trying to emerge
          from it, like an amoeba splitting.
          It's a sh hooter's laser!
          His eyes go wide as saucers.
          MR. x

<b>          GET DOWN1!1
</b>          .but it's too late as bullets rip into her head.
          splattering everything above her eyebrows into the wet
          bar.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          4.
</b>          Mr. X crouches, drops his hands behind his back, and a.
          PAIR OF GUNS -- as technologically advanced as anything
          we've ever seen -- spring into his hands.
          The bullets .stop flying and he sprints at the window from
          which they came, smashing t rough what remains of it,
          disappearing from the demolished room...
          .all this as Puja's dead body hits the floor, blood
          seeping out of that holy third eye.

<b>          EXT. OUTSIDE THE SKYSCRAPER - FORTY FLOORS UP - DAY
</b>
          Mr. X's momentum carries him from one building to the
          next, over an alleyway, the wet-concrete shining below.
          He lands on the...

<b>          ROOF OF THE NEXT BUILDING:
</b>          ...and rolls up quickly, guns ready.
          His eyes spot FOUR MARKSMEN running and ducking for cover
          on the neighboring rooftop..
          .and on a dead sprint across the roof...
          . he spots about a CENTIMETER OF FLESH sticking out from
          around an air-conditioning vent. He fiKes the his
          left band.
          The bullet flies through the air and rockets into the
          flesh... which happens to be one of the marksmen's ears.
          The guy YELPS IN PAIN and falls back from the vent,
          exposing himself. That's all Mr. X needs, and another
          shot rings out while he's still on a dead run. THWAP!
          The bullet finds its mark in the yelping man's forehead,
          silencing him, just as...
          .Mr. X ducks behind a stairwell door.
          He pulls up his right hand and looks down the barrel of
          this pistol: built into the barrel is thin c u r
          screen. It actually shows the heat signatures of the
          three remaining marksmen, one of which is directly in
          front of him, hiding behind a small rooftop supply shed.
          A second marksmen is just on the other side of the
          stairwell. The third is on the far side of the rooftop.
          Mr. X takes another look at the heat signature of the
          marksman hiding behind the shed and he FIRES his gun...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          5.
</b>
<b>          /~,
</b>          ...then does an amazing thing: in the split second that
          the bullet travels forward, he jerks his gun to the
          side... actually steering the bullet around the wall and
          into the ksman's throat.
          Before the guy's blood hits the ground, the assassin is
          moving again: he dashes away from the stairwell then
          makes two incredible shots; one knocks a piece of
          aluminum off the top of the stairwell...
          ..which causes it to flip up in the air above the head
          of the hiding marksman...
          . the second shot strikes the aluminum again, ,,..,sending
          the bullet ricocheting down into the ton of the
          marksman's heads As he falls...
          THE CAMERA MOVES OVER TO WHERE... the FINAL MARKSMAN is
          breathing hard, like an engine with a chronic misfire, as
          he looks out at the dead bodies of his fallen comrades...
          all chopped down in a matter of seconds.
          He squeezes his eyes shut, trying to psyche himself up...

<b>          LAST MARKSMAN
</b>
<b>          (SOFTLY)
</b>          C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
          He looks out at the stairwell door... and all is quiet.
          Maybe Mr. X didn't know he was there, maybe he left,
          maybe the last marksman can sneak away after all.

<b>          LAST MARKSMEN
</b>
<b>          (SOFTLY)
</b>          Okay... okay...
          He finally decides...
          .and takes one step forward...
          THWAP1!1 A bullet disintegrates his knee.
          He falls, clutching the knee in agony, as Mr. X walks
          toward him slowly until he stands right over him like a
          hunter over his prey.
          Mr. X's shoe comes down on the final marksman's wrist,
          pinning it away from his dropped weapon.

<b>          MR. X
</b>
<b>          (GROWLS)
</b>          Who sent you?

</b>
<b>          6.
</b>          For a moment, we're not sure the last marksman's going.to
          answer. Then...

<b>          LAST MARKSMEN

          Kroger's aisles: ox. She's wearing barely enough
          clothing to cover her tight body.

          With that, she walks toward the end of the aisle, eyes
          scanning the whole time.
          Stunned, all Wesley can do is watch her walk.
          on the sMll f her back is a tatt It'
          tattoo we saw in the be i n n : a thKee-head2d dog.
          She gets to the end and catches him looking at her.
          Then she makes a very subtle gesture with her head... as
          if to say "come here."
          Wesley still isn't sure what the hell is going on.
          Sheepishly, he makes his way to where she stands.
          She leans in close, her lips just inches from his ear.

          She screams this, grabbing Wesley's wrist and jerking him
          forward, just as Cross comes back up, firing, a killing
          machine.
          They barely get out of the way, as the pasta aisle
          explodes in an avalanche of bullets! Glass bottles of
          spaghetti sauce shatter, turning the aisle into a
          rainstorm of red droplets -- we're not sure what is sauce
          and what is blood.
          Then... Cross springs on to a display stand of tortillas
          and up to the top of the freezer section, so he can have
          a better angle of attack at the fleeing Fox and Wesley.
          He starts sprinting down the top of the freezer section,
          smashing over styrofoam coolers, as his bullets barely
          miss Fox and Wesley, but slam into the freezers behind
          them, sending ice and glass exploding everywhere.

          Wham! Wesley turns the ignition, pope the clutch, and
          smashes the gas pedal as the car nearly snaps his neck
          when it launches forward.
          He races through the gears and rips around a corner and

          hard right, where it bounces off a Fed Extrugk.,,, hat
          sends it into a violent roll.
          Wesley guns the Ferrari at the tumbling truck as it flips

          The CAMERA SHOOTS WAY UP to give us an aerial view of the
          neighborhood. We see that we are in the hills over the
          city, and across the canyon, a Japanese man is just
          pulling into his driveway, driving a black Audi, a mile
          away.
          He brakes his car, opens his door, but THWAPI A bullet
          disintegrates his head and he topples over, never knowing
          what hit him.
          Back at the hole in the hedge, we see the Gardener's
          eyeball looking through from the other side... until it
          disappears and he is gone.

          EXPLODES, causing him to flop on the sidewalk, like he

          They stand in a dark corner of a decrepit morgue, where a
          couple of urns rest on a counter. The place doesn't look
          like much more than a crack-house.

</b>          We cremate our dead. I'd like to say
          it's to honor them, but it's mainly to
          keep anyone from identifying them after
          they're gone.

          He runs his finger over it, and just when we think he's
          going to have an emotional moment...'
          ..he smashes the urn on to the stand, the ashes spilling
          out everywhere.
          Wesley runs his fingers through the decay: what a

          cremains.
          But then hisfingegs find something in the dust... a
          BULLET with a hole running down its center. He holds it
          up to the light for a closer look.

</b>          Wesley site with his hands tied behind his back, taking
          another beating from The Pharmacist, who spouts
          assassination techniques while he pummels Wesley.

<b>          THE PHARMACIST
</b>          If you get in the hoo-ha of a two on one

</b>          The sound of the Pharmacist's voice fades to the
          background as Wesley's voice-over comes up...

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          There are two kinds of pain. One is an
          object. A living thing that crawls
          around the outside of your body. Cuts,
          broken bones, bruises... all deliver the
          kind of pain you can learn to ignore, and
          they soon disappear to nothing but the
          sound of a gnat in your ear.
          Wesley's eyes are starting to lose consciousness.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          I've lived with a different kind of pain
          all my life... the kind that comes from
          two decades of being passed over, pushed
          around, ignored. But you can't hide from
          that kind of pain either...
          Wesley takes a brutal shot to the face.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          .because it finds you.
          He involuntarily spite blood as his eyes roll back in his
          head.

<b>          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Sloan sits across from Wesley at a skinny table in an
          otherwise bare room.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Watch the eyes. Look for a slight
          swelling of the pupil. You can train
          your body to stay a constant temperature,
          you can control your heartbeat, but you
          can't control the center of your eyes.
          That's how you know when someone is lying
          to you.
          Sloan looks right at him. Wesley narrows his eyes,
          trying to fend off his stare.

<b>          SLOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you want to fuck Fox?

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          I know that's a lie without even seeing
          your eyes.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Fine. Try something else.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Okay. What are you hiding from me?
          Wesley looks down, then focuses on Sloan.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Nothing.
          Sloan waits. Wesley realizes it's useless to try to keep
          something from this man. He reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out the bullet with the hole in its center...
          places it on the table.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          You told me to hunt down my father's
          killer. That's what I'm doing.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          What's this?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          The bullet that killed him. You said his
          heart stopped but there was no entrance
          wound. This bullet has a hole cut into
          its center...

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Yes?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          You know how a mole buries into the earth
          by pushing the dirt back around it? I
          think this bullet does what the mole
          does... Splits the skin and pushes it
          back through its center, filling the
          space it just passed through.
          Sloan looks at him, like he might have been
          underestimating him until now.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Fox was telling me that my father used
          special bullets. It looks like Cross
          does too... which means these are custom
          made. If we find who makes them, then we
          find someone who has access to Cross.

</b>          Sloan picks up the bullet and leans back.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          You put this all together on your own?
          Wesley taps his head.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Firing neurons.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          Whatever happened to my father's guns?
          The pearl handled ones?

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Don't know. But whoever has them isn't
          long for this place.
          Sloan reaches down and picks up a binder which he drops
          on the desk.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          What's that?

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Cross. The details of his life.
          q Continue your hunt.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          No rules, right?
          This stops Sloan for a second.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          No rules.

<b>          INT. FOX'S PENTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
          Wesley lies on Fox's couch, trying his damndest not to
          peek at her through her bedroom door. It's cracked just
          enough that he can see her draping a towel around her
          body as she heads to take a shower.
          Wesley site up and looks at the binder sitting on the
          table. Slowly he opens it and sees a picture of Cross
          staring back at him. The man who took Wesley's father
          from him.
          Wesley studies the face, wanting to know every detail.

          absorb more of Cross with every page.

          Sloan leads Wesley into a gigantic room lined from floor
          to ceiling with leather-bound books.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          We keep a record of every assassination
          mission, going back to the Ides of March.
          Maps, diagrams, logistics, complications,
          weapons of choice... it's all there.
          Wesley nods, impressed. Sloan just keeps leading him
          through a set of double doors, into...

<b>          INT. MAP ROOM -- DAY
</b>
          .a large room, the size of an auditorium. On the floor
          is a gigantic model of the entire city, built to scale,
          showing all the buildings, skyscrapers, churches, the
          waterfront, the city streets. Everything the city has to
          offer laid out in miniature.
          Sloan and Wesley stand like giants in the middle of the
          model city...

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          What's all this?

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Where we plot our local hits. This city
          is one of the Fraternity's major
          headquarters.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          (looking around)
          This room. The books. Seems low-tech.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Part of mastering technology is knowing
          when to use it. Models can't be hacked.
          Your father built this room himself.
          Most of the buildings are white, but interspersed amongst
          them are a few vainted red. Some of the model street
          lamps are also red.

</b>          The color red appears sporadically throughout the entire
          model city: on the sides of buildings, on mailboxes, on
          some of the manhole covers.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          What's with the red ones?
          Sloan just smiles...
          .and THE CAMERA MOVES TO HIS FEET, then PUSHES'IN on

          .the s city street, now full-sized, buzzing with
          activity, pedestrians hurrying to work, cars and taxis
          and trucks whizzing through the street.
          Sloan and Wesley walk down the sidewalk, passing
          streetlight after streetlight until they reach one in
          particular.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          The Fraternity's grasp reaches every

          including their construction. Look at
          this streetlight.
          Wesley peers at it... there is a plaque affixed to the
          pole... the standard thing you find on these things...
          "Municipal C. W. 63070."
          But then there is something different on this one... a
          tiny symbol on the bottom of the plaque... the Cerberus
          instead of the seal of the cit
          Sloan presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside,
          revealing a hollow space behind it. He reaches his hand
          inside and pulls out a small handgun... flips out the
          clip expertly, then racks the weapon.
          Wesley can't believe it.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          You have stashes...

          Sloan flashes his tattoo at them.

<b>          SLOAN

<b>          SLOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          They let us do our jobs, we let them

          Impressed, the Gunsmith moves the corpse closer to the
          target, making the angle all that much tougher.
          Wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger, but a pistol
          starts FIRING next to him.
          He looks over... Sloan is standing nr= &amp;o him, firing at
          the target. Every shot bends around the body and hits
          right in the forehead of the target.

          The Gunsmith does and we see that each of the five
          bullets has passed clean through the cadaver and found
          it's mark on the target.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          You'll find one entry below the shoulder,
          missing the major blood vessels there,
          exiting the back. Second shot went
          through the abdomen, clipped only the
          bowel and exited cleanly. Third hit the
          upper right quadrant of the abdomen,
          which is partially protected by the
          ribcage, and passed through the liver and
          probably part of the gallbladder. Upper
          left abdomen is a good place, where
          number four ruptured the spleen before
          continuing down main street. And
          finally, what I like to call "the ,7FK."
          Number five entered the mouth, was
          redirected downward by the upper jawbone
          ON, and exited the back of the neck. That's
          the shot you'll find in the middle of the
          target.
          Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the target.

          corner, narrowly cutting in front of an eighteen-wheeler,
          which has to slam on its brakes.

          left and right, some make eye contact, some don't...
          anybody could be the target..
          Wesley's eyes scan to the rooftops, surveying... the
          SECURITY GUARD by the theater, the SWEATER-FOLDER at The
          Gap, the SCARY-LOOKING GUY shopping at the sunglasses
          stand.
          And then Wesley's eyes settle on someone he was not
          expecting to see... Barry, his best friend that was
          shagging his girlfriend... is thumbing through books
          outside the BARNES AND NOBLE... seemingly. not paying
          attention to what's around him.
          Wesley can't believe it. It can't be him. Can it?
          Just then, Barry stops looking at the books and starts
          walking toward Wesley, keeping his eyes down. Fuck, this
          can't really be happening...

          .and he's looking at a man we recognize from his

          He's approaching rapidly behind Barry, fisting a 'pair of

          Just as Barry hits the deck, Wesley pulls the trigger...

          he darts behind a kiosk hocking monogrammed apparel, and
          dashes full speed through the crowds lining the street.
          The Consultant chases after him, knocking shoppers out of
          the way, sending fanny packs and Nordstrom bags flying.
          Wesley hooks a right around a SHARPER IMAGE and heads
          straight down a narrower section, like he's on a mission,
          knowing exactly where he's going. And now we see why...
          Because the city around us goes stark white like the Mg
          Room. We're seeing what Wesley sees, what he's memorized
          in all those hours staring at the model. Finally we see
          one SMALL BENCH next to a fountain, which is bright red.
          Immediately the natural color of the city c2 Ws back and
          Wesley is running all out for that bench. He goes into a
          slide, hitting the grass .underneath the bench, sliding
          under it, popping up on the other side.
          He rips a metal panel off the back of it as he does,
          revealing an AUTOMATIC PISTOL...
          .and just as quickly, he's up on one knee, aiming,
          using the bench as a shield as the Consultant rushes up,
          surprised and BAM! BAM! BAM:
          The Consultant drops where he is, three bullets hitting
          him in his two shoulders and his chest.
          People start SCREAMING and RUNNING the hell away from the
          gunplay. Wesley is about to run away himself, but when
          he turns, Fox is right there beside him... smiling. A
          couple of SECURITY GUARDS are with her, smiling as well.
          Wesley looks over at The Consultant, who site up, smiling
          too, even though he's bleeding from three spots on his

          Breathing ragged, shimmying across his work space, Pek

          They are surrounded by industrial looking warehouses, one
          of which has the words Times-Herald on it. Newspaper
          delivery TRUCKS make their way in and out of the loading
          dock area of this building.
          Overhead, an EL TRAIN scrapes along the worn tracks.
          Fox pulls around a corner and back into an alley, so they
          can have a view of the corner in front of them.
          Wesley scans the area quickly.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Not very discreet, are they?
          Fox smiles knowingly, and looks up, revealing what Wesley
          is talking about. On various rooftops we-see FIGURES

          Fox subtly moves her head and figures disappear,
          crouching down.
          Just then, out the windshield, they see a MAN wearing a
          long black overcoat approaching the corner near the
          newspaper building.
          Fox's eyes start to dance.

          Wesley nods and the two of them step out of the car.

<b>          IN THE STREET:
</b>          From a distance, Wesley approaches Cross from the back.
          His steps become quicker, getting closer every passing
          second. Wesley starts to reach in his coat for his
          gun...
          .and that's when Cross firesl Quick as lightning,
          Cross has guns out and lets loose toward the roof of a
          nearby warehouse.

</b>          His bullet has the instincts of a bird dog, and it curves
          over the edge of the building and finds its mark, causing
          a crouching ASSASSIN to plunge from the roof to the
          street near Wesley!
          The others on the rooftops hail down bullets as Cross
          disappears into the nearest building, the Times-Herald.
          Wesley and Fox run toward the building as three other
          Fraternity members beat them there, the BELLMAN, the
          WAITER, and the ELECTRICIAN.
          Wesley sees them congregate on the loading dock and then
          start inside the building...

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          No!
          The minute Bellman exposes himself in the open loading
          dock door he is cut down from inside, his bloody body
          falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the
          dock.
          Wesley and Fox join the other two on the dock as
          screaming WORKERS run from the place.

<b>          WAITER
</b>          We need a way in there.

<b>          ELECTRICIAN

          He's got the high ground.
          Wesley sees an unmanned forklift on the dock.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          On the pallet.
          They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the
          lift. Wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs
          into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching
          on the pallet on the front.

</b>          Separate.
          The lowest level is the loading dock, where pallets of
          newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await.

<b>          WITH THE ELECTRICIAN:
</b>          The Electrician hustles between the pallets and boxes,
          eyes darting, guns drawn. He backs up to a pallet of
          stacked newspapers, using it as cover. What he doesn't
          realize is that between each stack of papers is a space,
          just big enough for a --
          THWAP! A bullet finds its way through the space and hits
          the Electrician in the back of the shoulder, spinning him
          around.
          CLOSE ON: Cross' gun. Another shot and we follow the
          bullet, across the dock and dipping low into the next
          space in the paper stack -- right where Electrician is
          now leaning...
          .the bullet buries in his eye, sending him to the
          flog.
          Wesley sees Cross race for a set of stairs. Just as
          Wesley is about to cut him down, Cross fires at a wooden
          beam holding back some massive rolls of NEWSPAPER. The
          rolls tumble over and Wesley has to dive out of the way,
          allowing Cross to escape up the stairs.
          Wesley, Fox and the Waiter all race for the stairs.

<b>          ON LEVEL TWO:
</b>          Giant printing machines are running full speed, printing
          up the morning edition.
          A group of NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES see the guns the
          Fraternity members are toting and scramble for safety.
          Wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring
          machines...

          machines.

</b>          How do you know?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          It's what I'd do.
          With that, Wesley and Fox disappear amongst the
          machinery.
          The Waiter takes a step back from the press, where over a
          hundred pounds of paper spins through every second.
          He sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that
          scaffolding. Everything looks clear, until...
          ...shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o
          Waiter's head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans
          of spray lubricant falling to the floor. No big deal,
          until Cross shoots one of them out of the air, causing it
          to explode!
          The burning oil covers the Waiter, who SCREAMS and
          stumbles nearer the printing press...

<b>          BAM BAM BAM!
</b>          More shots from Cross and one of the RESTRAINING ARMS on
          the roll of paper feeding the machine breaks in half.
          The paper roll spins wildly from the machine and like a.
          saw, cuts the Waiter in hplf !
          With a leap, Cross is on the scaffolding over the
          presses. For just a second, Cross stops as he locks eyes
          with Wesley...
          ..but Fox is already firing at him so Cross has to keep
          moving...
          He heads up a second staircase, but not before he sends a
          stream of bullets back at Fox, who athletically
          cartwheels away...
          .but one of Cross's bullets disintegrates a gear on the
          press near her, sending flying metal everywhere. A piece
          of shXapnel b ies into Fox's leg... making her break out
          of her cartwheel and flop down, wounded.

          Wesley races for the stairs. He is the only one left to
          chase Cross to level three.

<b>          ON LEVEL THREE:
</b>          Wesley bursts through the door, guns ready. The place is
          already in pandemonium, with PEOPLE yelling and screaming
          and running for cover. Quickly, Wesley realizes he's in
          the business offices of the paper, and it looks
          surprisingly similar to his old office. Lame-ass
          cubicles and florescent lighting everywhere.
          Wesley jumps up on a desk.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Cross!
          Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of
          the office. Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at
          Cross... who immediately returns fire...
          .and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets
          in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take out a
          COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE.
          The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving
          over and in the cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the
          Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each
          other from sharp angles...
          Strangely,. the first bullet collision was not blind luck,
          but the pattern for the battle. They are fighting the
          same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man
          using the same techniques at the exact same time.
          Wesley needs an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the
          words "Action Items" written on it. He fires at it, and
          his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them
          strikes Cross in the shoulder... THWAP!!!
          Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to
          flinch... right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely
          avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby
          window, smashing the glass out,

          and...

<b>          OUTSIDE THE WINDOW:

<b>          THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT:
</b>          Fox limps out of the newspaper building and hurries to
          the Porsche. She ignores her wounds and rips the car out
          of the alley, chasing after the fleeing L train.

<b>          ON THE L TRAIN:
</b>          Ahead of Wesley, Cross is also on the top of the train.
          He manages to get up, spin around, and fire at Wesley...
          .but they both have to duck as the L train whips under
          an overpass, which misses smashing both of them by mere
          inches.
          Cross takes the opportunity to swing down between cars
          and enter one of the L cars.

<b>          BEHIND HIM:
</b>          Wesley hurries across the top of the train, spying the
          trail of blood that Cross is leaving behind from his
          wound.
          Wesley smiles, a shark on a wounded baby seal, as he also
          swings down between the cars and enters...

<b>          THE FIRST L CAR:
</b>          .where he sees the trail of blood leading all the way
          down the center of the empty car and out the back door.
          Wesley hovers in the entry way, his guns up and ready.
          He takes a step forward to follow the blood trail, and
          immediately, he is decked from the side by an ambushing
          Cross.
          They tumble over the first row of seats, both losing
          their guns.

          SLAMS Cross into one of the train's windows hard enough
          to crack it. With a quick twist of Cross' wrist, Wesley
          takes a sun from him Just as Cross kicks h,m off...
          .Wesley fires as he falls backwards. Cross falls
          backwards too from the momentum...
          ..and they both smash out opposite windows of the train
          before landing on either side of it!

          But the amazing thing is... they stand up and keep

          realize they. are timing their shots to actually blast
          between each car in the s it-second the opening passes.

          papers, holding on to the handrails... completely unaware

          A bullet whizzes through an open window, pierces a
          BUSINESSMAN'S paper, and exits a window on the opposite
          side of the car. The man sticks his finger through the
          hole, unaware of the battle outside. What the hell?

<b>          IN THE ALLEY:

</b>          Finally, Wesley does and his face goes slack as he sees
          himself reflected in Cross's Dupils.
          Just then, Fox pulls up in the Porsche about fifty yards
          away, and her headlights illuminate them.
          Cross shifts his eyes to her, then does a curious thing:
          he lowers his gun, then drops it to the ground. Wesley
          can't believe Cross would leave himself defenseless.
          Moving swiftly, Cross men tucks something into the
          Rocket of Wesley's hooded sweatshirt.

<b>          CROSS (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>          (WHISPERS)
</b>          Everything they told you was a lie,
          Wesley.
          With that... Cross falls down. His black jacket spills
          open to show a gun shot wound not just to his shoulder,
          but to hig n too. one of Wesley's bullets through
          the train must have found its mark.
          Cross is bleeding profusely. He gasps a couple of
          times... then, with his last bit of energy...

<b>          CROSS (CONT'D)
</b>          Find the missing piece. And... don't...
          let them... dispose of the weapon...
          With that, the life goes out of Cross's eyes.
          Wesley stares at that face, trying to decipher some
          meaning there. But Cross just stares blankly back at
          him, just as Fox comes limping up.

<b>          FOX
</b>          You did it, baby! Son of a bitch, you
          did it. You put down motherfucking
          Cross!
          Wesley looks down and sees some of Cross's blood on his
          hands from their clench. There is also some on the gun
          he is holding. ar --h d ed crun.
          Wesley reaches down and takes the other pearl-handled gun
          from where it dropped and looks over them both.

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)
</b>          What'd he say to you?
          Wesley looks up, sees some sort of anticipation in Fox's
          eyes. He looks back down at Cross's body..

          Fox measures him, like she's not sure if he's telling the
          whole story. Finally, she nods...

<b>          FOX
</b>          Well... damn, I couldn't be more proud of

<b>          FOX
</b>          You sure?
          But he's already walking off. She watches him go,
          thinking...

<b>          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
</b>
          Wesley walks down the street. PEOPLE instinctively get
          out of his way as he cuts a path down the sidewalk.
          Then he pulls out what Cross slipped inside his pocket:
          a beaten-up copy of COUNT OF ONTE CRISTO. In fact,
          there's no mistake, it's the same copy he had as a kid.
          Wesley tries to make sense of this as he opens up the
          cover... printed on the inside in a steady hand are the
          words: "I left you something."
          Wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a
          Harley at a curb. He bee-lines for the guy.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          80.
</b>
<b>          EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING
</b>
          Wesley now blazes down the highway, pushing the Harley to
          its limits. His angry expression hasn't dissipated.

<b>          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING
</b>
          The Harley pulls up to a lower-middle-class house, the
          kind you might find in any run-down suburb. Kids run
          around the neighborhood, playing.

<b>          ON THE BIKE:
</b>          Wesley sits and looks at one particular house. He climbs
          off'and heads to the side of the house, still carrying
          his book.

<b>          SIDE OF THE HOUSE:
</b>          He ducks through a broken chain-link fence and moves down
          the side of the house...
          .until he finds a familiar wooden BOARD. Familiar
          because we've seen this place before: it's where he
          lived when he was a foster kid.
          He removes the board, then reaches into the hole. His
          hand seizes on something. From the hole, he withdraws a
          KEY attached to a note with an address on it: 1850 North
          Highbury St.
          Wesley's eyes move from the copy of MONTE CRISTO, to the
          key, and back to the book.
          Finally, he lowers his hands... revealing a little eight-
          year-old kid, watching him curiously from the back yard.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Hey.

<b>          KID
</b>          Hey.

          The kid.nods .

<b>           WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>           Foster home?
          4014 The kid nods again.

</b>
<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Read this.
          He tosses the kid the book and heads off.

<b>          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
</b>
          He pulls the Harley over to a curb and then reaches into
          his jacket pocket and withdraws the note and the key.
          Across the street, the address matches: 1850 N.
          Highbury. The place looks like a concrete fortress... no
          windows, just a large-iron door in front.
          Wesley approaches, not sure what the address could mean.
          He gets to the door, looking for a key-hole, but he
          doesn't find one.
          He fidgets there awkwardly for a second, but then...
          .the door opens, revealing a woman, ANNA. She takes a
          look at Wesley and then puts a trembling hand over her
          lips.

<b>          ANNA
</b>          Come in, Wesley.
          He stares at her, trying to figure this out. He steps...

<b>          INSIDE THE HOUSE:
</b>          .and finds that the place is nicely decorated; an
          attempt to cover up what is really a reinforced bunker.
          Anna is now trying to hold back tears, but can't.

<b>          ANNA
</b>          He's dead, isn't he?
          There's no point lying to this woman...

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Yes, ma'am.
          She nods knowingly, sadly.

<b>          ANNA
</b>          He told me if he didn't come back... it
          would be you who pulled the trigger.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          âœ“ He killed my father...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          82.
</b>          Anna looks at him, confused. But then, realization sets
          in...

<b>          ANNA
</b>          I think you need to meet someone...
          she leads Wesley into another room, where a five-year-old
          boy, plays the floor.

<b>          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          Wesley. This is your brother... Andrew.
          Wesley's not sure what to make of this.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          My brother?

<b>          ANNA
</b>          Half-brother. But both of you, you are
          both 100 percent your.father's boys.
          I've seen that from the beginning.
          Andrew is busy playing with a couple of BLACK TOY
          BUILDINGS on the floor. Wesley studies the little guy,
          still confused.

<b>          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          Your father... he was with you the whole
          time.
          Wesley looks up and sees what she's referring to. The
          walls are filled with pictures of Andrew, Anna, and...
          remarkably...
          ...photoaraths of Wesley at various ages w hgn he was-
          growing u !

<b>          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          This was his favorite.
          She hands him a picture of Wesley at about age 12,
          sitting with his back to a tree, reading COUNT OF MONTE
          CRISTO. The picture has been taken through a windshield,
          across the street.
          Wesley reels, his legs give out, he slumps against one of
          the walls...
          FLASH: Cross firing at Fox and Wesley at the grocery
          store. But now we see that Fox positioned Wesley between
          herself and the shooter. He wasn't trying to hit Wesley,
          he was trying to separate him from her.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          83.
</b>          Wesley, thinking, remembering...
          FLASH: Wesley studying Cross's face in the file, seeing
          that there isn't jealousy in those eyes.
          Wesley still slumped against the wall, surrounded by
          pictures of himself...
          FLASH: Wesley reflected in Cross's pupils.
          Holy shitl!! Cross was his father!!! Wesley looks up at
          Anna's kind face...

<b>          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          When your father and I found each other,
          when we had Andrew, he said he could no
          longer live the way he had been living.
          He said he wouldn't give us up, the way
          he had given up his first eon.
          Wesley stares at the picture... he can't believe he was
          being watched back when he felt so alone.

<b>          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          It was his greatest regret.
          She leaves him in the room, alone, with his brother.
          Wesley watches the kid, trying to process it all.
          For the first time, emotions overcome him, and he breaks
          down...
          .but he's too tough now to sob, so he forces the Bob
          down in his throat and blinks back the tears. Goddamn,
          he has a brother.

<b>          IN THE KITCHEN OF THE SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
</b>          He walks up behind Anna, who is sipping some coffee at a
          kitchen table, red eyed.

<b>          ANNA
</b>          would you like some coffee?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          I'm okay.
          Wesley sets the key down on the table.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you know what this opens?

<b>          CUT TO:

<b>          84.
</b>          A LONE KEYHOLE in a solid closet door.
          Wesley sticks the key in and swings the door open
          revealing a LONG BLACK COAT, just like his father's.

<b>          ANNA
</b>          I guess it's not much of an inheritance.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>
<b>          (STEELY)
</b>          He left me more than this.
          Wesley takes the coat and folds it over his arm.

<b>          ANNA
</b>          I want you to know that he forgave you
          before you ever pulled the trigger. He
          tried to keep you out of it for so
          long...

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Why didn't he just tell me?

<b>          ANNA
</b>          once they had you... he couldn't risk it
          unless you were alone. He knew his one
          shot at telling you might be his last.
          Her eyes harden a little bit.

<b>          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          You have to finish what he was doing,
          Wesley. It's the only way any of us will
          ever be free. Especially your brother.
          They won't stop hunting us... your father
          knew that.
          Wesley nods.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          I'll be back as soon as this is over.

<b>          ANNA
</b>          You have family here.
          Wesley nods, these words meaning so much to him.

<b>          INT. KOREAN BAR-B-QUE JOINT - NIGHT
</b>
          Fox eats in a small restaurant in the heart of Koreatown,
          the kind of place that has the hot hibachi grills on the
          S table tops.

<b>

<b>

<b>          85.
</b>          The place is mostly empty, quiet, with mainly Korean
          faces both dining and serving. It's the kind of place
          where you can eat and not be bothered.
          The doors swing open and Fox looks up. The silhouette of
          e I URE IN THE DOgJLWM is disturbing, a familiar
          person in a long black coat...

<b>          FOX
</b>          Jesus.
          She squints, the setting sunlight nearly blinding her as
          all she can see is a silhouette...

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)
</b>          For a second there I thought you looked
          just like Cross.
          Wesley steps into the light and moves over to the table
          as Fox lights up a cigarette.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Skipped the hospital?

<b>          FOX
</b>          He picked me clean and I don't care much

          toward the ceiling.

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)
</b>          Sloan's on his way.
          One of the waiters waves to her to put out her smoke and
          she just stares him down. The man backs off, nodding and
          smiling.

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)

</b>          He saw it... exactly what Sloan told him to look for when
          someone is lying.
          And from the look on Fox's face, she knows he saw it.

<b>          FOX
</b>          Goddammit, Wesley...
          She stabs out her cigarette, crushing it on the hot grill
          so that it SIZZLES.

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)
</b>          Why'd you have to ask me that?
          With that, she kicks back from the table, holding a huge
          black Smith and Wesson revolver.

</b>          Wesley only has a millisecond to respond,-and he does by
          kicking over the table, which sends food and utensils
          flying, but also shields him from Fox's bullets.
          Just as quickly, Fox leaps up on top of one of the other
          tables, trying to keep her heels on the sides so that her
          feet don't touch the hot grill. If she's wounded, we
          wouldn't know it.
          Wesley does the same on a nearby table. They take shots
          at each other as they leap from table to table, avoiding
          the sizzling centers, but they're both so quick that no
          bullets find their mark.
          Then Fox takes a running leap at him, moving ferociously
          fast. She's like the animal she's named after, and she
          launches off one of the tables...
          .and catches Wesley flush, kno in him backwards, a
          form tackle on to a table...
          ..where he lands Quare on the oven top... PSSSSBHH...
          and his guns go flying across the room as...
          .the table to starts to burn through his clothes!

</b>          You shoulda known better, baby...
          But he rolls over, taking Fox with him, and now the oven-
          is burning into her back.
          With all her strength, she bucks him off and then flips
          herself backwards off the table. With another kick, she
          sends the hot table flying at him. It rips free from its
          wiring, and the nozzle sprays gas out into the
          restaurant... SSSSSSSSS...
          Wesley knocks the flying table out of the way, but not
          before it burns his arm as he blocks it.
          Spotting his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a
          hailstorm of bullets.
          But he's too damn fast, and he dives across the floor
          Pete Rose style, sliding to a stop at the precise moment
          where his hands come u holSling his weapons.

          fireball b sts from nozzle, while a great Riume of
          sweltering fire keeps pouring out!
          Fox dives to get out of the way, which gives Wesley the
          opening he was looking for. He FIRES again, and one of
          his bullets knocks her crun away and another nicks her in
          the side of the face.
          She stops, seeing the blood drip down her cheek and off
          her chin. This only seems to enrage her.
          Pissed, she produces two S R GUNS out of the small of
          her bac -- where she had them hidden we have no idea --
          and charges Wesley like an unleashed Pit Bull...

</b>          Aaaaahhhh!
          She's firing both muzzles and her bullets find the marks
          this time, knocking Wesley's guns out of his hands from
          where he lies flat on the floor.
          She's disarmed him, and now he's defenseless...
          .and Fox stands over him, breathing hard, her face
          bleeding, both gun barrels pointed right at Wesley's
          face...

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)
</b>          I gotta admit, baby...
          She starts to squeeze both the triggers...

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)
</b>          I thought we might have a future...
          But, Wesley drives a fist into her wounded leg and she
          reels...
          In the same motion, he grabs her wrists and pulls her
          toward him... taking her guns right out of her hands like
          a quick-change artist.
          Flipping them over, Fox's face full of surprise is the
          last expression she'll ever have because...

          blood mess s ra s a oss the wall.
          Wesley leans his head back and closes his eyes, the spume
          of fire flickering brightly against his lids, the events
          of the last several hours washing over him.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          There's a town in Germany called

          Hans Koblenz.

          joint.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          60 During his life, he was said to have
          killed over four hundred bears and was
          the pride of this small community on the
          Rhine. You want to know how he died? A
          pair of black bears singled out his house
          from the entire village, mauled his wife,
          killed his twin daughters, and then lied
          in wait for him to get back from the
          woods.

<b>          INT. KOREAN BAR-B-QUE JOINT - LATER
</b>
          The fire is out, but it has blackened the inside of the
          joint, so that it looks like an absolute war zone.
          Fox is in the same position as when Wesley shot her, but
          there's a sheet of paper folded on her chest.
          The Butcher and the Pharmacist flank Sloan as he
          approaches the body, frowning.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          When the hunter opened the door, they
          ripped his throat out before he could
          scream.

          proceeded to bite. each other till they
          bled to death.
          Sloan reaches down and picks up the paper, and sees
          beneath it that pearl-handled revolver. The one with the
          blood on the handle.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)

          He unfolds it, to read printed in black ink on the paper:

          Wesley moves into Andrew's roan... where the boy is still
          playing with the black model buildings.
          Wesley moves over and crouches down next to Andrew.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Can I see that for a second?
          The boy hands him the building in his hand. It is
          painted jet black, except for one corner of the first
          floor, which is painted red. Wesley looks up at Anna.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you know where he got this?

<b>          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
          Anna leads Wesley down some wooden steps into Cross's
          basement.
          Sure enough, the entire floor of the basement has been
          made into a model map, similar to the one that the
          Fraternity used in the map room, but all the buildings
          are black, with an occasional red mark.
          The scale is larger, the model shows only one section of
          the city, and a BLUE LINE indicates a route through the
          streets.
          And on the wall are PICTURES and CLIPPINGS of Henry
          Helms.
          Wesley squats over it, trying to figure out what his
          father's plan was. He sees a missing place for a
          building and puts Andrew's toy back in place, then
          studies the map some more.

</b>          Only he didn't know where on the route
          they would try and hit Helms. That's the

          with his note pad, the words "LIFE SUCKS AND THEN YOU
          DIE" printed over and over, while the consultant
          continues to rattle on and on.
          Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley spots the

          The CAMERA HOLDS ON A photograph of Helms, which...

</b>
          .where HENRY HELMS himself is tying a tie in a hotel
          mirror. He's a handsome enough guy, distinguished even,
          but he looks tired, like the weight of living under a
          death threat has dragged him down.
          A door opens, and we see his wife, SARAH HELMS, step past
          two, huge BODYGUARDS to come in.

<b>          SARAH HELMS
</b>          The car is here.

<b>          EXT. HOTEL SIDE DOOR - DAY
</b>
          A gaggle of large bodyguards surround the Helmses as they
          hurry out of a side door and make it into a LIMOUSINE.
          They notice the half dozen MOTORCYCLE COPS positioned
          around their limo.
          A LEAD BODYGUARD holds the limo door for them.

<b>          HENRY HELMS

          What's all this?

<b>          LEAD BODYGUARD
</b>          We're not taking any chances.
          He shuts the door for them before climbing behind the
          steering wheel.
          The limo starts to make its way down the drive, flanked
          in front and in back by dark SUBURBANS and the motorcycle
          cops.

<b>          EXT. RIVER - DAY

          A guy looks down at the street with his binoculars. It's
          the Gunsmith!

          Nothing yet, sir.

<b>          EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - SAME
</b>
          On another tall building, Sloan talks into a radio.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Hold until I give the word.
          He clicks off the radio and looks into his palm, where-
          e's holding that pearl handled aun, fingering the dried
          blood.

<b>          ON A CITY STREET:
</b>          The suburbans and cops flank the limo as it rolls through
          the concrete jungle.

<b>          IN THE LIMO:
</b>          The bodyguards peer up at the buildings ready for
          anything.
          Henry Helms reaches over and grabs his wife's hand, a
          reassuring gesture. But his white knuckles betray his
          trepidation.
          The driver watches as they reach a frontage road on the
          east side of the river.

<b>          ON THE ROAD:
</b>          They make a turn along the river and haul ass toward the
          bridge. Traffic is sparse and they look like they have
          an easy clear passing.

<b>          ON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP:
</b>          The Gunsmith sits, waiting patiently...

<b>          ON ANOTHER ROOFTOP:

</b>          (into the radio)
          Here comes the car. Any minute now.
          Take your positions.
          Sloan leans out over the edge of his building, gun ready.

<b>          QUICK SHOTS:
</b>          On the hospital roof, the Gunsmith puts down his
          binoculars and picks up a rifle.
          The Pharmacist leans over the edge of a building and
          looks down, high-powered rifle in his hand.
          On another building, the Chef does the same.
          And on still another building, the Gardener also gets
          ready.
          Each killer is in a different spot and has a gun, pointed
          and ready, just waiting for the signal...

<b>          ON THE ROAD:
</b>          The limo is about halfway up the incline now, a sitting
          duck, hellfire about to rain down upon it.

<b>          ON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP:
</b>          The Gunsmith waits, waits, waits...
          .and then, out of nowhere, surprising the hell out of
          him, a knife is held to his neck from behind.
          The Gunsmith doesn't even so much as swallow, as the
          blade is so tight against his throat that it draws a drop
          of blood.

          The CAMERA MOVES TO THE SIDE to show Wesley crouched
          right behind him, a look of icy determination on his face
          as he holds the knife in place.

          In the distance, the Helms limo moves on, safely.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Looks like you missed your chance. Now
          where is Sloan?
          The Gunsmith feels the edge in Wesley's voice.

<b>          GUNSMITH
</b>          You don't understand, man. This ain't
          about Helms. The Intern told you right
          where to go...
          He smiles.

<b>          GUNSMITH (CONT'D)
</b>          .I'm just the decoy.
          THE CAMERA WHIPS around behind Wesley... to show that
          three laser sights are lighting up his back in a perfect
          pattern.
          And now we see it, this was al a Bet-up to get Wesley in
          the open. The three surrounding rooftops, slightly more
          elevated, hold each of the three assassins crouched-in
          sniper positions, zeroed in on Wesley's back.
          But instead of surprise, Wesley just leans in closer to
          the Gunsmith's ear.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>
<b>          (WHISPERS)
</b>          She told me that, too.
          And with that, he rolls the o0 over of ,
          just as the assassins on the higher rooftops all unleash
          a hail of bullets.
          BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! The Gunsmith takes a dozen
          shots, all in the chest, but none of the bullets make it
          through the Gunsmith's body.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Should've studied your anatomy, fellas.
          Wesley FIRES BACK indiscriminately at the neighboring
          rooftops, lying on his back, using the.dead assassin's
          body as a shield.

</b>          Quickly, he bucks the Gunsmith's body off of him and
          scampers for a nearby stairwell.

<b>          ON THE ROOFTOPS:
</b>          The assassinB-all disappear from their positions and head
          to the street.

<b>          INT. HOSPITAL BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - DAY

          Wesley bursts from the stairwell doorway and moves to the
          front door of the building. He clicks the empty
          cartridges out of his guns and is about to reload when he
          hears a sickening sound behind him...
          The sound of two knife blades being rubbed together...
          .and Wesley turns to f' the Butcher there waiting for

</b>          The Butcher deflects them with the knives in his hands:
          Wesley goes to fire again but his firing chambers recoil,
          showing that he is out of ammo.
          The Butcher's eyes go wide...

<b>          THE BUTCHER
</b>          Like I told you... the blade will always
          live on.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          I remember some dumb shit like that
          coming out of your mouth.
          Wesley tosses the guns in his pockets and then nulls out
          the kniZ2 in his shoulder.
          They charge each other, the blades whizzing and clanging
          off each other as each tries to gain an edge.
          The fight spills out the front door, and into...

          Wesley strikes three auick swipes acrosiLthe Butcher's
          face And forehead, filling his eyes with blood.
          The Butcher grabs his face and sees the blood streaming
          on to his hands. He tries to wipe the blood from his
          eyes, but it's just getting worse.

<b>          THE BUTCHER
</b>          I can't see!

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          But you can hear. So hear this: To cut

          Wesley lunges and the Butcher is defenseless to stop it.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          ...and thrust down behind the clavicle,
          cutting side to side.
          He does just as he describes and the big guy topples over
          as his gore spills out into the street.
          But before he can gloat, Wesley realizes his new
          predicament...
          He's standing in the middle of the street, and at one end
          is the chef, and at the other is the Gardener. To make
          things worse, directly across the street from Wesley is
          the Pharmacist, and each has a gun on him.

<b>          THE PHARMACIST
</b>          Three on one, mate. You're out of ammo.
          And you're in a part of the map with no
          Fraternity stashes.

<b>          (LAUGHS)
</b>          That's what I'd call a real ball ache.
          For a moment, Wesley stands there, sizing up the
          situation. His eyes swivel from the Gardener to the Chef
          to the Pharmacist.
          Just then, the buildings ound all of them go black.,
          just like in cross's model! Wesley's eyes fall on the on
          the red corner of the nearest building, a cement block
          making up a decorative support column in front of it.

          With that, the world goes back 12 its natural colorB, and
          he races for the building, jumping up onto and over a
          Lexus parked at the curb. The three assassins fire
          relentlessly at him, but their bullets slam into the car,
          smashing it to bits... as...
          . on the other side of it, Wesley goes into a slide just
          as he reaches that cement block... affixed to it is a

          and the cement block mechanically opens, revealing: a new

          As his adversaries converge on him, Wesley takes the
          guns, spins, splits both hands apart and we...

          pierces his body... and...

<b>          INSIDE HIS BODY:
</b>          We see the bullet ricochet off of one of his ribs-exit

          before he can even react.
          Wesley watches a pink spray shoot out from both sides of
          the Pharmacist's head as he falls to the asphalt, dead.
          But Wesley's not through, he moves over to the Gardener
          and rolls him over.

          Wesley is clutching his wounded shoulder with his wounded
          hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big red drops.

<b>          SLOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          You once asked why I helped hide you as

          both open fire...
          .Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan

          The place is now blanketed with cops, looking at the dead
          bodies, trying to make sense of what happened.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          But I've learned something in that time.
          I've learned about the man who made me.

<b>          EXT. DOWNTOWN CORNER - DAY
</b>
          Cope stand on the street, handing out pictures of Wesley,
          asking pedestrians if they've seen this man.

<b>          WESLEY (V.O.)
</b>          I've learned about the man I am.

<b>          INT. POST OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          Patrons stand in line at a post office, but the'CAMERA
          PUSHES PAST THEM, finding a black and white "WANTED"
          poster of Wesley, describing all the killings he's
          responsible for. It holds tight on the picture.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          I've learned that all of us are unique,
          even though sometimes we're too fucking
          blind to see it.

<b>          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
</b>
          The door to the safehouse opens, and Anna, Wesley and
          Andrew step out into the bright sunlight. Wesley is
          carrying his little brother.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          109.
</b>          They turn and head up the street, toward the eastern sun.
          The CAMERA RISES UP, UP, UP, where it hovers for a
          minute... and just when we think it is going to leave the
          planet...

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And I learned, the easiest place to hide
          is in plain sight.
          .it comes back DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, until it finds...

<b>          INT. TYPICAL INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          ..Wesley sitting at a computer in the middle of another
          cubicle maze, pecking away at his keyboard. A sign
          attached to one wall reads: "SAN ANGELO INSURANCE
          ASSOCIATES: Setting the Bar Highl"
          Office workers mill about in their drab suits and ties,
          wishing they were anywhere else.
          A pretty RECEPTIONIST comes over to Wesley's desk.

<b>          RECEPTIONIST
</b>          You're the new guy, huh?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Just started last week.

<b>          RECEPTIONIST
</b>          Where'd you move here from?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          All over the place, really. Nothing too
          exciting.

<b>          RECEPTIONIST
</b>          Well, welcome to the team. Just watch
          out for Brokaw. He'll stab you in the
          back first chance he gets.
          Just then, a harried man, BROKAW, comes storming up.

<b>          BROKAW
</b>          Jesus, Connie, don't you have some faxes
          to get to?
          The receptionist hurries away, making a face as she does.

<b>          BROKAW (CONT'D)
</b>          Laziest skirt I ever hired. But nice fun
          bags, I'll give her that.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          110.
</b>          He leans over Wesley's desk, right in his space.

<b>          BROKAW (CONT ' D )
</b>          Jim, right?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Yes, sir.

<b>          BROKAW
</b>          Listen, Jim, I don't want to get started
          off on the wrong foot here, but we.have
          numbers to make and if we don't make
          those numbers, it's my ass on the line.
          And if my ass gets chewed out by
          regional, I can guarantee.that your ass
          is gonna be Purina doggy chow. Now I'm
          not sure how they ran things...
          Wesley stares at that mouth zeroing in further and--
          further, until the words become gibberish, just like they
          did with Janice.
          Wesley catches himself and snaps out of it, just in time
          to hear...

<b>          BROKAW (CONT'D)
</b>          .so do we understand each other?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Of course.

<b>          BROKAW
</b>          Good boy.
          With that, he hurries away, his pants riding so high up
          his ass that they look like they may burst at any second.
          Wesley stares up at the clock on his monitor: it reads
          11:15. He stands up, stretches, and makes his way to the
          receptionist's desk. She looks up, bites her lower
          lip...

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          You want to take a break with me?

<b>          RECEPTIONIST
</b>          Sure!
          She stands and they move toward the elevators, waiting
          for the doors to open.

<b>          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
</b>          You know, we don't usually get breaks.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Just then, the elevator doors DING.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Well, you'll find there's nothing "usual"
          about me.
          They climb in.
          THE CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on Wesley's
          face...

<b>          WESLEY (V.O.)
</b>          This life is ours, to make of it what we
          can.
          .until it fills the screen, looking just like the shot
          of Wesley we started with. And then a sly smile spreads
          across his mug...

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          I think I'll give it a shot.
          .and as the doors close, we officially...

<b>          FADE OUT.
