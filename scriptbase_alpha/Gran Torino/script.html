<b>                                 GRAN TORINO
</b>

                                  Written by

                                  Nick Schenk





<b>          FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          INT. CHURCH
</b>
          We're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski. In attendance
          are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored
          teenagers.
          WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He
          speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit.

<b>          OLDER MAN
</b>          I'm real sorry about Dorothy,
          Walt. She was a real peach.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Thanks for coming, Al.
          Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue
          eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut
          hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.
          Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his
          hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.
          Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at
          his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his
          GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Jesus Christ.
          Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from
          across the pews.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Look at the Old Man glaring at
          Ashley. He can't even tone it
          down at Mom's funeral?

<b>          STEVE
</b>          What do you expect? Dad's still
          living in the ‘50s. He expects
          his granddaughter to dress a
          little more modestly.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Yeah, well your kid's wearing a
          Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad
          appreciates that.

<b>          STEVE
</b>          My point is that there's nothing
          anyone can do that won't
          disappoint the Old Man.

<b>          (MORE)
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>          PAGE 3
</b>          It's inevitable. That's why we
          stopped doing Thanksgivings; the
          deal with the boat motor, the
          broken bird bath, it's always
          something.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          What are we going to do with him?
          Don't you think he'll get in
          trouble by himself over in the old
          neighborhood?

<b>          STEVE
</b>          Why don't you have him move in
          with you?

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Ha ha.

<b>          INT. CHURCH - LATER
</b>

          The choir sings the Beatitudes.
          Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as
          one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes
          and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish.
          FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up
          to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife.
          Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak,
          unconvincing words of Father Janovich.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Death... is often a bittersweet
          occasion to us Catholics. Bitter
          in the pain it causes the deceased
          ... and their families. Sweet to
          those who know the salvation that
          awaits them. And some may ask,
          what is death. Is it the end? Or
          is it the beginning? And what is
          life? What is this thing we call
          life?

<b>          WALT
</b>          Jesus.
          Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips.
          He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white
          cloth.

<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>          INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
</b>
          The house is crammed with people following the service.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to
          keep busy. Steve steps over to his father.

<b>          STEVE
</b>          A lot of people showed up after
          the service.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew
          there'd be plenty of ham. I think
          I'll go downstairs and get some
          more chairs.

<b>          STEVE
</b>          I'll do it, Dad.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Naw, we need them now, not next
          week.

<b>          INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME
</b>
          Grandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in
          the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed
          through.

          Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT
          looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are
          sprawled dead on the ground.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Is that Dad?

<b>          DANIEL
</b>          No, it's Grandpa Walt.
          Josh turns the photo over and reads it...

<b>          JOSH
</b>          ‘Third Platoon, E company, March
          second, 1952, Korea.'

<b>          DANIEL
</b>          Where's Korea?

<b>          JOSH
</b>          Hell if I know?
          David holds up a MEDAL.

<b>          3.

<b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>          PAGE 5
</b>
<b>          DAVID
</b>          Cool, I found a medal.
          They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt
          descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch,
          pretending to be doing nothing.
          Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.

<b>          UPSTAIRS
</b>
<b>          5
</b>
<b>          5
</b>          People eat and chat. Ashley marches over to her parents,
          KAREN and Mitch.

<b>          ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER)
</b>          How long do we have to stay, this
          ghetto is a dead zone for my cell
          and I'm bored.
          Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs,
          he overheard his Granddaughter. Mitch and Karen are
          embarrassed.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Ashley, honey. Why don't you help
          Grandpa Walt with the chairs?

<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          Me?

<b>          KAREN
</b>          Yes you.

<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          Grandpa Walt, can I help you with
          the chairs.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I'll take care of it, you just
          painted your nails.
          Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window.
          It's snowing. Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks
          relieved to get out of the house.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I'd better salt the sidewalk
          before someone falls and breaks a
          hip.
          Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very,
          very, very old DOG follows him outside.

<b>          4.

<b>          EXT. WALT'S HOUSE - EVENING
</b>

<b>          6
</b>
<b>          6
</b>          Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. He deliberately
          stops at the boundary of his property.
          The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now
          mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged
          to Polish families.
          Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on.
          Walt can see through the window that the living room is
          jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong.
          And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full-
          blown, unrepentant racist.
          Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats
          can they cram into a living room?
          Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.

<b>          INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME
</b>

<b>          7
</b>
<b>          7
</b>          Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a
          cigarette. She has pulled back the canvas tarp that
          covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972 GRAN TORINO.
          The Gran Torino is in mint condition. It has been babied
          since the day it rolled off the line.
          Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt.

<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the
          vintage car?
          Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still
          burning cigarette before answering.

<b>          WALT
</b>
<b>          1972.
</b>
<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          I never knew you had a cool old
          car.

<b>          WALT
</b>          It's only been in here since
          before you were born.

</b>
<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          So, what are you like going to do
          with it like, when... you die?
          Walt lights up a smoke --

<b>          WALT
</b>          Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
          Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.

<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          Then what about that super cool
          retro couch in the den, I'm going
          to State next year and I don't
          have, like, any furniture?
          Walt walks out without commenting.

<b>          BACK IN WALT'S HOUSE
</b>
<b>          8
</b>
<b>          8
</b>          The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door. Standing
          there is TAO, a sixteen-year-old HMONG boy. Walt scowls.
          TAO is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very
          good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Who the hell are you?

<b>          TAO
</b>          (very quietly)

          Walt slams the door in Tao's face.
          Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich.
          Walt hates situations like this.

</b>          Huh?

<b>          WALT
</b>          It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Right, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife
          and I became quite close these
          last few months. She asked that I
          watch over you when she passed on.
          I told her I watch out for my
          entire flock, but she made me
          promise I'd keep an extra sharp
          eye on you.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I appreciate your kindness to my
          wife and now that you've spoken
          your piece, why don't you move on
          to the next sheep?
          Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Dorothy mentioned specifically
          that it was her wish for you to go
          to confession. She said she
          couldn't remember the last time
          you went.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Is that so?

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          It is.
          Walt drains his lowball glass.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Well, I confess I never much liked
          church and only went because of
          the wife. And I confess I have no
          desire to confess to a boy who is
          fresh out of the seminary.

</b>          People are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling,
          stiff-jointed old Pollacks.
          Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are
          more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter
          and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy
          bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home.
          The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old
          baby is named and three souls are located for the
          newborn.

<b>          ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>          Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old
          ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables
          to their dead battery.
          Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a
          brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.

</b>          I'd really like to help, Dad, but
          we have to get the kids home,
          they're getting restless.
          Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser
          and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Fine. Go.

          As they drive off, Walt hears faint SINGING. Walt looks
          into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes.
          The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their
          heads sliced off, right there in the yard.
          The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder.
          It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to

          their native language, the younger generation speaks both
          English and Hmong.
          (NOTE: Hmong is subtitled when necessary.)
          Tao's Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN.

          his sister gives him orders and he
          obeys.
          The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of
          dishes. An older relative drops dishes in the sink,
          without acknowledging Tao's presence. It's clearly an
          insult.
          In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong “Soul Calling” ceremony
          starts its next phase. An elder, the family SHAMAN, is
          present and begins the ritual.
          As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch. Tao slips
          on his coat and goes out the back door.

          from a shadow, JUMPER CABLES in his hands. They make eye
          contact as Tao passes.
          Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy.

          WHAM! A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his
          front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the
          snow.
          A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand
          around the stunned, prone Tao.

          the first swing. You drop me and

</b>          What the fuck you smiling at,

          He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.

          houses are rundown.
          Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped
          screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed
          a chicken coop.
          Walt looks down at Daisy --

          of Latino gangbanger types.

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          You think about it and we'll see
          you tomorrow.

</b>          Tao digs in the garden. Tao's younger sister SUE sits
          and reads JANE magazine on the porch.
          The tricked-out Honda with Blue Neon lights pulls up.
          Spider, Smokie and two other Hmong gangbangers get out.

<b>          SPIDER
</b>          Hey, cuz. Hey, Sue.

<b>          SUE
</b>          What do you want?

<b>          SPIDER
</b>          Came to talk to my cousin Tao.
          Smokie looks over to Sue.

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          Spider, who's the other cousin?
          SUE laughs at the name “Spider.” Sue is seventeen, has
          long straight hair with red highlights.

<b>          SUE
</b>          ‘Spider'? Is that what he just
          called you, Fong?

<b>          SPIDER
</b>          This is my little cousin, Sue.
          Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue.

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          Hey, Sue... how old are you, girl?

<b>          SUE
</b>          Mentally, I'm way too old for you.
          I'm going inside.

<b>          SUE
</b>          Yeah, that's exactly what I'm
          doing, Fong.
          Sue rolls her eyes and goes inside. Smokie stares at
          Tao.

<b>          SPIDER
</b>          You think about what we talked
          about?
          A PAUSE. Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a
          cigarette. Tao shakes his head “no” and looks at the
          ground.

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          That's exactly the point, Tao.
          Spider told me how everyone thinks
          you're a pushover, how everybody
          walks all over you and shit. I
          mean, look at you, out here
          working in the garden like a
          woman.
          Tao nods silently, but still looks at the ground.

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          It ain't no big thing. You just
          need a little guidance.
          Tao looks up at Smokie. Tao looks a little skeptical.

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          It's true, man. Shit, I used to
          be kind of a quiet little punk
          like you, everybody fucking with
          me. But finally I said ‘no more.'
          You, you're lucky, Tao, we got
          your back. Me? I didn't have
          nobody. Had to mold my own tribe.

<b>          SPIDER
</b>          Smokie's right. We're family,
          right? You with us or what?

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          I swear, brother, we're the best
          friends you'll ever have. And

          Smokie points to Walt's open garage.

          color jokes.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I got one. A Mexican, a Jew and a

          says -- ‘get the fuck out.'
          The gang laughs, until they see Father Janovich step up
          to the bar. He smiles as he recognizes several faces.

<b>          WALT
</b>          ‘Death is bittersweet? Bitter in
          the pain, sweet in the salvation.'
          That's what you know of life and
          death? Good God, it's pathetic.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?

<b>          WALT
</b>          Plenty. I lived with death for
          three years in Korea. We shot
          people, we stabbed them with
          bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year-
          old kids to death with shovels,
          for Christ's sake. I did things
          that won't leave me till the day I
          die, horrible things, things I
          have to live with.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          And what about life?
          Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his
          answer.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Well... I survived the war... got
          married... and raised a family.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH

</b>          Daisy?
          The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at
          the clock; it's 3:48 am.
          Walt looks out his bedroom window. He sees the faint
          beam of a flashlight in his garage.

          Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out
          the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea.
          Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and
          chambers a round with a loud SNAP.

<b>          23
</b>          The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face
          to face with the barrel of Walt's M1 RIFLE.
          Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better
          aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. Tao
          drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud
          metallic clang.
          Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs
          up, Walt advances, step for step.
          Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip.
          They both start to fall. The lightbulb is bumped with
          the rifle barrel and swings back and forth.
          As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE
          RIFLE. The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer
          sign on the wall.
          Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over
          Walt. Tao runs out of the garage and into the night.
          Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. Sweat runs
          down his forehead. He coughs up blood. The lightbulb
          still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage.

          Walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood
          in defiance. A couple of Hmong teenagers look at the
          car.

          Torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway. The
          whole scene looks like a mid-sixties car ad in Popular
          Mechanics.
          Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen
          light comes on. The Gran Torino remains in the driveway.
          It's a challenge, an invitation. Walt is daring the

          Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other
          gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay.
          A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into
          the yard. All the gangbangers overreact and pull their
          pistols. The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face
          and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel.
          Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes
          a pushing, rolling, surging melee.

          Walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts
          up his hands, indicating they've come far enough.

</b>          Not that it's any of your
          goddamned business, but when
          things happen quickly like that,
          you have to react. In Korea, we
          never ‘called the police' when a
          swarm of screaming gooks came
          pouring into our lines. We
          reacted.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
          Walt says nothing.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          I've been thinking about our
          discussion on life and death.
          About what you said. About how
          you carry around the horrible
          things you were forced to do.
          Horrible things that won't leave
          you. It seems that it would do
          you good to unload some of that
          burden. Things done during war
          are terrible, being ordered to
          kill, killing to save others,
          killing to save yourself. You're
          right, those are things I don't
          know anything about. But I do
          know about forgiveness. And I've
          seen a lot of men who have
          confessed their sins, admitted
          their guilt and left their burdens
          behind them. Stronger men than
          you. Men at war who were ordered
          to do appalling things and are now
          at peace.
          Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I'm impressed. You came with your
          guns loaded, for once.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Thank you.

<b>          WALT
</b>          You have balls, Father. And what
          you said, you're right. I'm sure
          stronger men than me have found
          their salvation. Hallelujah. But

          Tall Guy makes “kissy faces” at Sue as he touches his
          crotch.
          Walt sits there for a second; he shouldn't help, but Walt
          solves every situation by being aggressive.
          Walt drives off, then makes a U-turn.
          The Tall Black Guy now focuses on Trey.

          Trey puts up his hand to “hi-five.” The Tall Black Guy
          just looks at him.

<b>          TREY
</b>          Yo, it's cool, dog.

</b>          Just open it.
          Walt opens the package, it's a Gopher Reaching Tool --
          the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up
          objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc.
          Walt looks at his son and daughter-in-law.

</b>          A lot of the people in this house
          are very traditional. Number one,
          never touch a Hmong person on the
          head, not even a child. Hmong
          people believe that the soul
          resides in the head, so don't do
          that.

<b>          WALT
</b>          That's dumb, but fine.

<b>          SUE
</b>          Hmong people also consider looking
          someone in the eye to be rude.
          That's why everyone looks away
          when you look at them.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Swell. Anything else?

</b>          Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin
          when they're yelled at or get into
          a confrontation. It's a cultural
          thing. It expresses embarrassment
          or insecurity, not that they're
          laughing at you.

          Sue smiles and nods.

<b>          SUE
</b>          Something like that. The Hmong
          hold their clan Shaman in very
          high regards.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Boo-ga, boo-ga.
          Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong. She turns and
          translates to Walt.

<b>          SUE
</b>          Kor Khue is interested in you, he
          heard what you did. He says he

          Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman. The Shaman responds and
          sits down across from Walt. He looks at Walt for a long
          time.
          Walt stares straight back at him. The Shaman mumbles to
          himself.
          Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly.
          As Sue translates, the Shaman watches Walt's reaction.

<b>          SUE
</b>          Kor Khue says that you think
          you've been disrespected. You do
          not live your life. Your food has

          Walt looks like he's been hit by a truck. The Shaman
          watches Walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the
          head.
          Walt looks pale. He's been spooked good. He wipes sweat
          from his forehead.

          Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and
          offer tea and cookies from a tray.
          Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom.
          Walt coughs hard. He wipes blood from his lips. Sue

          lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let
          his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953.

          Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food,
          occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc. This
          corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong

          And the first person he sees across the room is Tao.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Oh great.

</b>          Yeah, Toad.
          Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks
          over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He leans
          against the DRYER. The DRYER wobbles.
          Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the
          dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the
          machine.
          He just can't help it.
          All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at
          this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a
          dryer during a party. Walt looks up -- deer in the
          headlights.

<b>          WALT

          their hands.
          Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from

          interaction between the boys and girls.
          One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL
          stares across the room at Tao. Tao looks back at her,
          but then looks away.
          The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her
          hair.
          Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do.
          They do their best to charm her. She's polite, but not
          interested, she keeps looking at Tao.
          Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this
          wasted opportunity. Suddenly the Girl steps over to
          Walt.
          She smiles --

</b>          Speaking of busy, I have a lot on
          my plate right now, unless there's
          something pressing.
          Walt looks at a pale, blue pamphlet. Mitch looks at his
          housekeeping bill.

<b>          WALT
</b>          No. Nope.
          Another pause.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Okay then.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Okay. Yeah, so it's not a good

          call me over the weekend.

</b>          While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door.
          Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder,
          trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw.
          Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Hey, moron.
          Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.

<b>          TAO
</b>          What?

<b>          WALT
</b>          I appreciate you're doing
          something on your own, but you're
          the only person I know dumb enough
          to get himself killed trimming
          tree branches.

<b>          TAO
</b>          What now?

<b>          WALT
</b>          You don't stand on the top step of
          a ladder and if you cut through
          that branch you're hacking away
          at, you'll end up kaput.
          Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black POWER LINE is
          five feet below the branch he's almost severed.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Go grab the extension ladder from
          my garage and I'll show you how to
          do it right, zipper head.

          cigarette, looks up in the tree and nods.

          leaves.

<b>          TAO
</b>          I know. I will.
          Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the
          cooler and watches Tao rake.
          A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past
          Tao.
          Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass.

<b>          WALT
</b>          This kid doesn't have a chance.
          The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house. Walt just
          stands there, sipping his beer.
          The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at
          Walt.
          The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens.
          Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN. He closes one
          eye to better “aim” his imaginary gun and moves his thumb
          several times as if firing. Bang -- bang -- bang.
          The Honda takes off. Walt watches it drive off and
          lights another cigarette.
          Walt doesn't notice, but Tao witnessed this whole
          interaction from his yard.

</b>          It must be a hundred degrees in

          Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles
          and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off.

          shock to a thief, but I actually
          bought the things I have with

          Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick
          succession, questioning Walt with his expression.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail
          punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife.
          Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile

          Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but
          he's too uncomfortable to speak up --

</b>          What?

<b>          TAO
</b>          I can't afford to buy all this
          stuff.

</b>          I didn't buy all this stuff at
          once, blockhead. I've lived here
          for fifty years. A man stays in

          attract a decent set of tools.

</b>          Look, kid, I think I know where

          need everything to maintain a
          house. I'm going to let you in on
          a little secret.
          Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE
          items in quick succession.

<b>          WALT
</b>          This is for you. Roll of duct
          tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of
          vise-grips. Any man who's worth a
          shit can do half his household
          jobs with these three things. In

<b>          SUE
</b>          It's tough. The boys float

          Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it
          against the pavement. Whatever tools Smokie can't
          destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building.

</b>          The Gran Torino? You'd let me
          drive it?

          are heard and glass breaks.
          Walt gets up and looks out the shades...
          TAO'S HOUSE is raked with GUNFIRE coming from a VAN!
          Windows shatter and the siding splinters.
          FIFTY BULLETS shake the house before the VAN peels off.

          Tao -- making sure no one's been hit.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Is everyone okay? Is anyone hit?
          Sue? Vu? Tao, where's Tao?
          Tao sits up from behind the couch. Blood pours down his
          neck. He's stunned.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Oh no.
          Walt lays Tao down and rips open the collar of his shirt.
          Walt probes around Tao's neck.

          follows his gaze.

</b>          It's a miracle no one was killed.

<b>          WALT
</b>          They aimed high.

          Tao scrambles for the phone and dials.
          Tao speaks Hmong to whomever answered. Tao starts to
          speak faster. He looks at Walt and shakes his head “no.”

          speaks loudly, without any consideration for Phong who
          shoots him dirty looks.

          Phong looks out the window and screams. She runs over
          and swings open the door.
          Everyone expects the worst...
          And it comes like a cold wind -- SUE WALKS IN LIKE A
          ZOMBIE. She has been brutally beaten. Her clothes are
          dirty and torn.
          BLOOD runs down SUE'S legs from under her shirt.
          Walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand.
          Sue staggers into Vu's arms. Vu weeps. Sue hugs her
          mother and sobs.
          Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at
          him, pointing at Walt and back to Tao.
          Walt is destroyed. He steps outside into the dark.

          and CRIES. He tries to stop and cries harder.
          It's the first time Walt has cried in fifty years. He
          wails, crying for Tao, Sue, his wife, kids and himself.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          God loves and forgives you. Say
          ten ‘Hail Marys' and five ‘Our
          Fathers.' Are you going to
          retaliate for what happened to
          Sue?
          Walt says nothing. Father Janovich looks hard at Walt.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          I'm going over to that house
          today, Mr. Kowalski.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Is that so?

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          It is. And every other day until

          planning.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I gotta go, Padre. Busy day

          two weapons --
          The 30-06 M1 GARAND RIFLE and the COLT .45 PISTOL.
          Tao picks up the heavy RIFLE.

          for you.

<b>          TAO
</b>          What?

<b>          WALT
</b>          In Korea, October, 1952. We were
          sent up to sweep a Chink machine
          gun nest that had carved us up
          pretty bad. I was the only one
          who came back... I received the
          Silver Star. I want you to have
          it.

<b>          TAO
</b>          Why?

<b>          WALT
</b>          When we went up that hill, we knew
          it was ten to one against us, but
          we went anyway. This trouble now,
          it's similar. We're walking right
          into it. We might not be coming
          home tonight.

<b>          TAO
</b>          The hell we won't. We're going to
          roll in there and tear ass.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Don't be a fool, these guys are
          waiting for that exact reaction.
          Tao is quiet for a minute.

          Tao goes downstairs. He turns on the light and goes into
          the cellar. Tao locates a BLUE WOODEN BOX and opens it.
          Tao holds up the MEDAL. He looks at it closely.
          AND WHAM -- Walt slams the heavy cellar DOOR shut behind
          him. Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a loud

<b>          CLICK.
</b>          Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years. Of
          course he tries anyway. Tao is furious. He throws
          things.

<b>          TAO
</b>          What the hell are you doing?! Let
          me out of here, you goddamned son-
          of-a-bitch!!

</b>          You let me out, you crazy old
          fuck, or I will kill you when I
          get out of here.
          Tao pounds on the door. Walt pounds back with a strength
          and authority which startles Tao.

<b>          WALT
</b>          You want to know how it feels to
          kill a man? It feels goddamned
          lousy. And it feels even worse
          when you get a medal for bravery
          right after you mowed down some
          scared kid when he tries to give
          up. A dumb, scared, little gook,
          just about your age. I shot him
          with the same rifle you just held
          upstairs.

          Walt goes back upstairs, leaving Tao locked up in his
          cellar.

          in Hmong as Walt walks straight up to her.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I need you to watch my dog.
          Walt holds the leash closer. Phong folds her arms in
          defiance. Walt exhales loudly.
          Walt lifts up one of the LEGS OF HER LAWNCHAIR and slips
          the loop of the leash underneath it so Daisy can't follow
          him.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Her name is Daisy.
          Walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets Daisy. He
          scratches her belly.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Hail Mary, full of grace.
          Walt reaches into his coat pocket. Six Hmong gangbangers
          simultaneously level their PISTOLS and FIRE.
          BULLETS FLY. Walt is struck down. People scream.
          Walt falls dead. A ZIPPO lighter clutched in his hand.
          Walt never intended to kill anyone. Self-sacrifice.

<b>          109
</b>          Tao and Sue arrive just as Smokie, Spider and company are
          being driven away in Police cars.
          Tao looks at Smokie in the squad car. Smokie no longer
          looks tough or hard, he just looks scared.
          On the street, Walt is being bagged by the ambulance
          crew. Father Janovich prays over him.
          Tao steps up to a POLICE OFFICER.

<b>          TAO
</b>          What happened?

<b>          POLICE OFFICER
</b>          You have to step back.

<b>          TAO
</b>          He was a friend of mine.

<b>          POLICE OFFICER
</b>          I said step back.
          Tao turns to the HMONG POLICE OFFICER.

<b>          TAO
</b>          What happened, man?
          The Hmong Police Officer looks at the WHITE POLICE
          OFFICER and then to Tao.

<b>          HMONG POLICE OFFICER
</b>          You heard him, step back.
          Tao speaks to the HMONG OFFICER in their native language.

<b>          TAO
</b>
<b>          (SUBTITLED)
</b>          Please, man, it's important. He's
          my friend. Tell me what happened?

<b>          HMONG POLICE OFFICER
</b>
<b>          (SUBTITLED)
</b>          The old guy reaches for a lighter
          and they gunned him down. The
          gang said the old guy was here to
          kill them, but he didn't have a
          weapon.

<b>          TAO
</b>
<b>          (SUBTITLED)
</b>          What's going to happen?

<b>          (SUBTITLED)
</b>          We actually have witnesses for
          once. These guys are going away
          big time.
          The WHITE OFFICER yells at the HMONG OFFICER.

<b>          POLICE OFFICER
</b>          Officer Chang, get those people
          back.

<b>          HMONG POLICE OFFICER
</b>          Yes, sir. You have to step back
          now.
          Tao hugs his sister. Sue openly weeps. Tao holds it in.
          He looks at his friend Walt as the bag is zipped over
          him.

</b>
<b>          110
</b>          Tao and Sue wait in front. Tao wears a suit, Sue is in a
          traditional Hmong dress. A TAXI pulls up and they get
          in.
          Sitting on the porch is Phong who rocks back and forth in
          her rocking chair. Phong holds Daisy in her arms, gently
          petting the old dog.

<b>          INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH
</b>

<b>          111
</b>
<b>          111
</b>          We're at the funeral of Walter Kowalski. Walt is dressed
          in his new suit.
          Along with the crowd you'd expect, Tao and Sue are seated
          near the front.
          Walt's sons and family are there. Mitch gives Tao a
          dirty look. Tao looks back at him, his gaze bores right
          through Mitch. Mitch looks away.
          Father Janovich steps up to the pulpit and speaks.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Walt Kowalski once said to me I
          didn't know anything about life or
          death because ‘I was an
          overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
          who held the hands of
          superstitious old women and
          promised them eternity.' Walt
          definitely had no problem ‘calling
          it like he saw it.' But Walt was
          right. I knew really nothing
          about life or death until I got to
          know Walt. And boy, did I learn.

<b>          INT. LAW OFFICE
</b>

<b>          112
</b>
<b>          112
</b>          All of Walt's family are seated in an office as a LAWYER
          reads Walt Kowalski's will.
          Tao is present along with Walt's family.

<b>          LAWYER
</b>          Which brings us to our last item.
          And again, please forgive the
          language used in Mr. Kowalski's
          will. I'm simply reading it as it
          was written.
          The LAWYER takes a sip of water before reading...

<b>          LAWYER
</b>          ‘And to my friend, Tao Vang Lor, I
          leave my 1972 Gran Torino on the
          condition that you don't choptop
          the roof like a damned spick,
          don't paint any idiotic flames on
          it like some white-trash hillbilly
          and don't put a big gay spoiler on
          the rear-end like you see on all
          the other zipper heads' cars. It
          just looks like hell. If you can
          refrain from doing any of that,
          it's yours.

<b>          FADE OUT.
