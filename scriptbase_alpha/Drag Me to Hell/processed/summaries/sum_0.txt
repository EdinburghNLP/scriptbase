Christine Brown is a loans officer at a bank but is worried about her lot in life.
She's in competition with a competent colleague for an assistant manager position and isn't too sure about her status with a boyfriend.
Worried that her boss will think less of her if she shows weakness, she refuses a time extension on a loan to an old woman, Mrs. Ganush, who now faces foreclosure and the loss of her house.
In retaliation, the old woman place a curse on her which, she subsequently learns, will result in her being taken to hell in a few days time.
With the help of a psychic, she tries to rid herself of the demon, but faces several hurdles in the attempt.
