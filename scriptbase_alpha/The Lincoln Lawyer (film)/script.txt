          BANG IN FROM BLACK, FACE OF A MAN
          MICKEY HALLER, 40, lawyer-- TIGHT on him, as morning light
          flies across his features. He's fresh-shaved, neat suit,
          gazes out with a stark/steady focus from the back seat of--

          INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR (MOVING) IN A HARD RAIN--

          GRADUALLY FADE IN, under the SOUND of rain & freeway, his
          DRIVER, black, 20s, low patter to which Mick barely listens--

                         EARL
          I'm thinkin', when Not-Guilty-
          Two gets to four thousand miles,
          that's two cars ready, that's
          enough to start the airport runs...
          (then, realizing)
          You gettin' any of this, Mr.
          Haller?
          Not this morning. Mick watches the rain without seeing it.

                         MICK
          Just keep your speed up, Earl.
          Earl kicks it, passes cars...
          Mick takes a FILE from a stack beside him. Also laptop, cell-
          phone rack: His back seat is his rolling office. Opens the
          file. Top sheet:
          THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA v. LOUIS ROULET.
           Tight on Mick. His eyes see back to the be innin CUT TO,

          EXT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - BRIGHT SUN - ANOTHER MORNING

          The town car sails along, bright glint off the surface
          streets-- We HEAR HARD RAP, TUPAC SHAKUR-- CELL PHONE RINGS--

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - SAME TIME


                         MICK
          Earl-- buds.
          A command. Earl puts in earbuds, Rap cuts out. Into cell--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          This is Haller.

          MAN'S VOICE OVER CELL
          Where are you this morning?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          This time Mick's in a mussed suit, surrounded by newspapers,
          open files, electric shaver, take-out coffee...

                         MICK
          On my way to Lancaster for a
          calendar call. Why, have you got
          something?

          MAN'S VOICE (VAL)
          I got a franchise player is what.
          Reaction Mick: He's heard it before...

                         VAL'S VOICE
          I mean it, this guy could be money.
          But he goes before the judge at
          eleven.

                         MICK
          Van Nuys by eleven could be hard--

                         VAL'S VOICE
          But this client, listen Mick, his
          mother's lawyer just waltzed in

                         HERE--

                         MICK
          He's already got a lawyer?--

                         VAL'S VOICE
          Strictly real-estate, doesn't know
          his ass about criminal. Will you
          listen?

                         MICK

                         GO AHEAD--

                         VAL'S VOICE
          Guy waltzes in, ready to put up the
          family's beach house in Malibu
          against the million in bail...

                         MICK
          A million? What'd they book him on?

                         VAL'S VOICE
          He picked up a girl last night--
          Whatever went down she ended up
          pretty bad. Cops want Aggravated
          Assault with G.B.I.--

                         MICK
          Has the D.A. filed yet?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         VAL'S VOICE
          No. See? I'm giving you ground
          floor. So make it work for me,
          Mick. Don't let him use the house,
          get him to go for my bond--
          Meanwhile the Lincoln's approaching the Lancaster courthouse,
          there are cars, people-- a traffic jam. To Earl--

                         MICK
          Bring me around to the employee's
          gate, I'll talk my way in.
          (into cell, writes)
          I'm at the courthouse. Give me the
          name.

                         VAL'S VOICE
          That would be Louis Roulet...

                         (PRONOUNCED ROO-LAY)
          R-O-U-L-E-T, like the wheel.

                         MICK
          That's not how you spell the wheel
          but I got it, thanks.

                         VAL'S VOICE
          Remember: I steered him to you.

                         MICK
          You're on my Christmas list, Val.
          Lincoln swings abruptly to a steel gate. "EMPLOYEES."

          INT. LANCASTER COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - MINUTES LATER

          MOVING with Mick through the press of lawyers, others, before
          the Judge shows up, as a few PRISONERS are led into the
          holding pen-- Mick picks out his client, HAROLD CASEY, 30s,
          lanky, with a ponytail and skull & halo tattoo... Mick tries
          catching his eye but Harold's clearly avoiding him...

                         MICK
          Harold. Hard Case.

                         (HAROLD DUCKS)
          Don't hide from your lawyer,
          Harold, you know what I want to
          talk about.
          Caught, Harold slouches towards him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Listen. when the judge comes in
          he's going to want to know if we're
          ready for trial...

                         HAROLD
          We are.

                         MICK
          We're not and you know why not. You
          haven't paid me. Rule one, remember
          Rule one, Harold? I get paid or I
          don't work.

                         HAROLD
          Don't worry, I have your money...

                         MICK
          Right, you have my money, I don't.

                         HAROLD
          It's coming. I talked to my boys.

                         MICK
          Harold-- I looked at the list of
          people I trust, and you know what?
          You're not on it.

                         HAROLD
          The law says you can't just quit.
          The Judge won't let you. I looked
          it up.
          Mick's about to react to this jailhouse lawyering-- when a
          hush falls, and the JUDGE comes out: ORTON POWELL, 60...

                         MICK
          Pay close attention, Harold.
          Goes to his seat...

          INT. COURTROOM - MINUTES LATER

          Harold's case has been called, Mick stands--

                         MICK
          Mickey Haller for the defense, your
          honor. If I may, I'd like to carry
          this over.

                         JUDGE ORTON
          Do you have a reason, Mr. Haller?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         MICK
          I'm having trouble locating a
          witness, your honor. An
          indispensable witness. A Mr. Green.
          With emphasis. A look goes between the Judge and Mick.
          Meantime Harold stares from the pen. The Judge, to Mick--

                         JUDGE ORTON
          How much time do you need? Would a
          week be enough?

                         MICK
          I hope so, your honor. As your
          honor knows, Mr. Green can be hard
          to track down.
          A look of understanding. Judge nods--

                         JUDGE ORTON
          I'm holding this over pending
          notification from counsel...
          Then gavels down, for the next case-- As Casey's led off,
          Mick joins him along the rail-- He hisses--

                         HAROLD
          That was bullshit, askin' for a
          delay-- I know what that was about.

                         MICK
          And so does Judge Powell. He spent
          a lot of years as a defense lawyer,
          so he knows all about having to
          chase "Mr. Green," and he doesn't
          look kindly on defendants who don't
          pay their attorneys. Now do you get
          it, Harold?
          Casey won't look him in the eye-- RAP MUSIC IN AGAIN, TUPAC'S

          "LIFE GOES ON"--

          EXT. FREEWAY - LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

          The black town car cruises south, past dry brown hills...

          CELL PHONE RINGS AGAIN...

          INT. LINCOLN MOVING - BACK SEAT

          Earl, unasked, puts in his buds, as Mick answers the call--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         MICK
          This is Haller.

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          And this is your office.

          INTERCUT: LINCOLN (MOVING)/ INT. LORNA'S CONDO -DAY

          It's a one-bedroom in Studio City, Lorna's 33, redhead,
          pretty as hell, works at her kitchen table in her bathrobe,
          among breakfast dishes...

                         MICK
          Actually I'm in my office. On my
          way to court in Van Nuys.

                         LORNA
          That means Val reached you about
          his customer.

                         MICK
          Oh yeah: "This is the franchise,
          Mick." According to Valenzuela
          every case is "the franchise." I'd
          have paid my mortgage ten times
          over by now--

                         LORNA
          It could be he's right. I ran the
          name, the family's got a real
          estate business in Beverly Hills.
          The Times has them down for some
          big house sales, movie-star
          dollars...

                         MICK

                         (CONSIDERS)
          Sounds like the media might be
          interested. Call Sticks, tell him
          to show up. Any other calls?

                         LORNA
          A couple of DUI's, I quoted them
          the house number. That's it, you're
          free after Roulet.

                         MICK
          Good. Then I can go to County lock-
          up.
          Under which Mick sees Earl indicate something on the road...
          while Lorna reacts to what Mick said, exasperated...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         LORNA
          You're going to see Gloria. Why do
          you waste time on her, Mickey?
          Mick sees where Earl's pointing: SQUAD OF MOTORCYCLES,
          HARLEYS, IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRRORS... They pull up alongside:
          gang jackets, black leather vests... Big guys...

                         EARL
          Want me to do somethin' about this?
          'Cause I can.

                         MICK
          Ignore them, you're doing fine.
          FACE OF THE LEADER OF THE MOTORCYCLES, leers at Mick through
          window, as Mick ignores, answers Lorna re "Gloria":

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          What can I say, Lorn, I've got a
          soft spot for redheads. Why do you
          think I married you?

                         LORNA
          The divorce papers called it
          temporary insanity.

                         MICK
          Lucky for you there was a cure.
          When-- Earl interrupts, insistent now--

                         EARL
          Mr. Haller?
          Calling his attention to-- THE MOTORCYCLES HAVE PULLED IN
          FRONT. The leader signals Earl to pull off. Mick sees they're
          surrounded. Shit.

          EXT. OFF-RAMP FOR VASQUEZ ROCKS STATE PARK - CONTINUOUS

          The Lincoln follows the Harleys off, PULLS TO A STOP in a lot
          at the crest of the exit. Jagged rocks, craggy peaks.
          The leader gets off his bike. EDDIE VOGEL, nearly 300 lbs.
          Skull & halo patch on leather vest-- same as Harold's tattoo.
          The "Road Saints." Mick lowers a window.

                         EDDIE
          Counsellor, how's it hanging?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         MICK
          Fine, Eddie, how's it with you?

                         EDDIE

                         (CASUAL)
          Hard Case called me from the pen,
          he said I might catch up to you.
          Said you're stalling his case til
          you see more green, is that right?

                         MICK
          If you want me to work you've gat
          to pay me.

                         EDDIE
          We paid you. Five thousand.

                         MICK
          That's long gone. I could tell you
          half went to the aerial-photo
          expert. He's going to blow the
          state's case by showing that the
          DEA violated the air space over
          Harold's farm by flying too low...
          but you don't need to know that.
          All you need to know is, we had a
          deal. Time to refill the tank.
          Eddie smiles. Taps the side of the Lincoln.

                         EDDIE
          Sure, gas-guzzler like this. I
          heard you got three more. What's
          one man need with four Lincolns?

                         MICK

                         EDDIE--

                         EDDIE
          What? You want another five grand?

                         MICK
          Ten. I'm flying the guy in from
          Kodak in New York, he wants
          business class...

                         EDDIE
          And I want Harold back on the farm.
          He's the best farmer we got, if you
          know what I mean...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         MICK
          I don't. And I don't want to.
          Either pay me my money or go with
          the Public Defender the judge finds
          you. Of course he won't know much
          about air space, but--

                         EDDIE
          Keep your shirt on, Counsellor. We
          want you.
          He reaches into a vest with his big hand. Thick envelope.
          Mick takes it. Starts to count, and realizes:

                         MICK
          You had the whole ten ready. What
          if you'd backed me down to five?

                         EDDIE
          This vest got lots of pocket.
          Eddie taps another pocket and GRINS. one tooth missing.

          INT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          CAMERA MOVING ON: EIGHT MEN, prisoners in grey jumpers. Six
          are black. Of the two white men, one's a wet-eyed, skanky
          JUNKIE, 40s. The OTHER is a tall young man, somehow polished
          even in prison outfit, definitely out of place here--

                         MICK
          Louis Roulet?
          LOUIS turns: the proverbial deer-in-the-headlights: Scared.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          My name is Michael Haller. I had a
          call.

                         LOUIS
          Yes-- Mr. Haller--
          Mick stands behind a painted line three feet from the cell.
          Signals Louis to come to the bars to talk. Louis approaches,

                         FREAKED--

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I-- called you because I need

                         SOMEONE--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         MICK
          You want me to represent you for
          your first appearance. I get twenty-
          five hundred for that. We can work
          out what comes next.

                         LOUIS
          Thank you-- This is a set-up, Mr.
          Haller-- I made a mistake with that
          woman, she was setting me up--

                         MICK
          Keep your voice down. And don't say
          anything about the case, not til
          I've got you out on bail. Okay?
          Mick's voice, as always, is easy and calm. Louis nods.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I understand your family lawyer's
          in court?

                         LOUIS
          That's him. Cecil Dobbs.
          Points to-- DOBBS, balding dignified WASP, a few rows in.

                         MICK
          Is he ready to post bail?

                         LOUIS
          He'll do whatever he has to.
          Mick nods, noting the tinge of desperation in Louis's voice.
          Takes out a notebook...

                         MICK
          Okay, tell me about yourself. How
          old are you?

                         LOUIS
          Thirty-two...

                         MICK
          Ties to the community? You grow up
          here, go to school?

                         LOUIS
          Both. Beverly Hills, UCLA. I work
          for my mother's business...

                         MICK
          "Windsor Estates?"

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         LOUIS
          It's named for her second husband.

                         MICK
          How much did you make last year?
          (when Louis hesitates)
          If I'm going to get you out I need
          to know everything.

                         LOUIS
          My taxes last year said four
          hundred thousand.
          Just then, the White Junkie lurches forward towards Mick--

                         JUNKIE
          I want a lawyer too, you got a
          card?

                         MICK
          They'll have one for you out there.
          I need you to back up and leave us
          alone. Can you do that, pal?
          Junkie backs off, does just what Mick says. Impressing Louis.
          Then Mick, low-voiced--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Listen. They've put some heavy
          charges on you. The DA will
          probably ask for No-Bail...

                         LOUIS
          No bail?
          Frightened voice, the others react, Mick hushes him, and...

                         MICK
          I said they're going to ask it.
          When was the last time you were
          arrested?

                         LOUIS
          Never.

                         MICK
          So if I checked your record--

                         LOUIS
          --you'd find parking tickets.
          Mick looks briefly into the younger man's eyes-- he's scared,
          fragile -- but sincere. He sputters--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          This whole thing is--

                         MICK
          We're not talking about the case,
          remember? Not even to the judge.

                         LOUIS
          Don't I even say "Not guilty?"

                         MICK
          Today's about setting arraignment,
          period. You say nothing.

                         LOUIS
          Are you going to get me out?

                         MICK
          I'm gonna try, Louis.

                         (THEN)
          One more thing: There are lots of
          lawyers. Why pick me?

                         LOUIS
          I.. remembered your name from some
          case in the papers...

                         MICK
          What case?

                         LOUIS
          A drug case, I don't know.

                         MICK
          You remember the name or anything?

                         LOUIS
          No-- but you got the evidence
          thrown out against some guy-- Does
          it matter?
          (when Mick hesitates)
          I need your help, Mr. Haller.
          Off Mick, GO TO,

          AN 8 X 10 PHOTO OF A WOMAN'S BEATEN-UP FACE. CLOSE.
          Right eye bruised, swollen shut. Nose broken. Bloody gauze
          protrudes from her nostril. Lip cut and swollen like a plum.
          Gash over the right eye. Fear in her expression...
          Studying it is ASSISTANT D.A. MAGGIE McPHERSON, 30s. We're:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          INT. ARRAIGNMENT COURT - PROSECUTOR'S TABLE - LATER

          Maggie's in a navy suit, raven-black hair: smart and strong
          and a beauty. Coming up behind her--

                         MICK
          Are you the prosecutor who used to
          have the Roulet case?
          She starts to smile-- until his emphasis registers.

                         MAGGIE
          Don't tell me. Son of a bitch,
          Haller.

                         MICK
          Rules are rules.

                         MAGGIE
          I wanted this one...

                         (YIELDS)
          Alright I'll go quietly. But after
          today's hearing, if you don't
          object.

                         MICK
          Depends. You going for no-bail?

                         MAGGIE
          That won't change with the
          prosecutor. Not with what your guy
          did.
          With which she shows him the photo: gruesome.

                         MICK
          If he did it.

                         MAGGIE
          Sure. "If." They only picked him up
          in her home with blood all over
          him, but it's a valid question...

                         MICK
          I love it when you're sarcastic.
          Can I at least see the arrest
          report?

                         MAGGIE
          Get it from whoever takes over. No
          favors on this one.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Mick looks admiringly at Maggie. At her passion.

                         MICK
          How's Hayley?
          A beat. Off the sudden shift in topic, Maggie starts putting
          away the things on her desk...

                         MAGGIE
          She's good. She likes the things
          you send her but would rather you
          show up yourself...

                         MICK
          How about this weekend?
          This takes her by surprise. But she takes him up on it.

                         MAGGIE
          Okay, I'll tell Hayley. Tonight.
          Only Mick-- don't cancel on her.

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - LATER

          A TV CAMERA is trained toward LOUIS in the HOLDING AREA, he
          tries avoiding it... while MICK AND MAGGIE are ARGUING IN

          FRONT OF THE JUDGE...

                         MICK
          Judge, there is no way the state
          can claim my client is a flight

                         RISK--

                         MAGGIE
          With resources like this man has,
          it's always a risk-- let alone the
          fact that the victim was brutally

                         ASSAULTED--

                         JUDGE
          Ms. McPherson, the extent of her
          injuries are not the point. I'm
          setting bail at a million
          dollars...
          Mick wins, Maggie loses. Exchange glances--

          WE'RE-- INT. DOORS TO THE COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Mick bangs out, always moving. Getting the door for him is
          his friend, bail bondsman "VAL" VALENZUELA, excited--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         VAL
          What'd I tell you, Mick, we got us
          a franchise...

                         MICK
          We'll see, Val...

                         VAL
          There's the lawyer-guy, you get him
          to go for the cash-bond...
          MOVING from Val, Mick HEADS DOWN THE HALL, through the BUSY
          CRUSH of attorneys, clients, spectators to-- DOBBS, waiting.

                         MICK
          Cecil Dobbs?

                         DOBBS
          Mr. Haller.
          (They shake hands.)
          It was depressing to see the boy
          caught up in that cattle call...

                         MICK
          Boy?

                         DOBBS
          I've represented the family so long
          I think of Louis that way.

                         MICK
          He did look a little frail. My
          advice is, let Mr. Valenzuela fix
          you up with a bond and take "the
          boy" home.

                         DOBBS
          A bond? But Mrs. Windsor was
          thinking of putting up property...

                         MICK
          No good. Assessing it will take
          days. By then Louis might be
          carrying somebody's child.
          (before Dobbs can argue)
          So just tap Val for the bond,
          spring Louis, and take him to your
          office. We'll meet there at Four.
          And heads off again. Dobbs follows him out, to...

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

          EXT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE, DAY - MICK AND DOBBS

          Sunlight. Where Dobbs suddenly TENSES as he SEES: A TV
          CAMERAMAN coming out with camera. Off Dobbs's reaction--

                         MICK
          Yep. Media's already picked us up.

                         DOBBS
          Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about the
          press...
          Mick, a beat. Then calls the cameraman over. When he comes--

                         MICK
          I saw you in there filming. What's
          your name?

                         CAMERAMAN
          Rob Gillen. They call me "Sticks."

                         MICK
          You freelancing on this, Sticks?

                         STICKS
          Your client's got profile, I figure
          I can sell it to local news.

                         MICK
          How much?

                         STICKS
          'Scuse me?

                         MICK
          How much will they pay you for what
          you shot today?

                         STICKS
          That depends. Seven, seven-fifty.

                         MICK
          Suppose we take it off your hands
          for eight.
          Sticks hesitates, like it's not the legit thing to do.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Or do we make it a thousand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          Sticks hesitates no longer. Takes the tape from the camera
          and hands it to Mick... who's already counting out money from
          the roll of cash Ted gave him. To Dobbs--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I can expense this, right?

                         DOS
          Of course. Absolutely.
          Sticks takes the money, goes. Dobbs, impressed, beaming now--

                         DOBBS (CONT'D)
          I'll admit, Mr. Haller, you weren't
          my choice. You were Louis's.
          Frankly I'd never heard of you. But
          maybe I should have. Seems to me
          I've underestimated you.

                         MICK
          Then let's talk about my fees.
          (before Dobbs can reply)
          I'll need a hundred thousand up
          front. Working off five-fifty an
          hour, it'll come to another hundred
          thousand if we go to trial. That's
          estimating the trial at a week.
          Appeals, we start over.
          Mick's Lincoln pulls up smoothly to fetch him at the curb.
          Mick, hand on the door--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I take it that's not a problem.
          Reaction Dobbs-- hesitates but has no choice. MICK GETS IN,

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          How'd it go, Mickey? We get the
          case?

                         MICK
          (into his cell)
          We've got it if we want it. I'd
          still like to know the state's
          case, what they've got on him...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          What's the difference? 'Course we
          want the case...
          Mick says nothing. Gaze out the window. Then...

                         MICK
          I've got an hour til he's released.
          Til then I'll be at county. With
          Gloria.
          (before she says anything)
          Any calls?

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          Only Sticks. He says he owes you
          five hundred next time he sees you.

                         MICK
          Yeah he does.

          INT. VISITING AREA, COUNTY DETENTION CENTER, DAY - ON:


                         GLORIA
          Mickey Mantle. You're going to bat
          for me again?
          GLORIA, redhead, 27 but good looks already fading-- greets
           the arriving Mick in a client/attorney booth.

                         MICK
          You don't even know who the Mick
          was. You don't look good, Gloria.

                         GLORIA
          Thanks. For coming, not for the
          compliment.
          Mick's already paging through her arrest-sheet, sees...

                         MICK
          Something new for you, getting
          booked on possession of coke, along
          with the usual.

                         GLORIA
          Dumb, I know. A guy paid me with
          it, I had it on me when I went to
          my next.

                         MICK
          And your next was a cop.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          She shrugs/nods. Mick keeps turning pages, looking for a
          break... while...

                         GLORIA
          Can't you get me into one of those
          rehab places where they get you
          straight?

                         MICK
          We did a pre-trial rehab, last
          time. The D.A. won't go for it
          again. You may have to do some jail
          here.

                         GLORIA
          I can't.

                         MICK
          Yeah you can. They've got programs
          in jail, too. Look, you've had a
          long run. Maybe after this you can
          finally get out of the life.

                         GLORIA
          And do what? Have kids and plant
          flowers? Look at me.
          Mick doesn't have an answer. Opens a notebook, gets to work.

                         MICK
          Okay, tell me what happened.

                         GLORIA
          I did a guy at the Travel Lodge on
          Santa Monica...

                         MICK
          The one who paid you coke instead
          of money?

                         GLORIA
          He had a shitload in there. I saw.
          Which gets Mick's attention. His wheels suddenly turning...

                         MICK
          Do you know who he was?

                         GLORIA
          No. He reached me on my website. He
          was Mexican or something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         MICK
          (writes, likes this--)
          Did you screen him?

                         GLORIA
          Don't I screen 'em all?

                         MICK
          off what, his driver's license?

                         GLORIA
          No, his passport. I think his name
          was, Hector, or--

                         MICK
          Hector what? Last name. Think.

          INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING, L.A. - D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY


                         MICK
          Moya. Hector "Arrande" Moya is what
          you get if you run a trace. He's
          Colombian, a fugitive from a Grand
          Jury indictment down in Florida.
          The DEA wants him for drug
          trafficking.
          The D.A.'s LESLIE FAIRE: a woman, well-dressed, humorless.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Leslie? They want him a lot.

                         LESLIE FAIRE
          And your girl's looking to trade?

                         MICK
          She'll give you his motel and room
          number.

                         LESLIE FAIRE
          She'll also have to testify on the
          coke.

                         MICK
          That's a No. Location only. Your
          guys take it from there. My
          investigator says Hector hasn't
          checked out yet.

                         LESLIE FAIRE
          (as she weighs it)
          What's she want in exchange?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         MICK
          You drop charges, and all she does
          is a Pre-trial Rehabilitation. The
          facility at USC-Med would be nice.
          (when she hesitates)
          Or do I take this straight to the
          Feds?
          Which, though veiled, is a threat. Leslie hates this.

           INT. DOBBS'S CENTURY CITY LAW OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           HIGH FLOOR, TALL WINDOWS. DOBBS, ON THE CUT, lets in MICK.
           Mick's checking the impressive room, vast views all the way
           to the Pacific, as the OTHERS enter behind him: MARY WINDSOR
          (distinguished, 60), LOUIS (suit, silk t-shirt, Ray-bans.)
          Another man, 45, thickly built, enters at Mick's side.

                         MICK
          Mrs. Windsor, this is Raul Levin.
          Mr. Levin's my investigator.
          Accepting this, everyone takes their place at the long,
          blonde-wood conference table. Mick can't help run his hand
          over the surface, everything's a contrast to his own on-the-
          fly office... Dobbs, to Mrs. Windsor...

                         DOBBS
          Mrs. Windsor, I can't commend Mr.
          Haller highly enough for his
          performance in court this morning.
          Mary Windsor nods, provisionally pleased.

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I have a check for you, Mr. Haller.
          And slides it towards him in an envelope. Mick, tries not to
          seem too much in a hurry as he glances inside--
          ANGLE, we glimpse the amount, the zeroes... $100,000... BUT:

                         MICK
          I'm going to need that to come from
          your son, Mrs. Windsor.
          (slides it back to her)
          You can give him the money so he
          can write the check. But I want the
          check to come from Louis. He's my
          client and that's got to be clear
          from the start. No offense.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.
          She is offended-- but takes back the envelope, nods to LOUIS.
          He takes out a checkbook, writes. Mick continues to Mary--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Thank you. I'll expect you to
          support your son through this in
          other ways. If you're willing.

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Don't be silly. I'll back my son
          come hell or high water. These
          ridiculous charges. That ridiculous
          woman.

                         MICK
          It's good to know you'll be there
          when we need you.

                         MARY WINDSOR
          But not now, is that it?

                         MICK
          We'll be going over the case. The
          D.A. could make you testify about
          what you hear. Attorney privilege
          doesn't cover you.
          Mary Windsor's motionless a moment. Rather than respond, she
          simply rises. To Louis--

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I will see you at dinner.
          And goes. Dobbs gets the door for her. When she's gone:

                         LOUIS
          My mother built a good business.
          From the ground up.

                         MICK
          I've got no trouble believing that.
          (after a beat)
          I say we get started.
          All agree, they sit, Mick starts up--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Our first choice is whether we
          waive our right to a speedy trial.

                         LOUIS
          No. I want this behind me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         MICK
          You sure? You can stretch things
          out, enjoy your freedom. Most
          clients...

                         LOUIS
          Guilty clients, you mean. I want
          this over.
          Mick's struck by how firm.

                         MICK
          Fine. We go to trial right away.
          Puts more pressure on the D.A.

                         DOBBS
          Or maybe the case never even goes
          to trial.
          (They look at him.)
          Our firm's clout is considerable.
          Pressure can be brought to bear--

          MI C K
          Don't kid yourself, Cecil.
          (to Dobbs and Louis)
          No way the state is dropping these
          charges. In fact, they've already
          upped them-- to improve their
          negotiating position.

                         LOUIS
          There won't be any negotiating.
          (before Mick can speak)
          No plea bargain, no nothing. I'm
          not going to jail for something I
          didn't do.

                         MICK
          It might not be jail.

                         LOUIS
          Even if I walk. I'm innocent and if
          there's a trial I want to get on
          the stand and tell the jury I'm
          innocent. If that's a problem we
          can part company right now.
          Mick looks at the young man. Evaluating. Then...

                         MICK
          Time to tell me what happened.
          Louis. Removes his Ray-Bans. SUDDENLY:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

          WE'RE IN A BAR (MORGAN'S, STUDIO CITY)... NIGHT...
          CAMERA MOVES among L.A. yuppies, night-players. The scene's
          low-key but sexy, expensive... Waitresses roam...

          LOUIS (V.O.)
          I was having a drink at Morgan's,
          Ventura Boulevard...

          MICK (V.0.)
          Morgan's, that's a singles bar,
          right?
          Camera finds LOUIS at the bar, checking out the action...

          LOUIS (V.O. )
          Right, nice place, good for pick-
          ups. That's why I was there.
          Looking to get laid, pure and
          simple.

          BACK TO, LAW OFFICE
          Mick, to Raul, who's holding a dark blue file:

                         MICK
          Raul, what's the file say about the
          girl?

                         RAUL
          (reads-- Chicago accent)
          Regina Campo, goes by "Reggie."
          Twenty six. An actress and a
          telephone solicitor.

                         DOBBS
          And hoping to retire. Soon as she
          sues my client.

                         MICK
          (ignores Dobbs; to Louis)
          Did you know her before last night?

          BACK TO, MORGAN'S, NIGHT... HAND-HELD, CLOSE ON...
          REGGIE CAMPO, mid-20s, the finest sexual kitten imaginable,
          humor enlivening her face and eyes and mouth, moving...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

          LOUIS (V.O.)
          I'd seen her around, but never
          spoke to her. She was always with a
          guy. She was with one last night.
          She slows as she passes Louis, whispers, her lips brush his
          face as she discreetly hands him something...
          LOUIS (V. O.) (con t' d)
          She just laid her address on me. On
          a napkin.

          MICK (V.0.)
          But she was still with a guy?
          Reggie returns to: THE GUY at the bar: 40s, hard like a vet.

          LOUIS (V.0.)
          I got it that she wasn't too into
          her date. She told me he'd be gone
          by ten if I was interested.

          BACK TO, LAW OFFICE

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I didn't keep the napkin. I work in
          real estate, I remember addresses.

                         MICK
          Raul. Check that file you've got
          and see if the Police report has
          any of this.
          While Raul looks, Mick explains to Louis and Dobbs, can't
          hide some professional pride in Raul Levin's work--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Raul's already worked us a little
          miracle. He's managed to score a
          copy of the discovery file,
          everything the D.A.'s got. They'd
          have to turn it over eventually but
          it could have been weeks.
          Under which, Raul's checked the blue file, and...

                         RAUL
          Nope. They don't have the other
          guy. They don't even have the bar.

                         MICK
          All they've got is, Louis shows up
          and beats the crap out of her?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         RAUL
          That's it.

                         LOUIS
          That is such bullshit--

                         MICK
          Just keep telling me.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, REGGIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX... NIGHT...

          LOUIS is sitting in a Porsche Carrera...

          LOUIS (V.0.)
          I didn't want to walk in on
          anything, so I got there early.
          His POV, shadow-figure of Hard-Guy approaching in the dark..

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I waited til the guy came out.

          MICK (V.0.)
          You see what he was driving?

          LOUIS (V.0.)
          A Corvette. Yellow.
          Hard-Guy gets in the Corvette, pulls out.

          MICK (V.0.)
          So he leaves, and you go in...

          INT. HALLWAY/ DOOR TO REGGIE'S APARTMENT... HAND-HELD...

          Arriving up the stairs is Louis, knocks. A little while, and
          the door opens a crack. Reggie, part of her face, peers out.

          LOUIS (V.O.)
          She saw it was me...

          CONTINUOUS AS LOUIS ENTERS HER APARTMENT...
          LOUIS (V. O.) (coast' d)
          The hallway inside was tight. I had
          to walk past her, y'know, so she
          could close the door. So I had to
          turn my back to her.
          We SEE this, she's behind him... as we hear, simply...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Then, that was it.

          BACK SUDDENLY TO, LAW OFFICE. MICK, SURPRISED.

                         MICK
          What was what?

                         LOUIS
          She hit me with something and I
          went down. It got black fast.
          SUDDEN POP TO, LOUIS STRUCK FROM BEHIND... Blacking out as he
          tumbles... BACK TO,

          INT. LAW OFFICE

          Conference table's silent. All looking at Louis.

                         MICK
          Okay then. What do you remember
          next?

                         LOUIS
          Waking up with two guys sitting on
          me. Holding me down.

          QUICK CUT TO, REGGIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM...
          TWO GUYS straddle Louis who is face down on the floor.
          LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Couple of faggots from next door.

          BACK TO, LAW OFFICE

                         RAUL
          Police report has them, homosexual
          couple from down the hall...

                         LOUIS
          Like I said. Faggots.
          To which Raul says nothing. After a beat--

                         MICK
          Go on, Louis.

                         LOUIS
          I was still foggy when the cops
          came...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
           BACK TO, LIVING ROOM... Louis is cuffed by now, hands behind
          him, COP looms over...
           LOUIS (V.O.) (cont'd)
           She was on the couch telling all
          these lies...
           PARAMEDICS work on Reggie's bloodied face while, to a FEMALE
          COP (MAXWELL), through sobs, still frightened--

                         REGGIE
          .he was like an animal! He said
          he'd rape me and kill me... then
          rape me again when I was dead...
          Louis looks around at his left hand in a plastic ba Bloody.

          LOUIS (V.O. )
          That's when I saw she'd set it up.

          BACK TO, LAW OFFICE.

                         MICK
          Set it up how?

                         LOUIS
          Put blood on my hand. My left hand.
          But I'm right-handed, I'd use my
          right if I was going to... punch
          someone. Which is crazy.
          Louis mimes throwing a punch, in the air. Inept.

                         DOBBS
          Louis never hit anyone in his life.

                         RAUL
          What she did made sense. It's the
          right side of her face that was
          hit, she had to bloody your left.

                         MICK
          Louis: You said she opened the door
          a crack. Did you see her face?

                         LOUIS
          Not all of it...

          CUT TO, DOOR OF REGGIE'S APARTMENT... OPENING AGAIN...
          It open a crack. Enough for her look out, half her face...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Mainly her eye. Her left eye.

          RAUL (V.0.)
          That's it!...
          BACK TO, LAW OFFICE. Raul... mimes the opening of the door...

                         RAUL (CONT'D)
          She already had the injuries, on
          the right. She was hiding it from
          him when he steps in...

                         MICK
          And then she clocks him?

                         LOUIS
          Yes.

                         MICK
          So our case is, she beat herself
          up?
          Mick takes the file, takes the 8xl0s, REGGIE'S PULPED FACE...

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          We're saying, she pounded her face
          into hamburger meat, or had her
          boyfriend do it, hoping some far-
          off day a jury would give her a big
          fat reward?

                         LOUIS
          She must have.

                         DOBBS
          Of course. She saw his Porsche, his
          Rolex, it's known the family has
          money... I'll wager she's already
          filed in civil court.
          Mick. Thinks. Then, to Raul--

                         MICK
          Okay, the police report. Let's hear
          how Reggie tells it.

          CUT TO, INT. DOORWAY TO REGGIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          She's opened a crack, peering out... Raul reads...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          RAUL (V. 0. )
          "According to the victim, she was
          at home alone when the suspect
          presented himself at the door as
          someone she knew..."
          Louis is there, talks MOS. Reggie opens the rest of the way.
          RAUL (V.0.) (cont'd)
          "Upon letting him in, she was
          immediately struck..."
          WHICH WE SEE: The vicious repeated pounding of her face,
          bloodying her, but it's too fast & jumbled for details...

          MICK (V.0.)
          Does it say he knocked her down?
          She falls... Louis flies down on top of her...

          RAUL (V.0.)
          Yeah, then straddled her. "Held the
          victim by the neck until she agreed
          to cooperate..."
          Louis does as described, strangle-hold... Eventually lets her
          up, turning her toward the bedroom. And...
          RAUL (V.O.) (cont'd)
          "The suspect maintained a position
          behind her, holding a knife against
          the left side of her throat..."

          CLOSE, HAND-HELD, KNIFE-POINT TO NECK, SLIGHT CUT, BLOOD...

          RESUME, INT. LAW OFFICE.

          Raul takes something new from the file: PHOTO OF A BLOODY
          KNIFE. Sharpened to a point. Louis looks at it. Seethes.

                         LOUIS
          This isn't my knife.

                         MICK
          Raul, are his prints on there?

                         RAUL
          That's what the report says. I'm
          not surprised, if she put blood on
          his hands she's gonna put prints on
          his knife...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         LOUIS
          I told you, it's not "my" knife!
          Mick ignores, still intent on Raul's reading...

                         MICK
          Okay, how's she say he went down?

                         RAUL
          "As Ms. Campo entered the hallway,
          she pushed the intruder backwards
          into a large floor vase..."

          GO TO, INT. REGGIE'S APARTMENT - LOUIS FALLING...

          And Reggie scurrying free... STAY ON the fallen Louis as...

          RAUL (V.0.)
          "Realizing her attacker would catch
          her at the front door, she ducked
          into the kitchen and seized a
          bottle of vodka..."
          Louis, struggling to his feet, HIT ON THE HEAD from behind..

          MICK (V. D. )
          And clonked him when he got up?

          RAUL (V.0.)
          That's how she tells it.

          RESUME, INT. LAW OFFICE


                         LOUIS
          Those are all lies, this is bull--

                         MICK
          If everything she said is a lie,
          this will be the easiest case ever.
          I'll tear her apart and throw her
          entrails into the sea. But Louis...
          (He moves closer, for:)
          You swear it's all lies? Is there
          anything you aren't telling me?
          Mick's eyes burn into him. Louis answers simply.

                         LOUIS
          Nothing.
          Mick holds him in a long, hard, assessing stare. Over which,
          eventually, we PRE-LAP--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          MICK (V.O.)
          The way Louis tells it...

          INT. BAR (SMOKEHOUSE) - NIGHT - THE ENTRANCE


                         MICK
          .it's just quirky enough.
          Mick and Raul coming out, after having a few. It's a lawyers'
          hangout at this hour, others are coming/going...

                         RAUL
          Quirky enough for what?

                         MICK
          To be true. Maybe it went down just
          like he says.
          (off Raul's look)
          Anyway there's a. chance.
          In a party of law-types, we GLIMPSE MAGGIE, who catches sight
          of Mick in the doorway... while Raul mulls what Mick said...

                         RAUL
          An innocent client. Jeezus.

                         MICK
          Yeah. But you know what my father
          said about innocent clients...
          Maggie's overheard this, gives the answer.

                         MAGGIE
          He said there's no client as scary
          as an innocent man.
          Mick, seeing her, smiles and continues, a little tipsy...

                         MICK
          That's right. Because if you screw
          up and he goes to prison, it scars
          you for life. There's only one
          verdict. You've got to put an N.G.
          on the board.

                         (ADDS)
          Hey Mags.
          She reads the state he's in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         MAGGIE
          Raul, if you let a man drive in his
          condition I think I can charge you
          both.
          The guys look at each other. Maggie swipes the keys--

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          I'll drive him to his house.

                         RAUL
          And how will you get home?

                         MAGGIE
          My friends brought me. I'll keep
          the car, he can pick it up at my
          place in the morning.

                         (TO MICK)
          Get in.
          And she gets in the driver's side, waits. Mick to Raul--

                         MICK
          Okay, you know the moves. Make the
          rounds, check out Morgan's Bar...

                         RAUL
          And Mr. Corvette...

                         MICK
          And Regina Campo. The way Louis
          says she came on's got me
          wondering.
          Mick gets in and closes the door. As Maggie starts it up and
          pulls away, and we SEE the "NT GLTY" PLATES again... go to...

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Ride in silence. Then Mick, mischievous, turns on the RAP.

                         TUPAC
          "God bless the dead and buried
          nigga,
          Don't worry if you see God first,
          Tell him shit got worse..."

                         MAGGIE
          You've got to be kidding me.

                         MICK
          Earl lays this stuff on me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         MAGGIE
          Where is Earl tonight?

                         MICK
          I never keep him this late.

                         MAGGIE
          Hasn't he worked your fee off yet?

                         MICK
          A while ago. But he likes driving,
          keeps him out of trouble... He's
          taking courses, too, in music.

                         MAGGIE
          You can't tell by this stuff.
          She snaps the rap OFF.

                         MICK
          You get used to it. Besides, Tupac,
          he helps me understand my clients.
          Most of them go to school on his

                         LYRICS--

                         MAGGIE
          Not Roulet.

                         MICK
          Not Louis, no. Louis is my
          franchise player, he pays for all
          the rest...
          After a beat... Office gossip...

                         MAGGIE
          I heard Smithson assigned Ted
          Minton to your case.

                         MICK
          Never heard of him.

                         MAGGIE
          He's brand new. Bright, though.
          Smithson's protegee. Naturally.
          Georgetown, buys his suits at
          Brooks, above all he's a guy...
          Mick looks over at her, as she flares, calms... Moonlight
          lines her profile. Made self-conscious by his watching her,
          she moves her hair from her face. Beyond pretty: Beautiful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         MICK
          Lorna made me my schedule.
          Saturday's fine to take Hayley.

                         MAGGIE
          Saturday there's the Sponge-Bob
          movie...

                         MICK
          I'm all over it. How's she doing?

                         MAGGIE
          I'll know when I drop you and get
          home to relieve the sitter...
          (catches him looking)
          What?

                         (GLANCES)
          That's not doing me any good,
          Haller.

          EXT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE, LAUREL CANYON - DARK - NIGHT

          The Lincoln pulls up. Mick gets out but stands there.

                         MICK
          Thanks.
          She nods You're welcome. And pulls away. Mick's smile fades
          as he looks up at his dark lonely house.

          INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - ON:

          AN ANSWERING MACHINE, he's just hit Play. BEEP.

          VOICE OF A CHILD (HAYLEY)
          Daddy, Mommy said I could call and
          say G'night. Sorry you're not
          there. G'night, Daddy.

                         MICK
          Me too, baby.
          Then Mick hits "Play" again. BEEP.

          VOICE OF HAYLEY
          Daddy, Mommy said I could call...

          INT. COURTROOM, COMPTON COURTHOUSE - MORNING - ON:


          JUDGE FLYNN, 60
          (put-on Irish brogue)
          Top o' the mornin', Mr. McGinley!
          You know what day it is?
          Mick's client, DARIUS McGINLEY, black, 2B: In chains. Mick is
          beside him, as he answers, confused--

                         DARIUS
          The day I get my sentence?

                         JUDGE FLYNN
          That too. But it's also St.
          Patrick's Day. A day to revel in
          your Irish heritage.
          Darius doesn't get Flynn's joke. Mick cautions Darius, low--

                         MI CK
          He's an asshole but just be cool.
          Darius scowls... under which Mick notices that RAUL has
          showed up, is trying to get his attention... while...

                         JUDGE FLYNN
          Do you know the origin of your
          name, Mr. McGinley?

                         DARIUS
          Slave-holder, I 'spect. Why do I
          care who that motherfucka be?

                         MICK
          Darius I told you--

                         DARIUS
          The man's dissin' me!

                         JUDGE FLYNN

                         (GLARES)
          Alright: If you don't care about
          your name, then I don't.

                         (MORE)

          JUDGE FLYNN (cont'd)
          Let's get on with your sentence for
          the sale of rock cocaine and get
          you off to prison, shall we?
          Darius, pissed. Raul waves to Mick, wants to talk...

          INT. COMPTON COURTROOM - LATER - ANGLE...

          Darius led off by guards-- Mick, defeated, confronts Raul.

                         RAUL'S VOICE
          We caught a break. The owner had a
          camera installed to watch his
          register after he caught the help
          dipping in last year...

                         MICK'S VOICE
          And here comes Louis.

          I had the tape transferred to disc,

          Are you sure?

                         RAUL'S VOICE
          Wouldn't have popped a grand for

          Then... Here.
          Mr. X gets up, with pack of cigarettes, goes...

                         MICK'S VOICE
          I know the place. They got a
          smoking porch out front.

                         RAUL'S VOICE
          That's where he goese. Giving
          Reggie her chance. Watch her.
          She passes behind Louis, trails her hand along his
          shoulders... keeps going out of frame...

          MICI{' S VOICE
          That's not how he said it went
          down. He said she gave him her
          address, on a napkin...

                         RAUL'S VOICE
          Whoa, wait, she just went to the
          little girls'. But she's gotta come
          back, no?
          And NOW HE FAST-FORWARDS TAPE AGAIN... And this time she
          stops by Louis, speaks into his ear, presses her body against
          him... Louis nods, takes something from her... Reggie kisses
          his cheek quickly, continues on... Rejoins X at the bar.

          Do the cops have this?

                         RAUL
          How can they? I got the one and
          only. It ain't a copy.

                         MICK
          You're exceedingly beautiful.

                         RAUL

          Check out his hand, his watch.

                         MICK'S VOICE
          It's on his left. That's no good...

          INT. BACK SEAT, LINCOLN, DAY


                         MICK
          It means he's right-handed. But the
          facial blows were from the left...

                         RAUL
          Slow down. You said you knew
          Morgan's. So you oughta realize...
          (as Mick stares)
          This image is in the mirror over
          the bar. That's how the owner set
          the camera to watch his register.

                         MICK
          So everything's backwards...

                         RAUL
          And X punches with his left.

                         MICK
          I told you you were beautiful.
          Anything else?

                         RAUL
          Yeah. But it's not on the tape.
          You know how you were wondering
          about Regina?

                         MICK
          Yeah?
          Raul just looks at him. Off Mick,

          MICK exits, heads towards... into...

          INT. WINDSOR ESTATES, OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Behind the reception desk is ROBIN, tan/sexy blonde, hair
          hanging straight over one eye like a scythe...

                         MICK
          Mickey Haller. Here to see Louis.

                         ROBIN
          Mr. Roulet is with someone. He
          can't be disturbed.
          It's like he doesn't hear her-- walks calmly past her-- to --
          THE DOOR TO LOUIS ROULET'S OFFICE- Mick ENTERS, finds Louis
          with his loafers off, on the couch with his cell-phone
          cradled to his ear. Robin chases behind...

                         ROBIN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Roulet, this man
          just came back here--

                         LOUIS
          It's okay, Robin. You can go.
          Robin exits. Louis mutters an apology into his cell-phone and
          rings off. Looks annoyed at Mick.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I was setting up a showing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         MICK
          There won't be any showings in
          Pelican Bay.

                         LOUIS
          Where's that?

                         MICK
          It's a supermax prison where they
          send violent sex offenders. You'll
          fit in real good in your loafers.

                         LOUIS
          What's the matter?

                         MICK
          You lied to me, Louis. I'm about to
          go and see the new prosecutor,
          who's doing everything he can to
          put you away, and now I find out
          you've been lying.
          (before Louis can deny)
          Tell me about Reggie Campo.

                         LOUIS
          What about her? I've told you--

                         MICK
          You didn't tell me. That you were
          going to pay her for sex.
          (off Louis's surprise)
          You think it's hard to find out
          somebody's not Snow White?

                         LOUIS
          Alright yes, I was going to pay.
          She wrote down a price on the
          napkin, four hundred dollars...

                         MICK
          Why didn't you tell me this in
          Cecil's office?

                         LOUIS
          I didn't want my mother to know.
          Cecil tells her everything. And can
          we keep it down? Her office is on
          the other side of that door...
          Mick looks at Louis's concern. Believes it. Easing up...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         MICK
          This changes things. You see that,
          don't you?

                         LOUIS
          I'm not a lawyer. Explain it to me.

                         MICK
          Alright I will. You know that guy
          on the Venice boardwalk? The one
          who has all those plates spinning
          on sticks?

                         LOUIS
          What does this have to do with--

                         MICK
          Just listen. A bunch of spinning
          plates: that's the state's case. In
          the middle is a big one. It's a
          fucking platter. And if that falls
          it takes the others down with it.
          (He gets closer to Louis)
          The big plate is the victim. The
          only witness against you. I knock
          her down, the act is over and the
          crowd goes home. No trial.
          Mick has Louis' attention now.

                         LOUIS
          You can make this trial go away?

                         MICK
          We've lost time. You concealed from
          me the fact that could do it. It
          comes down to why.

                         LOUIS
          Why what?

                         MICK
          Why would a guy with a Porsche and
          a Rolex need a knife to get sex
          from a woman who sells it anyway?
          The answer is, he wouldn't. And
          when you see that you see the set-
          up, the trap. And suddenly it's the
          defendant who looks like the
          victim.
          Louis gets it. Penitent.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         LOUIS
          You're going to the prosecutor now?

                         MICK
          Yes. Young hot-shot named Ted
          Minton. He wants to give me the
          discovery file. Poor guy doesn't
          know that Raul already got it. He's
          new to felonies but he's no dope.
          When he hears his vic's a hooker
          he'll know we've knocked all his
          plates down.

                         LOUIS
          Then it'll be over?

                         MICK
          No promises, Louis.
          Louis closes his eyes, savors the prospect. Then sees Mick to
          the door. When he opens it: MARY WINDSOR's there. Surprised
          to see Haller.

          MRS. WINDSOR
          I didn't know you were here. Is
          there news?

                         LOUIS
          There will be, Mother.
          And puts out a hand to Mick. Grateful. Hesitating half a
          beat, Mick shakes it and goes...
          Louis and his Mother. Regard each other. Face to face.

          INT. VAN NUYS CIVIC CENTER - D.A.'S OFFICE, RECEPTION - DAY

          Mick in a chair. Impatient. Legal secretaries, prosecutors,
          etc., come and go, when-- a guy Mick recognizes, DETECTIVE
          KURLEN, fat, 40, approaches a desk with a stack of papers--

                         SECRETARY
          Are these for A.D.A. Knight?

                         KURLEN
          Yeah, and they're my only copies.
          I'll wait while you copy them.

                         SECRETARY
          I'll have to ask her...
          But, he holds them back. Stares. She yields...

                         SECRETARY (CONT'D)
          I'll run them for you now.

                         KURLEN
          Just what I wanted to hear.
          She goes. Mick tries to avoid Kurlen-- but too late--

                         KURLEN (CONT'D)
          Well, look who's come callin'.

                         MICK
          Detective Kurlen.

                         KURLEN
          (re papers he dropped off)
          Puttin' a case away. Guy drowned
          his neighbor's kid in a tub to see
          what it felt like. It won't shock
          you to hear he was high...

                         MICK
          Thanks for clearing that up.

                         KURLEN
          If he gets San Quentin, maybe he
          can look up your boy Jesus
          Martinez.
          Mick bristles at this reference. Turns away again. To a

                         PASSING SECRETARY:

                         MICK
          (to a passing secretary)
          Is Minton back yet?--

                         SECRETARY #2
          He'll be a few more minutes, sir.
          Kurlen, seeing he's drawn blood, continues to needle.

                         KURLEN
          How's he doin' up there, anyway? He
          make the pucker-up-and-kiss-me
          team?

                         MICK
          I haven't talked to him.

                         KURLEN
          I guess once they plead guilty,
          they're not much use to you.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         KURLEN (CONT'D)
          (rubbing it in)
          He went down forever, right?

                         MICK
          He got life, but he'll be out. I
          don't know when.

                         KURLEN
          Too bad. 'Cause his victim, Martha
          Renteria? She's dead forever.

                         MICK
          You don't have to remind me you
          were lead dick on that.
          Kurlen grins. Shakes his head.

                         KURLEN
          How's a guy like you sleep at
          night? With the scum you represent.
          Mick's had enough. Moves closer. To tell him a story.

                         MICK
          I had a client once, he decapitated
          his ex-wife, then kept her head in
          the refrigerator.

                         KURLEN

                         (DISGUSTED--)
          Naturally you got him off.

                         MICK
          The D.A. got greedy. Tried to pile
          on two unsolved murders, trick up
          evidence to stick my guy with them.
          It's called the justice system, we
          don't do things that way.

          KURT. EN
          So your guy's out walkin' around.
          He ever do it again?

                         MICK
          I don't know. I never heard of him
          after that.

                         KURLEN
          But he could have. Fuck you,
          Haller.

                         MICK

                         (THE POINT:)
          No. Fuck the D.A.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          Before Kurlen can react-- TED MINTON arrives. Fresh-faced,
          Ivy League, 30.

                         TED
          Mr. Haller?
          (Mick stands, relieved.)
          Sorry you had to wait. I hope it'll
          be worth your while.
          He gives Mick a thin, white-covered file from a briefcase.
          Mick, leaving the still-sneering Kurlen behind, takes the
          file and follows Minton off-- tapping the file with a finger--

                         MICK
          Looks kinda thin for a discovery

                         FILE--

                         TED
          Yes well-- We can go to my office--

                         MICK
          I've got a question first.
          He takes from his pocket: Raul's DISC. The DVD Raul gave him.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          You have something to play this on?

          INT. TED MINTON'S OFFICE - AT HIS DESK - MOMENTS LATER

          ANGLE the young prosecutor's face as he watches the bar-tape.
          And Mick watching him for his reaction...
          When it's done, Ted clicks it OFF. Not much reaction at all.

                         TED
          What else do you have?
          The simple, polite question throws Mick.

                         MICK
          Look Ted, let's cut the bullshit.
          Not only is your so-called victim a
          working prostitute, but we've got
          her on tape soliciting my client!
          Maybe you're new, but you gotta
          know how hard it's gonna be to
          convince a jury a guy would have to
          rape a hooker to have sex with her--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         TED
          Nothing you're telling me's going
          to change my offer.

                         MICK
          Offer? You're making an offer?
          going forward?
          Not the way Mick thought it would go. Ted goes on...

                         TED
          We'll drop the charges to Assault
          with a Deadly and Attempted Sexual
          Battery. The guidelines put him at
          seven years, maybe he'll do four.
          Mick, uncertain now, doubts himself for the first time...

                         MICK
          .What am I missing here?...
          Ted stays innocent-looking. Blank.

          EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - KID'S AREA, PONY RIDES - SATURDAY

          MICK with his daughter, HAYLEY, 8. Mick's ON A BENCH near
          where Hayley waits on line for the next pony...
          EARL approaches from the refreshment stand with an ice-cream
          for Hayley and one for himself. Kids playing everywhere, a
          MINIATURE TRAIN chugs past... but Mick's lost in thought, his
          beat-up briefcase open, he's working.

                         EARL
          Got you the good stuff, Hayley...

                         HAYLEY
          Thank you, Earl.
          Just then a little girl gets off a pony. The attendant holds
          it for Hayley.

                         EARL
          Man's got your ride ready...

                         MICK
          Go on, I'll hold your ice cream.
          Excited, Hayley goes. The attendant lifts her up and on, and
          The pony carrying Hayley joins the others in the wide ring...
          Mick watches her for a moment, waves-- then, balancing the
          ice cream, returns to his files--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          There's something right in front of
          me and I'm not seeing it.
          On his lap he's spread out: PAGES from the TWO FILES: the
          blue-covered one Raul gave him. The white-covered from Ted.
          Mick starts turning pages, compares... The same, the same...
          When he turns the next one over:
          It's the page Raul gave him showing the PICTURE OF A KNIFE,
          the picture we saw in Cecil Dobbs' office.
          Turns to the matching page from Ted's file. Reaction Mick...

          HARD CUT TO, EXT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - COUNTRY CLUB - LATER

          In the parking lot, pulls up. Louis is in front of the club,
          golf-clothes, waiting. Comes out to meet the Lincoln...

          INT. LINCOLN, BACK SEAT - SAME TIME


                         HAYLEY
          You said we',re going to the movies!
          You promised me last week!

                         MICK
          Daddy's got to talk to somebody.
          You stay with Earl.
          Mick gets out, Hayley stays...

          EXT. LINCOLN - CONTINUOUS

          Louis hurries over, as far from the clubhouse as possible, in
          order not to be seen or heard-- eager--

                         LOUIS
          What's happened? Is it over? You
          said it would be over by now--

                         MICK
          That was before I found out you
          were still lying to me.
          He shoves a sheet at Louis. Louis looks: PICTURE OF A KNIFE,
          but DIFFERENT from the knife-picture we saw before.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          You know what that is? It's a
          picture of your knife. The one you
          had on you when you went to Reggie
          Campos. The one the cops have.
          Look at the blood on the blade.
          Look at the initials.
          Louis is stuck for an answer--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          That's why Ted Minton didn't care
          when I told him Reggie's a
          prostitute. What's it matter, when
          he's got a knife with her blood and
          your initials on it?

                         LOUIS
          This wasn't the knife in the file--

                         MICK
          (scowls, sore)
          That's right. The file Raul got us
          was a loaded deck. The cops must
          have been on to him, because they
          used it to set us up. So we'd think
          they had nothing, when in fact they
          had enough to put your Hugo Boss,
          golf-playing ass away for twenty
          years!
          Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off.
          He sees HAYLEY in the backseat looking out. So does Louis.
          Mick sees him looking her way...
          Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back. Out of sight. A
          moment... then Mick resumes. Cold and firm.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Explain to me why you lied about
          the knife.

                         LOUIS
          I didn't lie. I said the one in the
          picture wasn't mine.
          Mick frowns/grins at the answer...

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I said it twice! Nobody listened!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         MICK

                         (MOCKING)
          What are you now, a lawyer? A
          clever, third-rate fucking lawyer
          with smart-ass technicalities? "You
          said it wasn't yours"-- What you
          should have said was, "I had a
          knife but this isn't it!" What did
          you think, it would just go away?
          (closing in on him)
          You brought a murder weapon to a
          meeting with a prostitute, Louis!
          How am I supposed to make that look
          like she set you up?

                         LOUIS
          1. Did. Not. Do this.
          Off which, Mick stares hard at Louis. At his frightened look.
          Then tries-- slowly-- as if for the last time--

                         MICK
          Then kindly tell me why you went to
          her apartment with a custom-made
          knife, serrated tip, with "LR"
          engraved on the blade?

                         LOUIS
          I always carry it.
          For a moment, Mick takes this in. Echoes.

                         MICK
          You always carry it.

                         LOUIS
          Yes. In real estate we show homes,
          to people we don't know. This one
          time...
          He stops. Like it's difficult. Then goes ahead...

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          My mother. She was showing a place.
          It was in Bel-Air, so she thought
          it was okay to go alone, even
          though there was a man at the time
          who had raped some women that way.
          He was there.

                         MICK
          Who was there?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         LOUIS
          The man. He raped her. When she
          didn't come back, I went to the
          house and found her.
          Mick. Stirs. Like he's seeing a possibility...

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          That's when she stopped showing
          property. I do the selling now. And
          I started carrying a knife. Always.
          Mick turns it over. Finally...

                         MICK
          That's quite a story, Louis.

                         (BEAT)
          Your mother will have to testify.

                         LOUIS
          We don't want that.

                         MICK

                         (COLD)
          I don't give a damn what you think
          we want. From now on you do what I
          tell you while I try this case. Do
          I make myself clear?
          Louis is silent. Mick looks off. Towards Hayley, in the car.

          INT. DOOR OPENING TO: MAGGIE'S HOUSE, STUDIO CITY - NIGHT

          ON THE CUT she OPENS TO MICK CARRYING HAYLEY IN HIS ARMSi
          fast asleep but still clutching a carton of movie popcorn...

          INT. KITCHEN

          Maggie leads Mick-with-Hayley through, Hayley snuggles
          further in her father's arms. As they continue...

                         MICK
          If she wasn't so darn heavy I'd
          carry her all night, I swear.

                         MAGGIE
          Defense lawyers will swear to
          anything...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

          INT. LIVING ROOM, LATER - MICK AND MAGGIE

          He's at the door about to go. Maggie delays him with,

                         MAGGIE
          You look like you're in a daze.

                         MICK
          It turned into a rough week. Being
          with Hayley was the only high.
          She can't find anything to say. As he heads out again...

                         MAGGIE
          Nobody's seen you at Four Green
          Fields lately.

                         MICK
          I stopped going. Too much of a
          scene.

                         MAGGIE
          Yeah well. If you start going
          again.
          Now she has his attention.

                         MICK
          If I start again, what?
          She's awkward. Smiles, shrugs to cover--

                         MAGGIE
          Bunch of us from the office are
          there. Tuesdays, after work.
          An invitation. S-zrprising him.

                         MICK
          I'll keep it in mind.

                         MAGGIE
          Okay.

                         MICK
          Okay.
          After more awkwardness, goes. She closes the door. CUT TO,

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          INT.'FOUR GREEN FIELDS' (LAWYERS' BAR) - MONDAY - EVENING

          Noisy, drinking CROWD of legal types-- We're MOVING through
          it-- Don't realize it at first but it's--
          MICK'S POV-- he's trying to shoulder his way through towards--
          A BOOTH OF WOMEN from Maggie's office--
          Maggie sees him, lights up a little--

                         MAGGIE
          Haller! Let him in, girls! Buy you
          a beer?

                         MICK
          You won't make it to the bar...

                         MAGGIE
          Then let's share this.
          They fight to a table for two, edge of the crowd. When he
          balks at sipping from her glass--

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          We've had a taste of each other
          before.
          He laughs a little, reads that she's had a few. He drinks.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Feeling a little better tonight? Or
          did Ted Minton sandbag you?

                         MICK
          (How'd she know?)
          Yeah, that's exactly what--

                         MAGGIE
          With that guy Corliss, right? I
          told them using that dirtbag was a
          bullshit play. But you'll take the
          the guy's head off on the stand...
          Mick's off-guard, doesn't know what she's talking about.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          (catches herself, giggles)
          Whoops, I shouldn't say that...

                         MICK
          (to keep it alive)
          So Ted talked to you about Corliss?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         MAGGIE
          Huh? It was me who sent him to Ted.
          Corliss thought it was my case
          because I handled first appearance.
          (sees Mick is too eager)
          I'm telling you too much.

                         MICK
          Nah, nothing I don't know, they
          always use a professional snitch...
          (when she doesn't bite)
          I mean Corliss has done this
          before, right?

                         MAGGIE
          (clams up, with:)
          Can't we just forget work and have
          a friendly Guiness?

                         MICK
          How about we go somewhere to eat?
          (before she objects)
          So we can talk about our daughter.

                         MAGGIE

                         (WEAKENS)
          Let me tell my friends I'm leaving.
          She goes. And Mick, quick, writes the name CORLISS on napkin.

          INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT - AT A TABLE:


                         MAGGIE
          I'll bet you didn't know Sponge-Bob
          movies could be so much fun.

                         MICK
          The fun's watching her.
          Maggie likes this. Touch glasses. After a quiet moment...

                         MAGGIE
          You didn't know Minton had Corliss
          til I blabbed, did you.

                         MICK
          He was hiding something, I thought
          it might be a jailhouse snitch...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         MAGGIE
          You got me drunk to find out what
          you wanted to know. Except I was
          already drunk. Good point, right?
          He feels something. ANGLE, her hand on his knee...

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Hayley's probably asleep. I gotta
          go relieve the sitter--
          (makes a face)
          Only I don't think I can drive
          myself home.

                         MICK
          one good turn. I'll drive you.

                         MAGGIE
          And will you take me back to get my
          car in the morning?
          A loaded proposition. Covers her hand with his own. CUT TO,

          INT. MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - THE BED - MORNING

          ANGLE HAYLEY, sleeping between her two parents. Mick opens
          his eyes: Maggie's awake and staring at him. Grim.

                         MAGGIE
          This is not fair to her.

                         (MICK STIRS--)
          Waking up and finding you here.
          She'll get her hopes up.

                         MICK
          How'd she get in here?

                         MAGGIE
          She comes in here when she has
          nightmares. She has nightmares.

                         MICK
          So she sleeps in here a lot?

                         MAGGIE
          Don't start. You have no idea what
          it's like raising a child alone.
          He can tell by her tone: All last night's tenderness gone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

          INT. GUEST BEDROOM DOWN THE HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          He's dressing-- she enters to him in a robe--

                         MICK
          Look-- I'll leave-- then come back
          in an hour. We'll go together to
          get your car then I can take her to

                         SCHOOL--

                         MAGGIE
          Just like that? You're gonna start
          taking her to school?

                         MICK
          Don't you remember what we talked
          about last night?

                         MAGGIE
          I thought you were just trying to
          get into my head on your case-- or
          get me into bed--

                         MICK
          (getting angry now)
          I can't win with you--

                         MAGGIE
          Not when you're being a defense
          lawyer! Do you know how crazy we
          were to think we could ever make
          it? Me trying to get dirtbags off
          the street, you keeping them there--

                         MICK

                         ALRIGHT MAGGIE--

                         MAGGIE
          Just go!

          INT. DINER (DUPAR'S) - MORNING - MICK AT THE COUNTER:

          Unshaven. Edward Hopper drabness. To lose himself in work,
          looks down at his files:
          An 8x10 OF REGGIE CAMPO'S BATTERED FACE.
          WAITRESS, 50s, pours coffee. Recoils as she glimpses the
          picture, the gruesome wounds, Mick didn't mean her to see.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         MICK
          Sorry. It's work.

                         WAITRESS
          I just hope you catch the bastard
          who did it to her.
          And goes. Mick tucks the picture under some papers, to hide
          it-- but finds that he's only hid it halfway. Leaving half
          her face exposed. The good half. Something about this... He
          picks it up again, folds it...

          INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Leaning over the sink, Mick holds the folded photo against
          the mirror, the unhurt left side showing. Creates a full
          image of a face. He stares a long time. Then, to himself:

                         MICK
          Martha Renteria.

          INT. ANGLE ON A WAREHOUSE-GARAGE DOOR RISING - FROM WITHIN

          Mick, enters. THREE LINCOLNS LINED UP along a wall. Mick's
           "fleet." California plates: NT GLTY 1, NT GLTY 3, NT GLTY
          4.. Walks past... to some battered file cabinets. He turns
          on a single-bulb lamp...
          DRAWER OPENING ON FILE CABINET... Mick's fingers fly through
          the tabs of old files, stops at: MARTINEZ.
          Cut to, MARTINEZ FILES ON DESK, MOMENTS LATER: Mick examines
          them: Police reports, printouts. Until he finds...
          Autopsy report. Name: RENTERIA, MARIA. Takes out... Bx10
          PHOTO: WOMAN DEAD ON A BED, NAKED. Dark bloodstains.
          NEXT PHOTO - TIGHTER: Knife-wounds. And bruises.
          NEXT PHOTO - HER FACE: BEATEN: Injuries to the left side
          (opposite of Reggie's.) Dark-haired, large brown eyes.
          MICK. Folds this one in half. Takes the folded shot of
          Reggie, fits them together, crease to crease: So alike, they
          form what could be the face of one woman.
          Mick. Not wanting to face the memory: a VOICE in his head:

                         MICK'S VOICE
          I wish you'd called me before you
          talked to the cops, Jesus...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          GO TO, INT. VAN NUYS JAIL, ATTORNEY/PRISONER ROOM - DAY

          FLASHBACK OF MICK WITH MARTINEZ, who's stalking around, in a
          panic, while Mick is laying out the bad news...

                         MARTINEZ

                         (MEXICAN ACCENT)
          I seen my picture every place! They
          was gonna bring me in, so...

                         MICK
          But you told Kurlen you were in her
          apartment. He didn't have that, he
          doesn't even have any prints...

                         MARTINEZ
          That shit I tol' is true, man! I
          seen her at the Cobra Room, she
          said if I paid we could go to her
          place, she didn't care about the
          other guy...

                         MICK
          Nobody saw any "other guy"...

                         MARTINEZ
          There was another guy, bpi guy that
          she was talking to...

                         MICK
          Plus the coroner says her vagina
          was brutalized...

                         MARTINEZ
          Are you my lawyer or what, man?
          (insists, crazy now)
          When I left that chick was fine! I
          fucked her but I didn't hurt her--
          You ain't even listenin'--

                         MICK
          Three people saw you throwing a
          knife into the L.A. River...

                         MARTINEZ
          'Cause I had that knife in my car!
          I knew they was gonna find it...

                         MICK
          If all you did was fuck her then
          why didn't you leave any prints?
          The place was wiped down...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          But your semen was on the towel,
          you forgot you wiped your penis on
          that towel...

                         MARTINEZ
          I didn't forget nothing! I jus'
          used that towel, then I give the
          chick the money and I left!

                         MICK
          It's not gonna make.

                         MARTINEZ
          Don't say that!

                         MICK
          Jesus they want the death penalty!
          I can see to it that never happens,
          but not if you don't plead.

                         MARTINEZ
          You want me to say I did this?
          Mick hesitates but stays level. Unbending. No choice.

                         MILK
          Jesus, there's a deal to be made. I
          can do that. I can get you Life.
          (Martinez crumples...)
          Life means you'll do fifteen...

                         MARTINEZ
          I'm innocent! Inocente! You know
          what that means?
          Mick just looks at him.

          EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, SAN FRANCISCO BAY - DAY

          Not much traffic rolling out of the city, mid-morning...

          INT. CAR NORTH OF THE BAY - DAY

          Mick at the wheel. Beside him, his briefcase. SEES OUT ON THE
          WATER: the prison-fortress of SAN QUENTIN.

          INT. VISITOR'S ROOM: GLASS-DIVIDED - SAN QUENTIN - LATER

          ON THE CUT, JESUS MARTINEZ sits. 29, only a few years older
          than when we saw him but looks bad. Glass wall divide them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         MICK
          I'm not going to ask you how you
          are because I know.
          Martinez glares at him, then spits on the floor.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Look. I need to ask some questions.

                         MARTINEZ
          you didn't have no questions then.
          Never ask, Did you kill that girl?

                         MICK
          I am trying to make it right.
          Martinez is silent. Cold.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Tell me again about the Cobra Room.

                         MARTINEZ
          Tell you what?

          CUT TO, INT. COBRA ROOM - NIGHT

          The black-light Latina club, music, smoke-- In the middle is
          a pit iwith a BIG COBRA BASKET, out of which a girl in a
          snake costume emerges-- MARTHA. Watching is MARTINEZ--
          MARTINEZ (V.0.) (cont'd)
          She was workin'. Dancin'.
          LATER, AFTER THE ACT-- Camera finds Renteria half-curling
          herself around MARTINEZ--
          MARTINEZ (V.0.) (cont' d)
          Then she came and talked to me...
          She's whispering, Martinez is loving it--
          MARTINEZ (V.0.) (cont'd)
          She tol' me I could take her home.
          I did, but I didn't kill her.

          MICK (V.O.)
          You said there was another guy...
          Disentangling from Martinez, Martha slides toward a MAN,
          TALL, his back to us...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

          MARTINEZ (V.0.)
          Si, she talk to him too, but she
          come back to me.
          Though she's with the other man, she glances back at Jesus...

          RESUME, INT. VISITING, SAN QUENTIN

          Mick opens his briefcase, takes out a stack of photos. One by
          one holds them against the glass with his fingers... WHEN:

          SPEAKER (GUARD'S VOICE)

          GET BACK FROM THE GLASS. OR THE

          INTERVIEW WILL BE TERMINATED.
          Frustrated, Mick complies-- but calls--

                         MICK
          Guard!
          Long beat. Guard enters. Clean-Marine. Mick shows the stack.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I need him to look at these.

                         GUARD
          You can't give him anything.

                         MICK
          But if you won't let him close to
          the glass, how can he see them?

                         GUARD
          That's not my problem.

                         MICK
          All right, but can you stay a
          minute? If he IDs one of these mug-
          shots I need you to witness it.

                         GUARD
          Don't drag me into your bullshit.
          And goes.

                         MICK
          Godammit.
          (then, to Martinez)
          Try. See if one is the guy.
          Mick holds up one after another. Martinez shakes his head no--
          Then the booking photo of Louis Roulet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          Mick holds it up. Off Jesus, as his eyes narrow...

          EXT. AIRLINER LANDING, BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

          PRE-LAP the YELPING/SNARLING of a small /fierce dog... We're:

          INT. RAUL LEVIN'S BUNGALOW, GLENDALE - EVENING

          Raul in shorts, lets Mick in over the barks of his Shih-Tzu.

                         RAUL
          Cool it, Ahab... C'mon in, Mick...
          Leaves Mick alone while he puts out the dog--
          Mick cools his heels. Takes in: Cubs pennant, Raul's old
          peaked policeman's cap, mounted... finally pours himself a
          vodka. Notes the photo of a YOUNGER GUY, its frame hung with
          the "Fight Aids" ribbon. Raul re-enters.

                         MICK
          (re the drink)
          I helped myself.

                         RAUL
          It's okay. I owe you, the way I let
          you down on that discovery file--

                         MICK
          It wasn't you. The cops set you up.
          Who was it slipped you the file,
          anyway?

                         RAUL
          Some guy in vice I play cards with.
          Lonnie Fry. You don't know him.

                         MICK
          You're right, I don't. But I know
          who his partner was, when he was in
          homicide. Kurlen.

                         RAUL
          That prick. I'll make him sorry.

                         MICK
          Don't bother. We've got bigger
          problems.
          The way Mick says it. Raul sits, asks--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         RAUL
          Like what? Where were you today
          anyway? You were hard to reach...

                         MICK
          Cell phones don't work too well
          where I was.
          Raul waits. Knows this is why Mick came here.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I came to tell you a story. About
          Jesus Martinez.

                         RAUL
          You were at San Quentin.

                         MICK
          It's about what happened after he
          left Martha Renteria's apartment.

                         RAUL
          After he killed her?

                         MICK
          He never killed her. He went there,
          had sex, flushed the condom--

                         RAUL
          Wiped his prick on the pink towel--

                         MICK
          And then went home. The story
          starts after he left.

                         RAUL

                         (GETS IT)
          The real killer.

                         MICK
          The real killer. She lets him in.

          CUT TO, INT. MARTHA RENTERIA' S APARTMENT - NIGHT


                         MICK
          Maybe he fakes like it's still
          Martinez and he forgot something.
          Or maybe it was an appointment...
          We see the door open but we don't see who enters...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          RAUL (V.O.)
          The other guy from the club? The
          one Jesus said he bid against?

          NICK (V.0.)
          Right. He comes in, punches her a
          few times to soften her up...
          Renteria staggers as she's suddenly pummeled, then spun...
          NICK (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Then takes out a knife and holds it
          to her neck while he walks her to
          the bedroom...
          We SEE the knife-tip against her throat...
          MICK (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Only she isn't lucky like Reggie
          Campo will be. He climbs on top,
          puts on a condom, rapes her...
          CUT TO, BEDROOM, as Mick gives us the action...
          MICK (V.0.) (cont'd)
          And when he's done he stabs her
          over and over, fifty-two times,
          while he works out something in his
          sick fucking mind.
          We SEE, the stabbing, bleeding, then--

          RESUME, INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW


                         MICK
          Do you need to ask what kind of
          knife it was, based on the wounds?

                         RAUL
          A short-blade folding knife...

                         MICK
          Or whose face Martinez picked out
          of the mug-shots I brought him?
          No. No need. A beat. Raul's dog barks from outside.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Of course the story goes on from
          there. From there it's about the
          lawyer Martinez gets himself...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         RAUL
          Don't do this to yourself...

                         MICK
          (ignores, on a roll now)
          The lawyer who just assumes he did
          it because of the DNA. The lawyer
          who gets him the best deal he can,
          and feels pretty good, because the
          deal keeps his client off Death
          Row... and this guy, this lawyer,
          he's all about the deal, see?

                         RAUL
          Mick-- You can't beat yourself up
          for what you didn't know--

                         MICK
          I just saw him and he's twenty-six
          going on forty. He's a little guy.
          You know what happens to the little
          ones up there.
          A beat. Mick drinks.

                         MICK (CONT'D)

                         (SUDDENLY)
          He has a type. Roulet. It's more
          than a type, Renteria and Campo,
          you put their faces together you
          get the same face...

                         RAUL
          (off the drink Mick takes)
          You better take it easy...

                         MICK
          Listen, I was thinking about this
          the whole way down on the plane--
          That night with Renteria? It was
          like he hit the jackpot-- got to do
          his thing and get away with it.
          Then he's in a bar, sees Reggie--

                         RAUL
          Who he's seen before, remember--

                         MICK
          Yeah but tonight he sees who she
          looks like.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         RAUL
          Renteria?

                         MICK
          Right. And he's right back there.

                         RAUL

                         (DOUBTFUL--)
          Mick, we're talking about a really

                         STRANGE--

                         MICK
          We're talking about a killer at
          work. You know that video from the
          bar? Just like you, he saw that Mr.
          X was left-handed.

                         RAUL
          (struck by this)
          Smart as the devil--

                         MICK
          He knows what he's doing. Reggie's
          the luckiest woman alive.

                         RAUL
          You think there are others? With
          that face, or--

                         MICK
          You find out. Dig into Roulet.
          (recalls...)
          "All you'll find is parking
          tickets," I don't buy that anymore.
          Check out knife-murders of women.
          Not just the unsolved ones, Martha
          Renteria was a closed case.

                         RAUL
          Look man, I can't throw a net like
          that. I'm just one guy! You gotta
          bring the cops in.

                         MICK
          I can't. He's my client.
          (clear on this:)
          That's why he hired me.
          Raul looks up, startled by this. Mick lays it out...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I was thinking about that on the
          plane too: He was worried I might
          hear about the case and put it
          together. But if he was my client,
          I'd be bound to keep my mouth shut
          and protect him.

                         RAUL

                         (SEES)
          Attorney-client privilege.

                         MICK
          I told you: He knows what he's
          doing.

                         RAUL
          You got one guy in prison for what
          your other client did. What are you
          going to do, Mick?
          A beat.

                         MICK
          I'm working on it.

          CUT TO, EXT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

          Lincoln in front. Mick, working on Raul's question. Trudges
          up the steps. PHONE RINGS before he gets in, he fumbles keys--

          INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN... AS HE ANSWERS...


                         MICK
          This is Haller...

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          Did you get my messages?

                         MICK
          Maggie, no, I was up in San
          Francisco for the day...

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          No you weren't. You don't go to San
          Francisco, you go to San Quentin.
          Must have been seeing a client...

                         MICK
          You always were too smart for me.
          Is Hayley okay?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          She's good. Look, she's playing
          soccer tomorrow, and she wants you
          to come to the match. You've
          started something, Mickey...

                         MICK
          Fine, I look forward to it.

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          You'll need to pick her up at noon.
          But, under this, he sees, DOWN THE HALLWAY, light from a
          room. Sudden chill. Angling to see, keeping a normal voice...

                         MICK
          Noon, I'll do that. See you then.
          And hangs up before she can say goodbye.. And Stops. Freezes.
          Eyes on the LIGHT at the end of the hall. Carefully, Mick
          begins to move down the hall...
          Pauses at the door he comes to first, bedroom, dark...
          Kicks it-- Nothing. starts walking again, when: there's a
          SOUND. Then silence. What was it?... Mick continues-- to--
          The LIT ROOM: SIDE ANGLE, we see it's the den-- Mick braces--
          And BURSTS IN SUDDENLY:

          INT. DEN - LOUIS IS THERE...

          Sitting in Mick's chair, leg up on the desk...

                         MICK
          What the hell are you doing here?

                         LOUIS
          Funny thing is I've been here
          before. I was offered the house to
          show, never gave back the key--

                         MICK
          (over,doesn't give a shit)
          Get out of my house! Now!

                         LOUIS
          (rising, but)

                         EASY MICK--
          But, sees Mick noticing-- the ELECTRONIC ANKLET on his leg--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Your friend Valenzuela put this on.
          A tracer. As if I were going
          anywhere.

                         MICK
          I said Get up! Get up and get out
          of this house!
          Off Mick's force, Mick's almost crazy-- Louis smirks, goes--

          EXT. FRONT DOOR, PORCH - MOMENT LATER, AS THEY COME OUT...


                         LOUIS
          (turns to him, to

                         "EXPLAIN")
          I couldn't reach you! I'm on trial
          for my life, Mick, and I get
          nervous when I can't reach yout
          And you were away all day. Like you
          told "Maggie."
          Meaning he listened to the call. Mick goes white.

                         MICK
          You don't come near this house
          again, do you understand me? We
          aren't friends, we aren't partners,
          you're my client, eriod--

                         LOUIS
          Just what I wanted to remind you
          of. I'm your client.
          Mick reacts. Louis lets in sink in, then:

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Besides, I like it in your house,
          Mick... Pretty pictures of your
          kid, Hayley...

                         MICK
          Fucken don't.

                         LOUIS
          Don't what, don't say she's pretty?
          But I saw her, the other day at the
          club...
          At which, Mick's had enough: belts Louis in the mouth. Quick,
          solid.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          His lip bloodied, Louis flashes with anger-- but then, just
          as suddenly, he steels himself. Glares coldly at Mick.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Okay. Okay I'm going. But--
          And extends his hand: with Mick's house-key in it.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          --first I think I should give you
          back your key. It isn't right that
          I have it. Now that we can trust
          each other.
          Mick takes the key. Panting, he watches Louis go down the
          fucking steps.

          SUDDEN CUT TO,, EXT. ON HAYLEY: SOCCER MATCH IN PROGRESS

          Hayley, defending, scrambles to get in the way of another
          girl, a forward, dribbling towards her...
          ANGLE MICK, on the sideline... among other parents...

                         MICK
          That's it, Hayley, get in her way!
          Hayley isn't quick enough, the forward dribbles round her,
          goes in for the score. Hayley looks despondently at Mick--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          It's okay, honey!
          When-- his CELL-PHONE RINGS. Into it--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          This is Haller...
          He strains to listen... Stops cold. His look darkens... Even
          from the field, Hayley sees this...

          CUT TO, INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW - DAY

          MOVING ON THE CUT, WITH MICK, as he ENTERS... It's a CRIME
          SCENE, swarms with cops, forensics, technicians...
          Mick distressed, moves as if through heavy water. DETECTIVES
          are leading him: LANKFORD, 38, clean-marine-- and HEIDI
          SOBEL, 30. They wear paper booties, thin rubber gloves...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         LANKFORD
          Levin was back in his office...

                         SOBEL
          We wouldn't have found him if a
          neighbor hadn't brought the dog
          back. It was running loose.

                         LANKFORD
          (shows a desk calendar)
          Your name's all over this. Were you
          the only guy he worked for?

                         MICK
          No, but I've got a big trial next
          month, attempted rape and murder.
          He was helping me.

                         SOBEL
          Is that the Roulet case?

                         MICK
          How did you know?

                         SOBEL
          Because every file that's been
          rifled has the name.

                         LANKFORD
          Only thing, Roulet himself is
          already cleared for this. We've
          checked the tracking on his tracer-
          anklet and it doesn't show him
          anywhere near this place. And
          there's no way to trick those
          things, no way in the world.
          We see Mick register this-- wants to ask about it, but before

                         HE CAN--

                         LANKFORD (CONT'D)
          By the way, Counsellor, where were
          you this morning?
          Mick rocked by the question. What it means.

                         MICK
          I'm a suspect?

                         SOBEL
          He knew whoever shot him. There are
          no signs of forcible, he even let
          the killer into the back room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         MICK
          I was watching my daughter play
          soccer. A couple of dozen people
          can confirm I was there.
          Provisionally buying this, Lankford takes out booties.

                         LANKFORD
          Put these on and don't touch
          anything back there.

          INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW - HOME OFFICE

          Raul face down on the floor, in front of his desk chair.

                         SOBEL
          Can you tell us if you see anything
          unusual?
          Mick draws close. Lankford, abruptly--

                         LANKFORD
          All I see are pictures of a guy.
          Was he a fruit?

                         MICK

                         (BITTER)
          He was a hell of an ex-cop, is what
          he was. Crimes Against Persons,
          back in Chicago. And yeah he was
          gay, and what the hell's that got
          to do with it? If the murder was
          some kind of gay thing, why'd they
          ransack the office? Isn't it
          obvious they were looking for
          something to do with his work?
          Lankford can't argue with this. When Sobel, near the body:

                         SOBEL
          Look. The position of his hands.
          ANGLE: Two middle fingers point down. Two outside fingers up.

                         LANKFORD
          Was this guy a Longhorns fan or
          what? Or is it some kind of sign,
          like he was trying to tell us who

                         SHOT HIM--

                         (MAKES "HORNS")
          --"The devil did it?"

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

           EXT. MOVING ANGLE ON: SUBURBAN HOUSES (VALENCIA) - EVENING

           Seen from the POV OF--

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - MICK AT THE WHEEL - SAME TIME

          He drives the street, his focus pumped up... until he comes
          to: A HOUSE, its garage door wide open. Mick pulls into the
          drive behind it...

          INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - MICK ENTERS

          What he FINDS inside, beside a family van, is a LARGE THIN
          CARDBOARD BOX... It's upright, marked "Fragile."

          EXT. HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Mick stands there KNOCKING at the door. It's opened by:

                         VAL
          Hey Mick!
          Val's surprised... a mix of emotions...

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          What're you doin' here?... and I
          heard about Raul Levin, man...

                         MICK
          (ignores all that)
          You know your garage door's open?

                         VAL
          Shit: I just had a plasma
          delivered...
          And rushes to... the GARAGE. Mick trails... Val's relieved to
          find the box is okay.

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          Oh man, if we still lived in Van
          Nuys this sucker'd be gone. Set me
          back eight grand, too. But it's
          gonna be great for the games...
          (notes Mick's silent mood)
          What's up anyway? What brings you
          out here?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         MICK
          Raul's murder.
          (Val waits, listens.)
          I've been with the cops. They can't
          tie Roulet to it, because your
          ankle bracelet doesn't put him near
          the house.

                         VAL
          I know, I gave them the trace. The
          bracelet's got a mass detector,
          there's no way to beat that.

                         MICK
          Did the cops ask you where you were
          this morning, Val?
          Val's slow at first, to register just what Mick's asking...

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Somehow, some way, Louis killed
          Raul Levin. And it didn't show up
          on the trace.
          Mick looks at the plasma TV, then back at Val. Val reddens--

                         VAL
          You better not be sayin' what I
          think-- that I cut him loose-- to
          let him kill Raul--?

                         MICK
          Maybe you didn't know what he was
          going to do--

                         VAL
          (over, angry--)
          You think I'd let that happen? For
          a fuckin' TV?
          And he lunges at Mick, shoves him back agains the van, Mick
          shoves back, harder, backwards into the TV box-- it hits the
          cement floor, hard, and Val falls on top of it--
          Sickening snap/crunch from within the box--

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          Shit, man--

                         MICK
          Where'd you get the money for an
          eight thousand dollar TV, Val?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         VAL
          That's bullshit! I didn't do that!
          How dare you say that to me-- I'm
          inocente, man--
          Mick reacts to the word-- Martinez's word-- as Val glares at
          him from the ground.

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          Get outa here; Get out of here,
          Mick, and get outa my life!
          Mick's already backing off-- towards the car--

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          Keep going, man!
          Mick keeps going-- down the drive and into his car-- CUT TO,

          INT. FOUR GREEN FIELDS - NIGHT - MICK AT THE BAR...

          Drinking, CAMERA moves on him, he taps the glass for another.
          Bartender comes over like he's going to pour one. Mick's keys
          are on the bar--
          Instead of pouring the bartender swipes the keys. Mick looks
          at him, uncomprehending.

                         BARTENDER
          That's it. You're done here, pal.
          And you're not driving either.
          (shows keys, keeps them)
          Call yourself a cab or something.
          Off Mick,

          INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          MAGGIE, lugs him into his room, he's a mess...

                         MAGGIE
          Being married to you sucked but it
          beat being a car service...

                         MICK
          That's the idea, y'know. Car
          service, with the Lincolns-- Drive
          the illustrious turds of our city
          back and forth to LAX--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         MAGGIE
          I'll be your first customer. First
          dollar.
          And rolls him onto the bed. He looks at her. Drunk as he is:

                         MICK
          Lemme ask you something. Corliss.
          The name Corliss. You didn't just
          give me that just because you'd
          been drinking. You wanted me to
          have it.
          She doesn't confirm or deny. Just gets him into bed-- says

                         POINTEDLY--

                         MAGGGIE
          I'm not staying.
          He knows, but-- one thing more--

                         MICK
          Maggie-- Raul. Did I get him
          killed?
          Moved, she shakes her head no. Straightens his pillow.

                         MAGGIE
          How do you do it, Haller? You're a
          sleazy defense lawyer with two ex-
          wives and a daughter, and we all
          still love you.
          We STAY ON HIM as she stands up, goes. To no one:

                         MICK
          I can't do this anymore.

          INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

          He's in bad shape as he comes out of the bedroom. Stares at
          the light pouring in from the glass doors onto the porch.
          Finds: THERE'S A DOLLAR TAPED TO THE GLASS. (From Maggie.)
          Also: the MESSAGE LIGHT ON HIS PHONE is ON.
          MOMENTS LATER: He's pressed the button, listens to...

                         MACHINE VOICE
          Message received: YESTERDAY, ELEVEN-

          SEVEN A.M.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         RAUL'S VOICE
          Mick, it's me. Guess I missed you.
          Wanted to go over a few things, so
          I wouldn't interrupt your day with
          Hayley. Anyway...
          Presses STOP. Raul's voice: Mick's not sure he can deal. But
          pulls the pencil & pad near him, and presses START again...
          RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd)
          First, that witness name you gave
          me. Corliss? Turns out he's this
          hype, Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss,
          sometimes goes by "DJ." When you
          run it that way you find out he's
          played the courtroom snitch a lot,
          mostly in Arizona. But here's the
          thing: One time down there? It blew
          up on him. I'm working on it, it
          can be good for us... Don't know
          how we get to him, though. They
          put him in USC lock-up, just to
          make it harder...
          Under which Mick, excited, is writing down D J CORLISS...
          ARIZONA... then USC, circles this last...
           RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd)
          Other thing is, you asked me to dig
          deep-on Roulet? Mick, I found
          something. I found Martinez' ticket
          out of the Q.
          When, on the tape he hears DOG BARKING... and a DOOR BELL...
          RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd)
          Uh, that's somebody at the door...
          Look, have a good time with your
          kid. Gotta go, boss.
          And MESSAGE goes OFF. Mick thinks a moment. Tries to clear
          his head. Then pulls out a card and dials a number...

          The message came at Eleven-oh-

          Looks down at his notes. At "Corliss." "USC." A beat. As he
          tears off the note, stuffs it in his pocket...

                         MICK
          No-- No, that's it. Then the dog
          barked, somebody was at the door.
          He hung up.
          (before she can ask more)
          Look, maybe you can tell me if
          there's any progress on the case.
          (when she hesitates)
          He was my friend.
          Sobel, makes a decision...

                         SOBEL
          Well, we did catch a break. We
          found a bullet casing in the room,
          from a 22. It turns out Levin owned
          a .22, but when we checked it out
          it wasn't a Woodsman, like the gun
          that killed him...
          To which, Mick reacts... as she goes on...

                         SOBEL (CONT'D)
          The other thing is we can't find
          his cell-phone...
          (noticing Mick is silent)
          Are you still there?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         MICK
          Yeah... just, I'll let you know if
          I think of anything. About his cell-
          phone, I mean. Thanks.
          And hangs up. Too sudden. Leaves Sobel wondering...

          CUT TO, MICK MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH HIS HOUSE...
          Down the hall, to a closet, climbs clumsily above to a shelf--
          Tossing clothes out of the way... Finds: AN OLD WOODEN GUN
          BOX. The top has a brass plate: COLT "WOODSMAN."
          Mick, in a cold sweat, opens the box. It's EMPTY. Suddenly--

          EXT. HOUSE - MICK STEPS OUT ONTO THE PORCH...

          For air-- He can hardly breathe-- straightens his thoughts--
          Takes the note from his pocket, studies it.

          INT. USC-COUNTY LOCK-UP - MOVING WITH MICK...

          GUARD leads him DOWN A HALL... leads him to a room and leaves
          him there.
          With GLORIA. In prison jumper. Faint smile.

                         MICK
          Gloria I'm not here about you. I'm
          here about me. I need your help.

          FADE OUT.

          FADE IN: THE FACE OF LOUIS ROULET - INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

          Louis, lanky, graceful, takes a seat at the DEFENSE TABLE.
          Mick, sorts papers. Louis, turns, seems to watch him...
          ANGLES, THE GALLERY: DOBBS and MARY WINDSOR, she's on edge
          but hides-- Also LORNA, to support Mick. While, AT THE TABLE:

                         LOUIS
          Mick. I want to tell you something
          before we start.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         MICK
          Better make it fast.

                         LOUIS
          You're my lawyer, right? So I can
          tell you anything, even a crime
          I've committed, and you have to
          keep it secret.

                         MICK
          (a beat, uncomfortable--)
          That's right. Unless it's one
          you're going to commit.

                         LOUIS
          I've killed people, Mick.
          Reaction Mick. Just then, Courtroom clerk gives a warning--

                         COURTROOM CLERK
          Two minutes, people...

                         MICK

                         (TO LOUIS)
          Now? Now? Why now, are you telling
          me this...

                         LOUIS
          Because I know your plan.
          Mick looks at him. Before he can deny--

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Your plan is to defend me on this--
          then, when I'm not your client,
          throw me to the cops.
          (when Mick says nothing)
          I can't let that happen. So I'm
          telling you: I've killed people and
          guess what? Martha Renteria was one
          of them. There now. If you use what
          I've told you you might get Jesus
          Martinez out of jail, but you'll
          never practice law again. And I'll
          never be prosecuted. I think it's
          called fruits of the poisoned tree--

                         MICK
          Come with me.
          Cuts Louis off, rises, leads him... past prosecution table,
          TED MINTON turns, watches them... as Mick leads Louis out to--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

          INT. ENTRY VESTIBULE, DOUBLE DOORS - CONTINUOUS

          He suddenly spins on Louis and puts him against a wall.

                         MICK
          You son of a bitch. You killed
          Raul.

                         LOUIS
          You're right about one thing. I am
          a son of a bitch.

                         MICK
          How did you do it? The trace said
          you weren't even in Glendale...

                         LOUIS
          He was getting too close.

                         MICK
          (yanks Louis's lapels)
          You piece of shit, do you think you
          have this wired? You don't!

                         LOUIS
          I do have an insurance policy.
          He grabs Mick's wrists. Strong: pulls them off his chest.

                         MICK
          I want my gun, Louis--

                         LOUIS
          I walk away from this trial a free
          man-- and remain free-- and it
          never falls into wrong hands.
          The deal. Mick's close to hitting him-- when the door opens--

                         COURTROOM CLERK
          Judge Fullbright is on the bench.

          INT. COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER - MICK AND LOUIS ENTER...


                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Nice of you to join us...
          She's 46, bad hair, tough. Mick's off on the wrong foot.

                         MICK
          I'm sorry, your honor.

                         TED
          What this case is about is a
          predator... On the night of March
          Sixth, Louis Roulet was out
          stalking his prey...
          Jury of twelve, two alternates...

                         TED (CONT'D)
          You are going to hear from the
          victim herself about her lifestyle,
          one that we would not condone. But
          remember that anyone, anyone, can
          be the victim of a violent crime.
          (approaches the jury box)
          The case is clear. Straightforward.
          A man attacked a woman in her home
          in order to rape and kill her.
          It is only by the grace of God that
          she's here to tell you the story.
          Over Ted,

          Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

          My name's Michael Haller, and I'm
          representing Louis Roulet.
          (glances at Ted)
          Mr. Minton doesn't want to use the
          word prostitute for the woman who's
          supposed to be Louis's victim. He
          needn't worry, this case isn't
          about how she makes her money...
          But it is about her actions. How
          she saw a young man with signs of
          wealth, and chose to target him...
          (closes in on the jury...)
          What she didn't count on, was you.
          The fact that you'd put two and two
          together, and let your common sense
          tell you who was the real predator.

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - LATER

          As Mick exits with Lorna for the lunch-break. Low-voiced--

                         LORNA
          You had a message from Gloria. She
          thinks she can do what you asked.

                         MICK
          Thinks?

                         LORNA
          Corliss has the same meal time. She
          can try.

                         MICK

                         (DISCOURAGED)
          Let her try. But it may not matter.

                         LORNA
          What do you mean?

                         MICK
          I mean, Corliss isn't on the
          witness list. It could be Ted
          Minton is holding him back. He
          won't use him until he has to.
          Until I screw up his case so bad he
          has no choice.

                         LORNA
          Mickey? Can you do that?
          Off Mick, tries for a confident smile...

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM, LATER - ON THE STAND:


          FEMALE COP (MAXWELL)
          I'd describe Ms. Campo when we got
          there as... hurt and frightened...

                         TED
          Frightened?

                         OFFICER MAXWELL
          She kept asking us if she was safe,
          even after Roulet was taken away.

          Mick has Maxwell on cross... Clerk hands her pages...

                         MICK
          Officer, would you read from your
          arrest report where it's marked?

                         OFFICER MAXWELL
          "The victim does not know the man
          who assaulted her or why she was
          attacked."

                         MICK
          Why did you write that she didn't
          know him?

                         OFFICER MAXWELL
          Because that's what she said.

                         MICK
          So, she just opened the door at ten
          o'clock to a stranger?

                         OFFICER MAXWELL
          She didn't put it like that...

                         MICK
          Was there blood on his right hand?

                         OFFICER MAXWELL
          (confused by the shift)
          No, his left. Or we would have
          bagged his right one, too.

          INT. CAMERA TRAILS THE JURY...

          As a new witness is on the stand, Ted's witness...

                         TED
          Mr. Talbot, you were with Miss
          Campo on the night of March Sixth?
          CHARLES TALBOT, 48, the customer from the video. Blurred
          tattoos on muscled forearms, dyed blonde hair.

                         TALBOT
          Yep. Had a date with her at
          Morgan's. Then from there we went
          to her place and had another date,
          if you know what I mean.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          B5.
          Air of a sleaze-ball sex-player, but calm and good-humored.

                         TED
          Had you known Miss Campo before?

                         TALBOT
          Nope. Just called her up.

                         TED
          How did you know to call her?

                         TALBOT
          From her website. She's got a real
          good website.
          Jury laughs a little. Fascinated but repulsed by this guy...
          but Fullbright stirs, disliking Talbot's tone...

                         TED
          Did you have sexual relations?

                         TALBOT
          Four hundred bucks worth. And she
          earned every cent.
          Angle a male JUROR, red-faced with disapproval. Mick catches
          his reaction, likes it. Ted goes on...

                         TED
          And what time did you leave?

                         TALBOT
          About five minutes before ten.

                         TED
          She say she had another engagement?

                         TALBOT
          No, she acted like she was done for
          the night...

                         MICK
          Objection, I don't think Mr.
          Talbot's qualified to interpret Ms.
          Campo's thinking or plans...

                         TALBOT
          I just mean she acted satisfied...

                         (OFFENDED--)
          Sustained! Go on, Mr. Minton.

                         TED
          When you left, what condition was
          she in? Was she hurt?

                         TALBOT
          No, she was fit as a fiddle. I know
          because I'd just played her.
          (before Fullbright bursts)
          Sorry, your honor. She was fine.
          Minton goes, lifts a sheet over an easel, REVEALS the blown-
          up PHOTOS of the Reggie's battered face.

                         TED
          She didn't look like this?

                         TALBOT
          Man. What kind of bastard does
          something like that?

                         FULLBRIGHT
          Answer the question.

                         TALBOT
          No. We made consensual and
          pleasurable love. Which is what
          life is all about. Then I paid her.

          CUT TO, MICK HAS TALBOT ON CROSS...

          handed?

                         TALBOT
          Left.

                         MICK
          Left. And isn't it true that before
          you left Regina Campo asked you to
          strike her repeatedly in the face?

                         (OBJECTING)
          Your honor, there's no basis for
          this sort of questioning. Mr.
          Haller is just muddying the waters
          with outrageous statements.
          Fullbright looks to Mick for a reply. Mick half-shrugs...

          The witness can answer.

                         TALBOT
          I never hit her or any other woman.

          Shaquille Barton? "Shaquilla
          Shakels" is her work name.

                         TALBOT
          Okay, yeah. I seen her one time...

                         MICK
          And if I brought her here and she
          said you had struck her with your
          left hand...

                         TALBOT
          She'd be lying. I tried Shaquilla,
          that rough stuff's not for me. I'm
          a missionary man.

                         MICK
          With a strong left. Thank you.
          And Mick sits-- drawing a nasty look from Ted for this last,
          and a pleased one from Louis. CUT TO,

          INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Where Mick, as he exits the courtroom for the day, is

          SURPRISED TO FIND: DETECTIVES LANKFORD AND SOBEL WAITING FOR
          HIM. Sobel holds documents. Reaction Mick: Oh shit.

          CUT TO, INT. BACK SEAT, DETECTIVES' CAR (MOVING) - LATER

          Mick looks over the pages Sobel hands him. Lankford drives.

                         MICK
          This warrant is bullshit--

                         LANKFORD
          Good enough to search your house.
          For a Woodsman registered to you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          BB.

                         SOBEL
          We need to run ballistics on it.
          She turns around: The good cop, but she's hurt:

                         SOBEL (CONT'D)
          It would have been better if you'd
          told me that you had a Woodsman.

                         MICK
          I don't anymore. It was stolen.
          The worst yet. Lankford laughs: "How convenient..."

          INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - LATER - ON:

          The BOX FOR THE WOODSMAN: Sobel in gloves, examines, while--

                         LANKFORD
          We got the history on the piece.
          Turns out it belonged to Mickey
          Cohen the gangster, in the forties.

                         MICK
          I know. My father represented him.
          He got him off for using it in self-
          defense, so Cohen made him a
          present of it.
          Sobel, careful, opens it... It's empty. Like Mick said.

                         SOBEL
          Why didn't you report it stolen?

                         MICK
          Because I knew who took it.
          (They look at him.)
          A client. He told me, so I couldn't
          turn him in without breaking a
          trust. They do that.

                         LANKFORD
          (doesn't buy this)
          Still and all, mind if I look
          around? Just in case you haven't
          had time to toss it off a pier?

                         MICK
          Go crazy. You've got the warrant.
          Lankford sneers, starts for the next room. To Sobel--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         LANKFORD
          Heidi-- bag the box.
          He leaves. As she bags it-- He wonders why.

                         MICK
          You can't do ballistics on a box.
          She glances, seeing Lankford's gone-- explains.

                         SOBEL
          That old Mickey Cohen shooting?
          It's kind of famous. It turns out
          the county still has the evidence
          in storage. The bullet.

                         MICK
          You can match casings to a slug
          that's fifty years old?

                         SOBEL
          It'd be easier with the gun, but
          yeah.
          She goes to join her partner. Mick stops her with--

                         MICK
          Detective? How long will ballistics
          take?

                         SOBEL
          Careful. You'll make me think
          you're worried what we'll find.

                         MICK
          I'm in the middle of a trial.

                         SOBEL
          A day. Maybe forty-eight hours.
          She leaves. Mick's gaze, in the mirror: Fear.

          INT. COURTROOM - NEXT MORNING - ARRIVING...

          Mick and Ted, at the same time. As they move to the front...

                         TED
          Morning, Haller. Word is, you had
          interesting visitors last night...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         MICK
          Worry about yourself, Ted. You're
          dying the death of a thousand
          razors up there and you don't even
          know it.
          They peel off-- Mick to the defense table, where Louis waits
          for him. Before Louis can speak: Low--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Listen, you little shit: This gun-
          scheme of yours is about to blow
          up, and I'm not going down for it.
          If I have to drive people to the
          airport the rest of my life.
          Mick is seething. Louis smiles. Unruffled.

          INT. COURTROOM, LATER - TED RISES...


                         TED
          One last witness, your honor. The
          prosecution calls Regina Campo.

          INT. COURTROOM, LATER - REGGIE ON THE STAND...

          Diminutive, conservative dress, dark curls around her pretty
          face-- none of the aggressive sexiness. Hesitant but frank.

                         REGGIE
          It's true that I lied. I knew him
          when he came to the door.

                         TED
          In fact, you'd arranged his coming
          Miss Campo: why did you lie?

                         REGGIE
          I was scared. I wasn't sure the
          police would believe me and I
          wanted to make sure they arrested
          him... because he's an animal...
          She looks tentatively at Louis, as if still scared-- then she
          looks away. Louis is blank. Mick takes it in. Ted follows up--

                         TED
          Do you regret that decision now?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         REGGIE
          Yes. If it helps him to get free
          and do this to somebody else.

                         MICK
          Your honor, prejudicial--

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Sustained.
          But ANGLE THE JURY: the damage is done. Reggie's moved them.

                         TED
          I have no further questions for
          Regina, your honor.
          Ted sits.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Your witness, Mr. Haller.
          Mick about to rise when-- Louis grabs his hand. Low-voiced----

                         LOUIS
          I want to remind you of your words.
          You were going to tear her apart
          and throw her entrails into the
          sea.

                         MICK
          That's it, keep acting like you
          pull the strings.

                         LOUIS
          I do.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Haller.
          Emphatic. Mick frees his hand, straightens himself. watched
          by Louis. Then all at once, to surprise her--

                         MICK
          Ms. Campo have you engaged an
          attorney to sue Mr. Roulet for the
          events of March Sixth?

                         REGGIE
          (recovers,
          No I haven't.

                         MICK
          But have you talked to an attorney?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         REGGIE
          I haven't hired anybody or--

                         MICK
          I asked if you talked to one. About
          a possible lawsuit.
          Mick's crisp like he knows for sure. She wilts a little.

                         REGGIE
          It was nothing more than talk...

                         MICK
          Did you ask if you could sue Mr.
          Roulet for damages?

                         REGGIE
          I thought what you say to lawyers
          is private.

                         MICK
          If you wish, you can tell the
          jurors.
          Faces her. Ted squirms, seeing the box she's in.

                         REGGIE
          I think I want to keep it private.
          Ted squirms again. Wrong answer.

                         MICK
          Okay, let's go back to the night at
          Morgan's. Had you ever seen Louis
          Roulet before that night?

                         REGGIE
          Yes. There and other places.

                         MICK
          Ever noticed he wore a Rolex watch?

                         REGGIE

                         NO--

                         MICK
          Or that he drove one of two cars, a
          Porsche or a Range Rover?

                         REGGIE
          I never saw him driving.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         MICK
          And what made you approach him?

                         REGGIE
          I knew he was in the life. You
          know. A player. I had seen him
          leave with girls who do what I do.

                         MICK
          With prostitutes. To go to a hotel,
          or their apartments...?

                         REGGIE
          I don't know where.

                         MICK
          So how do you know they left? Maybe
          they just went out for a smoke...

                         REGGIE
          Because they got in his car and
          drove away.

                         MICK
          But you just testified that you
          never saw Mr. Roulet drive! Now you
          saw him leave with a prostitute
          like yourself. Which is it?
          The contradiction rings round the room. Reggie, tries...

                         REGGIE
          I saw him get in a car but I didn't
          know what kind it was.

                         MICK
          Do you know the difference between
          a Porsche and a Range Rover?

                         REGGIE
          one's big and one's small, I guess.
          Reactions... Reggie shakes her head, knows she's not making
          it... But Mick, like he's just getting started...

                         MICK
          The women he left with, when you
          saw them again, had they been
          beaten or injured?

                         REGGIE
          I don't know, I didn't ask.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         MICK
          But girls in your profession talk
          about customers, don't you? Warn
          each other if someone's a freak...

                         REGGIE
          Yeah, usually...

                         MICK
          And how many had warned you about
          Louis Roulet?

                         REGGIE
          None. No one.

                         MICK
          So you believed you'd be safe?

                         REGGIE
          I, thought he was a known quantity
          and I needed the money, so...

                         MICK
          So you thought he could solve your
          need for money?

                         REGGIE

                         NO--

                         MICK
          No? Isn't that why we're sitting
          here? Because you zeroed in on him?

                         REGGIE
          No! I mean yes, but not like that--
          (looking round, a plea to

                         BE BELIEVED)
          He attacked me, I swear!

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM, LATER - ON A VIDEO PLAYING:

          The BAR TAPE, blown-up projection, SHOWS REGGIE PASSES LOUIS

          SITTING AT THE BAR, LEANS HER BODY INTO HIM SEXILY...
          ANGLE COURTROOM, ON REGGIE watching the tape. Also JURORS,
          reacting, enthralled, and Mick watching them...

          RESUME ANGLE SCREEN, REGGIE HANDS LOUIS A NAPKIN, PASSES BY.
          RESUME COURT, Mick signals the TECHNICIAN. It goes OFF.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         MICK
          What did the napkin say, Ms. Campo?

                         REGGIE
          My name and address...

                         MICK
          And your price?

                         REGGIE
          Yes. Four hundred dollars.

                         MICK
          (after a beat)
          It's a hard line of work...

                         REGGIE
          And dangerous.

                         MICK
          In fact, haven't you told friends
          you were looking for a way out?

                         REGGIE
          Yes. I'm not proud of what I do--

                         MICK
          And so, isn't it true-- nothing
          would be easier to understand--
          that you saw Louis Roulet and his
          money as a way out?

                         REGGIE
          No! That's not what this is about!
          That man hit me and tried to kill
          me.

                         MICK
          Yes, we've heard you say that--

                         (TO FULLBRIGHT)
          Judge may I ask the witness to
          stand up?

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          (surprised, but)
          The witness will stand. I hope
          you're going somewhere with this,
          Mr. Haller.
          Reggie stands.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         MICK
          Now if you please, walk over to my
          client.
          She goes, stands before Louis. Who rises on cue from Mick.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          This is the man you broke free
          from, overpowered, knocked out?

                         REGGIE
          Yes-- You can do amazing things
          when you're afraid--

                         MICK
          How much do you weigh, Ms. Campo?
          Because your website REGGIE-FOR-FUN-
          DOT-COM says one hundred three...

                         REGGIE
          That's right.
          A beat. Louis sits. Reggie stands there... suddenly cries.

                         MICK
          I've got no further questions for
          the witness, your honor.
          Reggie returns to a seat behind the prosecutor's table. Where
          we pick up TED MINTON. Staring at Mick, hiding the sense of
          damage as best he can... He's startled when:

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Minton? Do you have another
          witness for us?
          Ted rouses, summons confidence, rises...
          WHILE, ASIDE, Louis to Mick, re Ted...

                         LOUIS
          He looks worried.
          Mick watching Ted, waits, tense...

                         TED
          The state rests, your honor.
          Mick's disappointed: No Corliss.

                         MICK
          Not worried enough.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          (raises a gavel...)
          Then the defense will call its
          first witness after lunch.
          And the gavel comes down.

          INT. COURTROOM, AFTER THE BREAK - MICK, ON DIRECT, HAS...


                         MARY WINDSOR
          Yes, I recognize this knife.
          (holding an evidence bag)
          It's the one my son carried with
          him for protection for the last
          four years. Almost exactly.

                         MICK
          Why would he need protection?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Because realtors alone in a house
          are sometimes robbed or hurt...
          Even raped or murdered.

                         MICK
          But has Louis ever been the subject
          of such a crime?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          No. But he knew someone who...
          (hesitates...)

                         MICK
          Go on, please.

                         MARY WINDSOR
          She was raped and robbed by a man.
          Louis found her. It was terrible.
          The first thing he did afterwards
          was get himself a knife to carry,
          at all times.
          (looks at Ted Minton)
          March Sixth would have been no
          different.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          INT. COURTROOM, LATER - TED HAS MARY WINDSOR ON CROSS...


                         TED
          Mrs. Windsor, you seemed pretty
          exact, about when your son started
          carrying around this, this weapon,
          a five-inch folding knife...

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I am. The incident took place on
          June ninth, two-thousand-one.
          Mick watches Ted, carefully... Cat and mouse...

                         TED
          Was it in the newspapers?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          No.

                         TED
          Or, do you somehow remember because
          the police came to talk to Louis...

                         MARY WINDSOR
          There was no police investigation.

                         TED
          Then how can you remember the exact
          date so well?
          (sly look at Mick)
          Were you given the date before
          testifying here?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I know the date because I'll never
          forget the day I was attacked.
          The news falls on Ted. She goes on before he can rally...
          MARY WINDSOR (cont'd)
          Louis will never forget it either.
          He found me in that house, tied up.
          Naked. It was traumatic for him.
          She's perfect: a strong woman, unused to showing emotion.
          Mick smiles, impressed. When, with some sarcasm:

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Minton-- anything else?
          Ted, still thrown, stares down at his notes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         TED
          As Louis's mother, you'd do or say
          anything to save him, wouldn't you?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I wouldn't lie. Not about what
          happened that day...

                         TED
          We have no police or hospital
          record that it even occurred...

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I never reported it...

                         TED
          Why not?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I was ashamed. If you don't
          understand that I can't explain it
          to you. And yet I live with it
          every day.

                         TED
          But it's only you who says so:
          Mary looks at Ted, and at the Judge, as if confused:

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Is that a question?
          Off Mick, admiring, GO TO,

          INT. COURTROOM - POST-ADJOURNMENT, END OF DAY...

          Mick packing his stuff-- looks up, as Ted approaches.

                         TED
          I've been thinking about the
          thousand razors.

          EXT. COURTHOUSE - MINUTES LATER

          Louis waits on the steps, Mick comes out. Where they're
          alone...

                         MICK
          We've had an offer. Want to spend
          six months in county jail?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         LOUIS
          I told you from the beginning--

                         MICK
          I know: The only verdict's Not
          Guilty. Okay. We'll get there.
          Grateful for this, Louis puts a hand on Mick's arm. But:

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Don't touch me, Louis. You want to
          show your gratitude give me my gun
          back.
          Louis grins: meaning No way.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I thought so.

                         (THEN)
          You still sure you want me to put
          you on the stand?

                         LOUIS
          I insist on it.

                         MICK
          Then get some rest tonight, you're
          up next.
          Leaving Louis, Mick continues down the steps, to where the
          Lincoln waits. He gets in.

          INT. LINCOLN - CONTINUOUS

          Earl in the front seat.

                         MICK
          There's something I need you to get
          me, Earl.
          A tone Earl never heard him use before. Earl turns around.

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - NEXT DAY - CRISP...

          Mick steps past Ted on his way to his desk. As he passes--

                         TED
          Did you talk to your client?

                         MICK
          Yes. No deal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          Ted feigns surprise-but-acceptance... While, TO THE JUDGE:

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          The defense calls Louis Ross
          Roulet, your honor.

          INT. COURTROOM, LATER - LOUIS ANSWERS ON DIRECT...


                         LOUIS
          I turned toward the living room,
          the way she pointed...
          ANGLE MICK, has a floorplan of the apartment, on an easel.

                         MICK
          And what happened when you turned?

                         LOUIS
          Something hit me and I blacked out.
          I don't know for how long.

                         MICK
          That was all?

                         LOUIS
          Then when I woke up these guys were
          on me, telling me not to move. I
          couldn't anyway. I was too scared.
          Mick moves toward Louis, as if determined to find flaws...

                         MICK
          But, there was blood on your jacket
          and your left hand...

                         LOUIS
          Someone put it there because I
          didn't.

                         MICK
          Are you left-handed?

                         LOUIS
          No.

                         MICK
          You didn't strike Ms. Campo with
          your left fist?

                         LOUIS
          No!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         MICK
          Threaten to rape her, or kill her?--

                         LOUIS
          No!

                         MICK
          You're angry. Why?

                         LOUIS
          (passionate but simple--)
          Do you know what it's like to be
          accused of something like this? To
          listen to people tell lies about
          your having done something so sick
          and awful? I, I understand I had to
          be quiet and wait my chance and not
          say anything-- but if guilty people
          have rights, what about innocent
          people? I am innocent!
          Mick. Meets Louis's eye, communicates: You were perfect.

                         MICK
          Nothing further, Judge.
          Ted already up & moving, passes Mick as he takes his seat--

                         TED
          According to you, Ms. Campo punched
          herself or had a man she never met
          before punch her lights out as part
          of a set-up?

                         LOUIS
          All I know is that I didn't.

                         TED
          And this knife you always carry,
          how did she know she'd find it on
          you as part of the set-up?

                         LOUIS

                         ("HONEST")
          She couldn't, could she? I mean, I
          never took it out or showed it to
          anybody-- so she must have just
          found it when she went into my
          pocket for the money I had that I
          was going to pay her with, right?--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          M.

                         TED
          I'd really prefer it if I ask the
          questions, and you answer them!
          (then calming himself)
          Would you look at this, please--
          Goes to the easel, REVEALS: PHOTO of Reggie's beaten face.

                         TED (CONT'D)
          Please tell us again if you think
          Regina Campo would or could have
          done this to herself.

                         LOUIS
          I don't know who did it, but it
          wasn't me. Nobody deserves that to
          happen...

                         TED
          (seizes on this)
          What do you mean by "deserves?" Do
          you mean crimes of violence come
          down to a whether a woman gets what
          she "deserves?"

                         LOUIS
          (right back at him)
          I mean no matter what she does for
          a living or who she is-- No woman
          deserves that.
          Ted keeps staring at the photo: Wants the jury looking there.

                         TED
          I have no more questions.
          At which, suddenly there's a wave of movement-- SLOW-MOTION--
          Louis dismissed from the chair-- Ted returning to his seat,
          passing Mick as Mick rises--
          Louis gives Mick a "How'd I do?" look, Mick nods,
          unmistakably, "You did fine..."-- Mick's look finds Ted--
          Mick and Ted holding each other in a gaze-- Mick's face in a
          kind of smile, Ted grim--
          As Mick brings out, speaking to the Judge but his smiling
          eyes fixed on the unhappy Ted-- RESUME NORMAL SPEED for
          Mick's confident, fateful words:

                         MICK
          Your honor, the defense rests.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          Ted hears this, sets his jaw. Fullbright turns to him.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Minton?
          Ted is uncertain...

                         TED
          Your honor...
          (She waits.)
          The state needs the night to
          decide, your honor...

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          To decide what?

                         TED
          Frankly I wasn't anticipating the
          defense would rest after two
          witnesses. I-- I'd like the night
          to consider calling a rebuttal
          witness.

                         MICK
          (reacts, "objects--")
          Your honor, first we've heard of

                         THIS--

                         TED
          I said `-consider." I need to find
          out if the witness is even

                         AVAILABLE--

                         MICK
          The state still has an obligation
          to disclose the identity--

                         TED
          Not if I decide not to use him.
          (a note of pleading)
          I'm begging the court's indulgence,
          your honor.

          It's the vast view from Mick's porch. He has a drink in his
          hand. And holds a phone to his ear...

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          There's a rumor in the office...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         MICK
          How I'm the one who shot Raul?

          INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - ON THE PHONE IN THE KITCHEN

          In the BG we SEE HAYLEY, in pajamas, jumping on her bed...
          Maggie closes the bedroom door so she can speak...

                         MAGGIE
          Haller, is this serious?

          INTERCUT: MICK ON THE PORCH, RAIN/ MAGGIE IN HER KITCHEN

                         MICK
          I'd say so. I'm being set up for
          his murder. Couple of detectives
          from Glendale are following me
          around, just waiting for the go-
          ahead to hit me with an arrest
          warrant... Could be any minute...

                         MAGGIE
          How is this possible?

                         MICK
          Bad timing, bad client, me being
          dumb...

                         MAGGIE
          Is it Roulet? Is that the client?

                         MICK
          I can't talk to you about my
          clients. How is Hayley?

                         MAGGIE
          Fine. But Haller, if she ever hears
          anything about this--

                         MICK
          She won't. Not if I play it right.

                         MAGGIE
          What are you going to do?
          A long beat. Then he says, just as he told Raul--

                         MICK
          I'm working on it. I have a plan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          CUT TO, INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - HARD RAIN - MORNING

          CLOSE ON MICK, in the back seat. Looking out at the rain. His
          look a little different: close shave, neat suit. Fade up
          sound of Earl, meanwhile, rattling on...

                         EARL
          .when Not Guilty Two gets to four
          thousand miles, that's two cars
          ready, that's enough to start the
          airport runs...
          Scene we saw at the opening. Mick absorbed... Earl notices...

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          You gettin' any of this, Mr.
          Haller?
          Mick opens the file (back-seat office extraordinarily neat).
          Top of the print-out: THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
          vs. LOUIS ROULET...

          EXT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE, MORNING - RAIN CONTINUING

          Earl holds an umbrella over Mick, they hurry into the
          building...

          INT. COURTHOUSE - SECURITY VESTIBULE

          The items in his briefcase checked, wand passed over him...

          INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - ON MICK'S BACK...

          As he moves down the hall. Everything counts today. Enters:

          INT. COURTROOM - EMPTY, EARLY - CONTINUOUS

          Ted prepares at his table. Look at each other without
          greeting-- as Mick moves to the CLERK, who shuffles papers...

                         MICK
          Bill, I'm getting coffee. Any for
          you?

                         CLERK BILL
          No man, I'm off caffeine...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         MICK
          Hey, is that the custody list? Can
          I see if any of my no-good clients
          are on it?
          Bill lets him have it. Mick, casual, looks over the names...

          INT. COURTHOUSE - COFFEE COUNTER - DAY

          LORNA, she's paying for a take-out coffee, when Mick scoops
          her up by the arm, urgent, he's been looking for her--

                         MICK
          Minton's putting on Corliss. He's
          got him in lock-up already...

                         LORNA
          But Gloria still hasn't let us know
          if she got to him!

                         MICK
          You said she had mealtimes to work
          it...

                         LORNA
          Yes but...

                         MICK
          I'll take my chances. Meantime did
          you serve Kurlen?
          Moving her OUT OF THE CAFE, DOWN THE HALL-- hushed & fast--

                         LORNA
          Yes but I didn't like forging the
          judge's signature...

                         MICK
          Yes you did.

                         LORNA
          Yes I did.
          Just then, approaching, he sees SOBEL & LANKFORD: Are they
          coming for him? No, they turn into the courtroom along with
          others showing up for the trial's last day. Relieved--

                         MICK
          Now go, and be ready for my call.
          Lorna starts to go-- then pauses.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         LORNA
          I'm crazy about the power suit.
          Extra flip to her hips as she goes because Mick's watching.

          INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

          No sooner enters than KURLEN's in his face, waves a document.

                         KURLEN
          What shit is this, Haller? I got
          nothing to do with your case!
          Mick, "innocent," inspects the papers. With surprise--

                         MICK
          Subpoena to appear as a witness?
          You'll just have to wait and see.
          It's a legal document, Detective.
          Cursing, Kurlen takes himself off to a corner. Leaving Mick
          with the "legal document." He tucks it away--
          And continues to the front-- Past CECIL DOBBS and MARY
          WINDSOR, to LOUIS, at the defense table. OVER WHICH, PRE-LAP:

          JUDGE FULLBRIGHT (V.0.)
          Mr. Minton--

          INT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - COURT'S IN SESSION...


                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Does the state have any rebuttal?

                         TED
          (rises, ready)
          The state calls Dwayne Jeffrey
          Corliss as rebuttal witness.

                         MICK
          Judge? Who is this witness? Why
          wasn't I told before now?

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          A fair question. Mr. Minton?

                         TED
          Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating
          witness who spoke with Mr. Roulet
          in custody, following his arrest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

                         LOUIS
          (shouts, suddenly--)
          Bullshit! I didn't to talk to--

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Quiet, Mr. Roulet! Mr. Haller,
          control your client!
          Mick bends over, to Louis, sotto voce--

                         MICK
          That was good. Now leave it to me.
          (to the court)
          I do share my client's outrage,
          your honor. I'd at least like to
          know how long the state has been
          sitting on this testimony...

                         TED
          Mr. Corliss did not come forward
          until yesterday.

                         MICK

                         (OUTRAGED)
          This is incredible...

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Do you want to go back and talk to
          him? Given the timing I'd allow it.

                         MICK
          No, Judge, we all know what this
          is, this is a jailhouse snitch, and
          anything he'd say would be a lie--

                         TED
          That's groundless, your honor--

                         MICK
          --I just want my objection noted.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Then I'm going to rule he can

                         TESTIFY--

                         MICK
          Can I ask one indulgence? Can I
          step into the hallway and make a
          call to an investigator? For
          whatever good it will do at this
          late date.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

          INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM

          Mick already dialling-- Lorna answering--

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          Yep, here.

                         MICK
          Put your watch at quarter of. At
          ten fifteen you enter the room.

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          Got it.

                         MICK
          With the printouts.

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          Mickey, I know the moves!
          He snaps shut his cell-phone.

          INT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - DWAYNE CORLISS ON THE STAND

          Prison jumpsuit. We recognize him: the holding-cell junky.

                         TED
          Mr. Corliss, are you incarcerated
          at this time?

                         CORLISS
          Um, no, now I'm just in the
          courtroom.
          Dumb answer draws laughs. ANGLE LOUIS, seething...

                         TED
          But you are currently held in the
          jail-ward at USC hospital?

                         CORLISS
          Yes. Since I got arrested.

                         TED
          For burglary and drug possession?

                         CORLISS
          That's right.

                         TED
          Now. Do you know the defendant?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CORLISS
          Yes. I met him in lock-up. We was
          bussed over from jail, and then we
          was together in the tank when we
          came for first appearance.

                         TED
          And did you talk at that time?

                         CORLISS
          Yes... we talked about how bad we
          needed cigarettes.

                         TED
          Anything else?

                         CORLISS
          You know, "what are you in for?"
          Like that.

                         TED
          Did he say what he was "in for?"

                         CORLISS
          He said, "For giving a bitch
          exactly what she deserved." Those
          were his words.
          Reaction Louis, stirs like a caged animal. Mick steadies...

                         TED
          I have only one more question. Have
          I, or has anyone, made you promises
          to get you to testify?

                         CORLISS
          No. It's the right thing to do.
          Ted sits. Judge turns to Mick-- who's just staring, angrily.
          Then rises. Like he doesn't know what to do. Louis, the
          others, watch anxiously. Mick crosses to the front, steals a
          glance at the rear, SEES KURLEN standing against the wall,
          LANKFORD AND SOBEL seated in front of him. Then...

                         MICK
          How many times have you been
          arrested, Mr. Corliss?

                         CORLISS
          About seven in L.A. Couple of times
          in Phoenix if you count those.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         MICK
          So you know how the system works?

                         CORLISS
          I try to survive...

                         MICK
          And sometimes that means ratting
          out fellow inmates, is that it?

                         TED
          Objection, your honor...

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Take a seat, Mr. Minton. I gave you
          leeway bringing this witness in.

                         MICK
          Thank you, your honor. But I'll
          rephrase: How many times have you
          snitched on an inmate? Testified
          against a fellow inmate for the
          prosecution?

                         CORLISS
          This makes my fourth.

                         MICK

                         (LOOKING SURPRISED)
          Four times? People just come up and
          tell you they committed crimes so
          you can testify against them--

                         CORLISS
          People talk to me. I'm a friendly
          guy.
          Mick, walks toward Louis, indicates him--

                         MICK
          So you and my client were friends--

                         CORLISS
          That's right, we was friendly--

                         MICK
          And he just said what you said he
          said, about what the woman
          "deserved," and then you went back
          to talking about cigarettes?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         CORLISS
          Not exactly. He was like, bragging.
          He told me he did it before...
          Mick freezes... Like he's in a mine field and can't move...

                         CORLISS (CONT'D)
          He said the other time he killed
          the bitch... He got away with it
          then and he would get away with it
          now.

                         MICK
          (staring at Corliss)
          You... Wait...
          All eyes on Mick. The Judge prompts...

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Haller?

                         MICK
          No more questions, your honor.

                         TED
          Re-direct, your honor.
          Fullbright nods permission. While Louis leans over to Mick...

                         LOUIS
          What the hell is this?

                         MICK
          You tell me! What did you say to
          this guy?

                         LOUIS
          (through gritted teeth)
          Nothing! This is a set-up! You're
          doing this!

                         MICK
          How? How am I doing this?
          But Louis has no answer. Meanwhile Ted's taken the floor...

                         TED
          You said he was bragging. How?

                         CORLISS
          Well, like, he told me the details.
          About the other one, that he
          killed.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

                         CORLISS (CONT'D)
          He called her a snake dancer. She
          danced in some joint where she was
          like in a snake pit.
          ANGLE, REACTION DETECTIVE KURLEN, he leans forward at this...
          SAME TIME, REACTION at the defense table: Mick, "alarmed,"
          low to Louis--

                         MICK
          How does he know this?

                         LOUIS
          Do you think I know?

                         MICK
          If you didn't tell him this shit
          somebody did. Who? Start thinking!
          RESUME Ted, moving closer to Corliss--

                         TED
          Is there anything else he told you?

                         CORLISS
          No, that snake-girl stuff was it.

                         TED
          (after a beat)
          Then no further questions, your
          honor.
          Ted sits. The look he gives Mick in passing is one of
          abounding confidence. Mick stews... Swivels around...
          Covert glance, MICK'S POV, looks to see if Kurlen is where he
          was, against the wall. He's not. He's gone. So is Lankford.
          And the courtroom door still swings slightly, as if they've
          just left... While IN FRONT:

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Any re-cross from the defense?
          Mick rises to answer, hesitates-- and just then turns to see
          Lorna enter and approach down the aisle.

                         MICK
          A moment with my staff, Judge?

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Be quick.
          He meets Lorna at the gate. Brings his head close to hers--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

                         LORNA
          This is where I whisper in your
          ear, tell you stuff...

                         MICK
          (takes a file from her)
          It's all here, right? You go now, I
          don't want anyone talking to you.

                         LORNA
          Damn.
          She goes, he returns to the table. Before Louis can speak:

                         MICK
          I don't know what's going on here,
          but it won't matter if it's two
          murders or a hundred if I can show
          he's a liar--

                         LOUIS
          If you set me up I swear I'll--

                         MICK
          Just tell me if there's anything
          else he knows. Anything else I have
          to stay away from.

                         LOUIS
          I don't know because I never talked
          to him. I'm not that stupid.

                         MICK
          It doesn't matter. If I destroy him
          none of it counts...

                         LOUIS
          (from his gut)
          Then destroy him.
          A command. Mick nods. Returns to the witness Corliss--

                         MICK
          Dwayne, if I can call you that--

                         CORLISS
          It's what people call me--

                         MICK
          Don't they also call you D.J.? For
          example, down in Phoenix, right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         CORLISS
          Maybe.
          He's a bit wary. Mick looks through the file Lorna brought--

                         MICK
          Because you know, my assistant, she
          was just reading on the internet
          about D.J. Corliss-- arrested in
          Phoenix, 1989 on drug charges--
          Hometown of Mesa, Arizona?

                         CORLISS
          Yeah, that'd be me. But--

                         MICK
          You remember Fred Bentley, right?
          Corliss, darkens, stumbles at this-- Ted's quick--

                         TED
          I object, your honor, where is the
          defense going with this?

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Connect the dots soon, Mr. Haller.
          But the witness can answer.

                         CORLISS
          I don't remember any Bentley--

                         MICK
          Sure you do. You testified that he
          confessed to you the crime he was
          charged with-- rape of a ten-year-
          old girl-- even though he denied
          his guilt in court. Am .I ringing
          any bells, D.J.?

                         CORLISS
          Uh-- 1989, I was high a lot,
          there's not much I recall--

                         MICK
          Then I'd like you to read this to
          us, D.J. It's a printout of a news
          story from the Arizona Star, 1997,
          that's eight years after he was
          convicted. I ask that it be
          admitted into evidence--

                         TED
          Your honor? A news report?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Let's see where it takes us. The
          state can object later.
          Mick hands printout to the bailiff, who gives it to Corliss.

                         MICK
          I've marked the paragraph.

                         CORLISS
          I ain't too good at reading...
          (clears his throat)
          "A man, Frederick Bentley, wrongly
          convicted of rape, was released
          Saturday after con--

                         (HESITATES)
          --conclusive DNA results cleared
          him of the crime. The case was
          bolstered at trial by testimony
          from an informant, D.J. Corliss of
          Mesa, who claimed Bentley had--
          bragged to him about the rape while
          together in a holding cell--"

                         MICK
          That's enough.
          (takes it from him)
          Were you charged with perjury for
          that incident, D.J.?

                         CORLISS
          No I was not.

                         MICK
          Was that because the police were
          complicit in your confession?

                         TED
          (rises, angry--)
          Judge, how can the witness know
          what went into the D.A.'s decision?

                         MICK
          (ignores, over--)
          Were you promised the same deal
          here, Mr. Corliss? To say that
          Louis Roulet "bragged" to you in
          the "holding cell?"

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Alright, Mr. Haller, that will do!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.

                         MICK
          (Ceases. Angry.)
          Sorry. I have no more questions.
          And Mick sits. Courtroom's hushed. Until--

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          I'm excusing the jury for an early
          lunch. Bailiff, see them out.
          Maintains a smile as the jurors leave. Then her smile dies.

          INT. JUDGE FULLBRIGHT'S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

          No sooner through the door-- than Fullbright wheels on Ted:

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Minton do you know what you
          have done? You've put a documented
          liar on the stand, a man with a
          record of putting innocent people

                         IN PRISON--

                         TED
          Your honor, I--

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          You shut the fuck up when I'm
          talking to you! I can think of
          nothing more prejudicial or corrupt
          than what I just saw out therel
          (in a rage now--)
          Do you realize what you've done to
          my trial?

          INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          As Mick and Ted exit into hall-- Ted hurrying off, angry--
          Mick to LOUIS, DOBBS, and MARY WINDSOR-- tells them re Ted:

                         MICK
          He's going to see his boss. To
          decide what to do before the judge
          comes down with a directed verdict.

                         LOUIS
          What's a directed verdict?

                         MICK
          She takes it out of the jury's hand
          and declares an acquittal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          119.

                         MARY WINDSOR

                         (GLAD/HOPEFUL)
          Oh my god...

                         MICK
          We'll know in a few minutes.
          And heads off. Louis's cold stare, watches him go...

          INT. COURTHOUSE - MEN'S ROOM

           Mick at the urinal. Louis enters in and slides behind him.

                         LOUIS
          I'm not celebrating just yet, Mick.

                         MICK
          Yeah I can see that.

                         LOUIS
          I want to know how Corliss got that
          shit he was saying.

                         MICK
          Let it go. You're getting what you
          want, I'm getting you off...

                         LOUIS
          What I want is get off for good.
          Leans into him. Pushes a hand into his back. A threat.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          You'd better understand that.
          You've got enough reasons to be
          afraid of me already.
          When-- DOOR OPENS-- the courtroom CLERK, BILL, enters.

                         CLERK BILL
          It's starting.

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - MINUTES LATER - ON...


                         TED
          I just spoke to the District
          Attorney, your honor. The state
          wishes to dismiss all charges.
          Here's a motion...
          Mick, Louis, watch Ted hand it to Fullbright...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          120.

                         TED (CONT'D)
          It acknowledges that the procedures
          which guarantee justice were not
          followed in this case...

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          (as she reads)
          This is a motion to dismiss with
          prejudice. No coming back. Ever.

                         TED

                         (WITH DIFFICULTY)
          Yes, your honor.

          INT. COURTROOM, CORRIDOR - LATER - MARY WINDSOR...

          .tearful at the news, grips Mick's hand... she and Dobbs...

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Mr. Haller, thank you for my son...

                         DOBBS
          You were splendid--
          And Louis. Private, a few feet away. Smiles...

                         LOUIS
          I knew I wasn't wrong about you...

                         MICK
          I want the gun.

                         LOUIS
          Of course you do.
          No more can be said, because Mrs. Windsor-- descends on Mick--

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Mr. Haller, this time I insist you
          come to Orso for a celebration--

                         MICK
          I don't think so.
          Mary would insist, but before she can, OUT OF THE ELEVATOR
          comes KURLEN-- with LANKFORD AND SOBEL. Mick freezes, expects
          the worst-- but they move AROUND him and CLOSE IN ON:

                         KURLEN
          Louis Roulet, you are under arrest.
          Turn around and place your hands
          behind your back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          121.

                         LOUIS
          (as Kurlen cuffs him)
          Mick? This shouldn't be happening.
          Mrs. Windsor rushes Kurlen-- Sobel tries forcing her back--

                         MARY WINDSOR
          No! Take your hands off my son!

                         LOUIS
          Mother.
          Louis' voice controls her. Stricken, Mary gives up. Then--

                         DOBBS
          What are you arresting him for?

                         KURLEN
          (starting to take Louis)
          Suspicion of murder. The murder of
          Martha Renteria.

                         DOBBS
          That snake-dancer nonsense? Are you
          crazy? Everything that man Corliss
          said was a lie!
          Which stops Kurlen. He grins, confirmed.

                         KURLEN
          If it was all lies, how'd you know
          I meant the snake dancer?
          Dobbs sees his mistake. Kurlen begins again to take Louis--

                         MICK
          A moment with my client, Detective?
          Kurlen nods, why not. Mick leads Louis a few steps away.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          This is it, Louis. I got you off.
          Now get yourself a new lawyer.

                         LOUIS
          You're forgetting I have the gun...

                         MICK
          Yeah, and you'll have to explain
          how you got it. But you know what?
          I've stopped giving a shit. You're
          going down, and Martinez is getting
          out, and that's all I care about.

                         (MORE)

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          When they stick that needle in your
          arm, that will be me.

                         LOUIS
          And what if I don't go down?
          But Mick's finished, ready to leave, though Louis persists...

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Because I don't think they have
          enough to hold me. I could be out
          by tomorrow... You've got women,
          you've got a daughter...
          At this, Mick's head snaps to him, angrily...

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          You can't protect everybody.
          Kurlen arrives, takes Louis's elbow...
          Mick's already moving to the elevators... watched by SOBEL.

          EXT. COURTHOUSE - STEPS - MINUTES LATER - DAY - STILL RAINING

          SOBEL catches up as MICK reaches the Lincoln. Stops him. They
          move to beneath an overhang, where they're almost dry.

                         MICK
          Please tell me you've got enough on
          Louis for the murder of Renteria.

                         SOBEL
          We will. We have the ticket.

                         MICK
          What ticket?

                         SOBEL
          The parking ticket, that Raul
          found. That was the phone message
          he left you...
          (Sees Mick doesn't know)
          Raul checked. Louis got one at a
          meter outside the victim's place,
          same time she was murdered.

                         MICK
          What about Raul's murder? Do you
          have him for that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          123.

                         SOBEL
          No. We still don't know how he
          could have slipped the tracer
          anklet.
          (before Mick can ask more)
          Haller? Leave it alone.
           He hesitates-- but goes. Into the rain. Gets into--

          INT. LINCOLN (PARKED) - CONTINUOUS

          He watches Sobel hurry back to courthouse through rain. When:

                         EARL
          Mr. Haller? Got that thing you
          asked for.
          And he hands Mick something wrapped in a towel: A GUN. Mick,
          puts it away, in the armrest. A bit regretful, because:

                         MICK
          I said I'd never do this. Ask you
          to violate your parole.

                         EARL
          It's called, lookin' out for your
          blood.
          Mick sits back. Earl pops in a RAP CD, TUPAC.

                         TUPAC
          "To be a man in this wicked
          land..."

          AS RAP FADES, CAMERA TRAILS Mick's messy kitchen: take-out
          pizza, beer bottles... and the GUN. Barrel protrudes from
          under the thrown-aside windbreaker.
          Mick's seen on the porch. PHONE RINGS, he rushes into answer.

                         MICK
          Yeah?

          They're down! I'm shot!
          Suddenly LANKFORD & SOBEL are through the door-- Lankford
          sees Mary on the floor, while--

                         SOBEL
          Don't move, Haller--
          She rushes to him. Lankford's already on his phone--

                         LANKFORD
          This is Lankford, we've got a
          shooting, twelve-twelve Creek off
          Laurel, we need paramedics,
          ambulance transport for two--

          Transport for one.
          Rings off. Sobel takes Mick's hand, presses it to his wound--

                         SOBEL
          Press hard and keep pressing.
          Mick's hand is on a blood-soaked hole, hurting like hell...
          while Lankford makes another call...

                         LANKFORD
          Yeah, it's Lankford again. Tell
          them it's over, they can grab
          Roulet and bring him in... He what?

                         (LISTENS-- SURPRISED)
          So, bring him to the Emergency Room
          first, then bring him in!
          (rings off; to Sobel)
          Dig this. The uniforms had some
          help picking up Roulet. Some
          motorcycle gang was already beating
          the shit out of him.

                         MICK

          (She levels.)
          We thought he'd come after you. We
          couldn't tell you. The truth is we
          had plenty on him for killing
          Renteria. Jesus Martinez will be
          released. But we wanted Roulet for
          Levin, too. I told you: We had to
          find out how he beat the trace. Now
          we know.
          (her glance goes to Mary

                         WINDSOR)
          It was almost perfect. He's still
          wearing the anklet...

                         MICK
          I know...

                         SOBEL
          And it puts him half a city away.
          Just like last time.
          They share a look at the cleverness of it. When--

                         LANKFORD
          Look at this.
          Mick looks, HIS WOOZY POV AGAIN: Lankford, wearing a glove,
          lifts Mary's gun. Pearl-handled: The WOODSMAN. Admiring--

                         LANKFORD (CONT'D)
          They don't make'm like this
          anymore.
          Mick, makes a shape with his free hand. The "Longhorns" sign:
          inner fingers pointing down. Like Raul made.

                         MICK
          "W." Mrs. Windsor.
          Which is the last thing he manages to say before blanking.

          FADE OUT.

          FADE IN, EXT. HAYLEY, CLIMBING A TREE - DAY OF BLUE SKY

          L.A.'s best weather: Smog-blue. The tree off Mick's porch.
          Hayley's skinny legs climb nimbly from branch to branch.
          From the angle, we can tell someone is watching her.

          FADE OUT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          132.

          FADE IN AGAIN, ANGLE, HAYLEY ON THE NEXT BRANCH, LATER
          Lifts herself. Nimble. And so pretty. Watching is:

          MICK - ON THE PORCH - WRAPPED UP IN A LOUNGE CHAIR
          Recovering, but not fully there. MAGGIE SITS INTO FRAME
          beside him.

                         MAGGIE
          I didn't know you were awake.
          He looks at her. Questioning.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, we haven't been living
          here. We did, for a while. When you
          were touch and go.
          Mick. Returns his gaze to-- HAYLEY, going branch to branch.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          I'd better get her down, she can
          get hurt up there--

                         MICK
          You can get hurt anywhere. Let her
          climb.
          An almost normal tone of voice. She smiles. CUT TO,

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY


          RAP BLASTING, EARL AT THE WHEEL...

                         MICK
          Keep your speed up, Earl...
          He's IN THE BACK-SEAT, IT'S A MESS... He's scribbling on
          papers as they ride... His CELL-PHONE RINGS...

                         MICK (CONT'D)

                         (INTO CELL)
          This is Haller.

          CUT TO BLACK.
