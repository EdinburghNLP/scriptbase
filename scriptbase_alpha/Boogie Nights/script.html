1 EXT. HOT TRAXX NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

CAMERA holds on this PACKED disco on Van Nuys Blvd.

TITLE CARD: "San Fernando Valley, 1977"

A CADILLAC SEVILLE pulls up to the valet area and CAMERA (STEADICAM) moves
across the street, towards the car, landing close;

From the Seville steps, JACK HORNER (50s) and AMBER WAVES (early 30s).
CAMERA follows them (this is one continous shot) as they pass the crowd,
greet a DOORMAN and enter --

INSIDE THE NIGHTCLUB. Twice as packed inside as outside. Music is full
blast. Amber and Jack are greeted by;

MAURICE t.t. RODRIGUEZ (30s). Owner of the nightclub. Puerto Rican. Wearing
a suit and fifteen gold chains.

                                  MAURICE

              Jackie-Jack-Jack and Miss Lovely Amber Waves --

                                   AMBER

                                Hi, Maurice.

                                    JACK

               You bad ass little spick. How are you, honey?

                                  MAURICE

                    Pissed off you ain't been around --

                                    JACK

                           -- I been on vacation.

                                  MAURICE

                     Don't stay away this long from my

                     club ever again, Jackie-Jack-Jack.

                                    JACK

                                 I promise.

Maurice takes Amber's hand and gives it a kiss.

                                  MAURICE

                You are the foxiest bitch in ten countries.

                                   AMBER

                           You're such a charmer.

                                  MAURICE

                                 (to Jack)

                    I got you all set up at your booth.

              I wanna send over some clams on the half shell.

                                    JACK

                                 Beautiful.

                                  MAURICE

                     Just remember, Jack: I'm available

                     and ready. Cast me and find out --

                                    JACK

                             Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Amber and Jack head off towards the booth. CAMERA stays with Maurice,
follows him to the bar area, where he shouts some orders to a WAITER.

                                  MAURICE

                      Clams on the half shell to Jack

                       and Amber -- over there -- go!

The WAITER takes off to the kitchen, Maurice walks onto the dance floor and
greets three people;

REED ROTHCHILD, 20s, tall and skinny, BECKY BARNETT, 20s, black girl in
silk, BUCK SWOPE, 20s, black guy in cowboy gear.

                                  MAURICE

                           Hello there, kiddies.

                              REED/BUCK/BECKY

                           Hi, hey, hi, Maurice.

                                  MAURICE

                            Having a good time?

                                   BECKY

                                 Excellent.

                                  MAURICE

                            Great, great, great.

Maurice moves away to greet some more people. CAMERA stays with Reed, Becky
and Buck, does a 360 around them. Reed and Becky Disco Dance. Buck does
some Cowboy-Type Moves.

Moments later, the WAITER carrying clams on the half shell passes and
CAMERA picks up with him, follows him to Jack's booth, where he presents
them;

                                   WAITER

                          Compliments of Maurice.

                                    JACK

                                 Thank you.

                                   AMBER

                      Can I get a Marguerita, please?

                                    JACK

                             Seven-Up, here --

The WAITER exits, CAMERA PANS with him for a moment, leading to a young
girl wearing rollerskates, ROLLERGIRL (aged 18). She always, always wears
rollerskates. CAMERA PANS with her back to Jack's booth.

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                                    Hi.

                                    JACK

                               Hello, honey.

                                   AMBER

                              (to Rollergirl)

                       Did you call that girl today?

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                                 I forgot.

                                   AMBER

                   If you don't do it tomorrow, then it's

                  the weekend and you'll never be able to

                            get in to see her --

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                                    OK.

Rollergirl scratches her crotch as she speaks. Amber notices;

                                   AMBER

                       What's the matter down there?

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                              I gotta go pee.

                                   AMBER

                               Well go, then.

CAMERA stays with Rollergirl, following her across the dance floor. She
passes Buck, Becky and Reed, says hello, dances a moment, then continues on
-- into the clearing off the dance floor, heading for the bathroom. She
passes something, CAMERA moves away towards this something:

A bus boy cleaning a table, EDDIE ADAMS, aged 17. CAMERA moves into a CU --
blending to SLOW MOTION (40fps) for a moment.

(Note: In the text Eddie Adams will be referred to as Dirk Diggler.)

ANGLE, JACK'S TABLE.

Jack turns his head, looks across the dance floor and sees this kid
cleaning the table.

ANGLE, DIRK DIGGLER.

He looks up, catches Jack looking back at him, then turns away, disappears
into a back room.

CAMERA DOLLIES in on Jack, who at that moment, is approached by a figure
entering FRAME. Short, buffed out LITTLE BILL (late 40s). This is Jack's
Assistant Director.

                                LITTLE BILL

                                   Jack.

                                    JACK

                             Hey, Little Bill.

                                LITTLE BILL

                         Whatsa schedule look like?

                    Are we still on day after tomorrow?

                                    JACK

                        I wanna do it the day after

                          the day after tomorrow.

                                LITTLE BILL

                       For sure? 'Cause I wanna call

                 Rocky, Scotty, Kurt and all those guys --

Jack's attention is with the backroom that Dirk entered. He stands and
heads away.

                                    JACK

                   Absolutely. But I wanna keep it small.

                  I wanna keep a small crew on this one --

                                LITTLE BILL

                             -- a relaxed deal.

                                    JACK

                                  Exactly.

                                LITTLE BILL

                         Do you have a script yet?

                                    JACK

                      Tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day --

Jack is off across the dance floor.

CUT TO:

2 INT. BACKROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

                                    JACK

                                    Hey.

                                    DIRK

                                    JACK

                                    JACK

                              How old are you?

                                    DIRK

                  I have a work permit, I got the paper --

                                    JACK

                         No, no, no. Not like that.

                       How long have you worked here?

                                    DIRK

                                    JACK

                        Maurice give you a job here?

                                    DIRK

                                   Yeah.

                                    JACK

                            How much he pay you?

                                    DIRK

                  I'm not supposed to say how much I make.

                                    JACK

                          He's a friend of mine --

                                    DIRK

                        Well you'll have to ask him.

                                    JACK

                   You live around here, Canoga - Reseda?

                                    DIRK

              Um . . . no . . . do you know where Torrance is?

                                    JACK

                            How do you get here?

                                    DIRK

                              I take the bus.

                                    JACK

                          So what do you wanna do?

                                    DIRK

                                    JACK

                   You take the bus from Torrance to work

                 in Reseda, why don't you work in Torrance?

                                    DIRK

                              I don't want to.

                                    JACK

                               . . . ok . . .

                                    JACK

                             . . . what . . . ?

                                    DIRK

                       If you wanna watch me jack off

                     it's ten bucks. If you just wanna

                         look at it then it's five.

                                    JACK

                      walk out on Maurice. I'm sorry.

BEAT, THEN;

                                    JACK

                    It seems to me, beneath those jeans,

                      there's something wonderful just

                           waiting to get out --

Jack leaves.

Father, stubble on his face, places a kiss on the cheek of Mother.

                                   FATHER

                               Good morning.

                    gonna do that, it scratches my face.

Father takes a seat at the breakfast table, looks to Dirk.

16 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

A crowded high school geometry classroom. In the back of the class, sitting
at a desk is Rollergirl. A TEACHER walks about, handing out the final exam.
Rollergirl looks it over; a lot of questions, diagrams and generally
confusing material. She looks across the room;

Two BOYS are looking at her and chuckling to themselves. One guy looks to
the other and makes a "blow job" gesture.

She looks away, they continue their gestures and giggling. Other students
notice and smile.

CAMERA ARRIVES CU. ON ROLLERGIRL. She stands up, heads for the door -- the
teacher calls after her -- but she's gone.

17 INT. SUPER-DUPER STEREO SHOP - DAY

A semi-high end stereo store in the valley. Buck, dressed in his usual
cowboy-digs, is talking to a CUSTOMER about a stereo unit. The manager, a
skinny-white guy with a mustache and mustard suit, JERRY (30s) is standing
nearby.

                                    BUCK

                       -- so basically you're gettin'

                     twice the base, cause of the TK421

                  modification we got in this system here.

                                  CUSTOMER

                  I don't know - do I need that much bass?

                                    BUCK

                       If you want a system to handle

                        what you want -- yes you do.

                    See this system here. This is Hi-Fi.

                    "High Fidelity." What that means is

                  that it's the highest quality fidelity.

                                  CUSTOMER

                             It's the price --

                                    BUCK

                         I have this unit at home.

                                    BUCK

                      Yes. But -- I've got it modified

                    with the TK421, which is a bass unit

                    that basically kicks in another two,

                     maybe three quads when you really

                   crank -- lemme put another eight track

                    in so you can get a better idea what

                            I'm talkin about --

Buck ejects the Eight Track that was playing and puts in his own of a
country western song.

                                    BUCK

                     Hear that bass? It kicks and turns

                   and curls up in your belly, makes you

                   wanna freaky-deaky, right? If you get

                    this unit as it is -- it won't sound

                   like this without the modification --

                     and we do that for a small price.

The Customer listens another moment, then;

                                  CUSTOMER

                          Thank you for your time.

                                    BUCK

                                No problem.

The Customer exits and Jerry approaches Buck.

                                   JERRY

                    you throw on some Led Zeppelin. No.

                        I have to get back to work.

                                SHERYL LYNN

                           Give it to me, Eddie.

                                    DIRK

                   Don't make me pounce you, Sheryl Lynn.

                                SHERYL LYNN

                          Ohhhh-baby, baby, baby.

                                    DIRK

                               I'll do it --

                                SHERYL LYNN

                                  Promise?

                                    DIRK

                                 That's it.

Dirk jumps up and starts bouncing up and down on the bed, naked and
flapping. She stares at his crotch, shakes her head;

                                 DICK (OC)

                                   What?

                                SHERYL LYNN

                            You're so beautiful.

                                 DICK (OC)

                                 Yeah . . .

                                SHERYL LYNN

                      Do you know how good you are at

            doing this, Eddie? Having sex . . . fucking me . . .

                             making love to me?

Dirk looks down. BEAT.

                                    DIRK

                  Everyone has one thing, y'think? I mean:

             Everyone is given one special thing . . . . right?

                                SHERYL LYNN

                               That's right.

                                    DIRK

                Everyone is blessed with One Special Thing.

Dirk kneels down to her;

                                    DIRK

                I want you to know: I plan on being a star.

                  A big, bright shining star. That's what

                    I want and it's what I'm gonna get.

                                SHERYL LYNN

                                  I know.

                                    DIRK

                  And once I get it: I'm never gonna stop

                    and I'll never, ever make a mistake.

They Kiss.

Dirk is washing dishes. He looks up and spots Rollergirl. She lifts a skate
up just a little . . . She rolls closer to Dirk and pulls him into

A CLOSET SPACE

She goes down on him, unzips his pants and pulls out his cock. She
hesitates. DOLLY IN CLOSE ON HER FACE. She smiles up at Dirk.

                                Hey. Eddie.

                                    DIRK

                                Hello. Jack?

                           Yeah. You wanna ride?

                  This thing here, I mean, you understand

                    one thing and that's this: It costs.

                 I mean, this stuff costs good ol' American

                    Green. You got film, you got lights,

               you got sound, lab fees, developing, synching,

                   editing -- next thing you know you're

                 spending thirty/forty thousand a picture.

                                    DIRK

                           That's a lot of money.

                                    JACK

                  Hell yes it's a lot of money, but lemme

                  tell you something else: You make a good

                 film and there's practically no end to the

                    amount of money you can make, Eddie.

                                   AMBER

                        Have you seen Jack's house?

                                 JACK (OC)

                               He'll see it.

                               He'll see it.

                                 JACK (OC)

                 Eddie: You got ten, fifteen people around

                and that's just to make sure the lighting is

               right . . . shit, this is not an operation for

                the weak, and lemme tell you something else:

               When all is said and done, you gotta have the

              juice, you understand? I mean . . . you can work

               on your arms, your legs, workout morning, day,

               noon, night, the whole deal, but when it comes

             right down to it . . . what we need is Mr. Torpedo

               Area, y'understand? Mr. Fun Zone? Okay, let's

               say you got that: right? And You Do Got, Yeah?

He looks to Rollergirl. She smiles. CAMERA OFF AMBER NOW.

                                    JACK

                 I can go out -- tonight -- the reputation

                    I got: I can find myself 15/20 guys,

                cocks the size of Willie Mays Baseball Bat:

                  Do I want that? No. Do I need that? No.

                               I need actors.

                                   AMBER

                       Uhhh-ohhh . . . here we go --

                                    JACK

                   -- Alright, yeah, I need the big dick,

                   and the big tits -- that GETS them in

                   the theater. What keeps them in their

                    seats even after they've come? Huh?

                         The beauty and the acting.

              If you're able to give it up and show the world:

                     No, not just your cock. Fuck that.

                   What I'm talking about is showing your

               insides, from your heart . . . you understand?

                    Hey, Sure: GET THEM IN THE THEATER.

               That's one thing. I don't want 'em showing up,

                 sitting down, jacking off and splitting on

                 the story. I don't want to make that film.

                I wanna make the thing that keeps 'em around

            even after they've come . . . what happens when you

                    come? You're done, you wanna split.

                   My idea, my goal: Suck 'em in with the

         story . . . they'll squirt their load and sit in it . . .

                      Just To See How The Story Ends.

                  Sometimes we make these films, we wanna

                 make people laugh a little, then get into

              it and fuck heavy: That's good and that's fine.

                 But I got a dream of making a film that's

                  true . . . true and right and dramatic.

                                    DIRK

                . . . Right . . . right . . . I understand.

                                   AMBER

                     Don't listen too hard to all this,

                   honey . . . it's just nice in theory.

                                    JACK

                      It's a dream to be able to find

                            a cock and an actor.

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                     Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream.

                                    DIRK

               If you don't have dreams you have nightmares.

                                    Hi.

                                   MOTHER

                              Where were you?

                                  Nowhere.

                                   MOTHER

                     Shut up. Shut up. Where were you?

Dirk walks down the hall towards his room.

                                   MOTHER

                   You see that little slut girl you see?

                            Sheryl? Sheryl Lynn?

                                    DIRK

                              Don't say that.

                                   MOTHER

                    Does it make you feel like a stud to

                   see trash like that? Huh? What is she?

                             Your girl-friend?

                                    DIRK

                          She's not my girlfriend.

                                   MOTHER

                     She's a little whore and a little

                   piece of trash . . . I know you're not

                        the only one that she sees.

                                    DIRK

                What . . . what're you . . . you don't know.

                                   MOTHER

                  I've heard things about her. That girl.

                   Don't think I don't know what goes on

              when I'm not here . . . I wash your sheets, kid.

                  I know she's been here. Or are you doing

                    some other thing in there? With your

                    music and your posters on the wall?

                   You can't do anything. You're a loser.

                  You'll always be a loser -- you couldn't

                  even finish high school because you were

                  too stupid -- so what are you gonna do?

                                    DIRK

                    I'll do something . . . I'll do it.

                    I'll go somewhere and do something,

                                  find me.

                                   MOTHER

Dirk stops. His Mother looks to the posters on his wall.

         that's one thing . . . but soon . . . the club goes . . .

             I die . . . and what do I have? I've got nothing.

                                   AMBER

                                  Uh-huh.

                                  MAURICE

                    I want something to send back home.

               Something to send back to my brothers and say:

               Look At Me. Look At The Women I've Been With.

                                   AMBER

                So what . . . do you want me to talk to him?

                                  MAURICE

              Yes . . . I mean . . . y'know . . . what do you

                           think I'm askin' here?

                  He was obviously pissed about the music.

                     No it's not. It's over, it's dead.

                                    BUCK

                 You don't know what you're talkin' about.

                                   BECKY

                                   BECKY

                      The look I've got is just fine.

                                    BUCK

                             What's your look?

                                   BECKY

                           Chocolate Love, Baby.

                                Yeah, right.

OC we hear the new song start to play.

                                   BECKY

                   OH SHIT! TURN IT UP! I LOVE THIS SONG!

Becky leaves. CAMERA moves away to find:

37 INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY - THAT MOMENT

Jack and the Colonel are sitting, drinks in their hand. The Colonel smokes
a cigar.

                                    JACK

                   The idea is this: Amber is a director

                 of porno films and she's down on her luck.

                   She hasn't had a hit in a year. She's

             desperate. Her landlord is threatening to kick her

             out, so she's desperate for a big dick hit, right?

                                  COLONEL

                             Yes. Good dilemma.

                                    JACK

                   Yes. So she calls up all the agencies

                   in town and says: "Send over your best

                   actors, I'm casting a porno picture."

                   Well, the story goes and develops with

                     Amber auditioning various men and

                 women . . . the whole thing wraps up with

                  the Landlord, I'd like to get Jeremy if

                   he's still in town to play the part --

                     he comes in -- the landlord says:

                   You better pay rent or you're through.

                   Well, Amber does one helluva suck job,

                 ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing

                          and fade out - the end.

                                  COLONEL

                               That's great.

                                    JACK

                   There's a kid, a young man, I met him

                    last night: His name is Eddie Adams.

                He's here, he's at the party. He's something

                      special and I want to cast him.

                                  COLONEL

                          What films has he done?

                                    JACK

                          This would be his first.

Little Bill pokes his head into the office, sees the conversation and
quickly apologizes and exits. The Colonel looks to Jack;

                                  COLONEL

                Casting is up to you, Jack. You wanna do it?

                Then do it. If it has big tits, tight pussy

                 and focus: I'm happy. You tell the stories

                    you wanna tell, make yourself happy.

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                           What's wrong with you?

                                LITTLE BILL

                    Ah . . . my fuckin' wife, man, she's

                  over there . . . she's got some idiot's

                    dick in her, people standing around

                 watching -- it's a fuckin' embarrassment.

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                    Yeah. Yeah. I know. Anyway, listen:

                                LITTLE BILL

                                  -- yeah.

                               KURT LONGJOHN

               For the shoot -- I wanna talk about the look.

           I wanted to see about getting this new zoom lens . . .

                                LITTLE BILL

                                   Right.

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                  I wondered if we'd be able to look into

                  getting some more lights, too, y'know --

                                LITTLE BILL

                       Jack wants a minimal-thing --

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                   Right, well, very often, minimal means

                 a lot more photographically than I think,

            well . . . then I think most people understand . . .

                                LITTLE BILL

                               I understand.

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                    No, no. Hey. I know you understand,

                   I was talking about some other people.

                                LITTLE BILL

                     Well, I think what Jack is talking

                  about is minimal, not really "natural,"

                             but minimal . . .

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                OK . . . fine . . . I was just saying . . .

                                LITTLE BILL

                              I understand --

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                   -- 'cause I'm just trying to give each

                          picture it's own look --

                                LITTLE BILL

                       Can we talk about this later?

                               KURT LONGJOHN

          Oh, yeah . . . you have to go somewhere . . . or . . . ?

                                LITTLE BILL

                     Well, no, yeah . . . I mean . . .

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                  'Cause I was hoping to, y'know, for the

                  shoot tomorrow, we could send Rocky down

                         and he could pick it up --

                                LITTLE BILL

                                   Kurt.

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                 No. Hey. Gotcha. You've gotta go somewhere

                 so -- hey -- what the fuck? It's only the

              photography of the movie we're talkin' about --

Little Bill looks at him. HOLD.

                                LITTLE BILL

                       Are you givin' me shit, Kurt?

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                     NO, NO, HEY. No way, Little Bill.

                                LITTLE BILL

                 My fucking wife has a cock in her ass over

                 in the driveway, alright? I'm sorry if my

                thoughts aren't with the photography of the

                  film we're shooting tomorrow, Kurt, OK?

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                          OK. No big deal. Sorry.

                                LITTLE BILL

                                  Alright?

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                                  Gotcha.

Little Bill leaves. Kurt stands alone a moment. He walks over to the
driveway and watches Little Bill's Wife get fucked.

45 INT. JACK'S HOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY - LATER

CAMERA follows HAND-HELD behind Jack, the Colonel and his Limo Driver as
they walk quickly down a hallway that leads to a bedroom.

CUT TO:

46 INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

Jack, the Colonel and Limo Driver BURST into the room --

REVERSE ANGLE: On the floor of the room, the Colonel's LADY FRIEND is lying
naked. She's passed out and she has blood pouring from her nose. The YOUNG
STUD is naked, holding her in his arms. He looks up at the men who just
entered.

                                 YOUNG STUD

                            I think she's sick.

                                  COLONEL

                           What the fuck is this?

                                 YOUNG STUD

                           I didn't do anything.

                                    JACK

                             Is she breathing?

                                 YOUNG STUD

                I don't know. I think she did too much coke?

                                  COLONEL

                       Duh. Do you think so, smarty?

                                LIMO DRIVER

                        She's definitely overdosing.

                                  COLONEL

                       Oh . . . what the fuck . . . .

The four men look at the girl. The Colonel turns to his Limo Driver.

                                  COLONEL

                  Alright: Johnny. You're gonna take care

                    of this for me. You listening here?

                                LIMO DRIVER

                                   Yeah.

                                  COLONEL

                   I want you to pick her up, get her in

                    the car, take her down to St. Joe's.

                                LIMO DRIVER

                                   Okay.

                                  COLONEL

                    Listen, though: You drop her off in

              the front, I don't want this . . . y'understand?

                          I don't need this, here.

                                LIMO DRIVER

                                  Gotcha.

                                  COLONEL

                      Make sure no one sees the limo.

                                LIMO DRIVER

                                  Got it.

                                  COLONEL

                  Young Stud, I want you to help my driver

                      Johnny here get her in the car.

The Young Stud starts to cry hysterically.

                                  COLONEL

                                 (to Jack)

                           What the fuck is this?

                              (to Young Stud)

               Hey . . . hey . . . pal . . . get a grip, man.

                                 YOUNG STUD

             I'm sorry . . . it's just . . . it's just . . . .

                                  COLONEL

                                   What?

                                 YOUNG STUD

                         I . . . I . . . I . . . .

                                  COLONEL

                                Spit it out.

                                 YOUNG STUD

                     This is twice in two days a chick

                             has O.D.'d on me.

                                  COLONEL

                Well maybe that means you oughta think about

                 getting some new shit, what do you think?

                                 YOUNG STUD

                                 Yes, sir.

                                  COLONEL

                 Jesus Christ. Now be a man, deal with the

                     situation and get her in the car.

The Lady Friend starts to go into CONVULSIONS.

                                  COLONEL

                Y'see that, all this fuckin' conversation --

SCOTTY J. (mid-20s) comes over and interjects --

                                 SCOTTY J.

                                 Hey Reed.

                                   Maybe.

                                    REED

                                 Probably.

                                  COLONEL

                             Thank you, Eddie.

                                    DIRK

                                No problem.

Dirk exits. The Colonel turns to Jack;

                                  COLONEL

                    Jesus Christ. Jesus Lord in Heaven.

CAMERA picks up with Dirk, who runs for the pool and DIVES IN . . . .

48 INT. POOL - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA MOVES IN AS DIRK LANDS IN THE WATER, FLOATS TO THE BOTTOM, THEN
PUSHES OFF, TOWARDS THE SURFACE. TIME LAPSE TO NIGHT.

CUT TO:

49 EXT. DRIVEWAY/JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)

The party is coming to a close and people are trying to get in their cars
and get out of the driveway.

CAMERA hangs with Little Bill and his Wife.

                                LITTLE BILL

                  Thanks for fucking up this party for me.

                              I appreciate it.

                             LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

                           Oh Fuck Off. Will You?

                                LITTLE BILL

                               You Fuck Off.

                             LITTLE BILL'S WIFE

                                Yeah, right.

CAMERA MOVES TO FIND: THE YOUNG STUD AND THE LIMO DRIVER.

They're sitting by the limo. The Young Stud is crying.

                                LIMO DRIVER

                      Hey, hey, hey. I mean: How were

                           you supposed to know?

                                 YOUNG STUD

                                 I wasn't.

                                LIMO DRIVER

                  That's right. So what did you do wrong?

                                 YOUNG STUD

                                  Nothing?

                                LIMO DRIVER

                  Nothing is absolutely right, Young Stud.

                                 YOUNG STUD

                          Thank you for your help.

                                LIMO DRIVER

                                No problem.

The Colonel and Jack approach. The Colonel now has ANOTHER YOUNG LADY
FRIEND, picked up from the party.

                                  COLONEL

                             You ready, Johnny?

                                LIMO DRIVER

                                 Yes, sir.

                                  COLONEL

                            How you doin', pal?

                                 YOUNG STUD

                               I'm okay, sir.

                                  COLONEL

                   Don't worry about it. She'll be fine.

                                 YOUNG STUD

              She died in the limo on the way to the hospital.

                                  COLONEL

                            I didn't hear that.

                                 YOUNG STUD

                                   What?

                                  COLONEL

                 You never told me that and what happened,

                        never happened. You got me?

                                 YOUNG STUD

                                 I get you.

                                  COLONEL

                         Now go home. Sleep it off.

The Young Stud exits.

                                    JACK

                        Thanks for coming, Colonel.

                                  COLONEL

                             Great party, Jack.

The Colonel and the new Lady Friend get in the car.

CUT TO:

50 EXT. JACK'S HOUSE/POOL AREA - NIGHT (LATER)

The party is over. Amber and Rollergirl are inside playing cards. Scotty J.
is cleaning up, Dirk and Reed sit in the JACUZZI, looking up at the stars.

                                    REED

                    . . . you wanna hear a poem I wrote?

                                    DIRK

                                   Yeah.

                                    REED

                               Okay. Um . . .

                         "I love you. You love me.

                         Going down the Sugar Tree.

                       We'll go down the Sugar Tree.

                       And See Lots of Bees. Playing.

                       Playing. The bees won't sting.

                            'Cause you love me."

                                    DIRK

                         That's fucking great, man.

Jack approaches in a bath robe, holding a towel.

                                    JACK

                                Howdy-boys.

                                 DIRK/REED

                                 Hey, Jack.

Jack removes his robe and climbs in the Jacuzzi.

                                    JACK

                                Good party?

                                    DIRK

                               It was great.

                                    JACK

                      Good. You had a good time then?

                                    DIRK

                         Excellent time. Thank you.

                                    JACK

                       What this place is for, right?

                                    REED

                                   Right.

                                    JACK

                   Ahhhh . . . this feels good. Bubbles.

                      Turn those bubbles higher, Reed.

                                    DIRK

        Jack . . . I was thinking about my name . . . y'know . . . ?

                                    JACK

                                   Yeah?

                                    DIRK

                   I was wondering if you had any ideas.

                                    JACK

                 I've got a few . . . but you tell me . . .

                                    DIRK

                 Well . . . my idea was . . . y'know . . .

                    I want a name . . . I want it so it

               can cut glass . . . y'know . . . razor sharp.

                                    JACK

                                  Tell me.

                                    DIRK

                When I close my eyes . . . I see this thing,

              a sign . . . I see this name in bright blue neon

                lights with a purple outline. And this name

                 is so bright and so sharp that the sign --

          it just blows up because the name is so powerful . . . .

FLASH ON:

A BRIGHT NEON SIGN IN BLUE LETTERING, WITH A PURPLE OUTLINE:

                                DIRK DIGGLER

                                 DIRK (OC)

                          It says, "Dirk Diggler."

The NEON SIGN FLASHES, BUZZES, THEN BURSTS INTO AN ELECTRIC FLAME.

BACK TO:

51 EXT. JACUZZI - THAT MOMENT

Back to Reed and Jack. They look at Dirk.

                                    JACK

                    Heaven sent you here to this place,

                     Dirk Diggler. You've been blessed.

Dirk smiles. Reed smiles. Jack looks up and closes his eyes.

FADE OUT, CUT TO:

52 INT. JACK'S GARAGE/FILM STUDIO - DAY

. . . . The film crew sets up lights and other equipment around a small
"office" set. The crew consists of: Kurt Longjohn, Director of Photography.
Rocky, Gaffer/Grip. Little Bill, Assistant Director. Scotty J. Is working
as a utility/sound man.

Jack is sipping coffee, conferring with Kurt about lighting.

                                    JACK

                                 How close?

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                    Give me twenty to thirty. I've got a

                    couple tough shadows to deal with --

                                    JACK

                    Okay, but not too long, Kurt, right?

                 Remember, there are shadows in real life.

Little Bill approaches.

                                LITTLE BILL

                          You wanna go over this?

                                    JACK

                            Yeah. Let's . . . .

                                LITTLE BILL

                           (reading from script)

                     Okay. Set up is . . . here we go:

                1.) Amber talking to Becky about auditions.

                 They make the phone call to the agency to

                           send over some actors.

                   2.) Enter Reed to audition for Amber.

                     They go at it. Becky just watches.

                 C.) Becky goes to the bathroom to jack-off

               and is interrupted by Amber. They get into it.

                             E.) Enter Dirk --

                                 (looks up)

                            Who's Dirk Diggler?

                                    JACK

                       The kid, Eddie, from the club.

                                LITTLE BILL

                    Good name. Anyway: 4.) Dirk enters.

                     Meets with Becky. They go at it --

                                    JACK

                I wanna change that -- that should be Amber.

                   Dirk should be auditioning with Amber.

Little Bill makes a note. Jack walks over to Becky, who's sitting in a
chair, shaving her pubic hairs.

                                    JACK

                              Becky, honey --

                                   BECKY

                                   What?

                                    JACK

                     What're you doing? We're shooting

                             in twenty minutes.

                                   BECKY

                           I'm shaving my bush --

                                    JACK

                                    Now?

                                   BECKY

                      It only takes two seconds, Jack.

                                    JACK

                                Fine, fine.

Jack continues to get everyone ready.

                                    JACK

                   Alright everyone, let's go, let's go,

                    we need to shoot this first scene --

                         we need to get one off --

CUT TO:

53 INT. BEDROOM - DAY - LATER

Dirk is sitting on the edge of the bed, dressed up in a brown suit and his
hair is brushed back, parted down the middle. He paces a little, does some
deep breathing, looks over script, etc. Scotty J. enters.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                        Hey. Hi. Dirk. Dirk Diggler.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                       I'm supposed to come get you.

                        Tell you they're ready, now.

                                    DIRK

                                   Okay.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                           You look really good.

                                    DIRK

                                 Thank you.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                           You look really sexy.

                                    DIRK

                                  Thanks.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                             I like your name.

                                    DIRK

                                  You do.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                             It's really cool.

                                    DIRK

                                  Thanks.

                                 SCOTTY J.

              OK . . . well . . . whenever you're ready . . .

                          I'll see you out there.

Scotty J. exits. Dirk stands, takes a deep breath. CAMERA follows as he
exits the room and walks through the house and into --

54 INT. GARAGE/FILM SET

The crew is ready and waiting. Jack is there to greet him.

                                    JACK

                               Ready, champ?

                                    DIRK

                               Let's do this.

They walk through the scene with Amber.

                                    JACK

                  So we know the scene, we know the thing.

                    You're gonna start outside the set,

                   through that door, I'll call your name

             and action, that'll be your cue . . . come through

                the door, straight to the desk, right here,

                    boom, you and Amber do the scene --

                                    DIRK

                     Do we go straight into having sex?

                                    JACK

                              Is that alright?

                                    DIRK

                    It would be better I think, y'know,

                     so we don't break up the momentum

                              or something --

                                    JACK

                                   Amber?

                                   AMBER

                                   Good.

                                    JACK

                     So we'll just go straight through.

                                    DIRK

                                   Okay.

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                         Are we doing a rehearsal?

                                    JACK

                        Eddie, you want a rehearsal?

                                    DIRK

                     It's okay . . . I can do it . . .

                                    JACK

                                   Great.

                                    DIRK

                                   Jack?

                                    JACK

                                   Yeah?

                                    DIRK

               . . . can you . . . um . . . will you call me

                         Dirk Diggler from now on?

                                    JACK

                         Yes. I'm sorry, yeah, yes.

Jack exits. Amber and Dirk huddle in the corner a moment.

                                   AMBER

                Do you want to practice your lines with me?

                                    DIRK

                                 I know it.

                                   AMBER

                           You look great, honey.

                                    DIRK

                Does he want me to keep going until I come?

                                   AMBER

                Yeah. You just come when you're ready . . .

                                    DIRK

                            Where should I come?

                                   AMBER

                             Where do you want?

                                    DIRK

                           Wherever you tell me.

                                   AMBER

                     Come on my tits if you can, okay?

                       Just pull it out and do it on

                      my stomach and tits if you can.

                                    DIRK

                                   Yeah.

She touches her hand softly to the side of his face. (30fps)

                                   AMBER

                          Are you alright, honey?

                                    DIRK

                 This is great. I'm ready. I wanna do good.

               I wanna do this good . . . let's try and do it

                       really sexy . . . you want to?

                                   AMBER

                                   Okay.

Little Bill takes Dirk and walks him off the set, explaining things one
last time to him . . . CAMERA HOLDS ON DIRK. Little Bill walks away and
he's left standing alone a moment, waiting for his cue behind a closed
door. SILENCE. HOLD.

                                 JACK (OC)

                          and . . . action, Dirk.

CAMERA blends to SLOW MOTION (30fps) and FOLLOWS Dirk through the door and
into the set -- lights flare into CAMERA/DIRK and we focus in on Amber,
seated behind a desk. CAMERA blends back to 24fps.

KURT LONGJOHN'S 16mm CAMERA POV:

Dirk enters. A light shines straight at him. He walks into a two shot with
Amber at the desk. BEAT, THEN:

                                   AMBER

                            Hello. Are you John?

                                    DIRK

                                Yes, ma'am.

                                   AMBER

                  Your agency recommends you very highly.

                                    DIRK

                     I'm a really hard worker. You give

                    me a job and I won't disappoint you.

                                   AMBER

                      What special skills do you have?

                                    DIRK

                 Well, I spent three years in the Marines.

                    I just got back from a tour of duty.

                                   AMBER

                              You're kidding?

                                    DIRK

                    No I'm not. It got really hard being

                        surrounded by guys all day.

                                   AMBER

                  When was the last time you had a woman?

                                    DIRK

                                A long time.

                                   AMBER

                              That's terrible.

                                    DIRK

                  But I'm back now and I'm ready to pursue

                             my acting career.

                                   AMBER

                Well as you may or may not know, this is an

                 important film for me. If it's not a hit,

                 I'm gonna get kicked out of my apartment.

                        My landlord is a real jerk.

                                    DIRK

                                  Really?

                                   AMBER

                     Why don't you take your pants off?

              It's important that I get an idea of your size.

                                    DIRK

                                No problem.

Dirk starts to remove his pants . . . just before they come off we go to:

JACK AND THE REST OF THE CREW

Kurt Longjohn takes his eye away from the viewfinder for a moment. Rocky
frowns slightly. Scotty J. is in shock. Reed and Becky smile.

Amber looks from Dirk's cock to his face.

                                   AMBER

                      I think that you have the part,

                but why don't I make sure of something . . .

16mm CAMERA'S POV:

for the first time, we see Dirk's cock. It hangs about 12 inches. Amber's
hand reaches and grabs hold of it --

                                   AMBER

                           This is a giant cock.

So they go at it . . . taking each other's clothes off and climbing up on
the desk . . . OUR CAMERA is hand held, moving around, looking at the crew
filming and Dick/Amber making love . . . .

They continue for a while. Jack whispers something to Kurt, then walks over
to Dirk and Amber, quietly interrupts;

                                    JACK

                                 Guys . . .

                                    DIRK

                            Is everything cool?

                                    JACK

                     Hang in there, everything's cool,

                      I just wanna change the angle --

                            You're doin' great.

Amber looks to Dirk. They hold still;

                                   AMBER

                        You're doin' so good, Dirk.

                                    DIRK

                             Does it feel good?

Amber smiles. Jack and Kurt have set up a new angle;

                                    JACK

                Okay -- we're back, we're ready -- action --

They continue for a bit, getting faster and a little harder;

CU. DIRK AND AMBER

they're face to face. Following in sotto:

                                   AMBER

                              You're amazing.

                                    DIRK

                           You feel good, Amber.

                                   AMBER

                           Are you ready to come?

                                    DIRK

                                    Yes.

                                   AMBER

                                Come in me.

                                    DIRK

                                   What?

                                   AMBER

                          Don't worry, I'm fixed.

                          I want to come in me --

Amber and Dirk come together. HOLD. They kiss and smile.

                                    JACK

                         CUT! FUCK! YES! YES! YES!

THE CREW APPLAUDS THE PERFORMANCE. Everyone gathers around. Dirk is giving
hand shakes, high fives, etc.

CAMERA PANS over to Little Bill and Jack who step aside a moment. Following
in sotto;

                                    JACK

                              That was great.

                                LITTLE BILL

                      Yes it was. What do you want to

                      do about the come shot? We could

                go to the stock footage -- get a close up --

                                    JACK

                       It's not gonna match, we don't

                      have a cock that big on film --

Dirk hears this and turns to Jack and Little Bill.

                                    DIRK

                                   Jack?

                                    JACK

                                 Yes, Dirk?

                                    DIRK

                 I can do it again if you need a close-up.

Everyone in the room looks at Dirk. HOLD.

              What we can do is make it all one thing, right?

               You can go from being on top -- below and then

                  move and shift to the side -- pump away

                         there for a while, then --

Dirk gets on the bed with Rollergirl and tries a move.

                                    DIRK

                               KURT LONGJOHN

                 Is the movement of the waterbed a problem?

                                    DIRK

                                    JACK

                  Jack Horner has found something special

                   in newcomer Dirk Diggler. It's another

             stellar, sexual standout from Horner and Company.

              Diggler delivers a performance worth a thousand

              hard-ons. His presence when dressed is powerful

                            and demanding . . .

                 . . . when stripped to the bone, Diggler's

                 more eruptive than a volcano on a bad day.

                Amber Waves ripe-cherry lips do a wonderful

                  job of handling Diggler's wide load and

                Reed Rothchild's stiff biceps do a slapping

               good job with Becky Barnett's supple ass . . .

                                 JACK (VO)

              . . . but it's Diggler that remains the standout

               in this film. It's easy to predict, after only

            two films, that's Diggler's suck-cess can only grow

                            and grow and grow --

73 INT. JACK'S VAN - MOVING - DAY (music over into radio)

Amber is driving the van, Buck is in the passenger seat trying to figure
out why the radio isn't working and speaking;

                                    BUCK

                       If you were to open a business

                     specializing in, like, Super-Super

                    Hi-Fi Stereo Equipment -- forget it,

                    you're in the money. I mean, there's

                     no limit to the technology that's

                             comin' out now --

                                   AMBER

                                  Really?

                                    BUCK

                               That's a fact.

                                   AMBER

                      So what's wrong with this radio?

                                    BUCK

                 I think it's . . . uh . . . it's a wattage

                problem . . . yeah . . . we've got too many

                 watts per channel going into the front two

                          speaker . . . yeah . . .

IN THE BACK OF THE VAN:

Reed, Dirk and Jack are huddled, speaking intensely;

                                    JACK

                               -- what else?

                                    DIRK

                     That's it for now. I mean: I look

                     at this character Holmes has come

                    up with -- and -- look -- I just --

                                    JACK

                                  Tell me.

                                    DIRK

                I don't like to see women treated that way.

                This guy he plays, "Johnny Wad," it's always

                about slapping some girl around or whatever.

              It's not right, it's not cool and it just . . .

                isn't sexy. It isn't sexy like it should be.

                                    REED

                   We could make it more of a James Bond

                 character. This guy that's world traveled.

                                    JACK

                                I like that.

                                    DIRK

                        Reed could play my partner.

                                    JACK

                             I like this a lot.

                                    DIRK

                    We could make it really good, Jack.

                 Honestly. If you direct it . . . we could

                  make a whole series, with a whole story.

              This is exactly what we've always talked about.

                                    JACK

                           I know it. I know it.

                                    REED

                             We should do this.

                                    JACK

                  Alright. When we get back. We'll set up

                  the typewriter and we'll see what we can

                come up with. I'll talk to the Colonel when

                 we get to Vegas. But Dirk, you gotta work

                             on him too, okay?

                                    DIRK

                               Right, right.

                                    JACK

                -- if we don't put every element into this,

                        it's just not gonna work --

                                    DIRK

                                  Exactly.

                                    JACK

                        Now: What's this guy's name?

                        This character? Do you know?

                                    DIRK

                         His name is Brock Landers.

                                    REED

                   His partner's name is Chest Rockwell.

                                    JACK

              And The Award . . . for Best Actor Goes To . . .

                  I've seen his movies and I can't wait to

                work with him, I can't wait to get that big

                 cock in my mouth, my ass, my pussy or any

           which way he'll give it to me . . . Mr. Dirk Diggler!

The Audience Applauds wildly. Dirk, dressed in a jean outfit, makes his way
to the stage and accepts the award from Jessie. He turns to the crowd.

                                    DIRK

                Wow. I dunno what to say . . . I guess. Wow.

                 I guess the only thing I can say, is that

                 I promise to keep rocking and rolling and

               to keep making better films. It seems we make

         these movies . . . and sometimes . . . they're considered

            filthy or something by some people . . . but I don't

               think that's true. These films we make can be

        better . . . they can help . . . they really can, I mean it.

              We can always do better -- and I'll keep trying

           if you keep trying so let's keep ROCKING AND ROLLING.

AUDIENCE APPLAUDS. Jessie St. Vincent comes over and plants a deep, wet

                 told me the food in here was really good.

                   Good. No, it's not good. It's probably

                   the BEST place to eat in Los Angeles.

                              It's excellent.

                 Because sometimes I feel like an outsider

               to the whole thing. Y'know . . . I see you and

                 Amber and your relationship and I dunno --

                                    DIRK

                     No, no, Jessie. You shouldn't feel

                             like an outsider.

                                   JESSIE

                  I know my tits aren't as big and I know

                  my pussy isn't as tight as all the other

                  girls in this industry but I still feel

                   like I've got something that works --

                             I can paint, too.

                                    DIRK

                               Yes. Yes. Yes.

                                   JESSIE

                  I dunno. I was just never really secure.

                When I was a kid, I was never really secure

                with myself that much -- I guess that's why

            I try and act like I'm all care-free and everything.

                                    DIRK

                 I know what you mean, sometimes I'm like,

                 "What am I doing?" "What the hell is wrong

                             with me?" Y'know?

                        But then . . . I think . . .

                                   JESSIE

                       -- it's just fun. It's great.

                                    DIRK

                    It is. It's the best. I mean, look:

                      I couldn't be happier than where

                   I am today, right now, at this moment.

                                   JESSIE

                     You are so fucking awesome, Dirk.

                                    DIRK

                   Who says you don't have a tight pussy?

                                   JESSIE

                       I don't know. No one, I guess.

                    So I was all, "What's your problem?"

                    And he was all, "Nothing." So I was

             like . . . really . . . y'know . . . I was fuckin'

                     pissed, Amber. So then I was all,

                   like, "What are you gonna do?" Y'know?

                     And he was all, like acting tough,

                 y'know, with his friends around and stuff.

              So I was just all . . . like . . . "Forget it."

                             And I walked away.

                                   FLOYD

                    Why not be prepared? The money comes

                  from the Colonel, the talent comes from

                  you, Jack. I've got a connection to the

                 equipment and the mail order distribution,

                 not to mention those kids I got out there

                    who are hot-fuck-action to the max.

              This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.

                                    JACK

                  I have a stable of actors and actresses.

                     They're professionals. They're not

                    a bunch of fucking amateurs. They're

                   proven box office and they get people

                  in theaters (where films should be seen)

                     and they know how to fuck well --

                                   FLOYD

                       That's right, Jack and by that

                    same token, you're the one with the

                      power here. The video revolution

                  is upon us -- and our role is critical.

                 We have an obligation to use our resources

                     and talent to help make it fly --

                                    JACK

                You come in here, at my party, tell me about

                 this and that -- tell me about the future,

                  tell me about -- video and amateurs and

               all that -- well lemme tell you something now:

                   I will not shoot films on video and no

                   I will not loan out my actors who are

                       under contract to me. Period.

                                   FLOYD

              Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man.

                  I like cinema. In particular, I like to

                  see fucking on film. I don't want to win

                 an Oscar and I don't want to re-invent the

               wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter

                    in my ass and lollipops in my mouth.

               That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert,

                  but this is something I enjoy. One other

               small thing I want to do in this life is make

              a dollar and a cent in this business -- I'm not

              trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay

                       one step ahead of the game --

                                    JACK

                   We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.

                                  COLONEL

               Jack, I think this is about cost and future --

                                    JACK

                  The future is as bright as we make it --

                it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars

                that can be saved shooting on video tape --

                if it looks like shit and sounds like shit,

                           it probably is shit --

                                   FLOYD

              I think you're one gin past this conversation --

                                    JACK

                    No . . . no. I'm crystal clear here.

                                  COLONEL

                    Jack, please understand that this is

                 not an argument . . . this is a fact of --

                                    JACK

                             . . . What . . . ?

                                  COLONEL

                     This is not an argument, but a --

                                    JACK

                            What are you saying?

                                  COLONEL

                      What do you mean, Jack, c'mon --

                                    JACK

                       Are you telling me that you're

                          working with this shit?

                                  COLONEL

                    I think that there is a serious case

                  to be made for the price and the gamble

                on the whole idea of a home video market --

                Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's

                   gonna be able to walk into their local

               supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --

                                    JACK

                   True film fans won't watch that shit.

                 It doesn't look good and more importantly

                       it doesn't make sex look sexy.

                                  COLONEL

                    It doesn't have to look good, Jack.

                      Film is just too damn expensive.

                     The theaters are already planning

                      converting to video projectors.

                                    JACK

                           I haven't heard that.

                                   FLOYD

                                 It's true.

                                    JACK

                    We've got ten minutes until the New

                Year and I don't want it to start like this

                  so I'm leaving now. We will or we won't

                continue this conversation some other time.

Jack leaves. Floyd looks to the Colonel. HOLD.

92 INT. AMBER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dirk and Amber enter. She sits him on the bed.

                                   AMBER

                  I wanted you . . . to just . . . to come

                     in and give me a minute so I could

                       tell you how much I love you.

                     It's gonna be a new year and we're

                      gonna start things and do things

                     and I want you to know how much I

                     really care for you, honey. I care

             for you so much . . . you're my little baby . . .

                                    DIRK

                             Thank you, Amber.

                                   AMBER

                     You're the best thing in the world

                     that's happened to me since my son

             went off . . . and I just . . . I love you, honey.

                                    DIRK

                           I love you too, Amber.

Amber continues to talk as she sets up more lines of coke.

                                   AMBER

               Fucking 1980 . . . y'know? Can you believe it?

                                    DIRK

                  I can't . . . it's like . . . next thing

                   we know . . . it's gonna be 1990, then

                        2000 . . . can you imagine?

                                   AMBER

                 Goodbye to 1979 . . . hello to 1980 . . .

                           (handing him a straw)

              Make sure you snort it back quick and hard . . .

                                    DIRK

                              . . . wh . . . ?

                                   AMBER

                        Really fast, like this . . .

She demonstrates. Dirk hesitates a moment, then leans down and does a line
of coke.

                                    DIRK

                                 It burns.

                                   AMBER

                         It's good, though, right?

                                    DIRK

                     It's in my throat . . . uch . . .

                                   AMBER

               It's the drip . . . the drip's the best part.

                                    DIRK

                            Tastes like aspirin.

                                   AMBER

                     Do one more in the other nostril.

                                    DIRK

                . . . I need a glass of water, I think . . .

                                   AMBER

                         One more, then the water.

Dirk does another line.

                                    DIRK

                        Do I look cool when I do it?

Amber is right there to KISS him very hard on the mouth. HOLD.

93 INT. JACK'S HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

Dirk and Amber emerge from the bedroom and walk back to the party . . . .
Amber stops to say hello to some people . . . . Dirk keeps walking . . .
CAMERA follows him outside . . . Scotty J. approaches . . . .

                                 SCOTTY J.

                                 Hey, Dirk.

                                    DIRK

                        Scotty. Hey. What's up, man?

                                 SCOTTY J.

                  . . . fuckin' New Year's, y'know, right?

                                    DIRK

                                   1980.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                       Right. Did you see my new car?

                                    DIRK

                             You got a new car?

                                 SCOTTY J.

                              Yeah. Wanna see?

                                    DIRK

                                   Sure.

CAMERA FOLLOWS them outside, they pass Reed and Todd who are standing near
the BBQ pit --

                                    REED

                    Hey, Dirk, c'mere and meet someone.

                   This is Todd, my pal from the thing --

                                    DIRK

                                How are ya?

                              We finally meet.

                                    REED

                      Remember I told you about Todd?

                      He works over at the Party Boys

                                 (to Todd)

                  I'll see you around. We can talk later.

                                 Yesterday.

                                    DIRK

                       It's great. It's really great.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                Oh, shit! Let's get back inside, come on --

Dirk starts to walk away . . . Scotty watches him go . . . Suddenly: Scotty
CHARGES Dirk from behind and starts to KISS his neck. Dirk stumbles, pushes
him away and turns:

                                 SCOTTY J.

                    I'm sorry, Dirk. Please. I'm sorry.

                                    DIRK

                          . . . why'd you do that?

                                 SCOTTY J.

                        You look at me sometimes --

                                  -- What?

                                 SCOTTY J.

                        I wanna know if you like me.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                              Can I kiss you?

                         -- Can I kiss your mouth?

                           Please. Please let me.

                                    DIRK

                                    No.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                      I'm really sorry. I didn't mean

                       to grab you . . . I didn't --

                                    DIRK

                                    JACK

                    -- it's okay, Colonel. It's gonna be

                  fine in the end . . . . I promise . . .

                                  COLONEL

                           Are you promising me?

Jack doesn't answer.

                                  COLONEL

               Take it back, Jack. Don't promise me anything.

              You can't help me. I'm done. I'm going to jail.

        I've done wrong and I'm going to jail for a long, long time.

They hold a look for a moment. A few OFFICERS come and start to escort the
Colonel away. He leans in, speaks sotto;

                                  COLONEL

                   Listen to me, Jack: And I'm gonna tell

                    you this for you. Am I your friend?

                                    JACK

                                   What?

                                  COLONEL

                        Answer me, am I your friend?

                                    JACK

                                    Yes.

                                  COLONEL

                    So remember that I'm your friend and

               listen to what I tell you now: Give in, Jack.

               You've gotta give. For you, for your business

                 and your livelihood -- accept the future.

                   Don't fight it, because you can't win.

               Look for the new blood, go to Floyd Gondolli,

                  go to video, give up your battle -- the

                         filmmaking is over, Jack.

                It costs money, you got ten, fifteen people

                  standing around, and that's just to make

             . . . yeah, yeah, yeah . . . You look good, ready.

Dirk does some quick KARATE moves, then turns his BACK TO THE CAMERA. He
unzips his pants, looks down at his cock. His body starts to move a little,
slowly at first then faster as he tries to masturbate.

                                    DIRK

              C'mon . . . c'mon . . . c'mon . . . I'm a star.

                   I'm a star, I'm a rock and roll star.

                         And My Cock Can Get Hard.

              C'mon . . . c'mon . . . c'mon . . . I'm a star.

                    I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star.

The DOOR to the Bathroom is SUDDENLY OPENED by Scotty J. who catches Dirk
in the mirror with his pants down, speaking to himself;

                                    DIRK

                            -- what the fuck --

Scotty exits quickly. Dirk pulls up his pants and exits --

CUT TO:

117 EXT. JACK'S HOUSE/POOL AREA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jack is still sitting in the same spot. Johnny Doe is drying off. Dirk
comes charging out --

                                    DIRK

                            I'm ready to shoot.

                                    JACK

                          We need twenty minutes.

                                    DIRK

                   No. I'm ready now. It's gotta be now.

                                    JACK

                              Twenty minutes.

                                    DIRK

                        Fuck it. Hey, no, hey, Jack.

                 I'm ready now . . . my cock is ready now.

                   I'm ready to fuck . . . let's go now.

                                    JACK

                   Yeah, well . . . NO. Get me. You wanna

                        start something here, Dirk?

                                    DIRK

              I wanna start fucking . . . who is it gonna be?

                                    JACK

                                   What?

                                    DIRK

                    Who do you want to fuck, me or him?

Dirk points at Johnny Doe.

                                 JOHNNY DOE

                               Me . . . what?

                                    DIRK

                                  Shut up.

                                 JOHNNY DOE

                        I didn't do anything to you.

                                    DIRK

                    You're not an actor, man. You got no

               business being here -- you're not an actor --

                                 JOHNNY DOE

                                 Yes I am.

                                    DIRK

                  No: I'm an actor, man. I'm a real actor.

                                 JOHNNY DOE

                                  Shut up.

Dirk MAKES A QUICK KARATE-TYPE MOVE TOWARDS JOHNNY DOE, WHO FLINCHES, BUT
QUICKLY GETS INTO A KARATE STANCE OF HIS OWN.

                                 JOHNNY DOE

                              HEY, MAN, DON'T.

                                    DIRK

                             SHUT UP. SHUT UP.

                                    JACK

                       Dirk, you need to settle down.

                        Go inside, have a drink and

                   mellow this off . . . you understand?

                                    DIRK

                            I'm ready to shoot.

                                    JACK

                               Well I'm not.

                                    DIRK

                    I'm not gonna tell you again, Jack:

                                    JACK

                             -- Get outta here.

                                    DIRK

                             . . . What . . . ?

                                    JACK

                    Get off my set, get outta my house.

                                    DIRK

                           . . . you . . . what?

                                    JACK

                                   Leave.

                                    DIRK

                                    No.

                                    JACK

                        You don't want to do this --

                         the state you're in, Dirk.

                                    DIRK

                       Whatta you mean, state? State?

                     State of California? Yeah, I'm in

                          the state of California.

                                    JACK

                               Jesus Christ.

                                    DIRK

                      What are you, Jack, Jack, hey --

                                    JACK

                 You're high and you need to sleep it off.

                        You've been up for two days.

                                    DIRK

                      I haven't been up for two days.

                                    JACK

                     Whatever. You're high and you need

                     to come down. Sleep it off, Dirk.

                                    DIRK

                        YOU DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

                                    JACK

                          Get the fuck outta here.

                                    DIRK

                         YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME.

                                    JACK

                                 Yes I am.

                                    DIRK

                           ARE YOU THE KING? HUH?

                                    JACK

                      Jesus Christ. MOVE. GET OUT. GO.

Jack starts to prod Dirk a little with a slight PUSH.

                                    DIRK

                      DON'T YOU FUCKIN TOUCH ME, MAN.

Jack SLAPS Dirk across the face. HOLD. Dirk is shocked. Everyone has
stopped what they're doing by now and is watching nervously. Amber comes
over.

                                   AMBER

                 Dirk, honey, why don't we go for a walk --

                                    DIRK

                  YOU SHUT UP, TOO. YOU'RE NOT THE MOTHER

                  OF ME OR MY BOSS. YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER.

                                   AMBER

                            Dirk, please, honey.

                                    JACK

                                  Reed --

Reed comes over to the fight.

                                    JACK

                  Take him home, Reed. I don't need this.

                                    DIRK

                      No. No. I wanna shoot the scene.

                  I'm ready to shoot the scene. I'm fine.

                                    JACK

                           I don't want you here.

                                    DIRK

                    Look . . . it's over . . . alright.

                   I'm done . . . now I'm ready to shoot.

                    I'm calm, my cock is cool and ready.

                                    REED

                        Why don't we go home, Dirk?

                                    DIRK

                     I'm the one with the cock, I'm the

               one with the big fucking cock, so let's go --

                                    JACK

                        You listen to me now, kid --

                                    DIRK

                   DON'T CALL ME A KID. I'LL FUCK YOU UP.

                 YOU WANNA SEE ME KICK SOME ASS? YOU WANNA

                   FUCK WITH ME, I KNOW KARATE. SO C'MON.

                                    REED

                       Dirk, let's be cool, let's --

                                    DIRK

                    I'm the biggest star here -- THAT'S

                      THE WAY IT IS: I WANNA FUCK. AND

                 IT'S MY BIG DICK, SO EVERYBODY GET READY.

                                    JACK

                                Not anymore.

                                    DIRK

                         WHAT? What "not anymore"?

                                    JACK

                                 Your dick.

                                    DIRK

                            WHAT, WHAT? SAY IT.

                                    JACK

                I've seen you push thirteen inches, you'd be

            lucky if you could manage six today -- all the coke

                 you got in you. You're not ready to fuck,

                  your dick's not getting hard today, kid.

                                    DIRK

                  DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT ME LIKE THAT, JACK.

                                    JACK

                        Alright: You're fired. Okay?

                       You understand? You're fired.

                          Get outta here now. NOW.

                                    DIRK

                     WHAT? WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT?

                                    JACK

                     Just leave, Dirk. Leave RIGHT NOW.

                                    DIRK

                      My cock is READY. YOU WANNA SEE?

                  HUH? YOU WANNA SEE MY BIG FUCKIN' COCK?

Suddenly, blood begins to pour violently from his nose. He cups his hand
over his nose, hides his embarrassment;

                                    DIRK

                      FUCK THIS, FUCK THIS, FUCK YOU.

                   FUCK ALL OF YOU. YOU'RE NOT MY BOSSES.

                         NO ONE IS THE KING OF ME.

Dirk runs away, gets behind the wheel of his Corvette and tears off,
bleeding all the way --

Reed, Jack, Amber, Scotty, Johnny Doe and the rest of the crew watch him
go.

FADE OUT.

119 INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY (Mar. 83) Sequence "D"

Dirk stands in front of a microphone wearing headphones. The ENGINEER in
the booth speaks;

                                  ENGINEER

                        Okay . . . Dirk, you ready?

                           I was born ready, man.

                                  ENGINEER

                     Okay . . . Dirk Diggler Demo Tape,

                   "You Got The Touch," take seven . . .

The BAND kicks in and Dirk begins to sing his song. It's a cross between
Kenny Loggins/Survivor and any "Rocky" anthem.

                                    DIRK

                 YOU GOT THE TOUCH . . . YOU GOT THE POWER.

                 YEEEEAAAHHHH. AFTER ALL IS SAID AND DONE,

              YOU NEVER WALK, YOU NEVER RUN, YOU'RE A WINNER.

Dirk, Reed and the Engineer are mixing. The song PLAYS.

                                    DIRK

                  Is the bass taking away from the vocals?

                                  ENGINEER

             Well . . . a little . . . but not really too much.

                                    DIRK

                  Let's take down the bass and let's take

                               up the vocals.

121 INT. RECORDING STUDIO - LATER

Dirk is singing. Reed is playing guitar on a BALLAD called, "FEEL THE

               THE HEAT WILL ROCK YOU, THE HEAT WILL ROLL YOU

                            BABY DON'T YOU KNOW

                        So . . . what do you think?

                                    DIRK

                   Well I think that . . . maybe we could

                      speed it up a little -- it's --

                                  ENGINEER

                      It's a ballad. I thought that --

                                    DIRK

                  We'll just speed it up a couple octaves.

                   . . . cause that might make it cooler,

             people like it when slow songs . . . y'know . . .

               when they're a little fast . . . it's cooler.

                    Couple nights ago . . . and he died.

                    He like, went through the windshield

                     or something. Fuckin' shit. Dead.

                                    DIRK

                                 For real?

                                    REED

                   Yeah. He's dead. Can you believe that?

                                    DIRK

               That's gotta hurt, goin' through a windshield.

                              It's tough luck.

Dirk does another line of coke. The PHONE RINGS and Dirk answers.
DOLLY/ZOOM IN QUICK.

                                    DIRK

                     Hello? Becky? Becky -- what? What?

SPLIT-SCREEN;

138 INT. BECKY'S HOUSE/BAKERSFIELD - DAY - THAT MOMENT

Becky is locked in her bedroom on the phone with Dirk. OC outside the
bedroom, we can hear Jerome YELLING and SCREAMING.

                                   BECKY

                   I think Jerome is gonna kill me, Dirk.

                      Please. Please come and help me.

                                    DIRK

                   Well . . . where are you, I don't know

                              where you are --

                                   BECKY

                       I need you to save me, Dirk --

                  if he catches me on the phone, I'm dead.

                                    DIRK

                           Tell me where you are.

                                   BECKY

                 . . . okay . . . okay . . . OH SHIT. He's

                     coming in -- okay -- okay -- meet

                      me at Denny's in Bakersfield --

                       on Colfax Blvd. Please hurry.

                                    DIRK

                   Okay. I'm comin' right now, right now.

               I'm comin' right now to kick some ass, Becky.

SPLIT SCREEN/CAMERA stays with Becky are she hangs up the phone. The DOOR
to the BEDROOM IS SMASHED OPEN by Jerome -- he GRABS her by the hair of her
head and throws her across the room and into the KITCHEN.

                                   BECKY

                  Please don't do anything to me, Jerome.

                           Please. Please. I ask.

                                   JEROME

                 Think you're Miss Fuckin' Movie Star with

                  a dick in your mouth? Huh? You're gonna

                tell me -- tell it to me or I'm gonna break

                             your fuckin' jaw.

                                   BECKY

                      I don't know what you want me --

                                   JEROME

                  -- I want you to tell me that you liked

                getting fucked by those men in those movies.

                I want you to tell me that you loved getting

               shit in your face -- YOU FUCKIN' SAY IT, CUNT.

                                   BECKY

                           . . . I liked it . . .

                                   JEROME

                           Do you like big dicks?

                                   BECKY

                    I don't know what you want me to --

                                   JEROME

                                  SAY IT.

                                   BECKY

                                    Yes.

Jerome LEANS DOWN AND PUNCHES BECKY IN THE FACE. HOLD. He catches his
breath and walks out of the kitchen.

Becky, crouched in a corner, bleeding from her nose and mouth, reaches for
a large FRYING PAN on the floor --

CUT TO:

139 INT. DIRK'S HOUSE - DAY - THAT MOMENT

Dirk grabs his keys and his jacket and heads for the door . . .

                                    REED

                              Where you goin'?

                                    DIRK

                        Gotta go kick some ass, man.

He stops a moment and heads back into his bedroom . . . grabs his coke in a
newspaper fold and makes a dash for the door --

CUT TO:

140 EXT. DIRK'S HOUSE - DAY - THAT MOMENT

Dirk exits and gets in his car QUICK. DOLLY/ZOOM IN FAST.

CUT TO:

141 INT. BECKY'S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUED

CAMERA DOLLIES in front of Jerome as he walks out of the kitchen. In the
b.g., Becky appears with the frying pan in her hand . . .

She SMASHES THE FRYING PAN ACROSS THE BACK OF JEROME'S SKULL. He falls . .
she STANDS OVER HIM, STRIKING HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN.

                                   BECKY

                    DON'T -- YOU -- EVER -- TOUCH -- ME.

She runs out the door --

CUT TO:

142 EXT. BAKERSFIELD HOUSE - EVENING - THAT MOMENT

Becky runs from the house and off down the street. HOLD.

CUT TO:

143 INT. DIRK'S CORVETTE - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

Dirk is driving quickly through Laurel Canyon and trying to do a few
things; 1) He's trying to light a cigarette with matches, 2) He's trying to
find a cassette tape to play and 3) He's trying to brush his hair in the
rearview mirror . . . .

CU. DIRK

The cigarette falls from his mouth and he leans down, OUT OF FRAME to pick
it up . . . . the car starts drifting towards a TELEPHONE POLE that is
fifteen yards ahead . . . Dirk gets the cigarette, comes up INTO FRAME,
looks ahead and blinks;

Dirk's Corvette SLAMS INTO THE TELEPHONE POLE.

CAMERA DOLLIES IN ON DIRK, BEHIND THE WHEEL. He shakes his head, looks
around in a daze. A PEDESTRIAN runs over;

                                 PEDESTRIAN

                             You alright, pal?

                                    DIRK

                 My fuckin' car, my car . . . my Corvette.

                                 PEDESTRIAN

                 Holy shit, you slammed right into this --

Dirk puts the car in reverse and backs away.

                                 PEDESTRIAN

                  I don't think you should dirve this car.

                                    DIRK

                                 Fuck you.

Dirk drives off with the front of the Corvette SHREDDING along the
pavement.

CUT TO:

144 INT. BAKERSFIELD DENNY'S - NIGHT (LATER)

Becky is sitting at the counter. A few seats over from her is an older man,
MR. BROWN (late 60s). He wears an old gray suit,

                                 MR. BROWN

                          Are you alright, ma'am?

                                   BECKY

                                   What?

                                 MR. BROWN

                        Are you going to be alright?

                 You seem . . . you've been sitting there.

                     A while now. And I want to know if

                        you're going to be alright.

HOLD. Becky looks down.

                                 MR. BROWN

              Do you want to order something? A bowl of soup?

                                   BECKY

                       My friend was supposed to come

                    here and get me, but he hasn't come.

                                 MR. BROWN

                  Yes. Well, why don't you let me buy you

                 some soup while you wait for your friend?

                                   BECKY

                          No. No. I'm not hungry.

                                 MR. BROWN

                    Please. Please. I want to help you.

             This is not . . . this is something . . . you see,

                    an act of kindness, I'm trying to do

               something good . . . to help you . . . for no

             other reason . . . other than . . . just to help.

Mr. Brown reaches into his pocket, takes out a quarter and places it on the
counter in front of Becky.

                                 MR. BROWN

                   Why don't you try calling you friend?

BEAT. Becky looks at the quarter. CAMERA HOLDS ON QUARTER.

                               MR. BROWN (OC)

                        Use the quarter, young lady.

CUT TO:

145 INT. DIRK'S GARAGE - NIGHT

Dirk rants and raves, verging on tears, circling the car. Scotty, Reed and
Todd are now home and looking at the damage;

                                    REED

                          How fast were you going?

                                    DIRK

                           Fuck, I dunno. Ninety.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                           Ninety miles an hour?

                                    DIRK

                    Shit, yeah. I'm lucky I'm not dead.

                                    TODD

                          This is a lot of damage.

                                    REED

                          At least it's driveable.

                                    DIRK

                      It's nove driveable, look at it.

OC we hear the PHONE RINGING. Scotty moves to get it.

                                    DIRK

                Just let it ring, we gotta deal with this --

                                    REED

                       At least it still works, Dirk.

                                    DIRK

                    You can't just drive a Corvette down

                    the street looking like that, Reed.

                         C'mon, man. Be reasonable.

                                    REED

                         How you gonna pay for it?

                                    DIRK

                     -- I'll find a way to pay for it.

                        This is top priority, Reed:

                        My car has got to get fixed.

                                    TODD

                    It could be like two/three thousand

                       dollars worth of damage, Dirk.

                                    DIRK

                                    So?

                                    TODD

                                  I dunno.

                                    DIRK

                We gotta get those fuckin' demo tapes, too.

                I mean it . . . let's go kick that guy's ass

               or something . . . if we could get those demo

                  tapes, then we get the record deal, then

                   the Vette gets fixed. You cannot drive

               a Corvette down the street looking like this,

                              you just can't.

146 INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Becky is sitting in a booth across from the Mr. Brown. She's crying.

                                   BECKY

                     I don't know where to go. I don't

                 have anywhere to go, I can't get anywhere.

                                 MR. BROWN

                  It's alright. It's alright, young lady.

                                   BECKY

                    I'm so sorry to make you hear this.

                                 MR. BROWN

                            I want to help you.

                                   BECKY

                                No, I can't.

                                 MR. BROWN

                    You need help. You need someplace to

                   sleep and to wash. I want to help you.

                                   BECKY

Amber is sitting in a room with a long desk, a few chairs and fluorescent
lights. A middle aged female JUDGE enters and greets her;

                                   JUDGE

                         Hello. You must be Maggie?

                     I'm Kathleen O'Malley. The judge.

                                    Yes.

                                   JUDGE

                        You have a lawyer with you?

                                   AMBER

                           No. I don't. I do not.

They sit in silence. The Judge looks over a couple of files. Moments later,
Amber's ex-husband, THOMAS (late 30s) steps in with his LAWYER. They all
take seats.

                                   LAWYER

                               Hello, Judge.

Introductions happen, etc. BEAT. The Judge looks over some files;

                                   JUDGE

                    You've been divorced for six years.

                                   AMBER

                              Yes. Since 1977.

                                (to lawyer)

                 And the agreement on the money settlement

                             was taken care of?

                                   LAWYER

                  Initially, Andrew went with his father,

                    to her home or any reasonable place.

                                 (to Amber)

                        Was that the understanding?

                                    Yes.

                                   JUDGE

              And why wasn't that visiting privilege honored?

                                   THOMAS

                         Well, it was for a time --

                                   AMBER

                           I only saw him twice.

                                   THOMAS

                 It said, "reasonable place," and I didn't

                  think a house of drugs and prostitution

                         and pornography was that.

                                   JUDGE

                     I'm sorry, what is it that you --

                                   THOMAS

                 My ex-wife is involved in the pornography

                business -- I didn't think that environment

                        was a safe place for my son.

                                   AMBER

                    This is not right. My son was never

                    exposed to pornographic material or

                  drugs or any of these things, my husband

                              just assumed --

                                   THOMAS

                         I saw it with my own eye.

PAUSE. Amber has no response. The Judge looks down at the file.

                                   JUDGE

                   Did you register this as a complaint?

                                   LAWYER

                   My client didn't officially register,

                    but I think the circumstance called

                     for something immediate -- for the

                            safety of the child.

                                   JUDGE

                          How old is the boy now?

                                   THOMAS

                                He's twelve.

                                   AMBER

                       He'll be thirteen next month.

                                   JUDGE

                           Where do you live now?

                                   THOMAS

                    We live in Long Beach. I have a job

                  there and my new wife is home with him.

                                  (pause)

                  You see, the problem is, Judge, is that

               my ex-wife is a sick . . . she is a very sick

                  person and she needs help. She deals in

                       drugs and sex for a living --

                                   AMBER

                             I don't do drugs.

                                   LAWYER

                    Your honor, she has been in and out

                   of trouble with the law on quite a few

                  occasions regarding this sort of thing.

                                   AMBER

                            No. No. Not anymore

CAMERA HOLDS ON AMBER. She watches the Judge. OC there's the sound of
papers shuffling.

                        Have you ever been arrested?

                                   AMBER

                                    Yes.

                                 JUDGE (OC)

                      When was the last time you were

CAMERA'S POV is a CAMCORDER operated by KURT LONGJOHN. JACK, dressed in a
tuxedo, sits in the back of the limo with ROLLERGIRL, who's wearing a
full-length fur coat, lingerie underneath.

                             JACK (into CAMERA)

                Okay, okay, okay. Welcome to the experiment.

                This is Jack Horner, coming to you from the

                 inside of a limousine that at this moment

                 is heading West down Ventura Blvd. I have

                 with me -- a little princess in the world

                of adult film -- the lovely Miss Rollergirl.

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                            Hello, hello, howdy.

                                    JACK

                  Are you ready to do what we're gonna do?

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                      Ready, ready. Ready like Freddy.

                                    JACK

                     We are On The Lookout. That's what

                     we'll call this -- On The Lookout.

                  We're just gonna drive on down Ventura,

                    heading west, like I said -- and see

                   what we find. Maybe we find some new,

                    young stud who wants to take a shot

                   and get hot and heavy with Rollergirl

                 back here in the limo -- and we'll capture

                  it on video. This is a first, ladies and

                    gentleman. A first in porn history.

                    Who knows what could happen . . . ?

              Maybe we come across some guy, maybe some girl?

                 See if they'd like to get soft and sticky?

Dirk, Reed, Todd and Scotty J. have moved into a small motel with two beds
and a fold-out couch. Scotty is sitting on one bed watching television
dressed in his UNION 76 GAS STATION UNIFORM.

Dirk is getting dressed, Reed is trying to get his attention;

                          Where the fuck is Todd?

                         We have to sell your car.

                                    DIRK

                          I will not do it, Reed.

                                    REED

                      What else is there to do, Dirk?

                         Huh? We have nothing left.

                                    DIRK

                     I worked way too fucking hard for

              that car . . . what am I supposed to do . . . ?

                                    REED

                        It solves all our problems.

                                    DIRK

                I will not sell my Corvette: Simple as that.

                Where the fuck is Todd? Where are my jeans?

                                 SCOTTY J.

Dirk notices that Todd is wearing the JEANS he was looking for.

                           What the fuck is that?

                       Those are my jeans, Todd. I've

                          been looking for those.

                                    TODD

                       You said I could borrow them.

                                    DIRK

                             I never said that.

                                    TODD

                             I thought you did.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                         Can I come with you, Dirk?

                                    DIRK

              Give me my fuckin' jeans back, Todd. Seriously.

                                   Sorry.

Todd gets out of the jeans and gives them over to Dirk, who puts them on as
Reed and Scotty look on;

                               . . . No . . .

                                    DIRK

                          My name is Dirk Diggler.

                                   SURFER

                No . . . I mean . . . you're a guy . . . I'm

                          helping you out . . . .

                                    DIRK

                                   Yeah.

                                   SURFER

                      So . . . what do you want to do?

                                    DIRK

                       I'm . . . it's what you want.

                                   SURFER

               . . . I wanna watch you. I mean, I'm not gay.

                    I just wanna. Maybe you can jerk off

                 a little and I can watch. Maybe I'll join

                    in, but for now I just wanna watch.

Dirk nods his head a little. HOLD.

                                    DIRK

                               Twenty bucks.

                                   SURFER

                          Ten is all I have . . .

164 INT. LIMO - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

The limo is moving now. Jack is sitting behind the CAMERA. The LIGHT held
above the Camcorder SHINES brightly on them.

Rollergirl and the College Kid struggle in the seat. He has some trouble
removing his pants and she tries to help a little, but it's pretty obvious
she's not enjoying this. Jack tries to coach them from the sidelines;

                                    JACK

                     Alright, there, pal; make it look

                    good, make it sexy -- don't just ram

                        your way up and in there --

The College Kid doesn't respond.

                                    JACK

                    Hey, hey, hey . . . take it slow and

                         make it kinky, kid. C'mon.

                      Think of Miss Lovely Rollergirl

                     as a beautiful instrument that you

             need to play . . . c'mon now . . . slow down . . .

                   Pretend you're just a wonderful stud,

                   pretend you're a wonderful stud that's

            just ready to melt her pussy . . . hey, kid . . . ?

                   Are you listening to me? Hey -- hey --

                                COLLEGE KID

                       Just let me do my thing, man.

                                    JACK

                              Cut. Stop. Cut.

The College Kid looks a little pissed, Rollergirl pushes him off;

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                           This is stupid, Jack.

                                    JACK

                    I know . . . this isn't working out.

                                COLLEGE KID

                                 That's it?

                                 JACK (OC)

               Yeah, that's all. Sorry for the inconvenience.

The College Kid pulls his pants on.

                                COLLEGE KID

                   You got me hard -- you could at least

                      jack me off or something, lady.

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                         What the fuck did you say?

                                COLLEGE KID

                        It's not so cool to leave me

                              with a hard on.

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                                 Fuck you.

                                COLLEGE KID

                     Nice life you've got here. Should

                    be proud of what you've become . . .

The College Kid laughs a little, heads out of the car, turns back to Jack
and says:

                                COLLEGE KID

                    Your fuckin' films suck now anyway.

ANGLE, CU. JACK

CAMERA DOLLIES IN A LITTLE IN SLOW MOTION. He freaks out.

Jack CHARGES out of the limo TACKLING the College Kid to the Ground. He
starts to BEAT the shit out of him . . .

CUT TO:

165 INT. TOYOTA - PARKED - THAT MOMENT

Dirk zips his pants open. The Surfer kid's eyes watch closely. Dirk pulls
out his cock and the Surfer kid looks surprised, speaks sotto;

                                   SURFER

       . . . holy shit . . . that's nice . . . that's . . . big . . .

Dirk nods, looks down.

                                   SURFER

                      Why don't you jerk it a little,

                   get it hard? I wanna see it get hard.

Dirk's hand touches his cock and he starts to masturbate a little. The
Surfer kid watches. CAMERA BEGINS A PAINFULLY SLOW ZOOM INTO PROFILE XCU.
ON DIRK.

                                   SURFER

                    . . . maybe . . . do it harder . . .

Dirk does it harder and faster.

                                   SURFER

                             Get your hand wet.

                                    DIRK

                            . . . be quiet . . .

Dirk tries to do it faster and harder.

                                   SURFER

                 . . . c'mon . . . c'mon . . . c'mon . . .

Dirk tries harder and faster but only gets more frustrated. He verges on
tears, looks to the Surfer Kid.

                                    DIRK

              I can't . . . I can't get it hard . . . I can't.

                                I'm sorry --

SUDDENLY:

A PICK-UP TRUCK carrying THREE PUNK KIDS SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES IN FRONT OF
DIRK IN THE TOYOTA. Dirk looks up in shock, turns his head to the Surfer
Kid who says;

                                   SURFER

                You shouldn't do this sort of thing, faggot.

Surfer PUNCHES Dirk in the face . . .

CUT TO:

166 EXT. VENTURA BLVD. - NIGHT - THAT MOMENT

Jack continues to BEAT the College Kid and yell at him;

                                    JACK

                       YOU HAVE SOME FUCKING RESPECT.

                  YOU LITTLE PRICK. YOU HAVE SOME GODDAMN

                    RESPECT FOR THAT GIRL. SHE'S A STAR,

                  A WONDERFUL CHILD AND A STAR. You think

                  you're worthy to fuck her -- you're not

                 worthy to TOUCH her -- the way you fuck --

                 who taught you? WHO TAUGHT YOU HOW TO FUCK

                  THAT WAY? YOU'RE AN AMATEUR. AN AMATEUR.

He KICKS the College Kid again and again . . . CAMERA DOLLIES IN ON
ROLLERGIRL as she watches. She rolls over . . . stands a BEAT over the
College Kid . . . and then goes crazy . . . she SMASHES his face with her
ROLLERSKATES over and over and over;

                                 ROLLERGIRL

                 YOU -- DON'T -- EVER -- DISRESPECT -- ME.

She breaks down CRYING and SCREAMING . . . Jack pulls her off . . .

CUT TO:

167 EXT. PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT

The FOUR SURFER PUNKS drag Dirk from the car and proceed to beat the shit
out of him. Kicking and punching him, calling out;

                                  SURFERS

                      Little Fuckin' Fag. Donkey-Dick.

                       You don't do this. You don't.

They continue to yell and scream and kick and punch Dirk and eventually
peel out of the parking lot. Dirk moans and cries and holds his stomach in
pain. He coughs up some blood and vomit . .

CAMERA PANS away from him, looking out of the alleyway, toward Ventura
Blvd. HOLD WIDE ANGLE ON THE STREET, EMPTY FRAME, THEN;

The WHITE LIMO carrying Jack and Rollergirl cruises PAST.

ANGLE, IN THE STREEET, MOMENT LATER.

The WHITE LIMO drives PAST CAMERA LFT. HOLD, THEN; BUCK'S CAR enters in
CAMERA RT. And we PICK UP AND PAN with it into --

CUT TO:

168 EXT. DONUT SHOP/VENTURA BLVD. - NIGHT

Buck's car pulls up and parks in front of the donut shop. CAMERA DOLLIES IN
CLOSE. Jessie is in the passenger seat, Buck leaves the engine running;

                                    BUCK

                          What do you want, honey?

                                   JESSIE

           I want . . . um . . . apple fritter . . . Jelly . . .

              And uh . . . chocolate with sprinkles . . . and

                           a bear claw, too . . .

Buck gets out of the car and we reveal that she is SIX MONTHS PREGNANT.
Buck looks down;

                                    BUCK

                      How's my little kung-fu fighter?

                                   JESSIE

                    He's kicking ass inside my stomach.

                                    BUCK

                               That's a boy.

CUT TO:

169 INT. DONUT SHOP - NIGHT

Buck enters and looks at some donuts, helped by the DONUT BOY behind the
counter. A MIDDLE AGED MAN in a camouflage baseball hat sits in the corner
eating a donut and some coffee, reading 'Guns and Ammo.'

                                 DONUT BOY

                              Can I help you?

                                    BUCK

                   Yeah . . . I'm gonna get a dozen . . .

The Donut Boy gets a box and Buck starts to point out;

                                    BUCK

             Lemme get two bear claws . . . apple fritter . . .

               Two chocolate . . . two sprinkles . . . gimme

                some of those glazed . . . how many is that?

At that moment a PUERTO RICAN KID walks in, pulls a REVOLVER from his
pocket and points at the Donut Boy.

                              PUERTO RICAN KID

                  Empty the safe. Behind the soda machine.

                                    BUCK

                               Jesus Christ.

The Puerto Rican Kid SWINGS HIS AIM at Buck.

                              PUERTO RICAN KID

                  Don't talk . . . shut the fuck up . . .

                          (aims back at Donut Boy)

                      Okay . . . empty the safe . . .

Donut Boy starts to empty the safe, putting the money in a paper sack . . .
Buck is frozen . . .

The MIDDLE AGED MAN in the corner reaches into his coat pocket and pulls
out an extremely BIG GUN . . .

The Middle Aged Man SHOOTS the Puerto Rican Kid in the BACK . . .

. . . the Puerto Rican Kid turns and returns FIRE, hitting the Middle Aged
Man with a bullet in the FACE . . .

. . . The Middle Aged Man gets another wild SHOT off before he expires and
that bullet hits the Donut Boy in the CHEST . . .

So: The Donut Boy is dead, The Puerto Rican Kid falls to the floor dead and
the Middle Aged Man is face down dead in his donut and coffee . . .

Blood is ALL OVER Buck . . . he stands for a long moment . . .

CU. THE BAG OF MONEY ON THE FLOOR

CU. BUCK.

He looks at it. SLOW ZOOM IN. BEAT.

Buck leans down, picks up the BAG FULL OF MONEY and walks out of the donut
shop.

FADE OUT.

170 INT. EL PUEBLO MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Reed, Todd and Dirk sit around a table. Dirk is bandaged. Scotty J. is
mingling around the background. CAMERA DOES A SLOW 360 AROUND THE TABLE.

                                    TODD

                 Alright. I think this could be the thing.

              Something to help us score a little extra cash.

                 I think if we decide to do this, we gotta

                          be one hundred percent.

                                    REED

                                  I agree.

                                    TODD

                     This guy's name is Rahad Jackson.

                   He's got more money than God and twice

                  as much coke, crack and smack. He'll buy

               just about anything anybody wants to sell him.

               He just likes people hanging out at his house

                               and partying.

                                    DIRK

                            How do you know him?

                                    TODD

                      He used to come into Party Boys

                  once in a while. Mutrix introduced me --

                                    DIRK

                      And how would we do it, exactly?

                     I mean, how would it all go down?

                                    TODD

                       It's like this: I call him up,

                tell him I got half a key of quality stuff.

                                    REED

                       Do you have his phone number?

                                    TODD

                Yeah. So we call him up, give him the price.

                                    DIRK

                                 How much?

                                    TODD

               Half a key for like . . . five thousand bucks.

                           Split it three ways --

                                    DIRK

                    That's enough to get my Vette fixed.

                                    TODD

                    That's right. So we set up the deal,

                    dump half a kilo of baking soda in a

                  bag and walk over to his house -- BOOM.

                  Right there -- this could be a nifty bit

                             o' hustle-bustle.

                                    REED

                          Do you have his address?

                                    TODD

               Fuckin', Reed, yeah I have his address, c'mon.

                                    DIRK

                          What if he tests it out?

                                    TODD

                                 He won't.

                                    DIRK

                              How do you know?

                                    TODD

                 I know he won't. I'm positive. Believe me.

                                    REED

                          It's a pretty good idea.

                                    DIRK

                        I think we should go for it.

Scotty J. comes over to the table.

                                 SCOTTY J.

                   You guys should be careful with this.

                                    DIRK

                                  Scotty?

                                 SCOTTY J.

                                   What?

                                    DIRK

               Just . . . y'know . . . mind yer own business.

                                 SCOTTY J.

The Corvette pulls up in front of a tacky one-story house in the hills of

                                    TODD

                          You guys ready for this?

                                    REED

                                   I am.

                                    TODD

                                   Dirk?

                                    DIRK

             Me? Yeah . . . yeah, I'm ready. I was born ready.

                                    TODD

                                  Alright.

Todd takes out a .45 AUTOMATIC PISTOL and loads a cartridge.

                                    DIRK

                           What the fuck is that?

                                    TODD

                              It's a big gun.

                                    DIRK

                              I know, but why?

                                    TODD

                   Just in case, just in case. Let's go.

They pile out of the damaged Corvette and walk up. CAMERA (STEADICAM)
follows them.

                                    REED

                                I'm nervous.

                                    TODD

                               It'll be okay.

                                    REED

                     Let's get in and out, in and out.

                                    TODD

                  Not too quick -- that looks suspicious.

                          Lemme do the talking --

They arrive and ring the doorbell.

CUT TO:

173 INT. RAHAD JACKSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - THAT MOMENT

A really big fat black BODYGUARD comes to the door and opens up:

                                 BODYGUARD

                             Hello. Come on in.

The bodyguard leads them down a hall and into a tacky and spacious, sunken
LIVING ROOM.

They're greeted by a man in a silk robe, slightly open to show some bikini
briefs and a thin sheen of sweat covering his body: RAHAD JACKSON (late
40s).

Off in a corner of the room, a YOUNG ASIAN KID is casually throwing some
FIRECRACKERS around.

Rahad is DANCING around by himself to NIGHT RANGER, "SISTER CHRISTIAN." He
spots the men;

                                   RAHAD

                     Hello, friends. Which one is Todd?

                                    TODD

                  That's me. We met before at the club --

                                   RAHAD

                         Oh, yeah. Come on in here.

                                    TODD

                    These are my friends Dirk and Reed.

                                   RAHAD

                 Great to meet you. You guys want something

                  to drink -- or a pill -- or some coke --

                               or some dope?

                               DIRK/REED/TODD

                         No thank you, thanks, no.

                                   RAHAD

               So what do we have, we have, something, yeah?

                                    TODD

            Here it is . . . half a key . . . it's really good,

                        if you wanna test it out --

                                   RAHAD

                    Oh, wait a minute, I love this part:

                               (sings along)

                     "SISTER CHRISTIAN, THERE'S SO MUCH

                    IN LIFE, DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP BEFORE

                     YOUR TIME IS DUE . . . IT'S TRUE!"

                                 (to Dirk)

                          This song is so amazing.

                         Anyway: What's the price?

                                    TODD

                      We were thinking five thousand.

                                   RAHAD

                    That's good. No problem, cool, cool.

The Bodyguard brings over a PAPER BAG FULL OF CASH and hands the bag to
Todd in exchange for the PAPER BAG FULL OF BAKING SODA.

Reed watches the Bodyguard take the bag and notices something. REED'S POV:
a SHOULDER HOLSTER holds a .45 Automatic Pistol.

Rahad does an air guitar solo to the Night Ranger song . . . he walks
across the room, picks up a COKE PIPE and looks to the guys;

                                   RAHAD

                          You wanna play baseball?

                               DIRK/REED/TODD

                               No thank you.

Rahad strokes the pipe while dancing. Dirk looks across to an open bedroom
door.

DIRK'S POV: Through the crack in the door, we can see a bloody, battered
YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in a silk robe . . .she's followed by another YOUNG WHITE
GIRL in nothing.

                                 RAHAD (OC)

                             Check this out --

He takes out a nickel plated REVOLVER and loads a single bullet, spins the
chamber and puts it to his head and sings;

                                   RAHAD

                    SISTER CHRISTIAN -- OH THE TIME HAS

                    COME . . . AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE

                     THE ONLY ONE TO SAY . . . OK . . .

He pulls the trigger . . . Click . . . he smiles and casually speaks;

                                   RAHAD

                      I put a mix tape together of all

                my favorite songs . . . This is song number

               three . . . I love putting mix tapes together,

               you know . . . if you buy an album or tape or

                something, those guys put the songs in their

              order and they try and say how you should listen

                    to the songs, but I don't like that.

                   I don't like to be told what to listen

                  to, when to listen to or anything . . .

The Night Ranger song FADES OUT . . . BEAT . . . Rahad smiles at the Asian
Kid who's casually throwing some firecrackers around.

                                   RAHAD

                            (to Dirk/Reed/Todd)

                     He's Chinese . . . he loves to set

                           off firecrackers . . .

REO SPEEDWAGON, "CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING," begins to play.

                                   RAHAD

                   I CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING ANY LONGER

                  AND YET I'M STILL AFRAID TO LET IT FLOW.

                  WHAT STARTED OUT AS FRIENDSHIP HAS GROWN

                 STRONGER -- I ONLY WISH I HAD THE STRENGTH

                             TO LET IT SHOW --

                                    DIRK

           Well . . . I think maybe . . . we better get going --

                                   RAHAD

                      No, stay. Hang out. We'll party.

                                    DIRK

                         No, we really gotta split.

                     We have to be somewhere and we --

Dirk and Rahad continue to haggle about leaving/not leaving. CAMERA BEGINS
A SLOW DOLLY INTO A CU ON TODD.

                                    TODD

                           We're Not Leaving Yet.

Dirk and Reed look at Todd. He stands up.

                                    TODD

                 We're here now and we want something else.

                Hey -- Hey. We Want Something Else From You.

                                   RAHAD

                                   What?

                                    DIRK

                    Todd -- what the hell are you doing?

                                    TODD

                   In the master bedroom, under the bed,

                   in a floor safe . . . You understand?

The Bodyguard turns his head. Dirk and Reed are confused;

                                    DIRK

                  Todd . . . what the fuck, man, c'mon --

                                    TODD

                  Shut up, Dirk. I told you I got a plan.

                             I got a good plan.

                                   RAHAD

                         Are you kiddin' me kittie?

                                    TODD

                    No I'm not. I'm not kidding. We want

                   what's in the safe. We want what's in

                   the safe in the floor under the bed in

                            the master bedroom.

                                    DIRK

                          Todd -- don't be crazy.

                                 (to Rahad)

                 Sir -- we don't know anything about this.

                   This is not the thing that we wanted.

                                    TODD

                          SHUT THE FUCK UP, DIRK.

The BODYGUARD reaches into his coat . . .

. . . Todd pulls his REVOLVER quickly and AIMS at the Bodyguard.

                                    TODD

                         Don't reach for your gun.

. . . Rahad reacts by AIMING HIS GUN AT TODD . . .

                                   RAHAD

                     You don't wanna do this, friendly.

                                    TODD

                        You've only got one bullet.

Rahad PULLS THE TRIGGER . . . a bullet FIRES from the gun and strikes Todd
in the SHOULDER . . . the gun in his hand falls to the floor and he
stumbles back . . .

. . . The Bodyguard takes this moment to GRAB HIS OWN GUN from the holster
and FIRE off shots at Dirk and Reed . . .

. . . Bullets graze past them and they DUCK FOR COVER . . .

. . . The GIRLS in the bedroom SCREAM and SHOUT at the gunfire . . .

. . . A STRAY BULLET HITS the ASIAN KID in the heart, but he doesn't fall .
. .

. . . TODD reaches hold of his gun, crouches for cover and FIRES a bullet
STRAIGHT INTO the Bodyguard . . . who falls back DEAD . . . Todd looks
right and sees:

RAHAD scuttles into the bedroom with the women . . . Todd looks over his
shoulder to Dirk and Reed;

                                    DIRK

                     WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, TODD?

                                    TODD

                          He went in the bedroom.

                                    DIRK

                   ARE YOU CRAZY? WHEN DID YOU GO CRAZY?

                                    TODD

                     He's got cash and coke in the safe

                     under the bed -- if we leave here

                          without it we're fools.

                                    REED

                     Let's just split, let's just split

                     right now, Todd. Don't be stupid.

                       This wasn't part of the deal.

                                    TODD

                  I'm goin' in that bedroom and get what's

                       in that safe. Are you coming?

                                    DIRK

                     Fuck no. Todd. Don't. Don't do it.

Todd gets up and heads for the bedroom with his revolver at the ready . . .
he inches closer to the door and twists the door knob, then KICKS THE DOOR
OPEN;

. . . Rahad is standing right there, holding a SAWED OFF SHOTGUN. He pulls
the trigger . . . Todd blinks . . .

. . . Rahad's SHOTGUN BLAST blows Todd BACK and UP in the air about fifteen
feet . . . he FALLS to the ground with a HOLE in his STOMACH about the size
of a basketball . . . Rahad calls out to Dirk and Reed;

                                   RAHAD

                   C'mon out, little puppies. You want to

                  come and see, come and see, to get what

                        is coming down. Coming down.

Rahad peers out from his bedroom, sees a sliver of Dirk behind the wall.
Rahad FIRES HIS SHOTGUN . . . which cuts right past Dirk's head and SHREDS
the wall near him . . .

Reed and Dirk make a DASH for the front door . . .

. . . Rahad FIRES another shot . . .

. . . a BLAST BREEZES PAST THEIR HEADS . . .

Dirk and Reed make it OUTSIDE . . . Rahad chases after them . . .

CUT TO:

174 EXT. RAHAD'S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

Reed and Dirk make a dash for the Corvette -- they're steps away when a
SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS INTO THE PASSENGER'S SIDE DOOR --

Reed heads away from the car -- makes a run diagonally across the street
for shelter behind some SHRUBS and TREES -- (he gets lost from CAMERA)

Dirk gets around to the driver's side of the Corvette, shielded and
crouched -- he opens the door and starts to get in --

ANOTHER SHOT BLOWS THE PASSENGER'S SIDE WINDOW OUT.

GLASS SPRAYS IN HIS EYES AND HIS HAND SLIPS DOWN, RELEASING THE EMERGENCY
BRAKE OF THE CAR -- WHICH BEGINS TO ROLL DOWN THE STREET--

Dirk stumbles back from the car. He looks to the house:

Rahad is about to FIRE the shotgun again . . .

. . . he looks down the street: the Corvette is ROLLING away and picking up
speed as it goes down the hill --

Dirk gets on his feet and makes a run for the car, Rahad FIRES . . .

. . . Dirk catches up with the car, hops in -- gets the key in the ignition
and starts it up, peels off down the street --

CUT TO:

175 INT. DIRK'S CORVETTE - MOMENTS LATER

Dirk pulls around and stops a moment. He looks around -- he looks back in
his rearview mirror.

                                    DIRK

                           Fuck -- Fuck -- Fuck.

CUT TO:

176 EXT. STREET NEARBY - THAT MOMENT

Reed is running FULL-SPEED down a residential street, in and out of
backyards and over fences, dodging attack dogs, etc.

CUT TO:

177 INT. RAHAD JACKSON'S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

RAHAD storms around his house, the SHOTGUN in his hand. The two battered
YOUNG WOMEN are shaking and shivering in a corner --

                                   RAHAD

           What the fuck . . . what the fuck . . . what the fuck.

Rahad rants and raves incoherently, sets down the shotgun for a moment to
take a hit from his crack pipe. A DISCO song is playing LOUDLY and Rahad is
dancing. HOLD, THEN:

ANGLE, A WALL IN THE HOUSE

a red flash hits the wall . . . then a blue flash hits the wall.

ANGLE, RAHAD

he looks at the wall and sees the red-blue flash.

CAMERA DOLLIES IN ON RAHAD. He smiles.

More RED-BLUE FLASHES hit the house and the SOUNDS of POLICE ACTION start
to BUILD . . .

                                   RAHAD

                       It's coming down, coming down.

. . . RAHAD PICKS UP THE SHOTGUN, SMASHES THE WINDOW AND FIRES OFF A SHOT
TOWARDS THE OC POLICE ACTION . . .

. . . OC POLICE FIRE BACK ABOUT ONE MILLION BULLETS THAT RIP INTO RAHAD,
SENDING HIM BACK, STUMBLING ACROSS THE HOUSE, FURTHER AND FURTHER . . .
BULLETS RIP INTO THE TWO GIRLS, KILLING THEM.

OVERHEAD ANGLE, STRAIGHT DOWN:

Rahad's dead body falls next to Todd's dead body . . . a BEAT later, the
Asian Kid finally falls over, face down next to them . . .

QUICK FADE OUT, CUT TO:

178 OMITTED

179 OMITTED

180 INT. DIRK'S CORVETTE - MOVING - NIGHT

HOLD CU. ON DIRK. He's driving fast. Paranoid and freaked. The car starts
to sputter . . . slows . . . Dirk panics when he sees the gas tank . . .
ECU. The Gas Tank Display. The orangle needle is on, "E."

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: "Fourteen Miles Later"

CUT TO:

181 EXT. STREET/OUTSIDE LOS ANGELES - DAWN (LATER)

Dirk's car is out of gas. He pushes the car off the main boulevard and down
a side street.

CUT TO:

182 EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

Dirk pushes his car down a small cul-de-sac, hops in and pulls the
emergency brake.

He looks around a moment. HOLD. CAMERA DOLLIES IN CLOSE ON HIS FACE. He
looks at the street signs.

OVERHEAD ANGLE, INTERSECTION.

Dirk walks to the middle of the intersection and looks up at the signposts.
It reads, "Troost Street."

He walks down this street, looking at the houses. He walks a full two
blocks down, stops, looks: He's standing in front of his PARENTS HOUSE. It
looks just the same.

A young PAPERBOY rides past and throws the paper, hitting Dirk in the head.
He hesitates, then walks up the steps;

CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY ON THE DOOR, LANDS IN A CU. OVER HIS SHOULDER. He
knocks. Moments later . . . the door opens; A young woman in a bathrobe
with a BABY on her hip opens the door. This is SHERYL LYNN, who we met
earlier.

                                SHERYL LYNN

Dirk is on the phone in the living room. WE HEAR ONLY MUFFLED BITS FROM HIS
CONVERSATION.

                           Is everything alright?

Dirk nods. She sets him up with a cup of coffee.

                                SHERYL LYNN

                   You made something of yourself, Eddie.

She smiles, nods, points to the living room.

                                SHERYL LYNN

                  I have all of your tapes . . . I've seen

                  all of your films . . . I knew you'd do

                             I don't think so.

JACK walks back in the house, down the hallway, CAMERA PANS to a PICTURE on

                          Where the fuck is Ringo?

Dirk stands up, unzips his pants and lets his cock hang out. He looks at
the REFLECTION of it in the mirror;

                                    DIRK

                    I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star.

                     I'm a star. I'm a star, I'm a big

                            bright shining star.

He puts his cock back in his pants, does a final karate kick and walks out
of the room, closing the door behind him.
