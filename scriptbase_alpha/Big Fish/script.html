                                        Written by

                                       John August

                                  Based on the novel by

                                      Daniel Wallace

                                  Final Production Draft

<b>                
</b>
               This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but 
               truer for their inclusion. 

<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               A RIVER.
</b>
               We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.

               This is The Beast.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         There are some fish that cannot be 
                         caught. It's not that they're faster 
                         or stronger than other fish. They're 
                         just touched by something extra. 
                         Call it luck. Call it grace. One 
                         such fish was The Beast.

               The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited 
               with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past 
               a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         By the time I was born, he was already 
                         a legend. He'd taken more hundred-
                         dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. 
                         Some said that fish was the ghost of 
                         Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned 
                         in that river 60 years before. Others 
                         claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, 
                         left over from the Cretaceous period.

<b>               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)
</b>
               WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD 
               BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, 
               Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with 
               absolute conviction.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I didn't put any stock into such 
                         speculation or superstition. All I 
                         knew was I'd been trying to catch 
                         that fish since I was a boy no bigger 
                         than you.
                              (closer)
                         And on the day you were born, that 
                         was the day I finally caught him.

<b>               EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)
</b>
               A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES 
               as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Now, I'd tried everything on it: 
                         worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut 
                         butter-and-cheese. But on that day I 
                         had a revelation: if that fish was 
                         the ghost of a thief, the usual bait 
                         wasn't going to work. I would have 
                         to use something he truly desired.

               Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.

<b>                                     LITTLE BRAVE
</b>                              (confused)
                         Your finger?

               Edward slips his ring off.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Gold.

               While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks 
               bored. He's heard this story before.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I tied my ring to the strongest line 
                         they made -- strong enough to hold 
                         up a bridge, they said, if just for 
                         a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.

<b>               INT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)
</b>
               Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming 
               dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of 
               Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing.

<b>                                     EDWARD (CONT'D)
</b>                         The Beast jumped up and grabbed it 
                         before the ring even hit the water. 
                         And just as fast, he snapped clean 
                         through that line.

               WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His 
               mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and 
               practicality -- stands with him at the door.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         You can see my predicament. My wedding 
                         ring, the symbol of fidelity to my 
                         wife, soon to be the mother of my 
                         child, was now lost in the gut of an 
                         uncatchable fish.

<b>               ON WILL AND SANDRA
</b>
<b>                                     WILL
</b>                              (low but insistent)
                         Make him stop.

               His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.

<b>                                     WILL'S DATE
</b>                         What did you do?

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I followed that fish up-river and 
                         down-river for three days and three 
                         nights, until I finally had him boxed 
                         in.

               Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         With these two hands, I reached in 
                         and snatched that fish out of the 
                         river. I looked him straight in the 
                         eye. And I made a remarkable 
                         discovery.

<b>               INT. TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)
</b>
               WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE. This 
               is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and 
               family. They should be joyful, but Will is furious.

               Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. The room is 
               cozy and drunk.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         This fish, the Beast. The whole time 
                         we were calling it a him, when in 
                         fact it was a her. It was fat with 
                         eggs, and was going to lay them any 
                         day.

               Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from 
               the restrooms. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier 
               if this were her own wedding.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Now, I was in a situation. I could 
                         gut that fish and get my ring back, 
                         but doing so I would be killing the 
                         smartest catfish in the Ashton River, 
                         soon to be mother of a hundred others.

               Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, 
               but he gets up and leaves. Edward doesn't even notice.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-
                         born son the chance to catch a fish 
                         like this of his own? This lady fish 
                         and I, well, we had the same destiny.

               As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father --

</b>                         We were part of the same equation.

               Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.

               Will can't articulate his anger. He just leaves.

</b>                         Now, you may well ask, since this 
                         lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, 
                         why did it strike so quick on gold 
                         when nothing else would attract it?
                              (closer; he holds up 
                              his ring)
                         That was the lesson I learned that 
                         day, the day my son was born.

               He focuses his words on Sandra. This story is -- and has 
               always been -- about her more than anyone.

</b>                         Sometimes, the only way to catch an 
                         uncatchable woman is to offer her a 
                         wedding ring.

               A LAUGH from the crowd.

               Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him. As she 
               crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not 
               lessened their affection for each other.

               As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.

               The crowd APPLAUDS.

               Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for 
               her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.

               Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.

               Edward swims laps in the family pool. He's born to the water.

                         think he saw anything of himself in

                         each other very well.

<b>               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.

</b>                         In telling the story of my father's 
                         life, it's impossible to separate 
                         the fact from the fiction, the man 
                         from the myth. The best I can do is 
                         to tell it the way he told me.

               We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught 
               in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something 
               changes.

               Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 
               20's, staring into the water. He's not just handsome, not 
               just charming. It's as if all the forces of the natural world 
               had conspired to create him.

                         most of it never happened.

               Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, 
               grabbing hold of

<b>               THE BEAST.

               He brings the catfish up to his face. Looks it right in the 
               eye. A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring.

                         is.

               Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back 
               into the water with a splash.

               Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife's legs. She's 
               flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting

               Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets 
               into the doctor's unprepared hands. Bennett tries to hold 
               tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. It shoots up 
               into air.

               The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one 
               can hold it. As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we 
               can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.

               As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides 
               it a ramp to slide right out of the room. Everyone races

               Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair. By the 
               tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has 
               that insistent European sound.

               As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly 
               empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes. A cradle is still in 
               its carton.

               KEYS in the lock. LAUGHTER in the hallway. The door swings 
               open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of 
               groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain. His wife

               Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands

               Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him. The 
               endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big 
               shadows on the wall.

               Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in 
               earshot. He then leans in, complicitous.

               Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.

</b>                         This all happened in the swamp outside 
                         of Ashton. Kids weren't supposed to 
                         go out in the swamp, on account of 
                         the snakes and spiders and quicksand 
                         that would swallow you up before you 
                         could even scream. But there were 
                         five of us out there that night: Me, 
                         Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price 
                         Brothers, Don and Zacky.

               Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.

               The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive. The moon hangs 
               low, casting long shadows.

               Five kids walk past in silhouette. Four have flashlights on. 
               The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).

               MOVING UP behind the kids, we find ourselves at the gates 
               of...

<b>               EXT. A CREEPY OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

<b>                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         Now, it's common knowledge that most 
                         towns of a certain size have a witch, 
                         if only to eat misbehaving children 
                         and the occasional puppy who wanders 
                         into her yard. Witches use those 
                         bones to cast spells and curses that 
                         make the land infertile.

               We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically 
               creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie 
               gargoyles half-buried in the dirt. Even bats are afraid to 
               fly over it.

               In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows 
               what is lurking in the shadows?

</b>                         Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, 
                         there was one who was the most feared. 
                         For she had one glass eye, which was 
                         said to contain mystical powers.

               We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.

</b>                         I hear if you look right at it, you 
                         can see how you're gonna die.

                         not even a real witch.

                         and get that eye? I heard she keeps 
                         it in a box on her nighttable.

               Edward looks back at the spooky house.

</b>                         Fine, I'm doing it.

               He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.

<b>                                     RUTHIE
</b>                         Edward, don't!

</b>                         She'll make soap out of you!
                              (to Ruthie)
                         That's what she does, she makes soap 
                         out of people.

               Edward drops down on the far side of the gate. Truth be told, 
               Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.

               Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. 
               They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don 
               holds him by the collar.

<b>               EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE
</b>
               Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front 
               door. Anything could jump out of them.

               He steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he 
               continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. 
               Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.

               The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look 
               like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and 
               closer before he finally

<b>               RINGS THE DOORBELL.
</b>
               Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with 
               a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead 
               for years, but too stubborn to lie down.

<b>                                     EDWARD

                         Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and 
                         there's some folks'd like to see 
                         your eye.

<b>               EXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT
</b>
               Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more 
               convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the 
               gate.

                         Let's see it.

               The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping 
               up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left 
               eye, it shines with a hellish glow.

               We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.

               An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing 
               a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls. 
               Dead.

               We RUSH IN on Don Price.

               Don and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears 
               in his eyes.

<b>                                     ZACKY

                         old, and I fell.

               The brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old 
               Woman, Edward smiles.

<b>               EXT. AT THE OLD WOMAN'S DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
               Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but 
               curiosity gets the better of him.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I was thinking about death and all. 
                         About seeing how you're gonna die.

               The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I mean, on one hand, if dying was 
                         all you thought about, it could kind 
                         of screw you up. But it could kind 
                         of help you, couldn't it? Because 
                         you'd know that everything else you 
                         can survive.

               The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.

               The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. 
               And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks 
               into The Eye.

               This time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he 
               witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and 
               amused. Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys. 
               His future has something strange in store.

               The Old Woman nods. Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns 
               and leaves.

</b>                              (simply)
                         You didn't need to do that. You just 
                         didn't.

               A beat. Starting over...

</b>                         Hi, Mom.

               He leans in and hugs her. She surrenders, squeezing her son 
               tight. Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- 
               strong-willed but practical. They've always been close.

<b>                                     SANDRA
</b>                         I'm so glad you're here.

               That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-
               in-law. Seeing the size of her belly --

<b>                                     SANDRA
</b>                         You shouldn't have flown. But...

               They hug.

</b>                         It's good to see you. You look 
                         beautiful.

               It's not flattery. It's the truth.

<b>                                     SANDRA
</b>                         Thank you. I'll bet you need to --

</b>                         Yes.

</b>                         Down the hall on the right. The door 
                         sticks. You have to really pull it.

               Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice. 
               Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage. Sandra 
               follows him.

               Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the 
               first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for 
               the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot. KIDS are 
               playing on the street.

</b>                         He's impossible. He won't eat. And 
                         because he won't eat, he gets weaker. 
                         And because he's weaker, he doesn't 
                         want to eat.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
               Sandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine.

               DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded 
               from coming down the stairs. He was the town's first Black 
               physician. He's still the town's best physician.

<b>                                     DR. BENNETT
</b>                         Will.

</b>                         Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.
                              (they shake)
                         My wife, Josephine.

<b>                                     DR. BENNETT
</b>                         A pleasure.

               He judges her belly.

<b>                                     DR. BENNETT
</b>                         You're seven months.

</b>                              (impressed)
                         To the day.

               He leans close to her, whispering in her ear...

<b>                                     DR. BENNETT
</b>                         It's a boy.

               She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Will looks over -- 
               what did he say? Josephine shakes her head.

               Back to the main subject...

<b>                                     SANDRA
</b>                         You don't think he looks any worse.

<b>                                     DR. BENNETT
</b>                         No. I would say he's the same.

               And in the silence that follows, a lot is said. It wasn't 
               the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         Can I see him?

<b>                                     DR. BENNETT
</b>                         Absolutely. Be good for you to talk 
                         to him.

               A moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven't 
               spoken in years.

               Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the 
               counter.

<b>                                     SANDRA
</b>                         Get him to drink one of these. He 
                         won't, but tell him he has to.

<b>               INT. FOYER - DAY
</b>
               Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. 
               They CREAK with every step.

               The wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most 
               of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant 
               and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can 
               see him growing up with every step.

<b>               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
               A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the 
               end of the hallway. Will walks towards it, running a hand 
               along the wallpaper.

               Almost at the door, he stops for a beat. Gets his breath. 
               Then goes inside.

<b>               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although he's not 
               the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared. 
               The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.

               There are no I.V.'s, no monitors, nothing.

               Coming up to the bed --

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         Dad?

               Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses. He tries 
               to say something, but no words come out.

               He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him 
               a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.

               Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself. A very long, 
               tense beat. Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.

               Finally...

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         You --
                              (he points)
                         -- are in for a surprise.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         Am I?

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Having a kid changes everything. I 
                         mean, there's the diapers and the 
                         burping and the midnight feedings...

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         Did you do any of that?

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         No, but I hear it's terrible. Then 
                         you spend years trying to corrupt 
                         and mislead this child, fill its 
                         head with nonsense and still it turns 
                         out perfectly fine.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         You think I'm up for it?

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         You learned from the best.

               Will doesn't rise to the challenge. A beat, then he remembers 
               the can of Ensure. Holds it up. Edward recoils.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         Just drink half the can. I'll tell 
                         her you drank the whole thing. 
                         Everyone wins.

               A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes. Fine. Will cracks open 
               the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         People needn't worry so much. It's 
                         not my time yet. This isn't how I 
                         go.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         Really.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         The Old Lady by the swamp.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         She was a witch.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         No, she was old and probably senile. 
                         Maybe schizophrenic.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I saw my death in that eye. And this 
                         is not how it happens.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         So how does it happen?

</b>                         Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to 
                         ruin it for you.

               Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, 
               then pushes the can away. He swallows with difficulty.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         There was this panhandler who used 
                         to stop me every morning when I came 
                         out of this coffee shop near the 
                         office.

</b>                         And every day I gave him a quarter. 
                         Every day. Then I got sick and was 
                         out for a couple of weeks. And when 
                         I went back there, you know what he 
                         said?

               A beat.

</b>                         You're right.

               Edward gives a wry smile. He walked into that.

</b>                         Your mother was worried we wouldn't 
                         talk again. And look at us. We're 
                         talking fine. We're storytellers, 
                         both of us. I speak mine out, you 
                         write yours down. Same thing.

               Will won't commit to Edward's assessment.

</b>                         Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about

                         You.

               Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH. The HACKING 
               escalates until another drink of water gets it under control. 
               It's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from 
               talking.

</b>                         I used to do it when you were gone, 
                         remember? I used to do it a lot.

               He didn't mean for that to sound so pointed. Taking the half-
               empty Ensure, Will gets up to go. He's at the door when...

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I was never much for being at home, 
                         Will. It's too confining. And this, 
                         here. Being stuck in bed. Dying is 
                         the worst thing that ever happened 
                         to me.

               He smiles at his joke.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         I thought you weren't dying.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I said this isn't how I go. The last 
                         part is much more unusual. Trust me 
                         on that.

<b>               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
               Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of 
               the Ensure himself. Edward was right. It tastes horrible.

               Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door. As he 
               leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...

<b>               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]
</b>
               ...where an eight-year old Will is propped up in bed, his 
               face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion. He's 
               showing Edward how many bumps there are on his arm.

</b>
<b>               INT. TINY CHURCH - DAY
</b>
               Wearing a white shirt and tie, YOUNG EDWARD -- still about 
               10 -- sings "Down to the River My Lord" along with the 
               CONGREGATION. His voice is high and thin, but he gives it 
               his all.

               Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave. And then 
               another. His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, 
               wondering what's wrong. Embarrassed, Edward just keeps 
               SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.

               He pulls at his collar. Then pulls again, his face getting 
               red. Starting to panic, he loosens his tie. He's starting to 
               undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself. Two more 
               buttons fly off. One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.

<b>               ON HIS SHOES
</b>
               As we watch, Edward's pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that's 
               how fast he's growing.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         Truth is, no one quite knew what was 
                         wrong. Most times, a person grows up 
                         gradually. I found myself in a hurry.

<b>               INT. YOUNG EDWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
               Young Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various 
               pulleys and levers to support his weight. He has a dozen 
               encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         My muscles couldn't keep up with my 
                         bones, and my bones couldn't keep up 
                         with my body's ambition. So I spent 
                         the better part of three years 
                         confined to my bed, with the World 
                         Book Encyclopedia being my only means 
                         of exploration. I had made it all 
                         the way to the "G's," hoping to find 
                         an answer to my gigantificationism, 
                         when I uncovered an article about 
                         the common goldfish.

               INSERT: The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.

<b>                                     YOUNG EDWARD
</b>                              (reading)
                         "Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish 
                         will remain small. With more space, 
                         the fish can grow double, triple, or 
                         quadruple its size."

               Young Edward thinks this through.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         It occurred to me then, that perhaps 
                         the reason for my growth was that I 
                         was intended for larger things. After 
                         all, a giant man can't have an 
                         ordinary-sized life.

<b>               EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY
</b>
               The CRACK of a bat announces the game-winning home run. The 
               crowd CHEERS the swing, and especially the batter as he rounds 
               the bases.

               Although we've seen him briefly before, this is our first 
               real exposure to GROWN-UP EDWARD, who we'll follow from 
               roughly the ages of 18 to 30.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         As soon as my bones had settled in 
                         their adult configuration, I set 
                         upon my plan to make a bigger place 
                         for myself in Ashton.

<b>               EXT. SCHOOL FIELDS - DAY
</b>
               SINGLE SHOTS: Football hero Edward leads his team to victory. 
               On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret 
               love:

<b>                                     GIRL
</b>                         Edward Bloom!

               The other GIRLS SQUEAL in agreement. Don Price looks over, 
               glowers.

<b>               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</b>
               SINGLE SHOT: A lawnmower ROARS along the grass. We LOOK UP 
               to see who's pushing it, but it's not Edward. It's one of 
               his teenage EMPLOYEES.

               Edward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, "Bloom 
               Landscaping." He has workers on every lawn.

               He signs an autograph for an ADMIRING CUB SCOUT.

<b>               INT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
</b>
               Edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other 
               end of the court. Naturally, he makes it, winning the game.

               As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only 
               teammate who doesn't mob him.

<b>               EXT. TOWN - DAY
</b>
               Edward carries a dog out of a burning house.

<b>               INT. SCIENCE FAIR - DAY
</b>
               Edward wins a blue ribbon for his invention, a machine 
               labelled "Perpetual Motion." He and the JUDGE pose for a 
               photograph. A FLASH.

               Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the 
               trash.

<b>               INT. HIGH SCHOOL STAGE - DAY
</b>
               A dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain 
               call. He's the star of the show. Off to the side, we see Don 
               Price is the ass-end of a horse costume.

               Edward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious.

<b>               EXT. GRADUATION STAGE - DAY
</b>
               Edward accepts his diploma. The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         I was the biggest thing Ashton had 
                         ever seen. Until one day, a stranger 
                         arrived.

<b>               EXT. FARM - DAY
</b>
               As two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a 
               massive hole punched through the side of a barn. It's roughly 
               the shape of man, but no human could be that large.

<b>               EXT. SHEEP PEN - DAY
</b>
               Two fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them. They 
               BLEAT in panic as

<b>               TWO OVERSIZED HANDS
</b>
               reach in and scoop them up. Their protests continue as they're 
               carried away, one under each arm. We still haven't seen the 
               full stranger.

<b>               EXT. COURT HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns. 
               Amid the crowd we see Don Price.

</b>                         I won't have mob violence in this 
                         town. Now, has someone tried talking 
                         to him?

               Agreement from the crowd. And then...

<b>                                     A VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                         I'll do it.

               Everyone turns to see who said that. The crowd parts to reveal 
               none other than Edward Bloom. Don Price glowers.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I'll talk to him. See if I can get 
                         him to move on.

<b>               EXT. HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY
</b>
               Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching 
               the mouth of a cave. Outside, buzzards squabble over the 
               remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked 
               clean.

               In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Hello!

               There's no answer.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         My name is Edward Bloom! I want to 
                         talk to you!

               From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:

<b>                                     VOICE (O.S.)
</b><b>                         GO AWAY!
</b>
               The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair 
               back.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I'm not going anywhere until you 
                         show yourself.

               A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming. Edward 
               braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's 
               going to take.

               As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake. Even 
               Edward starts to worry. Just how big is this guy?

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         Armed with the foreknowledge of my 
                         own death, I knew the giant couldn't 
                         kill me. All the same, I preferred 
                         to keep my bones unbroken.

               Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.

               Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth. Hunched over, he slams 
               into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.

               KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you've ever seen. Not 
               just tall, but massive. He's completely feral, with a beard 
               to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. What remains 
               of his clothes are ragged and muddy. God knows what's living 
               in his matted hair.

               Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun. Edward throws his 
               rock, but it just bounces off. The giant didn't even notice 
               it.

<b>                                     KARL
</b>                         Why are you here?

               Edward ponders the best response, settling on...

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         So you can eat me. The town decided 
                         to send a human sacrifice, and I 
                         volunteered.

               Karl's eyes narrow, confused. Edward stands up.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         My arms are a little stringy, but 
                         there's some good eating on my legs. 
                         I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them 
                         myself.
                              (beat)
                         So I guess, just, if you could get 
                         it over with quick. Because I'm not 
                         much for pain, really.

               Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten. 
               Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.

               After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see 
               what the giant is doing. Relieved to see he's not licking 
               his chops --

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Look, I can't go back. I'm a human 
                         sacrifice. If I go back, everyone 
                         will think I'm a coward. And I'd 
                         rather be dinner than a coward.

               Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Here, start with my hand. It'll be 
                         an appetizer.

               Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth. But 
               the giant spits it back out.

<b>                                     KARL
</b>                         I don't want to eat you. I don't 
                         want to eat anybody. It's just I get 
                         so hungry. I'm too big.

               And that's the sad truth. Karl is less a monster than a freak -- 
               a giant man, but in the end, just a man.

               Edward takes a seat beside him.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Did you ever think maybe you're not 
                         too big? Maybe this town's just too 
                         small. I mean, look at it.

               Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town 
               in a tiny valley.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Hardly two stories in the whole place. 
                         Now I've heard in real cities, they've 
                         got buildings so tall you can't even 
                         see the tops of 'em.

</b>                         Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got 
                         all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat 
                         a lot, can't you?

</b>                         So why are you wasting your time in 
                         a small town? You're a big man. You 
                         should be in the big city.

               Karl smiles, but then it fades. A certain sad suspicion --

                         You think this town is too small for 
                         you, well, it's too small for a man 
                         of my ambition. I can't see staying 
                         here a day longer.

                         me. A man's life can only grow to a

                         So what do you say? Join me?

               Karl thinks a moment. Then --

               They shake on it.

</b>                         Now first, we gotta get you ready 
                         for the city.

<b>               EXT. RIVER - DAY
</b>
               IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, 
               while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.

<b>               EXT. MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY
</b>
               Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the 
               good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and 
               Karl.

               There's a few tears amid the familiar faces.

<b>                                     MAYOR
</b>                              (loudly, for the crowd)
                         Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, 
                         it's with a heavy heart we see you 
                         go. But take with you this Key to 
                         the City, and know that any time you 
                         want to come back, all our doors are 
                         open to you.

               Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his 
               neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start 
               walking, waving as they go.

               Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward 
               go. He crushes his cigarette under his heel. He wishes he 
               could crush Edward.

               Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or 
               shake his hand.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         That afternoon as I left Ashton, 
                         everyone seemed to have advice.

<b>                                     VARIOUS TOWNFOLK
</b>                         Find yourself a nice girl! Don't 
                         trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your 
                         pride, Edward Bloom!

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         But there was one person whose counsel 
                         I held above all others.

               As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with

<b>               THE OLD WOMAN.
</b>
               The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been 
               cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper 
               something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear 
               her voice.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         She said that the biggest fish in 
                         the river gets that way by never 
                         being caught.

               The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                              (to the Old Woman)
                         Okay. Thanks.

               Edward and Karl keep walking. The Old Woman shuffles off, 
               somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.

<b>                                     KARL
</b>                         What did she say?

</b>                         Beats me.

<b>               EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b>
               We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking 
               out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly 
               possessions.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         There were two roads out of Ashton, 
                         a new one which was paved, and an 
                         older one that wasn't. People didn't 
                         use the old road anymore, and it had 
                         developed the reputation of being 
                         haunted.

               Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers 
               left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road 
               is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         Since I had no intention of ever 
                         returning to Ashton, this seemed as 
                         good a time as any to find out what 
                         lay down that old road.

               Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.

</b>                         That poet, Norther Winslow did. He 
                         was going to Paris, France. He must 
                         have liked it, because no one ever 
                         heard from him again.

                         way and I'll cut through here. Meet 
                         you on the far side.

               A little paranoid...

</b>                         Just to be sure, you can take my 
                         pack.

               Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.

<b>               EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY
</b>
               The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is 
               still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.

               Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it's 
               a day meant for whistling.

<b>               EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH
</b>
               The road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight 
               break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the 
               air. Still, Edward WHISTLES.

               Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny 
               vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, 
               he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is 
               dead quiet.

               He looks back the way he came. It's tempting to go back. It 
               would be easier to go back. But Edward presses on.

               He carefully steps through the thorns. His trouser legs catch 
               on the barbs. We can hear the fabric TEAR.

<b>               FURTHER ALONG
</b>
               A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING 
               BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at 
               them.

               Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right 
               out of his hands.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         You stupid sonofa...

               He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. The 
               stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST. The swarm 
               roars out.

               Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.

<b>               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]
</b>
               Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.

               A half-broken sign lies in the road. Edward picks it up. 
               Reads it:

<b>                                         WARNING!
</b>
<b>                                     JUMPING SPIDERS!
</b>
               Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with 
               thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         There comes a point where a reasonable 
                         man will swallow his pride and admit 
                         he's made a terrible mistake. The 
                         truth is, I was never a reasonable 
                         man.

               Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         And what I recalled of Sunday School 
                         was that the more difficult something 
                         became, the more rewarding it was in 
                         the end.

<b>               EXT. CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY
</b>
               Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs 
               off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in 
               his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he 
               still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.

               At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty 
               and comforting.

               Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- 
               with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling 
               from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their 
               laces tied together.

               He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre!"

<b>               EXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAY
</b>
               It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, 
               Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is 
               old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group 
               of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach. 
               Most are smiling. There are even a few tears of joy.

               What's more, all of these people are barefoot.

               A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store 
               to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest 
               thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard.

               Beamen checks the clipboard. Not finding the name, he flips

                         We weren't expecting you yet.

               Still confused...

               A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:

</b>                         You must have taken a shortcut.

</b>                         Mmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And 
                         truthfully, the long way is easier, 
                         but it's longer.

               Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering 
               around to look at the handsome stranger.

</b>                         The town of Spectre. Best kept secret 
                         in Alabama. Says here you're from 
                         Ashton, right? Last person we had 
                         from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

</b>                         He's still here. Let me buy you a

                         Hell, I'll have him tell you.

</b>                         No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm 
                         already running late.

               He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's 
               laughing.

<b>                                     BEAMEN

<b>               INT. BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of 
               apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), 
               who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never 
               left the state.

<b>                                     BEAMEN
</b>                         Now tell me if that isn't the best 
                         pie you ever ate.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         It truly is.

<b>               UNDER THE TABLE
</b>
               Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes.

<b>                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
</b>                         Everything here tastes better. Even 
                         the water is sweet. Never gets too 
                         hot, too cold, too humid. At night 
                         the wind goes through the trees and 
                         you'd swear there was a whole symphony 
                         out there, playing just for you.

               Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the 
               door.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Hey!

               He chases after her.

<b>               EXT. TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY
</b>
               As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching 
               the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the 
               power line -- a perfect throw. There's no way he's ever 
               getting them down.

               The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is 
               confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his 
               hand.

               Still focused on his shoes...

               The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward... 

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)

                         filled with friends you've never 
                         met.

<b>               EXT. UNDER A TREE - DUSK
</b>
               Edward sits with Norther Winslow. The fireflies are out. 
               Thousands of them.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         A man might travel his entire life

                         My journey had scarcely begun, and I 
                         had arrived.

               Norther hands him his noteboook.

<b>                                     NORTHER WINSLOW

</b>                         There's a lot of expectation. I don't

               A beat.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         It's only three lines long.

               Norther grabs his notebook back.

                         it to Paris?

<b>                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
</b>                         I can't imagine any place better 
                         than here.

</b>                         You're a poet. You oughta be able 
                         to. And maybe if you'd seen more, 
                         you could.

               Norther doesn't answer. Just goes back to his notebook.

<b>               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT
</b>
               By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the 
               water, trying to make sense of it all. The Key to the City 
               dangles around his neck.

               He stares at himself in the reflection. He smiles.

               It's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.

               No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming 
               underwater. We never see her face.

               She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, 
               squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his 
               presence. Edward is breathless. It's the first woman he's 
               seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he 
               frighten her away.

               Then he sees the snake.

               It's a cottonmouth, has to be. It leaves a break in the water, 
               its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.

               There's no decision to be made. On pure instinct, Edward 
               dives in. He swims as hard as can,

<b>               GRABBING THE SNAKE
</b>
               just as it's about to strike.

               The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified 
               that a man is coming at her.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         No, it's okay! I got it. I got the 
                         snake.

               As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in 
               his hands. Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common 
               stick. And a non-threatening one at that.

               While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover 
               that the Girl in the River is gone. He never even saw her 
               face.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Wait! I'm sorry. Hello?!

               Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she 
               never does. He stands alone in the river, wondering what 
               tricks his eyes are playing on him.

<b>               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

</b>                         There's leeches in there!

               Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching 
               him.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Did you see that woman?

<b>                                     JENNY
</b>                         What did she look like?

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Well, she... uh...

<b>                                     JENNY
</b>                         Was she nekkid?

               Embarrassed to admit it...

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Yeah.

<b>                                     JENNY
</b>                              (matter-of-fact)
                         It's not a woman, it's a fish. No 
                         one ever catches her.

               Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow 
               up on the issue. He starts to wade back to the bank.

<b>                                     JENNY (CONT'D)
</b>                         Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent

                         the coon dog he had when he was kid, 
                         back from the dead.

               Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He 
               pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging 
               to his skin.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Shoot.

               He starts to work pulling them off.

<b>               EXT. PATH BACK TO TOWN - NIGHT

                         that's not much difference at all.

               Eager to get off this subject...

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

<b>               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find "downtown" 
               has been transformed. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables 
               across the street, and a small stage has been built at one 
               end to hold FIDDLERS.

               The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, 
               Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed 
               him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.

               The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and 
               complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants 
               to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a 
               stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast.

               Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.

               Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.

               Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear 
               over the MUSIC.

               Edward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of 
               the crowd. Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.

                         ask for. And if I were to end up 
                         here, I'd consider myself lucky. But 
                         the fact is, I'm not ready to end up 
                         anywhere.

</b>                         I suspect it will hurt a lot.

               And with that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople 
               stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.

               Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy.

               Jenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could.

                         supposed to.

               It's not good enough, but it will have to do. Edward keeps 
               walking. 

<b>               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
               VARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. 
               It's horrible. Almost unendurable.

               And then it gets worse.

               The trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be 
               the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood 
               CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying 
               to block him.

               Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for 
               his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab 
               another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now 
               all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes 
               towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         As difficult as it was to reach 
                         Spectre, I was fated to get there 
                         eventually. After all, no man can 
                         avoid reaching the end of his life.

               As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the 
               City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally 
               breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud.

               Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees 
               have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush 
               him.

               He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         And then I realized, this wasn't the 
                         end of my life.

               With a sudden calm...

<b>                                     EDWARD

                         This isn't how I die.

               Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back 
               where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn 
               in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. And LAUGHING.

               His bare foot steps onto asphalt.

               Edward turns to see

               to his right, coming down the larger, paved road.

               With that, the men start walking down the larger road.

<b>               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra 
               and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small 
               plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's 
               exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain 
               the family dinner ritual.

               The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a 
               knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence.

                         Josephine has some photos in the 
                         most recent Newsweek.

</b>                         I spent a week in Morocco for the

</b>                         We'll have to pick up a copy.

               A beat. As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward 
               suddenly speaks:

                         Josephine, but African parrots, in 
                         their native home of the Congo -- 
                         they speak only French.

               All three stop to listen.

                         of them in English. But if you were 
                         to walk through the jungle, you'd 
                         hear them speaking the most elaborate 
                         French. Those parrots talk about 
                         everything: politics, movies, fashion -- 
                         everything but religion.

                         it's another one of his stories.
                              (decidedly)
                         You can't honestly say you know him.

                         we married -- we chose each other --

                         The problem is, you only see me as

               With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.

               Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons. Will is 
               approaching with a Newsweek magazine.

               Two checkstands over, an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN in her 50's

               is getting her change. Though she's Sandra's generation, she 
               carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans 
               and sneakers.

               She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes. 
               We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra. 
               It's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or 
               just find him attractive?

               Will notices the gaze. The woman turns away.

               Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman?

               Sandra looks. After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again, 
               semi-casually. Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking, 
               she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.

               A portable fan quietly WHIRRS in the corner. Turned low, the 
               RADIO on the nightstand is playing a call-in AM sports show, 
               just a wash of background chatter. Edward lies asleep on his 
               back.

               At the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade. She reaches 
               over Edward to switch off the radio. He stirs from the silence -- 
               he wasn't fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over 
               him.

</b>                         What were you dreaming about?

               He tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine 
               motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed? He nods.

                         they're especially portentous. You 
                         know what that word means, portentous?

               She shakes her head.

                         Like one night, I had a dream where 
                         this crow came and told me, "Your 
                         Aunt is going to die." I was so scared 
                         I woke up my parents. They told me 
                         it was just a dream, to go back to 
                         bed. But the next morning, my Aunt 
                         Stacy was dead.

</b>                         Terrible for her, but think about 
                         me, young boy with that kind of power. 
                         Wasn't three weeks later that the 
                         crow came back to me in a dream and 
                         said, "Your Grampa is going to die." 
                         Well, I ran right back to my parents. 
                         My father said, no, Gramps is fine, 
                         but I could see there was trepidation. 
                         And true enough, that next morning 
                         my Grampa was dead.

               He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.

</b>                         For the next couple weeks, I didn't 
                         have another dream. Until one night 
                         the crow came back and said, "Your 
                         Daddy is going to die."
                              (beat)
                         Well, I didn't know what to do. But 
                         finally I told my father. And he 
                         said not to worry, but I could tell 
                         he was rattled. That next day, he 
                         wasn't himself, always looking around, 
                         waiting for something to drop on his 
                         head. Because the crow didn't tell 
                         how it was going to happen, just 
                         those words: your Daddy is going to 
                         die. Well, he went into town early 
                         and was gone for a long time. And 
                         when he finally came back, he looked 
                         terrible, like he was waiting for 
                         the axe to fall all day. He said to 
                         my mother, "Good God. I just had the 
                         worst day of my life."
                              (beat)
                         "You think you've had a bad day," 
                         she said. "This morning the milkman 
                         dropped dead on the porch!" Josephine 
                         smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him 
                         smiling too.

               A long beat. Then, deadpan...

                         cream.

               She nods, a bit more of a laugh.

                         making deliveries around back.

               As Edward continues, she can't help but laugh harder, 
               especially as the metaphors get more vulgar.

                         box.

                         Clanking the bottles. Licking the 
                         popsicle.

               She's starting to cry from laughing.

               He rolls his eyes, why not.

               Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. 
               We STAY WITH Edward in bed.

                         and my father. I had an extra print 
                         made.

               Edward grimaces, a flash of pain. Around others, he's hiding 
               how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.

               He controls his breathing, trying to push through it.

               She returns with her camera. Edward smiles, doing a good job 
               masking the pain.

</b>                         That's because we didn't have a 
                         wedding. Your mother-in-law was never 
                         supposed to marry me. She was engaged 
                         to somebody else.

                         Probably just as well. He would have 
                         told it all wrong anyway. All the 
                         facts and none of the flavor.

               A devilish smile. Pushing past Edward, we settle on the 
               whirling fan.

               ...where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment 
               in an Alabama field. To the left, we spot Edward, 20-ish, 
               halfway through a bag of peanuts. He's still carrying the 
               backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip 
               through Spectre.

                         knowing what that would be exactly, 
                         I explored every opportunity that 
                         presented itself.

               Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top.

<b>               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT

               A troupe of STILT-WALKING FIREBREATHERS finishes their act 
               to tremendous APPLAUSE.

               As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster 
               AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands. He may only be 
               four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence.

<b>                                     AMOS
</b>                         Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think 
                         you've seen the unusual. You may 
                         think you've seen the bizarre. But 
                         I've travelled to the five corners 
                         of the world, and let me tell you, 
                         I've never seen anything like this.

               From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards 
               the crowd.

<b>                                     AMOS
</b>                         When I found this man, he was picking 
                         oranges in Florida. His fellow workers 
                         called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow -- 
                         because when you were working beside 
                         him, he blocked out the daylight. He 
                         could take a whole tree in his hands 
                         and shake off the fruit. I had to 
                         pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I 
                         could take him with me.

               Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a 
               quieter moment.

<b>                                     AMOS
</b>                         Not to alarm you, Ma'am. But if this 
                         man wanted to, he could crush your 
                         head between his toes.
                              (she trembles)
                         But he won't.
                              (a long beat)
                         He's not going to hurt her, folks, 
                         because he's our own Gentle Giant. 
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you 
                         Colossus!

               The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL 
               begins. A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside.

               A foot suddenly bursts out from within. GASPS from the crowd. 
               That foot is massive. In the stands, Edward looks closer. 
               Intrigued.

               As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out. 
               Followed by hands. Shoulders. Finally, the head. This is 
<b>               COLOSSUS.
</b>
               From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he 
               is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and 
               giant club, he seems more ogre than man.

               In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. Colossus 
               walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at 
               him. Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving. A tight 
               spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd.

               Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with 
               the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention.

               He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is 
               sitting on the dirt --

<b>               KARL THE GIANT
</b>
               stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold 
               him. He's a good foot taller than Colossus. There's a GASP 
               from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will 
               happen next?

               ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling.

               ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up. With a resigned 
               shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into 
               the shadows.

               Karl shakes his head.

</b>                         It was on that night Karl met his 
                         destiny. And I met mine. Almost.

<b>               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward 
               notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (16) leaving with her family. 
               She's wearing a blue dress and hat. For no good reason, she 
               looks back at Edward.

               The two make eye contact. And as they do, all motion FREEZES.

               A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place. A 
               spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a 
               snowflake. Even the elephant is mid-poop.

               Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the 
               frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and 
               closer to this woman.

</b>                         They say when you meet the love of 
                         your life, time stops. And that's 
                         true. What they don't tell you, is 
                         that once time starts again, it moves 
                         extra fast to catch up.

               Suddenly, everything RUSHES. The crowd becomes a blur, and 
               the young woman is lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's 
               frozen, helpless in time.

<b>               EXT. DIRT PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
               Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his 
               fated love. Not finding her, he becomes more frantic, running 
               down the rows.

               Colossus is thumbing for a ride. The last pickup truck stops 
               and lets him climb in back.

               As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward. He'll 
               never find that girl, the love of his life.

<b>               INT. BIG-TOP - NIGHT

               Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back. He 
               spots Edward walking back into the tent.

               Amos hands off the contract to a CLOWN.

               Mr. Soggybottom HONKS his horn, then waddles off.

               Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him.

                         to tell me who she is.

               Amos takes a long look at him. Ultimately, there's no way he 
               can say no. He shrugs. What the hell.

                         my final offer.

               Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. 
               We move into a MONTAGE:

<b>               INT. BIG TOP CENTER RING - NIGHT
</b>
               CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously. His head is tilted to 
               the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it 
               in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are 
               just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward 
               is dead.

               The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes 
               Edward antsier.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         From that moment on, I did everything 
                         Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of 
                         things he didn't. I'd go three days 
                         without stopping to eat, and four 
                         days without sleeping.

<b>               EXT. THE HYDRA - DAY

               His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling 
               amusement park ride.

</b>                         The only thing that kept me going 
                         was the promise of meeting the girl 
                         who would be my wife.

               Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the 
               spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the 
               gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the 
               air.

<b>               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               Edward chases a costumed pig, tripping over tent cords, 
               falling in the mud.

               His hunt leads him through the back of a tent, where he's 
               unwittingly stepped in front of a line of motorized birds. 
               To the left, CUSTOMERS are shooting with rifles. He dodges 
               four SHOTS that knock down the birds around him.

               He catches his breath, lucky.

               Then a half-blind OLD WOMAN pulls her trigger, hitting him 
               in the shoulder.

<b>               EXT. BEHIND A TENT - DAY

</b>                         Over the months, I learned a lot 
                         about the woman I was going to marry, 
                         but not her name, and not where to 
                         find her.

               That time had come. I couldn't wait any longer.

<b>               EXT. AMOS CALLOWAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT

               Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, 
               and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking. A lot. 
               Not just that, there's MOANING coming from inside.

               But Edward KNOCKS anyway.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Mr. Calloway! It's Edward Bloom. I 
                         need to talk to you.

               Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop. A beat, then the 
               door handle begins to RATTLE. It seems to be stuck.

               Edward turns the knob.

               Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN. Edward is knocked down by a 
               massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen. It has green 
               glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.

               Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his 
               throat. 

               Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but 
               the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold 
               on tight.

               Entwined, they roll across the dirt. The other nearby CARNIES 
               scatter for cover. Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of 
               his clown suit. Loads a silver bullet.

               Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off. He rolls 
               to his feet.

               The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready 
               for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming 
               the revolver at the dog.

               At the last moment...

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         No, wait!

               Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES. The bullet catches 
               Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down.

               The carnies GASP.

               Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, 
               who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of 
               weapon. He finds only a small stick. He waves it at the dog, 
               ready to strike it.

               Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. It bounces 
               excitedly, ready to play fetch.

               Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he 
               can. The dog bounds after it,

</b>
               It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it 
               drops at Edward's feet. Its tail whips back and forth.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         It was that night I discovered that 
                         most things you consider evil or 
                         wicked are simply lonely, and lacking 
                         in the social niceties.

               Edward throws the stick again. The dog takes off in a new 
               direction.

               Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the 
               stick into the woods. The still-spry dog goes after it. It's 
               gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes 
               concerned.

               He follows it into the woods.

               Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy.

               Edward walks away. Then starts running. He has to get there 
               as soon as possible.

               We DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking 
               his head in the fountain.

               He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out 
               of the package. It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative 
               dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era.

</b>
               Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-
               open door. Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG 
               WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't 
               see.

               Finally, a decision is reached. The door opens to reveal the 
               woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's 
               effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight.

               He can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs, 
               nervous. That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on.

                         I've been shot and stabbed and 
                         trampled a few times, had my ribs 
                         broken twice, but it's all worth it 
                         to see you here, now, and to finally 
                         get to talk to you. Because I am 
                         destined to marry you. I knew that 
                         from the first moment I saw you at 
                         the circus. And I know it now more 
                         than ever.

               ON SANDRA, overwhelmed. All she can finally think of to say 
               is...

               ON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors. He tries to suppress 
               the reaction, put on a brave front.

               She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely 
               horrible for what's happened. But eventually she goes back 
               inside. We hear GIGGLES from inside as her sorority sisters

               There's a TITTER from the STUDENTS, but he doesn't notice.

                         his heart wasn't strong enough.

               Don Price squeezes down hard, trying to shit the unshittable. 
               Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on 
               the tile.

               The thrashing continues. Edward somehow fights his way back 
               to his feet, ready to be knocked down again.

               Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns.

               Sandra pulls off her engagement ring. There's an audible 
               AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from Don's brothers.

               A beat. Don stands stunned, his mind reeling.

               Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting 
               for the next punch. Where is it? What's going on?

               She hands him the ring. Another beat, then Don storms off. 
               But not before decking Edward one last time.

               Sandra leans over Edward's broken body. His head lies on the

               Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but 
               not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few 
               inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife.

               He doesn't let the moment linger with undue sentimentality. 
               There's a story to be told.

                         address, and after three years I had 
                         a lot of undelivered mail.

               In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself 
               listen to the story one more time.

                         caught up with me.

               Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail 
               with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking 
               letter. Reading it, his face drops.

               FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence.

               With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a 
               dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, 
               but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook.

                         years at that point, and having waited 
                         three years just to meet Sandra, I 
                         knew I couldn't survive being away 
                         from her that long. So I took every 
                         hazardous assignment I could find, 
                         with the hope of getting my time 
                         down to less than a year.

               One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main 
               line. When his time comes, Edward leaps...

               ...but he's stuck. His cord is caught up in the assembly.

               He twists and struggles, trying to free himself. Looking 
               down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the 
               darkness. They're already long gone.

               Digging a knife out of his pocket, Edward gets to work cutting 
               through the cable. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the 
               plane.

               A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the 
               equivalent of a U.S.O. show.

               A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. 
               We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every 
               act is fundamentally the same.

               The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's 
               finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. 
               The Emcee makes a "shoot him in the neck" motion to one of 
               the ARMED GUARDS off-stage.

               We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. 
               He can't steer. He's helpless.

               But then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage. 
               The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. It's just enough 
               cover for Edward to remain unseen.

               He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. 
               He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the 
               curtain goes up. Edward looks out at the sea of excited 
               soldiers. Every one of them would kill him. He's the legless 
               cricket left on the anthill.

<b>               EXT. ON STAGE
</b>
               The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's 
               as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see.

               She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a 
               knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their 
               feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING.

               UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. 
               The two men begin to SCUFFLE.

               MUSIC starts, a vampy torch song. Ping sings melody while an 
               off-stage voice carries perfect harmony.

                         Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to 
                         explode. 
                         Wants to grab the first man she sees 
                         and tear off his clothes.

               A ROAR from the soldiers. She knows what they want.

               Still fighting, Edward jumps for a pole on the far side of 
               the catwalk, sliding down it to end up

                         She needs a special special different

                         Because that girl,

               The soldiers ROAR LOUDER, STOMPING on the bleachers.

               Backstage, the two men are still fighting.

                         got 
                         Twice the love to give.

               For the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was 
               standing in profile. Ping is one-half of

<b>               SIAMESE TWINS.
</b>
               Her identical twin is JING, who's been singing harmony all 
               this time. They are two separate women who join at the waist, 
               one set of perfect legs beneath them.

               Edward sees the twins from behind, does a double-take. It 
               costs him a punch to the jaw.

                         I'm the bad one.

               As the MUSIC builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the 
               fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook.

               As Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final 
               pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, 
               their backs forming the curves.

               Edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away.

               The soldiers are SHOUTING for an encore, lighters waving. 
               The curtain slowly lowers, revealing

<b>               EDWARD'S PARACHUTE.

               The APPLAUSE dies, replaced by a concerned RUMBLE. The Emcee 
               yells for the Guards to search.

               Ping has no idea what's happening. Jing reaches into her 
               cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses.

               As ARMED GUARDS search the halls below the stage, Ping and 
               Jing shut the door to their dressing room. At the closet, 
               they start to change outfits. Off-stage, their personalities 
               become quite apparent: Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious, 
               while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish.

               Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress,

               Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward.

</b>                         And so the twins and I began our 
                         arduous journey halfway around the 
                         world. Unfortunately, there was no 
                         way to send a message back to America.

               A black car pulls up. Two ARMY OFFICERS get out.

                         Army believed I was dead.

               Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT. The pain of her shout 
               makes church bells RING.

               Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a

                         over the worst of the nightmares. 
                         When the phone rang, she didn't think 
                         it was somehow me calling her. When 
                         a car drove past, she didn't get up 
                         to check out the window.

               Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see

               on the sheet in front of her. She freezes, watching the shadow 
               ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the 
               breeze. She knows it can't be him. He's dead.

               She turns away. With all the strength she can gather, she 
               hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket.

               Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing 
               before her. She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real. 
               It is destiny.

               Without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him.

                         them. Or maybe there is no family. 
                         Maybe he never wanted a family. But 
                         whatever it is, maybe he likes that 
                         second life better. And the reason 
                         he tells all those stories is because 
                         he can't stand this boring place.

                         see 10 percent of them. The other 90 
                         percent is below the water where you

                         with you Dad. I'm only seeing this

                         lies. Stories are what you tell a 
                         five-year old at bedtime. They're 
                         not elaborate mythologies you maintain 
                         when your son is ten and fifteen and 
                         twenty and thirty. And the thing is, 
                         I believed you. I believed your 
                         stories so much longer than I should 
                         have. And then when I realized that 
                         everything you said was impossible -- 
                         everything! -- I felt like such a 
                         fool to have trusted you. You were 
                         like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny 
                         combined. Just as charming and just

                         see that, it's your failing, not

</b>
               With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out 
               of the pool, but it's a fool's errand. The pool has long 
               since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, 
               slime covering the cemented rocks.

               Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's 
               surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which 
               disappears into the murky water.

               A beat. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. He 
               casually walks away.

               The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring 
               into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of 
               hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built 
               outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian 
               lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to 
               sell.

               Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its 
               ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit 
               beside it.

</b>                         Your father decided he needed to 
                         have an office, and it wouldn't do 
                         to have it in the house. You'll know 
                         better than me what's important.

               With some effort, Will forces up the desktop. With a HISS, a 
               neighbor's cat makes a run for it. Will's getting used to 
               being startled.

<b>               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY [LATER]

               Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash 
               bags of papers to throw out. Looking through a new file, 
               Sandra makes a small sound. A memory.

               Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram. He shares it with 
               Josephine.

<b>                                     SANDRA
</b>                         It was during the war. Your father 
                         went missing. They thought he was 
                         dead.

               Will can't believe what he's reading.

</b>                         Not everything your father says is a 
                         complete fabrication.

               A beat, then Sandra stands.

<b>                                     SANDRA

</b>                         Go.

               Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra. Will re-reads the 
               telegram, still bewildered.

               Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange 
               mechanical hand on the desk. It clamps down automatically.

               Will smiles, a memory. He hasn't thought about this device 
               in years. We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the 
               hand.

               Edward's VOICE begins as a memory...

               On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to 
               the crowd.

</b>                         I've travelled from Tennessee to 
                         Timbuktu, and if there's one thing 
                         people have in common, is we could 
                         all use a hand around the house.

               Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a 
               metal lava lamp. Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five 
               fingers and a thumb. This is the Hand Around the House.(TM)

</b>                         Why, with this product you can...

               QUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates:

                         yourself while wearing mittens. Hold 
                         a book. Hold a baby. Hold the dog 
                         away from kittens. It's strong enough, 
                         you can do a handstand with no hands 
                         at all.

               Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his 
               entire weight on it. The crowd APPLAUDS.

                         information. Or dangers. Or beautiful 
                         women.

               The hand points a finger at an HEAVYSET MAN IN OVERALLS.

               Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols 
               out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling.

               SCREAMS all around. The skinny SECURITY GUARD makes a 
               halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off. 
               The guard takes out his gun and slides it over.

               There's nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might 
               as well be asking for a Budweiser. Still, Edward senses it 
               would be best to do as he says. He takes the guard's gun.

               ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he 
               truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The Teller Woman is

               Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they're 
               going just a little over the speed limit. No one's following 
               them. It's an empty country road for miles.

               Norther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money.

                         see what you got from the vault.

               Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. Digging through 
               the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single 
               deposit envelope. He rips it open, revealing just a little 
               cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies.

                         on it.

               Caught, Edward has to confess...

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Look, I just didn't want you to go 
                         empty-handed. There's something you 
                         should know, Norther. You see, the 
                         reason why...

               Edward continues his narration...

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         I told Norther about the vagaries of 
                         Texas oil money and its effect on 
                         real estate prices, and how lax 
                         enforcement of fiduciary process had 
                         made savings and loans particularly 
                         vulnerable.

               Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:

<b>               EXT. TEXAS ROAD - DAY
</b>
               Norther leans in the driver's side window.

<b>                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
</b>                         I should go to Wall Street. That's 
                         where all the money is.

               Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in.

<b>                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
</b>                         I knew then that while my days as a 
                         criminal were over, Norther's were 
                         just beginning.

               The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the 
               last moment, Norther calls out:

<b>                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
</b>                         Edward, thank you for the hand!

               He's talking about his Hand Around the House. We HOLD ON 
               Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future.

</b>                         When Norther made his first million 
                         dollars, he sent me a check for ten 
                         thousand. I protested, but he said 
                         it was my fee as his career advisor.

</b>                         Ten thousand dollars is no fortune 
                         to most men. But it was enough to 
                         buy my wife a proper house with a 
                         white picket fence.

               We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood. 
               Edward kisses his wife.

               Sandra drops the hose, letting it run on the lawn.

               CLOSE ON water SPLASHING into the claw-foot bathtub, which 
               begins to fill.

               Still wearing his pajamas, Edward climbs into the tub. 
               Carefully lowers himself.

               As the water reaches the third button up on his pajama shirt, 
               Edward suddenly slides

               Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop. It's 
               quiet, except for the distant SPLASHING of water from the 
               spigot. Edward's eyes are closed.

               A long beat. Another. Then the SPLASHING water goes silent. 
               Edward opens one eye. The other eye. He sits up to find

               sitting on the edge of the tub. She doesn't seem particularly 
               worried -- her husband has always done this.

                         you like a fern.

               He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in 
               the tub. A beat while she considers.

               Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, 
               facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind.

               He leans forward and kisses her. When they separate, she has 
               tears hanging in her eyes.

                         when she passed on. But we sold that

               Sitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels 
               lonely, set deep in its lot. Dapples of light break through 
               the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches.

               As Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows. He 
               checks the number: 33. This is the house. It is surrounded 
               by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother's. 
               Will notices this.

               Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside. Badly.

                         I just never had proof.

               She moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her 
               into. Once she's finally free...

               A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. 
               She's a tangle of conflicting emotions.

               Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.

</b>                         The first thing you have to 
                         understand, is that your father never 
                         meant to end up here. And yet he 
                         did, twice. The first time, he was 
                         early. The second time, he was late.

<b>               INT. EDWARD'S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT
</b>
               It's late, and Edward is pensive.

<b>                                     JENNY (V.O.)
</b>                         Those days, your father was working 
                         for himself. If there was one thing 
                         you could say about Edward Bloom, 
                         it's that he was a social person, 
                         and people took a liking to him. One 
                         night he was returning from three 
                         weeks on the road, when he hit a 
                         thunderstorm unlike any in his life.

               The first raindrops hit the windshield. Edward turns on the 
               wipers.

<b>               INT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT - [THE STORM]
</b>
               Suddenly, a deluge descends. It's not even rain anymore -- 
               there's no space between the drops. It's like being caught 
               in a waterfall. It's that loud.

               No choice, Edward stops the car. Puts on the handbrake. Just 
               as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but 
               softly SPLASHING. The world is close and echoing, because --

<b>               EXT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
               -- the car is underwater. The tires are still on the road, 
               but where there used to be air is water.

               Three catfish swim in front of his headlights.

<b>               INT. THE CAR - NIGHT
</b>
               Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm. Water is 
               trickling in through the crack between the window and the 
               door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine.

               That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.

               She's swimming outside the car. While we never see her face 
               exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, 
               as the first time we saw her.

               She puts her hand to the windshield. He puts his up to meet 
               hers. And smiles.

<b>               EXT. FIELD BY DIRT ROAD - DAY

               It's morning, and the sun shines brightly. Birds CHIRP. Trees 
               drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night's rain.

               Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his 
               suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from

<b>               HIS CAR,
</b>
               which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. As 
               Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny 
               piece of metal sticking out of the dirt. He pulls it out, 
               rubs it off.

               It's a key. It's the Key to the City he lost years ago.

<b>               EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b>
               Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a 
               one-street town in the distance. We pass a rusty sign...

                                  "Welcome to Spectre."

<b>               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

               Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the 
               road, no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to 
               find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, 
               along with the rest of the town's.

                         town didn't seem the same now that 
                         he was older.

<b>               EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTS

                         world to Spectre, and with it, banks, 
                         liens and debt. Almost everywhere 
                         you looked, people were bankrupt.

<b>               EXT. SPECTRE - DAY
</b>
               We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward 
               watching. Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among 
               the bidders.

</b>                         Two different corporations were 
                         looking at buying the town, if they 
                         could get the price low enough. One 
                         wanted to open a chicken processing 
                         plant. The other, a municipal dump. 
                         Either way, Spectre would be 
                         destroyed.

               Edward raises his hand.

                         not asked to leave or pay rent or 
                         anything. They were just asked to 
                         keep doing as they were doing. In 
                         that way, he could make sure the

               Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally 
               stopped. The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the 
               trees' thick canopy.

</b>                         Within six months, his trust had 
                         purchased the entire town. With one 
                         exception.

               In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen. 
               He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around 
               his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.

               We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack. Edward KNOCKS 
               on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.

               The inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. A fire 
               burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows.

               With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano. 
               Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to 
               have a crush on him. Without turning, she says...

               Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. She turns 
               to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her.

                         as soon it not change in the way it

               Finally realizing who this woman is...

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         You're Beamen's daughter. Your last 
                         name is different.

</b>                         I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that 
                         was a big difference.

               Before he can say anything more...

<b>                                     JENNY
</b>                         I won't be selling you this house, 
                         Mr. Bloom.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I see. I thank you for your time.

               A bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves.

<b>               EXT/INT. SWAMP SHACK - DAY
</b>
               Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it 
               breaks off in his hands. It's not the clean exit he was hoping 
               for.

               Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.

               Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they 
               SNAP off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I'm sorry.

               He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps 
               slipping.

<b>                                     JENNY
</b>                         It's okay, just leave it.

</b>                         I can get it. I can just...

               He leans the door a different way. It holds for a beat then 
               falls in, SMASHING a small table.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Lord, I'm sorry I...

</b>                         Go.

               She's dead serious. Weighing the scales of chivalry, he 
               finally backs away. Turns and heads back towards his car.

               We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go. She's furious, but there's 
               something more in her feelings for him. Something softer.

</b>                         Most men in that situation would 
                         accept their failure and move on. 
                         But Edward was not like most men.

<b>               EXT. SWAMP SHACK ROAD - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
               With Karl the Giant's help, Edward unloads a brand new door 
               from a pickup truck.

<b>               EXT. SHACK - DAY
</b>
               While Jenny watches, half-annoyed, half-amused, Edward tries 
               to set the door square. Karl pushes against the side of the 
               house until it fits.

<b>               INT. SHACK - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
               Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows 
               himself. Jenny is making soup, laughing at the story he's 
               telling.

<b>                                     JENNY (V.O.)
</b>                         As the months passed, he found more 
                         and more things to fix, until the 
                         shack no longer resembled itself.

<b>               EXT. SWAMP - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
               Edward and Karl cut down a tree, letting in a flood of light.

               Through the golden pollen hanging in the air, we RISE UP to 
               see the shack is now

<b>               THE LOVELY HOUSE
</b>
               we saw before. It's tiny and white, with black shutters and 
               a steep roof. A white picket fence. In every detail it is 
               impossibly charming.

<b>               INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer. 
               Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story. 
               And watching him with deepest affection.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Of course, the best part was creating 
                         new material. By the time the twins 
                         and I got to Havana, we had a whole 
                         new routine worked out for them, 
                         with just a ukulele and a harmonica.

               Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and 
               hangs it on the rack. Perfect.

               A beat. A look between them. With that last job done, there's 
               no reason for him to be staying any longer.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         I suppose I should...

               He takes his hat off the rack.

<b>                                     JENNY
</b>                         You can leave it there.

               A beat. Does she really mean it?

               She comes closer. Edward holds his ground. She takes his 
               hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. She's very close -- 
               just a half-inch from kissing him when --

               -- Edward gently holds her back.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         No.

               She freezes, stunned and humiliated. She pulls away.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should 
                         never have let you think that...
                              (beat)
                         I am in love with my wife.

</b>                         And from the moment I saw her until 
                         the moment I die, she's the only 
                         one.

</b>                         I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

               With that, he begins to leaves.

<b>                                     JENNY
</b>                         Wait! Edward!

               She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house. 
               Hands it to him. With a look, he thanks her. Then goes.

<b>               EXT. SPECTRE - MAGIC HOUR
</b>
               Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town.

               He climbs in his car and starts the engine.

<b>               EXT. JENNY HILL'S HOUSE - DAY TO NIGHT
</b>
               As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, 
               swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches.

               Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch. Snakes 
               slither through the marsh.

               Day becomes night.

</b>                         As for the girl, the common belief 
                         was that she'd become a witch, and 
                         crazy at that. She became something 
                         of a legend herself.

               We REVERSE to find FOUR KIDS looking in through the rusty 
               iron gate with flashlights. A beat, then they run away.

<b>               INT. JENNY HILL'S KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

               Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of 
               iced tea between them.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, 
                         because she was old back when he was 
                         young.

<b>                                     JENNY
</b>                         No, it's logical if you think like 
                         your father. See, to him, there's 
                         only two women: your mother and 
                         everyone else.

</b>                         You didn't become crazy.

</b>                         Well, therapy. And one day I realized 
                         I was in love with a man who could 
                         never love me back. I was living in 
                         a fairy tale.

               Will smiles to hear it called that.

</b>                         People aren't like they are in 
                         stories. They hurt each other without 
                         meaning to. They are kind and 
                         unbelievably cruel at the same moment. 
                         Like me, now. I'm not sure I should 
                         have told you any of this.

               Her composure is starting to break.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         No, I wanted to know. I'm glad I 
                         know.

               A long beat, both staring at their iced tea. Jenny is working 
               herself into more of a state by not talking.

                         I envied you so much. The way Eddie 
                         would talk about you when you were 
                         at Missouri, that award you won. 
                         Congratulations, incidentally. And

                         everything, he was so proud of you. 
                         I mean, that's the thing. Every moment 
                         he loved you.

               She's fighting tears, not the first ones she's shed over 
               this.

                         shine when he was with me, every 
                         time he left it disappeared. I wanted 
                         to be as important to him as you 
                         were, and I was never going to be. I 
                         was make-believe and his other life,

               ANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.

               Will skips through the stations on the radio, but ultimately 
               turns it off. He's trying to think.

<b>               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - DUSK
</b>
               Will walks up the front steps. There's a subtle change to 
               his expression, a dark cloud lifted. He unlocks the door.

<b>               INT. BLOOM HOUSE FOYER - DUSK

               It's half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no TV.

               Will looks in. Empty.

<b>               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DUSK

               We follow Will, looking into his and Josephine's room. He 
               aims for the guest room at the end of the hall.

<b>               INT. GUEST ROOM - DUSK
</b>
               Looking over his shoulder, we see his father's bed is empty. 
               The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.

               A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall. Back down 
               the stairs.

<b>               INT. FOYER - DUSK

               Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table. We LOOK RIGHT, 
               where the "MESSAGE" light blinks on the answering machine.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</b>
               The hospital is so new, it's not even finished -- thick 
               plastic hangs from exposed framing. There's no one at the 
               information desk, so Will forges ahead.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place 
               to start. Then, behind him --

               He turns to see his wife at a payphone. She hangs up. She 
               was calling him.

               And like that, it's done. We HOLD ON Will, reeling from the

               Edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose. 
               There are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights. It's 
               mercifully quiet.

               Sandra squeezes Will's hand tightly. She's holding herself 
               together, but it's been a tough day.

               Dr. Bennett has just gone through the details for the third 
               time.

               A nod, then Will holds the door for Dr. Bennett and Josephine 
               as they leave. Sandra is alone in the room with her husband.

               She neatens his hair. Holds his hand. As she kisses his 
               fingers, she tweaks her chin with them -- his signature move.

               Sandra waits outside the women's restroom. Her face is a 
               study in strained composure -- acknowledging the inevitable 
               but refusing to surrender to it.

               Josephine emerges.

                         carrying Will. Like clockwork.

               The two women start to walk, no hurry.

                         I loved every minute of it. I did. 
                         Eddie was travelling a lot, so he 
                         was gone, but I felt like I always 
                         had a piece of him with me. A little 
                         part of his soul inside me. I could 
                         feel it. It was alive and kicking.

               Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion. She 
               struggles to keep it in check. Almost a whisper...

<b>                                     SANDRA
</b>                         I really miss that.

               With a few breaths, Sandra tries to hold on. Hold back.

</b>                         Don't stop. Don't.

               A beat, then Sandra finally melts. Josephine holds her. The 
               two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment 
               be.

               Will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the

               overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.

               Tables turned, Will searches for an answer. He doesn't have

                         her, on account of your father was 
                         on business in Wichita. You were 
                         born a week early, but there were no

                         real story of how you were born.

               A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors 
               being paged.

               Will half-smiles.

               Patting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves. We STAY ON Will 
               and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and 
               starts making a list.

               Will flips to a new page. The list keeps getting longer.

               It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is 
               glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair, 
               Will wakes up a bit at a time. The notepad is on his lap, 
               the pen in his hand.

               He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. What 
               woke him up?

               He looks to his right. Holds his gaze for a breath.

               His father is awake, silently GASPING for breath. His eyes

               Edward shakes his head unambiguously. Will already has his 
               finger on the orange "nurse call" button, but doesn't push 
               it.

               Edward nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the 
               nightstand. He holds it to his father's lips, but Edward 
               won't drink. He pushes it away. He wanted something else.

               Will pushes his fingers under his father's heavy hand, and 
               holds it. There's nothing else to do.

               Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He 
               sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's 
               coming. Without the story, he's lost.

               there.

               With the blanket draped over his head like a ghost, Edward 
               points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway.

               They pass a HEAVYSET NURSE, who turns to look.

               Rounding a corner, they nearly crash into Dr. Bennett.

</b>                         Will! I... What are you doing?

               Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair 
               himself, pumping both arms. Will dashes to catch up with 
               him.

               The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room.

               At the elevators, Sandra and Josephine step out to find Will 
               and Edward barreling straight at them.

               Seeing SECURITY GUARDS heading their way, a quick-thinking 
               Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down.

<b>               INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

               Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet. The chair nearly 
               crashes into the back wall as the doors close.

<b>               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the 
               Chevrolet.

               Will lifts his father out of the chair.

               Will sets him in the passenger seat.

               Scrambling in back, Will finds a liter of Arrowhead. Hands 
               it off. Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, 
               he douses himself. Soaks the blanket.

               Will pops the trunk. Starts to fold up the wheelchair.

               Will stops short, the traffic backed up. He HONKS, trying to 
               get around the jam. But it's no use.

               Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive 
               hands. It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force.

               Edward leans out the window and waves. Karl waves back.

<b>               EXT. ASHTON RIVER - DAY
</b>
               The same stretch of the river where it all began. A CROWD of 
               more than 100 waiting.

                         see everybody's already there. And I 
                         mean everybody.

               Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. 
               Soggybottom. We also find Edward's Mother and Father, the 
               Mayor, and many others from along the way. No one has aged a 
               day since we saw them last.

               While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, 
               Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet.

               The crowd CHEERS. The Ashton marching band PLAYS. Jenny Hill 
               smiles. So does the Old Woman.

               We PUSH IN on the Old Woman's glass eye, where we see...

               reflected. This is what he saw.

               Amazed, Will turns to his father.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         It's unbelievable.

</b>                         Story of my life.

<b>               EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY
</b>
               Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd. 
               Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr. Bennett pull up. Karl 
               comes just after that.

               Crossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out. 
               Strangely, he's gotten even lighter. Will carries him easily.

               Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together. He 
               hands them to Josephine. She throws them up at the powerline. 
               They loop over. APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

               The crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river. As 
               he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the 
               cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.

<b>                                     WILL (V.O.)
</b>                         And the strange thing is, there's 
                         not a sad face to be found. Everyone's 
                         just so glad to see you, and send 
                         you off right.

               Will walks into the river, up to his knees. He turns back so 
               his father can face the crowd. Edward waves.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         Goodbye everybody! Farewell! Adieu!

                         miss you!

               But one face is missing from the crowd -- Sandra. Will turns 
               to see she's already standing in the river beside them.

               The reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an 
               unearthly glow. She's more tranquil and more beautiful than 
               we've ever seen her.

<b>                                     EDWARD
</b>                         My girl in the river.

               She kisses him. He tweaks her chin. The crowd HOLLERS in 
               approval, but their moment remains strangely private. Only 
               Will is there to witness.

               As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring. 
               But it's stuck. Finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free 
               with his teeth.

               A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold. Will takes the 
               ring out of his mouth.

               Edward suddenly drops out of Will's arms with a SPLASH. For 
               he's no longer a man, but rather

<b>               A FAT CATFISH
</b>
               swimming at his feet.

               We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, 
               disappearing.

               Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching 
               Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight. Josephine is back 
               on the shore, along with the entire crowd.

               MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...

               Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the water, 
               cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset. It then dives 
               back under with a SPLASH.

                              (he smiles)
                         And that's the way it happens.

                         Yes. Exactly.

               Edward smiles, proud of both of them. His eyes are so pale 
               and so open, we can almost see his soul. In every atom of 
               his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom is entirely happy.

               And this is how he goes.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
               Will shuts the door to his father's room behind him. The 
               walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.

               He finds a quarter, starts to dial. He has to squint to see 
               through the water in his eyes. It's ringing. And ringing. 
               The other end answers.

                         Hi.

               That's all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him. 
               He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.

               MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.

               Will and his mother pick out one of Edward's ties, for Will 
               to wear at the funeral. Will tries to button the cuffs on 
               the shirt he borrowed, but they're the kind that need links.

               He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to 
               find a matching pair. Further down, he finds a ribbon tied 
               to

<b>               THE KEY TO THE CITY.

               He smiles, disbelieving. It's a real thing.

<b>               EXT. CEMETERY / ROAD - DAY
</b>
               Will helps his mother out of a black sedan. She's well-
               composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected.

               Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE. 
               The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than 
               expected.

               As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see 
               an Oldsmobile parking.

               CLOSE ON the license plates. Missouri.

               The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely 
               visible over the door. He shuts it to reveal himself to be 
<b>               70.
</b>
               It's Amos Calloway. Will doesn't recognize him.

               The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel. We TILT 
               UP to see this man is huge.

               This man is KARL, now 55. He's not 12 feet tall, but at least 
               six-eight.

               CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists.

<b>               EXT. CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY

               As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother 
               to a seat near the grave.

               Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN 
               (50) behind them. A beat later, an identical face with glasses 
               peers out -- the woman's twin sister.

               It's PING and JING.

               Josephine almost GASPS. She elbows Will, who turns to look. 
               From this angle the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing 
               steps forward. They're really two separate people. 

               A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years: 
               BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.

<b>               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]

               After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups. 
               By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they're telling 
               stories. They're telling Edward's stories.

               We find Will watching them.

               Will joins in, laughing.

               screen.

               takes Will's hand in hers, just listening.

</b>                         That was my father's final joke I 
                         guess. A man tells his stories so 
                         many times he becomes the stories. 
                         They live on after him.

               A fat and happy catfish swims towards us.

<b>                                     WILL (V.O.)
</b>                         And in that way, he becomes immortal.

               The fish passes us with a SPLASH.
