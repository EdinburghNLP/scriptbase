Basquiat tells the story of the meteoric rise of youthful artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.
Starting out as a street artist, living in Thompkins Square Park in a cardboard box, Jean-Michel is "discovered" by Andy Warhol's art world and becomes a star.
But success has a high price, and Basquiat pays with friendship, love, and eventually, his life.
