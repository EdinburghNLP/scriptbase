Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions.
Each chapter of Jamal's increasingly layered story reveals where he learned the answers to the show's seemingly impossible quizzes.

When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out.
At the heart of its storytelling lies the question of how anyone comes to know the things they know about life and love.
