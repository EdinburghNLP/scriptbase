FADE IN:
BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES

1          EXT. - SKY NIGHT                                                       

The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes

2          EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT

A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see

3          EXT. - THE CITY - DAY     

Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.

4          CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS

As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.

5          ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER     

The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly  starts to descend.
 
6          INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR     

From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into  the crowd.

7           OUT

8          WITH THE RUNNER

As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.

9          ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR                              

Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.

10          WITH THE RUNNER               

Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.

11          THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)                                        

Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.

12          P.O.V.          

The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.

13          THE SANDMAN               

Emotionless. Aims. Fires.

14          THE RUNNER - CLOSE               

Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.

15          THE SANDMAN          

Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.

16          EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)     

Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

(TITLES END)

17          CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)          

Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal


18          INT. - NURSERY CORRIDOR          

The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.

19          OUT

19X1          LOGAN                

Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.

He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.

                              LOGAN
               Wake up...come on, Logan-6.

19X2          FRANCIS

entering .

                              FRANCIS  (shaking     
                             his head in  mild, mocking
                             disbelief)     
               You are here. I  couldn't 
               believe it when they told me.  
               What are you doing?
     
                              LOGAN (still knocking  
                             on the soundless glass)  
               Turn this way. 
                             (as one of the infants 
                            stirs, smiles, bubbles) 
               No,  no...not you...YOU!
     
Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is
intent on waking one of  the infants.

                              FRANCIS               
               You should've seen me take my  
               last Runner...perfect. 
                             (Logan  continues to pound the  
                         soundless glass) 
               I backed him  up against a residence 
               pool and  when he terminated...his  
               hand... 
                             (breaks off as Logan
                             is paying  no attention)
               So now you've seen him...what's
               the difference awake or asleep?

                              LOGAN (to infant)   
               Open your eyes once, idiot.  
                         (to Francis) 
               It's not every  day that a Sandman 
               son is  born. I'm telling you, 
               Francis  - that's him!

                              FRANCIS    
               Maybe,  maybe not. What's the  
               difference? Come on,  Logan, 
               let's get out of  here before 
               everybody  finds out.

But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an  idea.

                              FRANCIS 
               Okay...you really want to wake 
               him up?

Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound an
ALARM.

                              LOGAN 
               Hey, cut that out !

Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they
stand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and
stops him from  prying at the panel:
 
                              LOGAN
               Now you've done it...

The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:

                              VOICE 
               Break-in scanners report intrusion, 
               identify.

                              LOGAN 
               Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty
               quadrant. Intrusion accidental.

                              VOICE
               Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

The violet light goes off.


                              FRANCIS (with affection:
                         to Logan) 
               Had enough?

                              LOGAN (looking at the infant)
               Even the alarm didn't wake him.

As Francis starts out:

                              LOGAN (one last look; 
                         joining Francis)
               All right, Francis...I'm with you.

They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as
they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN
automatically  tended.

CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.

                              VOICE
               Sleep time...go to sleep.
               Sleeping time, little ones.

As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final look
backward.

                              FRANCIS
               You need a lift. Let's go 
               to Arcade and celebrate...
                         (teasing tone)
               your alert successor...Logan-6.
 
                              LOGAN 
               Has anyone ever broken in to 
               where the babies are?

                              FRANCIS 
                         (putting a card key into a door 
                         which opens soundlessly) 
               Not in my time...

They move through the door which closes.

20          EXT. - MAZE STATION - NIGHT

They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways,  each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.




                              FRANCIS (peering 
                         at Logan curiously)
               Why?

                              LOGAN 
               just wondered...what happens?

                              FRANCIS (shrugs) 
               Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever 
               happens, you can bet it's final. 
               But who would want to find out?

One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a  kind of twilight.

21          INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They   move off.
 
22          EXT. - MAZE- CAR

Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:

23          THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE

Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears  into a tunnel.

24          MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE

As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a
gathering  CROWD.

25          FULL SHOT - ARCADE

Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.

26          WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing...

                              LOGAN 
               but you don't know, you Just 
               say what everyone says.  One for 
               one. One for one."

                              FRANCIS 
               Well, why no!? That's exactly how
               everything works. How else could 
               the city stay in balance -You have
               a better idea?
 

                              LOGAN (laughs)
               No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- 
               instead of doing that "one for one" song           
               of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher 
               With a stuck tape.

                              FRANCIS
               Well the minute you get a better
               idea you can stop wondering.
                         (beat)
               You know, Logan -- you wonder 
               a lot. Too much for a Sandman

They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!
 
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts  back to RELIVE.

As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to  Logan and Francis and moves on.

27          ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU

They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of  her with his hands framing his face.

                              MAN
               Well? How do you like it?

                              WOMAN (critically) 
               I don't know. The cheeks maybe...
               look a little -

                              MAN 
               Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, 
               you think?

                              WOMAN 
               Too little.

                              MAN 
               Too little?
                         (gestures)
               Too little. Okay, wait for me.

And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances
around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.

28          ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP

Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
"yes...yes..." As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them.

                              LOGAN
               Did you ever see Francis-8?

                              FRANCIS (shaking his head) 
               I never even visited Nursery before 
               tonight. 
                         (beat) 
               When you wonder, it slows you up --
               you know?

They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going
in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds...

                              FRANCIS 
               I don't know what makes you so curious. 
               You have any idea who his seed-mother was?

                              LOGAN (quickly) 
               Of course not! I m curious, not sick.
                         (laughs)

The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.

29          FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL

An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:

                              FRANCIS
               and that's my friend, Logan. 
                         (as she acknowledges 
                         the introduction)
               We're celebrating his next in line.
               Carousel - Arcade - who knows? 
               Want to come along?

                              WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)
               Only if I make it to the top of
               Carousel.
                         (she holds up her hand)
               Thirty -- and the big spin.

In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her
a  half-squeeze.

                              FRANCIS 
               You're thirty -- already? I always 
               thought I was older than you - 
                         (beat)
               Well, give it a good try.

                              WOMAN (pleasantly) 
               You know I always have.

Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.

                              2ND WOMAN (to the first) 
               Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. 
               It¹s  my Love-Shop turn.

                              WOMAN
               That's all right. Happy turn.

                              2ND WOMAN
               You'll renew. I've got a feeling.

                               WOMAN (smiles) 
               So do I...but if I don't at least I'll 
               have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost 
               rather have that than renew.

                              2ND WOMAN 
               I feel the same way. Sometimes I think 
               I'm not even going to try and renew when 
               my time comes. But -- that's three years away.
               So long.

The 2nd Woman walks away.

                              FRANCIS (after a beat; 
                         to first Woman) 
                It's been nice.

                              WOMAN
               Um-huh.

They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm
and  they move off.
 
                              FRANCIS
               I guess you never had her?

Logan shakes his head.

                              FRANCIS
               You missed something special.

                              LOGAN
               Well...you can't have them all.

                              LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
                         (together, it's an old joke)
                But you can try.

They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.

                              FRANCIS 
               The damned Yellows are getting out 
               of hand. Those three ought to be in 
               Cathedral. No business scrambling in 
               Arcade...

                              LOGAN (laughs 
                         cuffs Francis' arm)
               What an old, old man you're getting 
               to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a 
               Yellow? I bet you were even wilder 
               than -
                         (he breaks off as the lights 
                         in the Great Hall dim) 
               -- come on, Sandman.

The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.
 
30          FULL SHOT - GREAT HALL

As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains
have parted to reveal

31          ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

AC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling  TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE  deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...

32          WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.
     
                              LOGAN 
               You should have been with us in Nursery,  
               Daniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -

                              FRANCIS (hustling
                         Logan)
               Come on. I don't want to miss the
               filing-in. There'll be some I know
               tonight, I think...

                              DANIEL (glances at his
                         own red crystal, nods)
               Yes. Me, too. You know we're
               both on Monitor tonight.
     
                              FRANCIS
               Damn! That's right. Just when I
               feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
               Arcade .
     
                              LOGAN
               Want me to take your shift? I'm
               feeling restless anyway
          
Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see

33          FULL SHOT - CAROUSEL

framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in
changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --     
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...

34.          ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated.

                              LOGAN 
               Now there's a few who could have been 
               his seed-mother.
     
                              FRANCIS 
               Only a few? You're just not trying.

35-36         OUT

37          PANNING THE CROWD

As the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...

SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...

38           OUT

38X1          ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS

Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.

39          THE CROWD     

Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.

40          LASTDAY GROUP     

Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.

41          CROWD

Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.

42          CAROUSEL

As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...

43          CROWD

Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see

44          CAROUSEL

Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.

45          LOGAN

Caught up in it Like the rest.

46          CAROUSEL

Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.

Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.
          
SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.

47          FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN

Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:

48          FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL

High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.

49          MEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN          

At the highest level...straining for the rainbow...

50          SWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWD     

Hysterical...starting to chant...

                              CROWD 
               Renew!

The man continues to strain:

                              CROWD 
               Renew!

51          CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN          

Almost a blur...but still straining:
          
                              CROWD'S CHANT
               Renew!

52          CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

                              LOGAN AND FRANCIS
                         (chanting with the rest) 
               Renew!

53          CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN          

The blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the
rainbow...

                              CROWD'S CHANT 
               Re...

Suddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness
below...where he is instantly incinerated.

54          WIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL     

Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining.

55          WIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERS          

Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing --
SCREAMING, fulfilled.

56           OUT

57          FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL
Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow
bands.

58          CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS               

As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a
BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,
dark plastic box.

Logan looks at the box. On it we see:

               MAN: RELIVE STORE 14          
               
                               LOGAN 
                         (to Francis)     
               Looks like I'm working.
          
Francis stands.
          
                              LOGAN
               Who invited you?

                              FRANCIS
               I'm in my party mood.
          
Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers.

They make their way into the hall.

Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.

Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.

As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:

59-
59X11         WIDE ANGLE - A MAN           

running.

CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.

A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.

B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.

C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.

D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.     

(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)

E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.

F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.

G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.

H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.

I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.

J. The Runner¹s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.

K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.

L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.

M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.

N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.

59X12-
63X1              OUT

63X2          WITH LOGAN     

As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.

63X3          INSERT TRANSCEIVER               

A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.
     
63X4          ANOTHER ANGLE     

As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.

63X5          INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:

The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION

63X6          LOGAN

Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly.

                              LOGAN
               Runner terminated 0:31
                         (a beat)
               Ready for cleanup.

Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.

                              LOGAN 
                         (smiling)
               That was a great shot you made.
     
                              FRANCIS
               Yes.
                         (beat)
               But you look a little rusty to me --
               what were you doing, wondering?

Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the
hall, passing CAMERA
     
63X7          ANOTHER ANGLE

We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.

63X8          1ST STICKMAN AND BODY     

The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.     
                         
63X9          CORPSE (INSERT)

It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.

63X10          1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS

Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.
          
63X11          2ND STICKMAN

Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.
               
63X12          CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN

Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.
               
63X13          ANOTHER ANGLE     

As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.

63X14          LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE

Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill.

                              FRANCIS 
               ...Well I think you're getting stale. 
               You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole 
               burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell 
               me it turns you inside out...

He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.

                              FRANCIS 
                         (calling after him)
               I'll look for you here when I'm off--

And he is gone.
     
63X15          LOGAN

waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.

63X16          POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.

Crazy, man.

63X17          BACK TO LOGAN     

Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:
          
63X18          POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS     

The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.

63X19          LOGAN          
Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.

63X20          LOGAN'S APARTMENT     

As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.

63X21          AT THE WALL RECESS          

As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.

63X22          LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE     

Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.
          
63X23          JESSICA AND LOGAN

Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.

64          LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised.

                              LOGAN
               What's wrong, Available?

                              JESSICA 
                         (breaking away gently) 
               Please . . .No.

She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.

                              LOGAN
               Please . . . no ?
                         (noting that she looks trapped,
                         he understands)
               You mean "not here"--that's it?
               You're a private Available but
               particular,
                         (he is moving in on her
                         as he speaks, she retreating, 
                         which amuses him)
               Don't worry. There's no one here but me. 
               And you.

                              JESSICA 
               No. 
                         (that stops him) 
               Just no.

                              LOGAN 
               You prefer women?

                              JESSICA 
               No.

                              LOGAN
               Well then...?

                              JESSICA
               Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself
               on the circuit. It was a mistake.

                              LOGAN 
               Sad? What made you sad?
     
                              JESSICA           
               A friend of mine went on Carousel          
               tonight. Now he's gone.     
          
                              LOGAN 
                         (after a beat)
               Yes...probably he was renewed?

                              JESSICA 
                         (flatly)
               He was killed

                              LOGAN
               Killed? Why do you use that word?

                              JESSICA
               Isn't it right? Isn't that what
               you do? Kill.

                              LOGAN
               I never 'killed' anybody in my life.
               Sandmen terminate  Runners
                         (a beat)
               Who brought you?

                              JESSICA 
               Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself
               on the circuit.

                              LOGAN
               You felt sad. What's your name?

                              JESSICA
               Jessica.

               You're beautiful. Let's have sex.

               No.
          
                              LOGAN
               Later.

                              JESSICA
               No.     

                              LOGAN
               But you put yourself on the circuit!

                              JESSICA
               I thought I had to do something.
          
                              LOGAN               
               And?                    

                              JESSICA
               I changed my mind

                              LOGAN
               And now?
     
                              JESSICA
               Curious.

                              LOGAN
               About what?
                                   
                              JESSICA
               How a Sandman lives.

Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.

                              LOGAN
               Let's have sex.
                         (as Jessica shakes her head)
               I thought you were curious.
                              
                              JESSICA
               Not about that.

                              LOGAN 
                         (after a beat)
               I'm listening.

                              JESSICA
               I'm afraid to tell you.

                              LOGAN 
                         (smiling)
               I'm not armed.
                         (a beat)
               Well?

                              JESSICA
               Why is it wrong to run?                    

                              LOGAN
               You shouldn't even think such things...
                         (smiles)
               And you picked a strange person to
               say them to - 
          
                              JESSICA
               I suppose. But what if you want
               to live?

                              LOGAN
               So? Do what everyone does. Try
               like hell for renewal.

Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.

                              LOGAN
               When this turns black...that's it.
                         (laughs) 
               If for any reason you want to be 31...
               you have the same chance as everyone 
               else...Carrousel.

Logan takes his gun and points it at her.

                              LOGAN           (playfully) 
               But if you're one of the misfits... 
               that's where I come in.

                              JESSICA (somewhat
                         frightened)
               I didn't say that I would run...
               I Just...

                              LOGAN (interrupting;
                         turning over her palm)
               Are you a 5 or a 6?
                         (we see a green crystal)

                              JESSICA
               Six. I go red next year.

                              LOGAN
               You're years away . . . I don't know
               why you're thinking of these things,
               much less talking about them.
                         (offering Jessica the gun) 
               Want to try?

Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an
admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.

                              LOGAN
               What Quad do you live in?

                              JESSICA 
               K.

                              LOGAN (softly)
               You're sure you don't want to try?

Jessica nods.

                              LOGAN      
               It's nice to know you can nod.     

Jessica smiles.

                              LOGAN
               It's nice co know you can do that,
               too.
     
Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,
Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort
after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan:
     
                              FRANCIS
               These are for me -- you've got your
               own.
                         (looking after Jessica)
               She must have been something--?
     
At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all.

64X1          EXT. - SAND MAN H.Q.

A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by
broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:

                              LOGAN
               What happened to you?

                              SANDMAN (embarrassed)
               I lost a Runner in Cathedral.

                              LOGAN
               How come?

                              SANDMAN
               Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. 
                         (as they stare)
               One of them cut me bad... 
                         (extends his arm and moves 
                         a finger from his shoulder to 
                         his wrist)
               all the way down.
                         
                              FRANCIS
                         (with anger)     
               CUBS!     
          
                              SANDMAN (shrug)
               On my way to the New You for repairs.

                              LOGAN 
               Get yourself a new face while you're 
               at it They know you now.

They wave. Logan and Francis continue.

64AX1-
64BX1         OUT
          
64CX1          INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY (VOICE OVER)

As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.
          
                              LOGAN
               I just might look in on New You 483
               myself.

                              FRANCIS 
               You? Why? You're already beautiful.

                              LOGAN 
               No -- it's that last Runner -- someone 
               in 483 was trying to help him.

64X2          INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - READY ROOM

As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen,
who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One
of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them

                         SANDMAN (Monitor)
               What's with you, Francis?
     
                         FRANCIS (touching his
                    head; grimacing)
               Last night
          
The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis
continue to:

65-68     OUT

69          INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREA

Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,
YELLOW GREEN AND RED.
        
Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.

There are no humans.

Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.

Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)

The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner
on the overhang above.     
               
Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of
fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.
He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments
later...the scanner stops...the word:
     |     
               IDENTIFY

appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .
and the words:
     
               CLEAR
               FRANCIS-7

appear on the SCREEN.

                              FRANCIS
               See you in the hydrotoner!
          
Logan nods.

Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.

Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the
items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier.

The scanner continues scanning.

Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on
and on.

Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time.

Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:

          PROBABILITY

blinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As
Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:
     
          APPROACH

We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .
that he has never seen this before.
          
Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.

The word on the SCREEN is now:

          IDENTIFY

Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.
We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words
appear on the SCREEN:

          OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM 
          PATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKED

               Question: I am six Red...how can

               Question: My Life-- 

Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.

Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes.

As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,
fearful.
               
                              LOGAN
               Question:

                    (extending the blinking palm)
               This means ten days to Lastday.
               Of course I will get the four years
               back, won't I?

The words on the SCREEN read:

                              LOGAN (very urgent) 
               Question: Do I get my four years back?

Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.

Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost
automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the
SCREEN already has the words:

          CLEAR LOGAN-5

Logan looks at it - then:

The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT
LIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKING
CRYSTAL....and continues out into:

69X1          INT. - HYDROTONER - DAY     

Spectacularly 23rd century. Logan enters. He looks around and spots
Francis.... in a whirlpool bath....trying to recover from has
incredible hangover.

In the b.g. of the SHOT we can see some Sandmen doing calisthenics.
Logan walks over to Francis....hiding his blinking crystal by
holding his hand against his leg.
                              
                              FRANCIS
               What the hell took you so long?

               Did you ever see anybody renew?

                              FRANCIS 
               I think you've been skulling out too 
               much. First Nursery and now stupid 
               questions.

                              LOGAN 
               Did you?

                              FRANCIS 
               Of course.

                              LOGAN 
               Anybody we know?

                              FRANCIS 
               Look....why don't you get into the 
               water....you need it....more than I do.

                              LOGAN 
                         (after a beat) 
               I'm fine....
                         (walking away)
               See you....

                              FRANCIS 
               At Carousel tonight?

Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS
for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:

70          EXT. - SANDMAN BUILDING     

Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking
crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out
the black box, dials.

                              LOGAN 
                         (into box)
               Location...female Green Six...
               name Jessica...living in Quad K.

71-73      OUT

73X1          INT. - LOGAN'S APARTMENT     

Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who
has obviously escorted her there.

                              YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling)
               She says she's been here before...

                              LOGAN
               She has.

Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile
widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.

                              JESSICA
               You could have called me yourself.

                              LOGAN
               But I wasn't sure you'd come.

                              JESSICA 
                         (the game has started)
               Here I am. 
                         (beat)
               Shall I come in?

Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.

                              LOGAN
               I couldn't get you out of my mind.

                              JESSICA
               I'm the most beautiful woman you've
               ever seen, I suppose?

                              LOGAN
               Maybe...sure....

                              JESSICA
               Thanks...but I have the choice.
                    
                              LOGAN     
               Of course.          
                              
                              JESSICA     
               Then it's still no.

Logan laughs.

                              JESSICA     
               You can have any woman in the city.                    
               What do you really want?                    

                              LOGAN
               You know

                              JESSICA
               I don't believe you. There has to
               be more.

                              LOGAN
               All right.

Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that.
Jessica can see it blinking red.

Jessica gasps for a moment...then:

                              JESSICA
               Why show me?

                              LOGAN
               I'm going to run.

                              JESSICA (after
                         reacting)
               Why tell me?

                              LOGAN
               You know something.
     
                              JESSICA
               About running, dying what?

                              LOGAN
               Both...running's what I'm interested
               in.

                              JESSICA
               I know what everyone knows. Try
               like hell for Renewal. You have
               the same chance everyone else has.

                              LOGAN
               It's different now. Help me.

                              JESSICA
               How can I?

Logan takes out the ankh.

                              JESSICA
               Where did you get that?

                              LOGAN
               A Runner gave it to me.

                              JESSICA      
               And then you killed him, right?                    

                              LOGAN
               I let him go...believe me.

                              JESSICA
               I don't..

                              LOGAN (a beat)
               Speak to your friends for me, Jessica...
               please...

                              JESSICA
               Please? What friends?

                              LOGAN 
                    (clutching the ankh, looking 
                    at Jessica's; then:)
               I don't have much time.

                              JESSICA
               I never heard of a Sandman running
               . . . ever. . .

                              LOGAN (putting the
               ankh in his pocket;
               dropping the bombshell)
               And I never heard of Sanctuary.

Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..

Logan reaches out and touches her hand.

                              LOGAN
               What can I do to make you believe me?

Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.

Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..

74-81     OUT 

82          EXT. - A SLEEK, OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

There are three men and a woman seated at a table. Jessica reaches
the table and sits down.

83          CLOSE ON - LOGAN     

A distance away...watching.

84-85      OUT      

86          EXT. - RESTAURANT - FULL ANGLE - THE THREE MEN,
          WOMAN AND JESSICA

Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their
conversation.

                              SECOND MAN 
               He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get 
               old, too.

                              FIRST MAN
               But what if he's telling the truth?

                              THIRD MAN
               I say no. It's not worth the risk.

                              WOMAN
               I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners 
               for a decade. He has no feelings.

                              JESSICA
               He was born a Sandman. He had no
               choice.

                              WOMAN 
               Neither do we.

87-88      OUT

88X1          SANDMAN READY ROOM     

Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He 
goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up.
          
                              1ST SANDMAN
               Thanks, Francis.
          
                              FRANCIS (taking his
                         place at the console)
               Just don't be forever about it like last 
               time.

                              1ST SANDMAN
               Ah-h you love it. You're afraid
               you'll miss a really good Run.          

They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.

89 OUT

89X1          EXT - RESTAURANT - THREE MEN A WOMAN AND JESSICA

Leaning together talking in an undertone
               
                              SECOND MAN (urgently)     
               If he believes you, he'll come.     
               
                              JESSICA     
               Why Arcade Station?
               
                              SECOND MAN (impatiently)
               Why? It's our only chance--kill him
               and get away in the crowd heading
               for the evening slaughter --
                    
                              JESSICA
               Right at the station itself?

                              MAN
               No - just there - on the first level.
                         (beat)
               Don't look for us. We'll see you.

                              WOMAN (cutting in)
               You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.
                         (beat)
               Can you do it? Will you?

Slowly, Jessica nods.

                              THIRD MAN
               Tonight?

                              JESSICA (stalling)
               Y-yes...if I can find him.

                              WOMAN
               I think you can. Don't you?

Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her
eyes, relaxes.

                              WOMAN  
               I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard 
               about Sanctuary -- and that makes him 
               dangerous to all of us.

After murmurs of agreement:

                              SECOND MAN 
                         (staring at Jessica) 
               We're counting on you.

Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment,
one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.

90-92     OUT

93-94      OUT

94A1          READY ROOM - FRANCIS     

Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress,
the assignment of a Sandman, the kill.
     
94X1          WITH JESSICA          

Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful.

94X2          ANOTHER ANGLE

The man from the restaurant, following.

94X3          GALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICA

Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.

Logan opens the door, reacts.

                              LOGAN
               Are you here to help me?
     
                              JESSICA
               What do you need?

A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to
him as the door closes.

94X4      OUT

DISSOLVE TO:
          
94X5          WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together,
stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi).

                              JESSICA
               What're you going to do?

                              LOGAN
               That's tomorrow.

                              JESSICA 
                         (turning away slightly)
               I wish I could help you.

                              LOGAN 
                         (turning her gently back)
               Maybe you'll chink of something...

                              JESSICA 
                         (hating herself)          
               I wish I knew what you think I know.          

Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each
other anyhow. They commence walking again.
          
94X6          ANOTHER ANGLE          

The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as
to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue,
Logan and Jessica approach.

94X7          WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA     

                              LOGAN
               If you did know, you'd tell me.
                         
                              JESSICA
               Of course--

                              LOGAN (overriding)
               If you trusted me, you'd know.
                    
                              JESSICA (evading it)
               We're coming to Arcade.
                         (beat)     -
               Shall we Relive together?
     
94X8          CLOSE ANGLE

As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the
followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are
partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from
his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go
off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit
round a corner.

94X9      OUT

94AX9     READY ROOM     

As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is
reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing
there, watching. He loves the work--they all do.

94X10     ARCADE - LOWER LEVEL     

Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing
tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.

94X11     ANOTHER ANGLE

Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw
before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving
so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.

94X12     FEATURING JESSICA     

As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for
Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,
hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.

94X13     THE AMBUSHERS     

Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the
man's hands.
     
94X14     LOGAN AND JESSICA     

Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.
Logan looks at her searchingly.

                              LOGAN 
               Tell me, Jessica.

Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his
hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,
Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too.
     
94X15     READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN

As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: 

          RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2
          ...LOGAN-5

The Sandman at the console turns and says:          

                              1ST SANDMAN
               Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight--
               why don't you--

But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others
ad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before you
see them" etc.

95-105      OUT

105X1     ARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH     

The two watching, muscles taut -- wondering.

106-
106X1     OUT

106X2     ARCADE - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA     

As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out
his destination on the car caller.

                              LOGAN
               A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.

106X3     MAZE-CAR STATION ARCADE     

                              JESSICA
               You're not going, are you?
          
                              LOGAN (a beat)
               Why not? Maybe she'll help me.
               You won't. You'd better stay here.

The maze-car arrives and they move to it.
     
                              JESSICA (touching his
                         arm)
               I'd rather be with you.
     
                              LOGAN (knowing she is
                         lying through her teeth)
               That's nice.
          
They enter the car which instantly moves off. As it passes, the men
in ambush come forward and read the destination. They ring for
another car which pulls in immediately.

                              LOGAN
               Have you ever been through Cathedral?

Jessica shakes her head.

                              LOGAN
               They're like beasts. Wild.
     
                              JESSICA          
               Maybe they're angry because they're
               grown in meccano-breeders.

                              LOGAN (interrupting,
                         grimacing) 
               Instead of what? Nine months inside a 
               woman:
                         (ugh) 
               We're all raised the same but most of 
               us don't become cubs in Cathedral.

                              JESSICA 
               Some people say children need human 
               mothering.

                              LOGAN 
               Insane. Nurseries are better than any 
               mother could be.

                              JESSICA 
               I'm only telling you what I've heard...
                         (slightest beat) 
               Haven't you ever wondered what your 
               seed-mother was Like...?

                              LOGAN 
               Uh-uh.

                              JESSICA 
               I have.

                              LOGAN 
                         (after a beat) 
               When did you begin to question Lastday?

                              JESSICA 
               I don't remember exactly...except I was 
               a Green.
                         (another beat) 
               What would you like to relive, Logan?

                              LOGAN (smiling)
               Let's see - how long has it been?

As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car
slides to a stop.

A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens.

                              VOICE               
               Attention passengers. Cathedral          
               Station is a personal risk area.     
               Persons with business are warned
               to be careful.

121X1     EXT. - MAZE-CAR - CATHEDRAL STATION     

Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,
looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs
away into the distance.

                              JESSICA
               I've never been in this quadrant.
                         (looks off)
               Is that Arcade off there?
          
There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an "elevated" station.
          
121X2     POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRAL

Arcade shining like distant fireworks.

122          EXT. - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRAL

Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed
walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim
and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy
architects."

Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the
only SOUND.

                              LOGAN 
               Let me go first. Sometimes they're 
               waiting just inside there--to rush 
               you when it opens...

                              LOGAN
               Quickly now--

He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very
thick.. They turn abruptly and see:

123          INT. - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBER

A room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,
also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an
absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily
certain she's about to smash into something.

                              LOGAN (guiding her) 
               Just follow--no matter how it seems...

                              JESSICA (doing her
                         best)
               But what is this--why?
     
                              LOGAN (as they enter     
                         the corridor)     
               The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle 
               there's  no way to catch up. Without the 
               dazzle, they'd just go past us--
                         (gesture)
               too fast

                              JESSICA
               Muscle? I don't know that one.
     
Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--a
fun house in which you can get hurt.
     
                              LOGAN
               It's unauthorized. No good for any-
               one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you
               to pieces--speeds everything up to a
               blur--
                         (he is amused)
               you can see what happens when some
               flying Cub tries to go through this
               on muscle--splat!
     
Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then:  A moment later:
     
124          ANOTHER ANGLE     

As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in a
tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica.

                              JESSICA (gently)
               Don't be afraid.

We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled.

                              JESSICA
               What's your name?

                              MARY
               I'm Mary 2.

                              JESSICA
               Where do you live, Mary?

                              MARY
               Here.

                              JESSICA               
               Why aren't you in Nursery?               

                              MARY
               I'm very smart.

                              JESSICA
               When do you go up?

                              MARY
               I never go upstairs. You're a
               nice old lady.

As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's
clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away
swiftly.

As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.

                              LOGAN 
                         (shaking his head)
               Not here. Might be a decoy.

Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-

125          EXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELF

An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.

Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,
listening...

SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.

Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,
puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand
still then he straightens, steps out, calls:

                              LOGAN
               Runner!

Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is
shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off. The Runner is a woman!

There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps, grasping at him.     
          
As Logan whirls:     
          
125X1          ANOTHER ANGLE     

Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a
futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.

A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.

                              BILLY 
                         (speaking of the Runner) 
               Don't worry about her. We'll have that 
               one later. Right now I think we've got 
               a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!

The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy.

                              A VOICE 
               We're going to have ourselves a time, 
               we are. Right, Billy?!

There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.

                              LOGAN          
               I'm a Sandman!          

                              BILLY
               I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They
               said I'd never get him...but I cut
               him up good, I did.

                              LOGAN (firm tone)
               I feel sorry for you, boy!

Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.

                              BILLY
               For me? Better feel sorry for your-
               self, Sandman!

                              LOGAN
               No, for you! How old are you, Billy?

Billy is silent.

                              LOGAN 
               Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running 
               out. How long can you last? A year. Six 
               months?
                         (he points to the yellow
                         flower in Billy's palm)
               What happens when you're sixteen and
               you go green?

                              BILLY (lashing out) 
               Nothing will happen! I make the
               rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say!
               Always have! Always will! I got
               Cathedral and I'll never let go!

                              LOGAN 
               No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever 
               heard of a cub with a green flower? 
               You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, 
               when you're on green, because they 
               won't let a green stay here.
                         (slightest beat) 
               If you try to stay the young ones will 
               gut-rip you apart!

                              BILLY
               Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!

Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a
blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned
building.

                              ANOTHER VOICE     
               Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut     
               his mouth! Let's watch him shake          
               himself to death!!
          
We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhale
the "Muscle." At once their movements become blurringly rapid. They
take menacing positions - some leaping overhead.
               
                              A VOICE
               Give him some Muscle!!
          
Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and
Jessica

moving a drugpad against Logan's face.

Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the
"Muscle" directly from the pad into his system.

                              BILLY (chilling laugh) 
               He's trying to hold his breath...

As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:

With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the
ground and pulls out his gun.

He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.

                              BILLY          
               We can rush him...we can take      
               can take him     again, we can!!     

The pack hesitates...stops backing away.

                              LOGAN 
                         (moving the gun slowly 
                         back and forth)
               All right! How many of you want this to 
               be Lastday?!

The pack moves back again...and  disperses, leaving Billy facing
Logan alone.

                              LOGAN
               Come on, Billy...come on...you cut
               a Sandman, didn't you?!

Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.

                              LOGAN
               Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on

After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.

Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.

The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.

They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned
buildings.

We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and
attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction
than where the beeping is coming from.

                              LOGAN 
                         (shaking his head) 
               They've got someone else! Why would 
               anybody come here?

Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.

The BEEPING is now very loud.

Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to
a door inside and kicks it down.

We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.

129          FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE WOMAN

the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.

                              WOMAN (nearing
                         hysteria)
               There's been a terrible error! My
               Lifeclock must have broken in some way!
                         (rising tone)
               I'm nowhere near thirty...look at
               me...I'm twenty-two. I should be
               green! Did you hear me?
                         (shouting)
               Green!

                              LOGAN (quietly)
               Don't be afraid--     

Before Logan can continue...the Woman...who is now wild-eyed and
hysterical lunges at Logan...and starts grappling with him.
     
                              WOMAN
               I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!

After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down:

                              LOGAN (breathing hard) 
               I'm not going to hurt you.

Slowly, she rises.

Logan takes out the ankh.

                              LOGAN 
               Sanctuary? Anything?

Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round
object...the size of a large marble.

                              LOGAN     
               If they find you throw this hard     
               enough to break it. Then hold your     
               breath till you get away...It's
               blind gas.

Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again.

During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.

Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round
object...she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move
off.

Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and
Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble... 

134          ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

shivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window.
          
                              FRANCIS (in a firm, cold
                         tone)
               Runner!
          
The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as:
Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples
to the floor;

134X1          MAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN     

hearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchange
a look.

135          LOGAN AND JESSICA      

At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn.
Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and
pulls her away.

136          FRANCIS 

After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and
starts to speak into it:

                              FRANCIS (quietly)
               Runner terminated at G.16
               Ready for cleanup at Cathedral
               Quadrant 39.
               
137          ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE 

The Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform...
peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto
the maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look at
one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have
heard.

They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica.

                              SECOND MAN
               I almost believed her.

They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.

138          MED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS 

Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car
platform.

139          INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT      

                               JESSICA
               I'm ashamed. I was bringing you
               to be killed.

                              LOGAN
               Where? Sanctuary? Can you take
               me there?     

                              JESSICA 
               Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. 
               But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

                              LOGAN (a beat) 
               All right. But why? I didn't kill the 
               Runner.

                              JESSICA (interrupting) 
               Yes, but they won't know that...or care. 
               They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, 
               now...

                              LOGAN (wry laugh) 
               That's nothing...there's a Sandman
               behind us, too and there'll be
               more soon. Take me to them.

                              JESSICA (torn) 
               I - I can't.

                              LOGAN
               Then - why don't you leave me - go
               to them - explain

                              JESSICA 
               No. Not that either.

Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then:

                              LOGAN
               All right. New You 483. I'll find
               out myself.

139X1          INT. - SANDMAN READY ROOM - FRANCIS

Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring
the city.

139X2          ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.

The scanners begin moving.

Moments later the scanner stops...the word:

          IDENTIFY     

appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into
the groove.

Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them
on the scanning table.

An ALARM SOUNDS and the word:

          REJECT

flashes on and off on the SCREEN.

Sandmen come running into the Area.

                              SANDMAN
               What happened?!

Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind,
taking the items off the table:     
          
                              FRANCIS
               Can you beat it....I've got the damn
               wrong bag.

                              SANDMAN 
               You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, 
               Francis.

                              FRANCIS (starting out) 
               Yeah....

140          EXT. - NEW YOU #483 - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA     

as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:

141          MED. ANGLE - THE SECOND AND THIRD MEN

A safe distance behind.

142          INT. - NEW YOU #483

The waiting room has many mirrors...where customers ...male and
female...are checking their faces (and bodies).

There are also various photographs on the walls... suggestions for
changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera. The chatty
informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber
shop.

There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner.

Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk.

The receptionist looks at Logan...ignoring Jessica.

                              RECEPTIONIST 
               Hello, Sandman.

                              LOGAN 
               Hello.

                              RECEPTIONIST 
               Do you want to see Doc?

Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching.

                              RECEPTIONIST     
               We don't get many Sandmen. I think
               we've only had one other since I've
               been here.

                              LOGAN (brusquely) 
               A Sandman can get as sick of his face 
               as anyone else. Where's the doctor?

                              RECEPTIONIST (smiling) 
               I like your face. Would you mind if Doc 
               took a picture? I'd Like him to give 
               your face to somebody else.

                              LOGAN
               It's all right with me. Is he here?

                              RECEPTIONIST
               My name's Holly...Holly 13. In
               ancient times they said my number
               was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?

                              LOGAN
               No - Look, I'm in a hurry.

                              HOLLY
               Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman.

Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and
sit down next to an attractive WOMAN.

                              WOMAN CUSTOMER 
               Is this your first time?

Logan and Jessica nod.

                              WOMAN CUSTOMER (smiling) 
               This is my third...
                         (a beat) 
               ... I did it when I turned yellow ...
               and green.
                         (showing her palm) 
               I turned red yesterday.

                              LOGAN (looking) 
               Beautiful work. This man do them all?

                              WOMAN CUSTOMER 
               No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you 
               seen any of his work?

                              LOGAN     
               Just one. 
          
                              HOLLY
               Doc's ready, Sandman.
     
Logan and Jessica stand. They follow Holly into a large, shining,
stainless steel room where we see:
     
143          MED. ANGLE - DOC

who looks about twenty-one years old, exchanges a pointed look with
Jessica. 
     
                              DOC
               It's a real privilege, Sandman.

                              LOGAN
               Thanks.
                         (slightest beat)
               I thought you'd be older. I ex-
               pected a Red.

                              DOC (showing his palm;
                         the flower crystal is Red)
               I am.

                              LOGAN
               Your own work?

                              DOC (with pride)
               And I did it myself right on there.

144          FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUS

Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.

The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.

At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the     
operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician
demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides.
     
                              DOC
               I designed it myself.
                         (slightest beat)
               What'll it be ...a face job or
               a full-body job?

                              LOGAN 
               Just the face.

                              DOC 
               Fine....Holly will get you ready. 
               You're in good hands, believe me.

Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.

As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:

                              DOC 
               Holly works here because she gets a 
               lift out of watching the Table...
                         (smiles)
               and other things. I'll be back in a 
               minute.

                              HOLLY
               He's going to sterilize himself.

                              LOGAN  
               Do I have to undress?

                              HOLLY 
               Not for your face.

Logan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Doc
who speaks to her with soft urgency).

                              DOC     
               You shouldn't have brought him here.     

                              JESSICA;
               I didn't bring him -- what's
               the difference. He's blinking.
               He wants to run.
          
                              DOC
               Run!? He's a Sandman.

                              JESSICA
               I tell you he's running. I know.
          
                              DOC
               Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd
               gone somewhere else.
                         (a beat, a shrug)
               All right. He gets a face.
          
144X1          THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY

Logan lies down.

The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning
him.

                              HOLLY
                         (leaning - close to 
                         Logan) 
               I like dark hair. Have him give you 
               dark hair.

                              DOC'S VOICE          
               All set?               
               
                              HOLLY
               Um huh. Would you take a picture
               of him, Doc? I'd like you to give
               his face to somebody else.

                              DOC 
               Why not?

Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH.

                              DOC
               Do you have anything special in mind?

                              LOGAN
               I don't care...Just get it over
               with.

                              DOC (smiling) 
               Hurry...hurry...hurry.

                              HOLLY (whispering) 
               Dark hair.

                              LOGAN
               Holly'd like dark hair.
               
                              DOC
               Holly'd like a lot of things.
                         (studying Logan's face)
               We can start by narrowing the
               cheekbones.
               
Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing
next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.

CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces
and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.

A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.

SOUND: An insistent chiming.

Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's
been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like
apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The
table and the laser heads stop moving.          
                         
                              DOC 
                         (as if speaking on a phone)
               Hello
                         (listening)
               Yes
                         (listening)
               Yes, they are.
                         (listening; his expression
                         changing)
               Done.

Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,
then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look
registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine
again...

                              DOC
               Pay attention, Sandman. I'm
               proud of this machine.

As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logan's face. It pauses as

                              DOC
               With this one there's no waiting
               for scar burnishing. It's all in
               one...watch now...

The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a
bright trail of blood as

                              DOC 
               But here's the improvement. Instant 
               healing---before you feel a thing. 
               Watch now...

Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,
spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole.

144X2          THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN      

His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright
face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's
happening.

144X3          BACK TO DOC 

who is playing the console as he speaks.

                              DOC               
               Perfect depth adjustment on this               
               one, Sandman. The beam will cut     
               through that uniform and just
               exactly through the skin beneath--
               absolute precision. Watch now
     
And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a
seam of blood following the rip.

                              DOC
               Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms,
               Sandman, but otherwise it does
               everything, doesn't it? Just
               imagine what would happen to you
               if the healing stopped functioning.
          
And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into
Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.
          
Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.

                              HOLLY
               No! You're scrambling the table.
               He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
     
                              DOC
               Damn right! It was a trap. They
               know!
     
                              LOGAN
               No - I'm Running!

Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY.

Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with
her as:

145-145X4          INTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN 

Moving.

HOLLY

Watching two stun beams lower.

Doc knocks Jessica down. She is groggy on the floor as

The stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks.

The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.

146-148          QUICK CUTS OF DOC AND HOLLY     

Watching intently as:
     
149-150          CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist
leaving two threads of blood.  A vacu-head dips to suck the blood
away neatly.

151          ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

As Logan desperately sucks in his belly....trying to flatten himself
into the Table.

152-153     CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healing
liquid on the cuts.
     
154          CLOSE - ON HOLLY

Excited....flushed....as:

155          CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As two wide blades of light sweep downward....and hover three inches
above his neck....and keep lowering ....HUMMING loudly....and one
inadvertently frees Logan's right arm.

156          CLOSE ON - DOC

Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun.

157          CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM.

As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan....he twists away....and
breaks off....jumping off the Table.

Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy.     

In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away....and as Logan looks
down at it....we see it lying on the floor completely frozen.

Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick
menacing in his hand.

                              LOGAN (out-of-breath)
               What I told you is the....

Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan...missing him as Logan ducks away.

As Doc turns to attack....Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chest
and Doc falls back onto the Table.

157X1     CLOSE ON - HOLLY

SCREAMING, as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks
and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and
various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces. Holly tries to
fight her way into the mess to help Doc, but Jessica, recovering,
pulls her down and the two struggle.

157X2     CLOSE ON - DOC

In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.

157X3     LOGAN

Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing
buttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from
Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance.
Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:

158-
162XI      OUT

163          FRANCIS

Entering...gun in hand.

164          REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As they face Francis.

165          FULL ANGLE - FRANCIS LOGAN AND JESSICA

                              FRANCIS (frowning)
               What's going on, Logan?!

                              LOGAN
               It has nothing to do with you.

                              FRANCIS 
                         (choking but still loyal)
               What are you talking about?! I saw you 
               let a Runner go? 
                         (up a notch)
               I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!

Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke
and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Logan
jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, he
and Jessica run out.

166           OUT

166X1          FRANCIS

Enraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off a
shot at them as they disappear. Then leaping to his feet, dashing
off in pursuit.

167          ARCADE TRACKING     

Logan and Jessica running through Arcade.
     
167X1     LOGAN AND JESSICA     

Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.

                              JESSICA
               Follow me, Logan. Stay close.

As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind...
spots them and follows.

168-
173           OUT

174          EXT. - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward
and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the
Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop.

175          INT. - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
     
As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with
sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when
booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an
orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random
flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and
stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings
and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and
laughing:

                              WANTON
               I have an empty one, Sandman

Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to
see a man almost carrying her off.  Then the light is gone again and
Jessica with it.

176          LOGAN AND THE WANTON     

As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to
pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go
and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica.

177-
179          SERIES OF SHOTS

Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off.

INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold
and multiform -- everybody doing it.

180          ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing
Wantons.

181-182     LOGAN, JESSICA

Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.

183          FRANCIS

Hunting both.

184          WITH LOGAN

As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees
it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple
mirrors enclose them.

Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and
Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides
shut again.
               
185          FRANCIS

Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and
Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down
again as the orgy continues.

186-
186X1      OUT

186X2     INT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY     

After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in
the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the
wall.

                              LOGAN
               Are you taking me to them?

                              JESSICA 
               Yes.
                         (beat)
               I don't know what else to do -- with
               him following us.
                         (she hesitates) 
               Why do you keep running from your--

                              LOGAN
               Because he's my friend -
                         (a beat) 
               and I don't want to be killed by him - 
               or anyone.

                              JESSICA 
               He's good, isn't he?

                              LOGAN
               Will he find us and kill us?
               Yes...or one of the others.
                         (a beat) 
               You know there's only one place 
               to go now...

                               JESSICA (hopelessly) 
               They won't believe us.

                              LOGAN     
                         (beat)          
               I'd rather take my chances with
               them...than with Francis.

                              JESSICA
               They won¹t listen.
               
                              LOGAN (interrupting)
               You think Sandmen will?
                         (before she can answer)
               There's no other way for me,

                              JESSICA 
               We'll convince them.

They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she
turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off.

                              JESSICA 
               Yes, Logan.
                         (turning to him blindly)
               I'm glad they didn't change your
               face.
     
Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They
continue down into the darkness.
     
Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their
footsteps are heard.

187           OUT
          
187X1     FRANCIS
     
At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows
they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away
as he searches.

188-200      OUT

200X1     WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA     

They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines
wetly in the darkness.

                              JESSICA (softly) 
               Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.
                         (they walk) 
               Now to the right. It's narrow here, 
               you'll have to get behind me.

                              LOGAN (whispering) 
               How will they know we're coming?

                              JESSICA (whispering)     
               They're watching us now. They'll     
               let us in when they're sure.     

200X2     CLOSE-UP - LOGAN'S HAND (INSERT)
               
As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a
signal.

200X3     INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. READY ROOM

As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly
into action.

200X4     LOGAN AND JESSICA     

Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly
heard:

                              VOICE (scratchy, 
                         filtered) 
               Sandman, put your hands on your head. 
                         (he does)
               Clasp your fingers together. Now turn 
               your hands over. Palms up. 
                         (beat) 
               In a moment a light will shine in your 
               eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, 
               then you, Sandman. You will have to 
               stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. 
               Do you agree?

Logan nods.

Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the
dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow
rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves
forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends
awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.

201          LOGAN, JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQ

As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the
side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned
helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden
appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan
is unable to draw his gun.

                              VOICE
               Hold still, Sandman, or die where
               you are.

                              2ND VOICE
               Is she the one?
     
                              OTHER VOICES (like angry
                         stage whispers)
               She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both.
               Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher.
               Sandman murderer.

Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their
heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off.

202-204      OUT

205          INT. - SANCTUARY HQ. - LOGAN, JESSICA - CLOSE     

In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all
around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points,
steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn.
Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.

                              LOGAN 
               I'm a runner. She brought me here because 
               I begged her to help me.

He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the
darkness.

At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.

                              VOICE
               He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.

                              2ND VOICE
               You don't run. You kill runners.
               You have killed runners all your life.     -

                              LOGAN     
               Yes I have.          
                         (beat)     
               Now it's my turn. And I want to
               live.

Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly:

                              JESSICA (shouting) 
               What's the matter with you. He's a runner--
               he's blinking. We must help anyone who 
               asks...we must-or we're the same as they 
               are--deciding who lives and dies.

One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce
burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.

206          LOGAN     

Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and
pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer,
shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He
subsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now".

Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a
CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor.
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the
chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in
front against the glare. It's Holly.

                              HOLLY 
               Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. 
               Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...

                              VOICE (gentle)
               Holly--Holly. Remember the code.
               The code, please Holly...

                              HOLLY (hysteria)     
               They smashed everything and I barely
               got away.
                         (beat)
               Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7.
               Holly. Holly...

She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the
bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side
and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.

She reacts with fear at the sight.     
               
                              HOLLY     
               It's him! The first Sandman. He
               killed...Doc.

                              JESSICA
               No, Holly--wait! He's running.
               Tell them the rest!
     
                              HOLLY (suddenly
                         exhausted)
               He's the one. You too. I remember.
               He was in a hurry. Just a face job.
               Dark hair, I said. Then he killed
               Doc and you grabbed me--and the
               machine blew up and I ran...I ran
     
                               JESSICA
               Holly. Holly! Please...The other
               Sandman. Remember the one who came
               after--

Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.

                              HOLLY (pouring 
                         it out) 
               That's right. The other one came after. 
               The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!

                              JESSICA (coaching
                         desperately) 
               ...and he was hunting the first one, 
               this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This 
               one was running, the other one was 
               hunting him...

                              HOLLY (remembers)
               Yes. Oh yes.
                         (to Logan) 
               He was after you. I remember. You're 
               running!

207-208      OUT

208X1     ANOTHER ANGLE 1

The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but
shaken, wary.

                              LOGAN 
               May we move?

A long beat. Then--

                              VOICE
               I saw we pass them through.               
               Somebody help Holly.     

Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room,
hands reaching out to help her.

                              VOICE 
               You two. Just go straight ahead. 
               Follow the corridors with the pipes 
               overhead to the end. Then use the key.

As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's
obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan
pauses.

                              LOGAN
               I don't know who you are. I'd
               like to thank someone.

                              VOICE 
               It doesn't matter who we are. Follow 
               the tunnel to the end.

                              LOGAN
               I Will there be someone to tell us
               where to go from there...?

A murmur of discussion then:

                              VOICE 
               Someone will follow. When you come to 
               the lock, he will tell you how Co go 
               on the other side. Jessica may go with 
               you as far as the lock.

                              LOGAN 
                         (a deep breath) 
               No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. 
                         (suddenly his tone is 
                         urgent as he speaks to her) 
               Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

She is bewildered by the change.

                              JESSICA
               Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.

                              VOICE1
               Only to the lock. After that 
               there's no way back. 

                              JESSICA (small voice) 
               I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. 
               With you.

A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible"...She ignores, watches Logan.
               
                              JESSICA (cont'd)
               Will you take me with you?

                              LOGAN
               Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
               
JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.

Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand,
moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He
wheels, pulling her with him.
               
                              LOGAN
               Come on then--they'll be here any
               minute!

Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,
led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.
               
Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING,
RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage
of the room.

209           OUT

209X1     LOGAN AND JESSICA      

As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in
the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They
watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The
Sandman is smashed away, burning.

209X2     LOGAN 

Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his
crystal can be seen from the room.

210          ANOTHER ANGLE

Francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching,
stopping as he sees

211          FRANCIS P.O.V.
     
The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.

                              FRANCIS 
                         (believing the     
                         blinking crystal is Jessica's)     
               Logan. I know you're in here. 
                What've you done...gone crazy over a 
               Runner?
                         (whispering) 
               Nobody knows except me. You know I 
               won't say anything. I should have 
               turned you in but I couldn't. Leave 
               her. Come on out with me. It'll look 
               like you're part of the group that 
               hit this nest.
                         (pleading) 
               Logan...you're a Sandman!
                         (slightest beat)
               Logan...now...now...Logan...

After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great
chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.

212          LOGAN AND JESSICA

As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads
her off down the tunnel.

213          WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL

following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but
always down.

214          ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK
     
As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch.

The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door 
tands in a couple of inches of water.
     
With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan
gives the wheel a tug...nothing.

SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a
RECORDED VOICE.

                              VOICE     
               Runner, this is the last gate. Use               
               your key now. When the Bell sounds               
               again...use your key. Good luck,
               Runner. May you find Sanctuary.

SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds. Then it stops     and the light goes out.

214X1     LOGAN AND JESSICA     

Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:
     
214X2     ANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.

Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING

215-216     CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.

                              JESSICA (breathlessly) 
               Every key only works once...and only 
               a Lastday key must open this door.... 
               They said it would fit - but....

She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the
dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.
Then Logan remembers.

                              LOGAN 
               Wait - I have the one I took from 
               the Runner.

SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runner's ankh.

Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.

As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the
distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.

As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens.

There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.

As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:

                              JESSICA
               There's no turning back, is there?

Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...
as the door closes and they are:

217          ON THE OTHER SIDE     

now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.

Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.

In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.

Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.

217X1     WITH FRANCIS     

As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.

But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing
     
128          LOGAN AND JESSICA     

Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.

(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)

219-224     WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS     

A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.

B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in
while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.     

C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.

                              JESSICA
               How do we know this is the right
               way?

                              LOGAN
               It's the only way.
               
D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a half
turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.

E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's
fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.

F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...
HABITAT MARITIME...ETC.

They speculate.

                              JESSICA
               What do you suppose this was...?

                              LOGAN
               Some kind of breeding pens...I
               suppose...They say people used
               to breed animal s, fish, anything
                         (at her disbelieving look)
               To eat, of course.
               
                              JESSICA
               Ycch.
                         (shudders)
               To kill things and then eat them.
               It must have been a savage world.
               
Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too.
               
G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small
inspection vessel and suddenly hear:

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.

225          POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT     

moving, hunting.

                              LOGAN (alert)     
               Stay here, while I see what it is.     

Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a
moment he's back. His face - is grim.

                              JESSICA
               It's Francis, isn't it?

He nods.

226          LOGAN AND JESSICA

Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly
seeming small and distant.

As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,
suddenly:

227          FRANCIS

looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.

228          LOGAN AND JESSICA     

Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion,
somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient
machinery GROANS.
          
They turn and run as they HEAR:
     
                              FRANCIS (distorted;
                         echo; etcetera)
               LOGAN N N N.
          
229          POV - FRANCIS' LIGHT

is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:

THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan
heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed.

230          CLOSE - ON FRANCIS

aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights.

231          LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS 

Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.

232          INT. - THE SHAFT      

A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes.
          
Logan slumps to the floor.

233          INT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -
flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white
color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.

In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is
seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to
move.

                              JESSICA (whispering) 
               I'm afraid.

                              LOGAN     
               It's brighter there...besides, we
               can't go back.

He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.

                              JESSICA 
               Wait.

He halts.

                              JESSICA (cont'd)     
               I don't know what's going to happen     
               to us Logan but --     
                         (a beat)
               Are you glad you didn't kill him?

                              LOGAN 
               It doesn't make any difference anymore.

                              JESSICA 
               You're really one of us now, aren't you?

                              LOGAN 
               You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?
                         (Jessica nods)
               Why did you stay with me?

                              JESSICA (feelingly) 
               I wanted to...
                    (Logan puts his arms
                    around her) 
               ...And you...what made you kill Sandmen?

                              LOGAN
               I had to. I did kill...for the
               first time in my life I killed.

                              JESSICA 
               Because you felt like a Runner, 
               didn't you.

                              LOGAN 
               I guess so...I know I felt something 
               I never felt before...and I didn't 
               like it...not a bit.
                         (after another long beat) 
               I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary 
               better be worth it. That's the last 
               place for me to live now.

                              JESSICA 
               For us.

Logan mouths "Us"...a strange word...and why not... in the last
minutes he has done strange things.

234-236      OUT
          
236x1     INT. - ICE CAVERN

Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side
and revealing for the first time where they are.

236x2     ANGLE

Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless
row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and
contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the
side, a bright light.
          
236x3     LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walk toward the light.

236x4     WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with
extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a
tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds.

236x5     ANOTHER ANGLE

As they look in wonder:

                              VOICE
               Overwhelming, isn't it?

Logan and Jessica turn and see:

237-238     OUT

239          FULL ANGLE - BOX     

Box is half-man...half-metal.

From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables.
One hand is a cutting tool. His head is half-flesh...half-metal. his
legs are a chrome pedestal.

                              BOX          
               Are you too startled? Am I too     
               removed from your ken?     
                         (slightest beat)
               I'm neither machine nor man...but
               a perfect fusion of the two...and
               better than either.
                         (with great pride)
               No human sculptor could match this
               greatness...don't you agree?

                              LOGAN
               All right - what are you?
     
                              BOX (laughs)
               Your turn.
     
                              JESSICA
               It's incredibly beautiful.

                              BOX     
               Ah, but wait for the winds. Then     
               my birds sing. My walrus breathes.     
               My palace chimes and bells. And the
               deep grottoes whisper my name...Box
               Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...

                              LOGAN (after a beat)
               We're hungry     do you have anything
               to eat?
     
                              BOX
               Anything to eat?

Box starts to laugh...He is roaring with laughter as:

                              JESSICA (quietly)
               We're human and we're hungry.

                              BOX (still laughing) 
               I know...I know.

                              LOGAN
               This place is a link to Sanctuary,
               isn't it?

Box looks totally confused.

                              LOGAN (angrily) 
               How do you think we got here??!!

                              BOX
               You walked in. I saw you. Don't
               you remember?

Logan contains his anger.

                              LOGAN (beginning 
                         again; quietly) 
               Where do you think we came from?

                              BOX 
               From? From? From?

                              LOGAN     
               We were sent here and you know it.
               Others have been sent here. Where
               are they? Hiding?
     
Box looks around the cavern:
     
                              BOX (mischievously)
               Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.

                              LOGAN
               Where do we go?!     
                         (up a notch)               
               Where do we go from here??!!

We hear a NOISE outside.

                              BOX 
               Is that the wind?
                         (smiling)
               Not yet...
                         (slightest beat) 
               You must hear my birds sing.

                              LOGAN 
               You know about Sanctuary! I know 
               you do! You have to help us! You 
               don't have a choice! It isn't your 
               decision!! Tell us.

                              BOX
               Never a pair. I have never had a
               pair.

                              LOGAN
               Where do you send them?

                              BOX
               You're a beautiful pair.

                              JESSICA 
               Please.

                              BOX 
               I've never seen humans whom I thought 
               worthy of being here...
                         (a beat) 
               I'd like to sculpt you.
                         (looking around) 
               Where would I put you?
                         (smiling) 
               I know...you'd be the base of the 
               column. You'd hold up my world!

                              LOGAN (exasperated) 
               Answer the question!

                              BOX 
               Do you know how long all this will 
               last? Not thirty years...or thirty 
               thousand years...but thirty thousand 
               thousand years...and you'll be part 
               of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And 
               you'll be here...the two of you... 
               eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.

                              LOGAN (to Jessica)     
               There must be somebody else up here.     
               I can't believe that he's--     

                              BOX (interrupting;
                         his voice tone changing;
                         very lucid)
               Let me sculpt you and I will show
               you where the others have gone.
     
                              LOGAN
               That's better.
                         (slightest beat)
               How do you want us?

                              BOX
               Nude. Imagine, a pair.

                              LOGAN (starting to 
                         take off his clothes; 
                         as Jessica hesitates, 
                         Logan smiles)
               It'll be all right...

240-241     JESSICA 

Undresses.

Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs.

                              BOX
               Up there.

Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal. As they stand there:

                              LOGAN
               How do you want us?

                              BOX (beat)
               Up there.

Logan looks at Jessica. Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight.

Logan takes Jessica into his arms.

                              BOX
               Enchanting. Is that what humans do?

By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to
Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings.

                              BOX'S VOICE     
               Superb!     

242          ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the
huge column supporting the cavern.

As he works furiously...at Incredible speed:


243          LOGAN AND JESSICA

...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue
to hold one another.

244-245     OUT

246          CLOSE - ON BOX

                              BOX (stepping back) 
               Done...behold...!

247          REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and
passionately.

Their mood is broken by:

                              BOX'S VOICE
               Done...Done...Done...

Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see:

248          FULL ANGLE - THE ICE SCULPTURE

Box has captured them perfectly...shimmering with life...filled with
emotion.

249          WIDE ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX

There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.

                              JESSICA (squeezing     
                         Logan's hand)     
               It's glorious 

Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.

                              LOGAN
               All right. Now you keep your
               bargain.

                              BOX (rapt by his
                         work) 
               Wait for the wind! Wait and hear
               the birds sing over you!

                              LOGAN (only interested
                         in getting out)
               We're ready.

Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice
Cavern.

250          INT. - ICE ROOM

As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica.

This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide.

It stretches back as far as the eye can see.

The ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right
wall is perfectly clear.

And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are:

251          WIDE ANGLE - MEN AND WOMEN

Standing in erect positions.

At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works
of sculpture.

But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear
ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been
frozen.

252          CLOSE ON LOGAN AND JESSICA

Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.

253          ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN FROZEN     
          IN THE WALL

We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm
of their right hands.
     
Logan walks to the end of this wall. Each frozen body has a number
above it. The final body's number is 1056...That number which the
voice in Sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing
Runners.

The CAMERA PANS Logan back to Box.

254          ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As Logan turns toward him.

                              LOGAN (stupefied) 
               How did they get in here?

                              BOX
               Regular storage procedure...the
               same as the other food... The
               other food stopped coming and they
               started.
     
                              LOGAN
               What other food?

                              BOX
               Fish and plankton, sea greens and
               protein from the sea.
                         (pointing to the frosted
                         ice wall)
               It's all here - ready - fresh as
               harvest day. Fish and plankton,               
               sea greens and protein from the
               sea...And then it stopped coming
               and they (gesture) came instead.
               So I store them here. I'm ready.
               And you're ready. It's my Job -
               protein, plankton, grass from the
               sea

Logan pulls out his gun.

                              LOGAN     
               Tell us how to get out...or I¹ll     
               destroy you..I'll kill you!

Box laughs...The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier.  Then:

                              BOX (calmly)
               Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand
               you facing one another.
          
Box starts his saw hand BUZZING.  He turns all the flesh parts of
his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica
who is now standing behind Logan.

Box is now like an armed vehicle.

Logan FIRES...the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame.

                              BOX (advancing)
               Resign yourself.

255          MED. ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.

As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of
this room and:

256          REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Advancing

We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice.
A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.

257          TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:

258          REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Relentlessly moving toward them.

259          TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.

Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving
his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or
button which might open it.

The entire time he never takes his eyes off:

260          REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY.

                              BOX (chilling tone) 
               I make such a small, quick incision ...
               you can hardly feel it.

261          REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above
them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.

262          FULL ANGLE - LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX
     
Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his
WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down
alongside her.

Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice
out of the rear wall as:

Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to
penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but
hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.

There is an EXPLOSION.

                              BOX (looking up; 
                         screaming) 
               No! The coils!

Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern
containing his sculptures.

                              BOX (still screaming)     
               All my work!' All my work!!     

As Logan and Jessica stand:

263-270     OUT
               
270x1     ANGLE - THE REFRIGERANT COILS

Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases.

270x2     LOGAN

Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and
walls.

270x3     ANOTHER ANGLE     
          
Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern.
               
270x4     ANOTHER ANGLE     
     
Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over.
               
270x5     FULL SHOT     

AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing
over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing.

270x6     BOX

Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and
flicker out.

270X7     ANGLE

The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again
and again like great spears and wedges 

270X8     BOX
     
Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring
ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.
     
270X9     LOGAN AND JESSICA
 
Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by
Being in an angle of the cave.

270X10     FULL SHOT     
     
The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence.
Then:

SOUND: Ice melting, water running.

270X11     LOGAN AND JESSICA

Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.

SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into
the water.

As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and
see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by
the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.

Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.

271-272     OUT

273          EXT. - HIGH LEDGE

Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt.

They are blinded by:

274          SUNSHINE: A HUGE RISING SUN     

As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the
dazzling light will not go away:

Standing together...in fear of the sunrise.

                              JESSICA           
               Is there something on fire!!      

Logan shakes his head...he doesn't know.

As Logan looks up at the sun.
               
                              LOGAN
               It seems to be moving away.
               Come on...

274X1     ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.

274X2     LOWER - AN AREA OF BOULDERS     

Suddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing.

                              JESSICA (frightened) 
               What's that?

                              LOGAN 
               It feels like breath. It makes 
               everything move. Your hair is moving.

                              JESSICA (smiling) 
               And yours.

They reach the level below and pause, look around.

                              LOGAN
               Jessica -- we must be outside!

She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they
set out again.

275-276     OUT

276X1     INT. - CAVE - CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled.

277-287X1     
OUT

288          EXT . - FOREST AREA

As Logan and Jessica reach it.

They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then
continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched,
etcetera.

A swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off:

                              JESSICA (starting to panic)
               I hate outside! I hate it!

                              LOGAN (holding her; 
                         comforting tone)
               We'll be all right...
                         (a beat)
               We will...

The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in
the grass...startling them for a moment.
          
288XA1     FRANCIS
Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the
unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica
did.
          
288XB1     WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA

They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them
and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca
grabs hold of his hand.

                              JESSICA
               Don't!

                              LOGAN
               Sooner or later, we'll have to try
               something

Logan eats the berries...as Jessica watches intently.

After a beat

                              LOGAN
               They're good.

Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat. When they are finished: 

                              JESSICA
               It's getting dark and cold.     
               I'm tired.          

                              LOGAN 
               Why don't we rest here? We know we can 
               eat these.

They sit on the ground.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

288X1     TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA - NIGHT     

Sitting on the ground.

Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep
her warm. 

                              JESSICA 
               Where do you think that heat-ball went?

Logan shrugs.

                              JESSICA
               Do you think everything's going to
               turn to ice?

                              LOGAN
                I doubt it.
     
                              JESSICA
               Don't ever let go.

                              LOGAN
               I won't.
     
After a long beat:

                              LOGAN
               It all seemed to make sense until
               Box.

                              JESSICA
               Do you think he was telling the
               Truth?

Logan shrugs.

                              JESSICA (trying to 
                         convince herself) 
               Maybe we're the first ones to get 
               through... 
                         (hopeful tone) 
               Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... 
               another protected place. It couldn't 
               be outside.

                              LOGAN (grunts) 
               How would anyone know? Even if we find 
               it -- we can never go back.

At her stricken look...Logan touches her in a caring way.

                              LOGAN
               You're right...it must be near
               now. We'll find it.

                              JESSICA (yawning;          
                         closing her eyes; resting     
                         on his shoulder)     
               Thirty thousand years didn't last
               very long, did they?
     
288X2     EXT. - BARREN TERRAIN - NIGHT - FRANCIS
     
Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun
drawn.

Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.

Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun...blasting
the rabbit to smithereens.

He is breathing hard (fear)...and looking around...gun in hand.

288X3     EXT. - FOREST AREA - DAY - LOGAN AND JESSICA

walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.

288X4     EXT. - FOREST AREA - FRANCIS

His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very
cautiously.

He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the
ground.

He picks a few off the bush...is ravenous...but finally...too
frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any.

As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand... then wipes his hand
on his trousers:

288X5     EXT. - FOREST AREA - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.

288X6-
288X8     TRACKING SHOTS WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Reaching...

289          FULL ANGLE - A BROOK

They rush to it...drink...then undress...swim...and as they embrace
in the water:

                              JESSICA
               Logan!!!Look!!
                         (Logan turns around)
               No...your palm...look!!!      

Logan looks at his palm...the blinking crystal is clear.

He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm... the same.

                              JESSICA (quietly)
               What does it mean?
     
                              LOGAN (trying to
                         assimilate its meaning
                         himself)
               The Lifeclocks have no power outside. 

Jessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it.

                              JESSICA (with laughter)
               You can have any woman in the city.
               What do you really want?

                              LOGAN (straight)
               You know, Jessica.

                              JESSICA. (a beat)
               ...But I still have the choice...?

                              LOGAN
               Of course.

                              JESSICA
               Then the answer's Yes...

They embrace there in the water...
               
290           OUT

291          HIGH ANGLE - SHOOTING DOWN - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Coming out of the forest...climbing up a green hilly area...reaching
the top and seeing:

292-301     OUT

The monument rising up out of a tangle of forest -- other buildings
gleaming, half hidden.  In the foreground Logan and Jessica walk
toward monument.

301X2     WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA     

Walking toward CAMERA to edge of swamp they stop and look at:

Looking up at statue.

                              LOGAN 
               I have never seen a face like that 
               before. It must be the look of great 
               age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.

                              JESSICA (beat) 
               Yes, do you think that's why he looks 
               so sad---?

Logan shrugs. They turn, start to EXIT from memorial.

301X11     INT. - MEMORIAL - HIGH ANGLE OVER STATUE'S BACK

301X16     CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA     

As they pass the stones, Logan glances at them.

                              LOGAN
               They all have names and numbers
               on them. I wonder what they are?

                              JESSICA
               "Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife".
               What can all that mean?
          
Just then their attention is focused by a distant SOUND as of
SHOUTING -- a man's voice. Jessica stops.
          
                              JESSICA
               Francis?
          
Logan shakes his head. They EXIT cemetery toward capitol.

Logan and Jessica enter the ancient room. They stop and look around.

301X20     CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA     

SOUND: HAMMERING NOISE -- irregular. It stops after a bit.

They walk to the door and open it cautiously.

They EXIT right.

301X21     INT. - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SENATE

301X24     INT. - SENATE - OVER LOGAN AND JESSICA'S BACK - A WHITE
          HAIRED MAN OF S SIXTY-PLUS     

There are HUNDREDS OF CATS...and THOUSANDS OF BOOKS all over the
place.

                              JESSICA (frowning; 
                         whispering)
               Look at his face...and his hair... 
                         (grimacing)
               Is that what it is to grow old?

                              LOGAN (still stunned)
               It could be...

There are a COUPLE OF CATS on the man's lap as he turns and faces
Logan and Jessica...when he HEARS them move closer.

The man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance
of Logan and Jessica.

                              LOGAN
               How old are you?          

                              MAN
               As old as I am I suppose...who
               knows ?

                              LOGAN 
               Your hair is white.

                              MAN          
               It wasn't always. I remember when          
               it wasn't. But it wasn't your     
               color either.
                         (looking at Jessica) 
               ...or yours. I have my color somewhere.

                              JESSICA
               Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?

                              MAN 
               Oh, no...

                              JESSICA 
               Could I touch them?

                              MAN
               Oh, my...please try.

Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face.

                              JESSICA 
               What's your name?

                              MAN
               I've forgotten. It's been so
               long since I've used it.
     
Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come
upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake.
     
                              MAN
               But all of my cats have names.
     
                              LOGAN
               Is that what they're called--
               cats?

                              OLD MAN
               Yes, cats, of course. What else
               could they be? Cats. Of course
               each one has his own name too.
     
                              JESSICA
               But there are so many of them.
               Do you know each one separately.
          
                              OLD MAN
               Yes indeed, everyone. Actually,
               they all have three.
                         (reciting)
               "The naming of cats is a difficult
               matter. It isn't just one of your
               holiday games. You may think at     
               first I'm mad as a hatter when I     
               tell you a cat must have THREE
               DIFFERENT NAMES."
                         (a beat)
               An ordinary name and a fancy name.
               That's two. Do you want to guess
               what the third one is?
          
Logan and Jessica are silent.

                              OLD MAN (reciting again)     
               "But above and beyond there's     
               still one name left over,     
               And that is the name that you
               never will guess;
               The name that no human research
               can discover -- -
               But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and
               will never confess."
                         (reaching down and
                         stroking another cat)
               Will you, my pet?
          
One of the cats jumps off his lap.

                              OLD MAN (reciting)
               "Why did you go little fourpaws?
               You forgot to shut your big eyes."
                         (the man closes his
                         eyes for a moment; then:)
               "I have a Gumble Cat in mind!"
          
As the man opens his eyes:
     
                              LOGAN
               How long have you been living
               here?
     
                              OLD MAN
               For as long as I can remember.
     
                              LOGAN
               What kind of place is this?
     
                              OLD MAN
               Just a place, I suppose...who
               knows?

The man looks puzzled.

                              LOGAN
               How did you get here?

                              OLD MAN
               I have always been here...

                              LOGAN               
               Are there any other humans?     
     
                              OLD MAN
               Gracious...no.

                              LOGAN 
               Have any other people ever passed 
               through?

The man shakes his head...then:

                              OLD MAN 
               But there may be a few around somewhere.

                              LOGAN 
               What makes you think so?

                              OLD MAN 
               My parents thought so. Mother and 
               Father. You know?

                              LOGAN (astonished) 
               Mother and -- ? You knew your mother 
               and father?

The man nods.

                              JESSICA 
               And...and how were you grown? Inside
               your mother?

                              OLD MAN
               Yes...

                              JESSICA 
               Are you sure?

                              OLD MAN 
               Mother and Father said so... you know?

                              LOGAN 
               Where are they?

                              OLD MAN
               Dead...they're dead...and buried.

                              JESSICA (not knowing
                         what it is)
               Buried???

Logan wheels...as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING
SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider:

302          CLOSE ON A CAT

Coming through the opening - did he push it?

303          CLOSE ON THE MAN

                              OLD MAN (pleased; 
                         reciting) 
               "Gus is the cat at the theatre door. 
               His name, as I ought to have told 
               you before, Is really Asparagus. 
               That's such a fuss To pronounce, 
               that we usually call him just Gus."

306          WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN AND JESSICA     

                              OLD MAN
               May I see your hand again?

Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them,
looks from one to another with delight.
          
                              OLD MAN
               They're beautiful. May I have
               one too please?
          
                              LOGAN
               No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.
               
                              OLD MAN (offended)
               It isn't fair. I'll give you one
               of my favorite cats...a Jellicle
               cat.
                         (reciting)
               "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces,
               Jellicle cats have bright black eyes;
               They like to practice their airs and graces
               And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."


                              LOGAN     
               I'm sorry but I don't have anything to 
               give you.     
          
As the man continues to look petulant:

                              JESSICA (simply; 
                         sincerely)
               That's the truth.

Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man.

                              JESSICA
               Here you can have this.

The man seems pleased.
     
                              OLD MAN
               What kind of jewel is this?

                              JESSICA
               I don't know.
     
                              OLD MAN
               You're both full of secrets like
               Macavity.     
                         (looking at the ring)
               Did you steal this?
     
                              JESSICA
               No.
          
                              OLD MAN 
                         (reciting)
               "Macavity, Macavity, there's no
               one like Macavity,
               There never was a cat of such
               deceitfulness and suavity."
     
                              LOGAN
               What's beyond this place - do you
               know?
     
                              OLD MAN
               No, no, no
          
                              LOGAN
               Did your Mother or Father ever
               mention another place?
     
                              OLD MAN
               Never, never, ever. Nothing.

After a pause:

                              LOGAN     
               May we stay here for a while?     
               We'd like to rest.     

                              OLD MAN
               Of course you can stay. This
               belongs to the people.

                              JESSICA
               What belongs to the people?

                              OLD MAN
               All this. All of it.
          
                              JESSICA
               What people?
               
                              OLD MAN
               I don't know...but it does.

The man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining
room.

                              OLD MAN
               I'll be right back.
                         (stopping)
               Oh, yes...about the cats...
               one rule is true:
                         (reciting)
               "Don't speak till you are spoken to."
               
The man smiles and leaves.
          
305          LOGAN AND JESSICA      

Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down.

Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it.

Logan is deep in thought.

Jessica looks up from the book.

                              JESSICA (quietly)
               How curious people used to be --
               All these books...

Silence...until:

                              LOGAN
               That sweet madman -- how could he
               Come to exist?
     
                              JESSICA     
               He had a mother and father --     
               and he knew them.     

                              LOGAN
               One in a million, I suppose

                              LOGAN AND JESSICA (together; 
                         smiling) 
               ...Who knows? 

                              JESSICA (after a beat) 
               We're going on, aren't we?

                              LOGAN 
                         (shaking his head) 
               There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.

Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line:

                              JESSICA 
               There's a Sanctuary...there is!

                              LOGAN
               You want there to be one...that
               Doesn't...

                              JESSICA (interrupting; 
                         urgent tone) 
               There has to be! I know it exists! It 
               has to!!

                              LOGAN (gently) 
               No, there doesn't. Not really --just so 
               many want it to exist...so many who 
               don't want to die...want it so much 
               that a place called Sanctuary becomes 
               "real". But it doesn't exist. It never 
               existed. Just the hope.

                              JESSICA (becoming     
                         hysterical)
               You're wrong!! It has to be!!
               It Just has to be!!

As Logan takes her in his arms...comforting her:

306          FULL ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MAN

The man returns with a portrait in hand.

                              OLD MAN     
               Oh, my don't cry.

The man proudly shows them the portrait....which is a portrait of
himself in his twenties. He sort of brushes the hair...which is rich
auburn.

                              OLD MAN (gesturing) 
               There are larger pictures of other 
               people over there. I don't know who 
               they are. Perhaps they're family.

She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.

307          CLOSE ON - JESSICA     

Remaining near the podium. She is dejected. Logan's argument that
there is no Sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold.

308           OUT

308x1     THE CORNER - LOGAN AND THE OLD MAN

We see portraits of Presidents of the United States.

We can recognize all of them...with the exception of the dozen or so
that come after Ford.

As Logan looks at the portraits he recognizes Lincoln.

                              LOGAN 
               That's the same fellow who's outside. 
               If he was so important - why isn't he 
               first?

The old man shakes his head.

309          INT - SENATE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON - JESSICA     

As Francis suddenly appears alongside her.

Jessica is terrified...speechless. Francis glances across the
chamber, sees Logan. When he speaks, it is softly but urgently.

                              FRANCIS 
               What did you do to him?

Jessica is silent. Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual.

                              FRANCIS     
               Why? Why you?     
                         (grabbing her)     
               Do you know you ruined him? Do
               you know that? Can you tell me
               why? Why you?
                         (a beat)
               And now you've killed him, you
               know...

Francis starts to tear off her clothes...obviously to rape...but his
expression remains cold and without passion.

                              JESSICA (screaming) 
               Logan!!!

As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her
O.S.

310           OUT

310x1     LOGAN

hears the scream, wheels -- sees nothing for a moment.

311          INT. - SENATE CHAMBER

                              FRANCIS' VOICE 
               Here!!!!

Logan looks up...and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of
the first row of the gallery...with his gun pointing down at Logan,
holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.

                              OLD MAN (cheerfully) 
               How nice...more company...

                              FRANCIS (emotional; 
                         disjointed thoughts) 
               We had such good times together... 
               I let you go! 
                         (frenzied) 
               You didn't terminate a Runner and 
               I let you go!!
                         (a beat)
               She did this to us! How could you
               let her?! An ordinary available??!!
                         (with this he flings
                         Jessica down and away.
                         She lies there...stunned)
               And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8? 
                         (a tear in his eye)
               ....Why didn't you chink about them?!
                         (up a notch)
               There's over two hundred years of
               Sandmen's blood in you, Logan....
               and now you'll spill it for a
               stinking Runner!!

312          CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Holding up his right palm.

                              LOGAN 
               Look at your palm, Francis.... 
               look! It's clear. Clear!

313          REVERSE ANGLE - FRANCIS

Looking at his palm....shocked...dropping his gun. It falls on the
CHAMBER FLOOR.

                              FRANCIS 
               Why did you do that??!!

                              LOGAN
               I didn't do anything, Francis!
               They've made us believe that....

                              FRANCIS (interrupting; 
                         wild) 
               Why did you do that???!!!

Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan.

314          WIDE ANGLE - CATS

Scattering in all directions as:

315-319     CLOSE ACTION SHOTS - FRANCIS AND LOGAN

In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling

320          INTERCUT WITH: JESSICA AND THE MAN REACTING

Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and
Francis were putting on a show for him.

321-331     THE FIGHT- SERIES OF SHOTS

A. Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan.

B. As Logan slumps to the floor and Francis cries to follow through
his advantage by crushing Logan's face with his foot:

C. Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it...sending Francis reeling
backward.

D. Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis...who
ducks.

E. Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has
sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it.

F. Francis moves toward Logan...with the menacing steel flagpole in
front of him.

G. Logan is wary...watching every movement of the steel pole.

H. Francis swings the steel pole twice...We can HEAR the WHISH-WHISH
as it cuts through the air...with Logan avoiding the blows.

I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and
swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest.

J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward.
Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment
as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on
Francis' head.

K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward
Logan...

Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding
death off with the strong grip.

                              FRANCIS (delirious)     
               That was the right shot--Look out     
               there, he's trying to break free          
               Watch it, Logan, steady, now!......

His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining
clear and white. Francis is suddenly radiant.

                              FRANCIS 
               Logan! You renewed!

And he is dead.     DIRECT CUT TO:
     
332          JESSICA AND THE MAN

The man walks over to Francis and bends down.

                              OLD MAN
               Oh, my...he died...

333          CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Rubbing his face with the palms of his hands...clearly upset.

334          ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING JESSICA AND THE MAN

                              OLD MAN
               We¹ll have to bury him.

                              JESSICA
               What¹s that?

                              OLD MAN
               They¹re put into the ground so
               they can be visited by the living...

Logan¹s eyes are glistening with tears.  The man starts out.

                              OLD MAN
               I¹ll make the arrangements.

                              JESSICA (softly)
               At least it¹s over...

Jessica¹s words don¹t help as Logan shakes his head...then:

                              OLD MAN
               Are you ready to put him in?
     
                              LOGAN
               Not yet.

                              OLD MAN
               All right.

The man sits down.

Gently, Logan lifts Francis¹ body...trying to straighten him out
from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the
floor.

After resting Francis¹ body on the floor again.  He cradles Francis¹
head in his arms.

339X3     INT. - SENATE - NEXT MORNING

On Logan sleeping - Jessica and Old Man in a spirited but soft
conversation in a far corner.

As Logan wakes he hears:

                              OLD MAN
               Of course...that's settled then.
               But just you remember your promise...

                              JESSICA 
               We'll remember. But that's a long time 
               off...

She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan
rises to her.

                              LOGAN 
               What are we promising him? What can we 
               possibly give him?

                              JESSICA 
               He asked if we would bury him when his 
               time comes.

                               LOGAN (beat)
               We can't. We're going back.

                              JESSICA 
               To what?

                              LOGAN          
               I'm going to try and tell people what 
               we've seen and--

                              JESSICA (interrupting) 
               You're lying! You'll never have the 
               chance to tell anybody anything! 
               You'll be killed the moment you're seen!

                              LOGAN 
               Do you expect me to let things go on 
               without trying to change them?!

                              JESSICA 
               Things won't change...you know that! 
               We can live here together, Logan...
               have a life as long as his... together!

                              LOGAN (showing his palm) 
               Things change!

                              JESSICA
               You want to go back to kill, is that it?! 
               Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill 
               Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!

Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical.

                              LOGAN (softly) 
               Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...
                         (as she quiets down)
               The Lifeclocks made me kill
               Francis. They make people die or
               be killed every day. If I didn't
               try and destroy that...I couldn't
               live here or anywhere. Do you
               understand?

                              JESSICA
               I want to be alive and with you,
               that's all I want.

Logan puts his arms around her.

                              LOGAN 
               I know...I know...

The Old Man comes to them, wondering.

                              LOGAN 
               We're leaving.

                               OLD MAN          
               What a pity. I was hoping you'd     
               be here to bury me.     

                              JESSICA 
               Come with us.

                              OLD MAN

                              OLD MAN 
               Alive?

Logan nods.

                              OLD MAN 
               Thousands and thousands...as many as 
               my cats?

                              LOGAN 
               More...many more.

                              OLD MAN 
               And all alive you say?

Logan nods.

                              OLD MAN
               Yes, I would like to see that. Is it 
               a long journey?

Again, Logan nods.

                              OLD MAN (mumbling) 
               Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...

340-349     OUT

350          HIGH ANGLE - GREENBELT AREA - SHOOTING DOWN - DAY

Logan, Jessica and the Old MAN are walking...with the Capitol
Building blurred by overgrown foliage receding in the b.g. of the
SHOT.     

351-361      OUT

361X1     EXT. - FOREST AREA - AFTERNOON

The Old Man has picked Some wild vegetables...and hands a piece to
Logan and a piece to Jessica.

As they hesitate...the Old Man bites into it... heartily. 

As Logan and Jessica start eating it, too:

                              OLD MAN (marveling tone) 
               Never see the sun or the moon... 
               I hope we get there soon...

361X1A     NIGHT - WOODED AREA - CLOSE     

On Logan, Jessica and the Old Man as they emerge from a small grove
of trees and stand looking O.S. past CAMERA Behind, a flicker of
firelight.

                              OLD MAN (weary but
                         enthusiastic)
               Is that really it? It doesn't
               seem very far. Will we be there
               soon?

                              LOGAN
               I promise. We '11 go on as soon
               as it's light.

                              JESSICA (gently, 
                         turning O.M. away) 
               But now I'm tired. Let's go back to 
               the fire...

They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.

P.O.V. WHAT THEY SEE (TO BE INTERCUT)

NIGHT (Matte) view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills.

361X1B     EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

As the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground.

                              OLD MAN 
               That's better than gold when it's cold.

                              LOGAN          
               Thank you.               
                         (turning to Old Man)     
               Tell me - what do those words mean?
               "Beloved husband²...²Beloved son"...
               "Beloved wife"'...

                              OLD MAN
               My father was the husband and my
               mother was the wife. "Beloved" is     
               a word they used - to stay together.

                              LOGAN 
               Stay? They lived together all their years?

                              OLD MAN 
               Oh, yes...I think...

                              JESSICA (reading; 
                         moved) 
               ³Beloved son²... 
                         (a beat) 
               So people stayed together for that 
               feeling of love... They would live and 
               raise children together and be remembered. 
                         (another beat) 
               I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we 
               be that way?

                              LOGAN (facing Jessica) 
               Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
                         (a beat)

                              JESSICA          
               And Sanctuary?          

                              LOGAN 
               Sanctuary is the right to live.... 
               nothing more. But nothing less, either....

There is a long beat...then Jessica snuggles up to Logan...she is
ready for sleep.

                              JESSICA (whispering)
               Beloved husband...

                              LOGAN (kissing her)
               Beloved wife...

361X2     OUT

361X3     EXT. - DAY - GREENBELT AREA - LOGAN, JESSICA AND
          THE OLD MAN
     
Walking.

361X4      OUT
     
361X5     EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT - LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN
     
As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.

The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.

362          LONG, LONG ANGLE - LOGAN JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN - DAY

Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the
scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.

363           OUT

364          LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN

Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They

HEAR: THE ROAR OF THE WATER

As they approach cautiously...they see:

365          WAVE POWER INLET

Waves pounding over ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION...
DESCENDING TO A VORTEX.

                              JESSICA
               What does that water do?

                              LOGAN
               It's part of the hydrogalvanic
               system. The ocean tides are changed
               into energy somehow.

                              JESSICA
               Is it inside the city?

                              LOGAN
               Of course.
                         (a beat)
               I don't know where...
                         (frowning)
               I Just took them for granted. 
                         (Logan takes Jessica's hand)
               It's our only chance.

The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE
STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:

366          FULL ANGLE - A POOL OF WATER

At the CENTER of this IMMENSE WATER FLOWING CONSTRUCTION OF STEPS.

After a beat Jessica looks at the Old Man:
          
                              LOGAN (softly)     
               I know...
                         (after a beat; to the
                         Old Man)
               We're going to try and get in this
               way. I don't think you can make it.

                              OLD MAN (sadly)
               Oh...I did so look forward to seeing
               all those people.

                              LOGAN
               I'm sorry.

                              OLD MAN
               Yes...

                              LOGAN
               Can you make it back?

                              OLD MAN
               Oh my...I'll try. 

                              JESSICA (kissing the Old Man)
               Goodbye.

                              OLD MAN
               Oh, my...

The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and
disappear.

367          THE OLD MAN

he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a
young child at a pond or lake.

368          INT. - POWER CENTER OF THE CITY - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Emerging from the water.

It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and
impulse collectors.

Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.

369-
369Xl      OUT

369AX2     GREAT HALL - AT CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

As the CROWD is pouring in:

                              LOGAN'S VOICE
               No!! Don't go in there !!

The CROWD turns and looks up at:

369X2     LOGAN

On a high balcony in the Great Hall.

Looking down at them.

                              LOGAN 
               You don't have to die!! No one has 
               to die at thirty!!! You don't have 
               to blink out on Lastday. There's no 
               renewal on Carrousel! You can live 
               longer and grow old... I've seen it.
               She's seen it!! Believe me!!

There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues:

                              LOGAN (holding up
                         his palm)
               See... it's' clear. The Lifeclocks
               are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!

369X3     WIDEN ANGLE - INCLUDING SANDMEN

Trying to grab Logan. There is a struggle. Some Sandmen are knocked
over the railing.

But remaining Sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues Logan
and Jessica.

The CROWD cheers...and continues into Carousel as:

370          INT. - SANDMAN DEBRIEFING AREA

It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to
find and destroy Sanctuary.

In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:
     
          PROBABILITY     
                    
blinks on and off.          

Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN.

We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the
b.g. of the SHOT.

Logan is placed on the chair in which his CRYSTAL was altered.

371          CLOSE ANGLE - LOGAN IN THE CHAIR

A shaft of light glows on and he stiffens - bound by it.

372           OUT

372X1-
372X3     FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE SCREEN

As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear
-- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these
heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.

As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads
answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.

373-378      OUT

378X1-
378X18     INTERCUT WITH CLOSER SHOTS OF LOGAN HIMSELF WRITHING IN
          AGONY AS THE IMPASSIVE HEADS SPEAK.

ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN AND HEADS

A.                               FIRST HEAD SPEAKS
                         (Logan's voice)
               A Jewelry store. 

B. Logan himself - twisting in pain.

C. The word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.

D.                              A SECOND HEAD
                         (Logan's voice)
               A creature called Box - all frozen, 
               all frozen.

E. Logan writhes in the chair.          
               
F. Again the word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.     

G.                               A THIRD IDENTICAL HEAD
                         (Logan's Voice)
               No...There is no Sanctuary.

H. The SCREEN seems to shimmer. It blinks.

I. A third time the word negative appears on the SCREEN.

J.                               A FOURTH HEAD 
                         (Logan's voice)
               There is no Sanctuary

K. The SCREEN'S glow increases...to an almost blinding light...
starting to frighten the Sandmen present.

L. At the same time, we see JESSICA coming out of her tranquilized
daze...fearful...still in the Sandmen's custody.

M.                              A FIFTH HEAD
                         (Logan's voice)
               An old man without a crystal...But
               there is no Sanctuary.

N. Now the SCREEN is starting to spark. Behind it we SEE the
intermittent glow of overheated electronic components.

O. And we see the word negative...once more on the SCREEN -- but
broken now.

P.                               A SIXTH HEAD 
                         (Logan's voice)
               There is no Sanctuary.

Q. Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking...and we
can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen.

R. On the SCREEN the word negative is beginning to shake...as the
SCREEN begins to shake.

379          FULL ANGLE - THE SIX HEADS

                              LOGAN'S VOICE (emanating
                          from all of them)
               There is no Sanctuary. There is
               no Sanctuary.

The sign PROBABILITY bursts...the SIX HEADS of Logan go out.      

The noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it
begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame.

380-410      OUT

410X1     ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a
puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time
to meet:

410X2     SANDMEN

Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in
on Logan One holding Jessica.

410X3     LOGAN AND SANDMEN
     
Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him
with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A
Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the
Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc.
Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks
which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and
discharges.

410X4     THE BATTLE

The electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion.
Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the
machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving.
Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet.
Crouched, they make for the exit.

410X5     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE. SCREEN     

Sputtering its life out in strange predictive words....PROBABILITY
flashing on and off.... EQUILIBRIUM...DESTRUCT...EQUIL...NO
BALANCE...NO BALANCE...FAMINE... INACCEPTABLE ...NO BALANCE...etc.,
flashing vainly through the eddying smoke and the fierce discharges
which fill the great room.

410X6     SANDMEN

The battle is lost -- the smoke and noise overwhelming. They pick up
their wounded and get out as best they can.

410X7     INT. SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY

Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of
fire behind them.

410X8     EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects. Pushing through
passers-by herding everyone away from the scene.

People getting the hell out of there.

Ad Libs: Get away from here. The whole thing's going.

410X9     INT. LIFECLOCK ROOM

Through the smoke, etc. The Lifeclocks EXPLODE.

410X10     EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

The building EXPLODES -- great geyser of flame shooting upward.

410X11     GREAT HALL

The sound of the explosion creates panic. Lights begin to flicker.
The great red crystal lights fitfully on and off. People are
panicking, running in different directions. Some pressing into
Carrousel for safety.

410X12     CAROUSEL

As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the
petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes
on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A
great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the
crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is
crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of
destruction.

410X13     GREAT HALL

The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.

410X14     ARCADE

People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the
exits, trampling  each other in their fright.

410X15-
X21          PANIC MONTAGE SERIES OF CUTS

A. EXT. The City under the dome -- fitfully lit as the dome itself
seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it
as from a gigantic line storm.

B. The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim.

C. The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the
screaming panicky people.

D. Maze-Car Station. People fighting to cram into cars. Car lights
go out. People turn and bolt in another direction.

E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each
other in fear, struggling to get away.

F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.

G. The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire
wrecking it.


410X22     EXT. - DOMED CITY - FIRE FX AND CRACKING 

INTERCUT with above:

410X23     LOGAN AND JESSICA

Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber,
running O.S. past Maze Car Station.

410X24     LOGAN AND JESSICA
          
Running past Power Center.

411     EXT. - CITY - FULL SHOT

The dome of the city torn. Lightning effects playing on the stunned
people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they
stumble forward into the darkness.

A wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. There
is a sense of wonder. Hysteria is lessening...as the people find
themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that
the crystals have disappeared from their palms.

Some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they
emerge from the crack in the dome at:

412          FULL ANGLE - THE ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION
     
We can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on
to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN
FRANCISCO)...full of happiness and hope for the future.

AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped
construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.

Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to
gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.

As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be
more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to
touch him...and some do.

Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men
and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.

FADE OUT:

THE END
