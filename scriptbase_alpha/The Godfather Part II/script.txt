SECOND DRAFT

September 24, 1973





FADE IN:

The Paramount Pictures logo is presented over a simple black
background, as a single trumpet plays the familiar theme of
a waltz.  White lettering fades in:

               Mario Puzo's THE GODFATHER

There is a pause, as the trumpet concludes, and there is the
additional title: - Part Two -

INT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD OFFICE - CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL
CORLEONE - DAY

standing impassively, like a young Prince, recently crowned
King.

CLOSE VIEW ON Michael's hand.  ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand.
Then it is taken away.  We can SEE only the empty desk and
chair of Michael's father, Vito Corleone.  We HEAR, over
this, very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance,
as THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY

We can barely make out the funeral procession passing over
the burnt-brown of a dry river bed.  The figures move
slowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past.

The MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their
instruments harsh and blaring.

They are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the
crude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a
strong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the
arms of those walking with her.

Behind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and
paisani continue alone behind the coffin.

Suddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians
stop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd
directions along the rocky river bed.

The young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin,
throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground.
We hear a woman SCREAMING:

                    WOMAN
               (Sicilian)
          They've killed young Paolo!  They've
          killed the boy Paolo!

EXT. SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - MED. VIEW - DAY

across the slain body of a fourteen year old boy, lying on
the parched ground.  In the distance we see four or five of
the mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and
veils, running up to the body of the boy.  They begin to
wail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the
mother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his
fresh blood wetting her strong hands.

EXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY

A boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being
pulled quickly by the hand.  This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is
to become The Godfather.

The VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by
his Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the
ornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble.

At various positions near the gates are men with shotguns,
or lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy
are shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He
wears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt
sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.  He wears a hat
to protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays
a gold watch and chain over his vest.

He sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden,
listening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only
son.

                    WIDOW
               (Sicilian)
          Don Francesco.  You murdered my
          husband, because he would not bend.
          And his oldest son Paolo, because
          he swore revenge.  But Vitone is
          only nine, and dumb-witted.  He
          never speaks.

                    DON FRANCESCO
               (Sicilian)
          I'm not afraid of his words.

                    WIDOW
               (Sicilian)
          He is weak.

                    DON FRANCESCO
               (Sicilian)
          He will grow strong.

                    WIDOW
               (Sicilian)
          The child cannot harm you.

                    DON FRANCESCO
               (Sicilian)
          He will be a man, and then he will
          come for revenge.

As she pleads, the Widow moves closer to the Don, until she
has practically thrown herself to her knees before him.

                    WIDOW
               (Sicilian)
          I beg you, Don Francesco, spare my
          only son.  He is all I have.  In
          the name of the Holy Spirit, I
          swear he will never be a danger to
          you...

Suddenly, she reaches under her skirt, where she has hidden
a kitchen knife.

                    WIDOW
               (continuing)
          But I will kill you myself!
               (she lunges at the
               Mafia chieftain)
          Vitone, go!

The boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates.  Then
there is a lupara blast.  He turns, and sees his Mother
flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the
terrible blast of the shotgun.  Then he sees the men turn
their attention to him.  One fires at him; but the boy is
quick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.

EXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT

Two men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying
lupare.  Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a
loud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler.  Their
names are MOSCA and STROLLO.

                    MOSCA
               (Sicilian)
          Our Friend promises misery to
          anyone who harbors the boy Vito
          Andolini.
               (he turns and shouts
               in the other direction)
          Our Friend promises misery to
          anyone who harbors the boy Vito
          Andolini.

INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

A family quietly eats their dinner.  The father is the local
policeman, as indicated by his uniform jacket and gun,
hanging nearby.

                    STROLLO
               (Sicilian, O.S.)
          Our Friend will be hard with any
          family who gives help to Vito
          Andolini.

One of the children looks up, about to speak.  But the
father sternly indicates that nothing must be said.  They go
on with their dinner.

EXT. THE STREETS OF CORLEONE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The men continue walking up and throughout the streets, far
in the distance.

                    MOSCA
               (Sicilian O.S.)
          ...misery to any family who harbors
          the boy, Vito...

INT. A BARN - NIGHT

Four little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and
father bind Vito tightly in swaddled cloth, and then lift
him up to the side of a mule; counter-balancing a heavy load
of firewood.  The father looks at the boy's almost stoically
calm little face.

                    FATHER
               (Sicilian)
          Vito...We pray for you.

He pulls the fabric over the boy's face.

                    MOSCA
               (Sicilian O.S.)
          ...Andolini...

                    STROLLO
               (Sicilian O.S.)
          Our Friend promises misery to any
          family...

EXT. THE CHURCH PLAZA - NIGHT

The men continue on their night-walk, up to the plaza of the
church.

                    STROLLO
               (Sicilian)
          ...who harbors the boy Vitone
          Andolini.

The figure of a single man on a mule passes them.

                    MOSCA
               (Sicilian)
          Let no one give help to the boy
          Vito Andolini...

The man on the mule makes his way out of the village and
disappears into the distance.

We begin to hear, very quietly, the Waltz repeated once again.

EXT. STEAMSHIP - CLOSE VIEW ON VITO - DAY

huddled in blankets, on the deck of the ship in Steerage.
He does not say a word.  The Waltz grows louder as the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled
together with all their earthly possessions on their way to
America.

Then, suddenly, the Waltz stops.

THE NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

SILENCE.  We glide past the Statue of Liberty.

VIEW on the IMMIGRANTS standing on shipboard silently;
looking.  Vito is standing with them, his eyes wide.

CAMERA MOVES IN on the statue, then MOVING PAST, on to the
beautiful buildings of Ellis Island.

EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - DAY

A tugboat pulls a barge brimming with immigrants into the
Ellis Island harbor.  Uniformed officials of the Immigration
Service load them up toward the main building.

INT. ELLIS PROCESSING HALL - DAY

The hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in
the great hall.  Various painted lines lead to the steps and
processing rooms above.

There is the babble of many interviews going on
simultaneously, uncertainly, in different languages.

Vito is bundled in an old coat, with a large tag pinned on
it: "Vitone Andolini -- Corleone, Sicilia."

He stands, moves up in the line, when several other immigrant
boys, older than he, rush up an push him back in the line.
Weak from the trip, he falls to the floor.  The boys laugh,
derisive in a language he cannot understand.  He struggles
to his feet, lifting his makeshift bags; staring at them in
an icy hatred.

INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY

Three or four interviews are crowded into the small room;
they are conducted in English.  From the expression on
Vito's face, and from the fragmented of the English, we
realize that he doesn't understand a word of it.

                    OFFICIAL
               (English)
          What is your name?

The man waits, impatiently.

                    OFFICIAL
          Your name?

Vito doesn't answer.  The Official pulls the tag pinned onto
his coat and copies to down on his form, using a typewriter.

                    OFFICIAL
               (speaking as he types)
          Vito...Corleone.  Step up, over
          there.

He hands the form to another official.

CLOSE VIEW on the form.  The name has been entered as Vito
Corleone.

INT. MEDICAL EXAM - DAY

Vito is stripped to the waist, as other immigrants wait.

The DOCTOR is just finishing his examination.  He shakes his
head, and then writes on the medical form.

                    DOCTOR
          Can you understand me?

Vito stares blankly.

                    DOCTOR
          You understand?  Smallpox.  Smallpox.

He doesn't understand.  The doctor turns to the Immigration
Official.

                    DOCTOR
          Quarantine...six months.

UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Officials move a group of immigrant men, including Vito, to
the quarantine section of the Island.

INT. QUARANTINE HALLWAY - DAY

The official stops at each doorway, and reads off a name.

                    OFFICIAL
          Salvatore Ormenta.

The man moves into the room, and the group proceeds.

                    OFFICIAL
          Vito Corleone.

No one responds.  The guard moves to the boy, reads his new
name tag.  And then, not unkindly:

                    GUARD
          That's you.

He opens the door, and Vito enters the room.

EXT. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

The VIEW slowly begins to pull back, revealing this to be
the view from inside the quarantine cell, where Vito stands
on his bench, looking out to the statue through the barred
window.

Then he turns, and sits in the corner.  He is silent for a
long time.

Then, in a sweet, pure voice, he sings to himself in Sicilian.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - MOVING CLOSE SHOT - DAY

A nine year old boy, dressed immaculately in white, with a
large white silk bow tied to his shoulder, moving slowly
down the aisle of the church with a group of other children
dressed in white.  He has dark black hair, and his face is
unmistakably similar to young Vito's.  He moves slowly, his
hands clasped around a golden missal.  We HEAR only the pure
voice of Vito in Sicilian, his sad song reaching out from
the past, as ANTHONY CORLEONE, his Grandson, moves on the
way to his First Holy Communion more than fifty years later.

FULL VIEW

The little children move in procession down to the Altar,
where the PRIEST raises the Host, and performs the Communion
Mass in Latin.

                    PRIEST
          Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit
          peccata mundi.

MOVING VIEW ON THE PRIEST

and Altar boys, as he moves along the row of kneeling
children, blessing them, and administering their first
Communion.

CLOSE MOVING VIEW

as the innocent faces receive the Host; finally, the Priest
comes to Anthony.

                    PRIEST
          Corpus Christi.

                    ANTHONY
          Amen.

EXT. LAKE TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The lawns of this great estate on the shore of Lake Tahoe
are covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the
First Holy Communion of Anthony Corleone, the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Michael Corleone.  A full dance orchestra plays music
of the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for
the occasion.  Speedboats roar through the water, pulling
youthful waterskiers; and the pool and private harbor are
filled with laughing, swimming guests.  It is Fall of 1958.

MED. VIEW

Anthony, in his Communion suit sits alone at the table,
looking like a lonely young Prince.

                    KAY (O.S.)
          Smile, Anthony.  Smile.

He does, and a flash goes off.

                    PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
          Now, one with the whole family.

                    KAY (O.S.)
          Mr. Corleone can't right now...

KAY CORLEONE enters from the side, leading her four year old
daughter, MARY, and MAMA CORLEONE to pose with Anthony.

                    KAY (O.S.)
          ...but we'll get one with the ladies.

                    PHOTOGRAPHER
          All together now, c'mon, Anthony...
          CHEESE and
               (flash)

                    KAY
          Thank you.

She smiles as she leaves the photographer, and then lets out
a weary sigh to Mama, as she touches the slightly protruding
belly.

                    KAY
          Do you think it'll show in the
          picture?

                    MAMA
          Two months never shows.  Two months
          look like you had a big lunch.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Oh, Mrs. Corleone.

A slender, aristocratic WOMAN in her late forties is waving
to KAY.

                    MRS. BARRETT
          Hello, Mrs. Corleone.  I'm Fran
          Barrett, our place is just down the
          lake.  This is my husband, Marshall.

                    KAY
          I'm so happy you could come.

                    MR. BARRETT
          The place is transformed.  We've
          been watching workmen come and go
          all summer.

                    MRS. BARRETT
          Where is Mr. Corleone?

                    KAY
          A business meeting ran late...but
          he promised he wouldn't be long.

Kay puts her arm around little Anthony's shoulder.

                    KAY
          This is our son Anthony Vito
          Corleone.  Today he made his First
          Holy Communion.

EXT. TAHOE GATE AND KENNELS - DAY

A confusion of cars; arriving and parking.  The squad of
parking attendants are supplemented by a whole team of the
local Police, working as high-class parking valets.

A very beautiful, statuesque woman, though slightly drunk,
DEANNA DUNN, slams the door of a powder blue Mercedes and
hurries barefoot through the great stone gate.

                    DEANNA
          I will not shut my mouth, and keep
          your Goddamn hands off of me!

She is followed by a harried, FREDDIE CORLEONE, dressed with
flash in the Hollywood style, and carrying her shoes in his
hands.

                    FREDO
          Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for
          a drive.

                    DEANNA
          I just had a drive; besides, I want
          to see my brother-in-law Michael.

                    FREDO
               (trying to get her to
               put her shoes on)
          Yeah, but I don't want him to see
          you.

Deanna pauses reflectively a moment, allowing Fredo to get
her shoes on.

                    DEANNA
          What beats me, is how you guys
          could be brothers.  You musta been
          your Mother's rotten egg.

She kicks off the shoes, giggling, and runs toward a waiter.

                    DEANNA
               (lifting a glass of champagne)
          Young man, young man...thank you,
          young man.

                    WAITER
               (impressed)
          Excuse me, but aren't you...

                    DEANNA
          Yes, you saw me in the movies, Good
          Humor man, and yes, I had more off
          than my shoes!

                    FREDO
          Goddamn bitch.

                    DEANNA
          Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance
          with me.

She extends her hand to him.

                    FREDO
          Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice
          people here.  Friends of Kay's.
          He'll never forgive me if you ruin
          his party.

                    DEANNA
          I hate to see you cringe in front
          of him.  How come you're so scared
          of your own kid brother?

                    FREDO
          He's the head of the family.

Disgusted, she turns around, and heads toward the music.

                    DEANNA
          Don't follow me!

EXT. TAHOE LAWN AND TABLES - MED. SHOT - DAY

Rushing through the tables, waving an arm jangling with gold
jewelry, and carrying several gift-wrapped packages, is a
hardened and aging CONNIE CORLEONE.  She is followed by a
blond, and wrinkled-handsome escort named MERLE.

                    CONNIE
          Mama...Mama!  Here I am!

She throws her arms around her Mother, who returns the
affection somewhat reproachfully.

                    MAMA
          Constanzia.  We expected you last
          week; we sent the car to pick you
          up at the airport last week.

                    CONNIE
          I know, it was chaos; but anyway,
          here I am one week late.
               (lifting a shiny
               green package out of
               Merle's arms)
          This is for my Mama.  You remember
          Merle?

                    MAMA
               (not giving him a
               chance to greet her)
          Yes, thank you.

                    CONNIE
          How are the kids?

                    MAMA
          Well, thank you, they asked for you
          all week.

                    CONNIE
          I got surprises for everybody!

                    MAMA
               (glancing at the wrapping)
          Bought at the airport.

                    CONNIE
               (gazing about)
          This is swell.  Where's Michael?
          I've got things to get straight
          with him and I can't wait on line.

                    MAMA
          You go see your children first, and
          then you wait to see your brother
          like everybody else.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A porch-like foyer of the boathouse, where a group of five
or six men wait, some nervously.  Some sit, and some pace.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

on one of these men, FRANKIE PENTANGELI, approaching his
sixties, with gray hair (the little of it left).  He's a bit
scruffy, this morning's shave of his white beard is not
perfect, and he seems tired.  He is accompanied by an
associate-bodyguard, WILLY CICCI; thin and dark, and also
dressed up for the occasion.  Frankie tries to get the
attention of one of the waiters; a college-groomed young man
in white sports jacket and black bow-tie.

                    PENTANGELI
          Hey, kid!  You got any red wine?

                    WAITER
               (offering the tray)
          Only champagne and cocktails.

                    PENTANGELI
          Forget it...

Finally, he sees someone he recognizes, Fredo, and shouts
out in a husky voice:

                    PENTANGELI
          Fredo!  Sonuvabitch.  You look great.

Fredo squints in his direction; finally recognizes him.

                    FREDO
          Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie
          "Five-Angels"...thought you were
          never coming West.

                    PENTANGELI
               (affectionately)
          Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey,
          what's with the food?  Some kid in
          a white jacket brings me a ritz
          cracker with some chopped liver.
          'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a
          peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker
          with chopped liver.' Go get me a
          salami sandwich and a glass of wine
          or I'll send you and your white
          jacket to the dry cleaners!

They get a good laugh at this fresh breath of New York.

                    FREDO
          Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you.
          Reminds me of old times.

                    PENTANGELI
          You remember Willy Cicci, don't
          you, Freddie?  We was all together
          with the old man Clemenza in
          Brooklyn... before...uh...

                    FREDO
          We were all upset about that.

                    PENTANGELI
          That's what I'm here to talk to
          your brother about.  What's with
          him, I got to get a letter of
          introduction to have a 'sitdown'?

                    FREDO
               (throwing his arm
               around him)
          C'mon, I see what I can do.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - MED. VIEW - DAY

The orchestra wears white summer sportcoats and black tuxedo
slacks as they play a tango behind monogrammed music stands.
A professional dance team, probably imported from Vegas,
dance the tango for the excited guests.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A large and very beautiful room overlooking the lake.  It is
dominated by an enormous bar, behind which stands ALBERT
NERI, discreetly in the background.

MICHAEL CORLEONE sits on a large sofa, his back to us.
Standing to one side is a tired and somewhat uneasy TOM
HAGEN.  Standing before Michael is SANDRA CORLEONE, Sonny's
widow; her daughter, one of the twins, FRANCESCA CORLEONE,
and a handsome young man of twenty, GARDNER SHAW.

                    SANDRA
          Michael, this is Gardner Shaw.
          Francesca and he have been seeing
          each other for six months now.
          Gardner, this is Francie's Uncle
          Michael.

                    GARDNER
               (a little nervous)
          I've heard a lot about you, Mr.
          Corleone.

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
          Sit down.  Francie.

The couple sit themselves on the sofa opposite Michael.

                    SANDRA
          They would like to set an engagement
          date, and...

                    MICHAEL
          Let them speak for themselves.

VIEW ON MICHAEL, calm, thoughtful.  One can tell that he has
special affection for his niece.

                    FRANCESCA
          We love each other, Uncle Michael.
          And, we want to be married.  I came
          to ask for your blessing.

There is a loud KNOCKING on the door; then Fredo's voice.

                    FREDO (O.S.)
          Hey, Mike...guess who's here?

Neri goes to answer it, cracks the door open.

                    NERI
          Not now, Freddie...

                    FREDO
          Tell Mike Frankie 'Five-Angels' is
          here.

                    NERI
          Not now...

Neri closes the door, and Michael looks at the nervous young
man.

                    MICHAEL
          Francesca is my oldest brother's
          daughter.  He died many years ago,
          and ever since I've felt much more
          of a father than an uncle.  I love
          her very much.  I'm pleased and
          impressed that you had the thought
          to come to me before going on with
          your plans.  It shows me that
          you're a considerate man, and will
          be good to her.  What are you
          studying in college?

                    GARDNER
          My major is Fine Arts, sir.

                    MICHAEL
          How will Fine Arts support your new
          wife?

                    GARDNER
          It's embarrassing to say, sir, but
          I'm a major stockholder in the
          family corporation.

                    MICHAEL
               (smiling)
          Never be embarrassed by your wealth.
          This recent contempt for money is
          still another trick of the rich to
          keep the poor without it.
               (warmly)
          Of course I give you my blessing.
          Let's set the wedding soon...it
          will be my pleasure to give the
          bride away.

They all smile, and rise.

                    MICHAEL
               (continuing)
          ...and take a few courses in
          Business Administration just to be
          on the safe side!

They laugh; Michael moves toward them.  Francesca throws her
arms around him, and kisses her favorite uncle.  The flushed
young man shakes his hand heartily.

                    FRANCESCA
          Thank you, Uncle Michael.

They all take their leave; Michael turns to Hagen.

                    MICHAEL
          Make her dowry impressive.  He
          comes from a family who still
          thinks an Italian bride goes
          barefoot.

EXT. TAHOE SWIMMING POOLS AND HARBOR - DAY

Francesca and Gardner are greeted by her twin sister and
their young friends, who squeal and embrace at the good news.
Someone throws someone in the pool, and life is good.

MED. CLOSE

Francesca kisses her Aunt Kay.

                    FRANCESCA
          Uncle Michael is the greatest man
          ever!

VIEW on Kay - happy for her niece.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Michael sits in the darkened boathouse.  Tom Hagen paces.
Michael is looking at photographs.  Neri stands over him.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

studying the pictures.

                    NERI (O.S.)
          His name is Fred Vincent.  He owns
          a small pizza parlor in Buffalo...

CLOSE ON THE PICTURES

Snapshots of a middle-aged man, handsome, Italian.  There is
something familiar about him.

                    NERI (O.S.)
               (continuing)
          ...American wife and two small kids.
          We traced him and found that he's
          in the country illegally, from
          Sicily...

Michael looks at another picture.  The same man.  Only
younger, and dressed in Sicilian shepherd's clothing.  We
remember him as FABRIZZIO...Michael's traitorous bodyguard
in Sicily.

                    NERI (O.S.)
          ...came over around 1956.  Sponsored
          by the Barzini Family.

Michael puts the pictures down.

                    MICHAEL
          It's him.  Fabrizzio.
               (almost to himself)
          Revenge is a dish that tastes best
          when it's cold.

                    NERI
          How do you want me to handle it?

Michael glances at Hagen, who has been waiting in the room.

                    MICHAEL
          Later.  Tom?

Hagen brings him a folder; then, as Michael glances through
it:

                    HAGEN
          I've cleared it through the
          Senator's chief aide, a man named
          Turnbull.  Turnbull's a heavy
          gambler, and into us for over a
          hundred grand, so I figure his
          information is reliable.

Neri moves to the bar, to prepare Michael a drink.

                    HAGEN
          The Senator can be set up; but he
          thinks of himself as a clean
          politician.  So it's got to be on
          terms he can live with: campaign
          contribution, donation to a
          charitable cause that he controls,
          things like that.  If he gets even
          the inkling that you think you're
          buying him, he'll freeze up.
          Nevada's a funny state, they like
          things both ways here... All right.
          Turnbull says the Senator will be
          here at two-thirty, and he's been
          primed.  He knows you'll want to
          meet with him alone, and he knows
          it's about the Tropicana's license.
          At any rate, he expects to be
          introduced around to some of the
          influential people here today, and
          generally treated as an ordinary
          guest.  Just go light on him,
          Mikey, sometimes the biggest crooks
          don't like to think of themselves
          as crooks...

Michael glances at Hagen, as though that last remark was
unnecessary.

                    HAGEN
          I'm sorry; of course, you know that.

                    MICHAEL
          Two-thirty.  That gives me time to
          see my boy.

                    HAGEN
          Connie's outside.

Michael doesn't want to see her.

                    HAGEN
          I promised; she said it was urgent.

Michael nods.

                    MICHAEL
          All right.  Apologize to Pentangeli.

Neri opens the door; Hagen exits, and Connie steps in
impatiently, followed by Merle.

                    MICHAEL
          I said I would see my sister, alone.

                    MERLE
          I think this concerns me too.
               (taking a cigarette
               from the dispenser)
          You don't, do you?

Connie steps forward, kisses Michael on the cheek.

                    CONNIE
          How are you, honey?  You've met
          Merle, haven't you.  He was with me
          in Vegas.

                    MICHAEL
          I saw him with you.

                    CONNIE
          We're going to Europe next week.  I
          want to get passage booked on the
          Queen.

                    MICHAEL
          Why do you come to me?  Why don't
          you go to a travel agent?

                    MERLE
          We're going to get married first.

Michael is silent.  Then he rises, and moves to the window
overlooking the lake.

                    MICHAEL
          The ink on your divorce isn't dry.
          Your children see you on weekends;
          your oldest boy, Michael Francis...
          was in some trouble with the Reno
          police over some petty theft that
          you don't even know about.

                    CONNIE
          Michael...

                    MICHAEL
          You fly around the world with lazy
          young men who don't have any love
          for you, and use you like a whore.

                    CONNIE
          You're not my father!

                    MICHAEL
          Then why do you come to me?

                    CONNIE
          Because I need MONEY!

                    MICHAEL
               (softly)
          Connie, I want to be reasonable
          with you.  You have a house here,
          with us.  You can live here with
          your kids...and you won't be
          deprived of anything.  I don't know
          much about Merle; I don't know what
          he does for a living; what he lives
          on.  Why don't you tell him marriage
          is really out of the question; and
          that you can't see him any more.
          He'll understand.  But if you
          disobey me, and marry this pimp...it
          would disappoint me.

                    CONNIE
          It was my father's money; and I'm
          entitled to what I need.  Where is
          Tom Hagen?

She turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face
with Merle.

                    MICHAEL
          Are you finished?

                    MERLE
          I think so.

                    MICHAEL
          Then out.

Merle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - FULL VIEW - DAY

The orchestra has struck up a "Paul Jones," where two
concentric circles of young people march in opposite
directions, until the music stops.  Then they take whomever
is opposite them as their new dance partner.

VIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA

Francesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young
friends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the
water skis.  We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path
leading to a separate and more private boathouse.  A small
covered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men
step on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and
follow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his
business.

CLOSE VIEW

Pentangeli has led Mama up to the dance floor, and is having
some difficulty with the orchestra.

                    PENTANGELI
          I can't believe that out of thirty
          professional musicians, not one of
          you is Italian!
               (as the musicians laugh)
          C'mon, give us a tarantella.

He waves his hands, conducting, and singing.  The piano
starts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet
starts to play "Pop Goes the Weasel," and soon the rest of
the orchestra is playing that.  They look to Pentangeli for
approval.  Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a
handful of canapes.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Rocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold
and wet of his boatride, to Michael.

The man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that
Neri should get him a drink.

                    MICHAEL
          Rocco, his friends must be hungry.
          See what you can do, but I'd like
          to keep them away from the guests.

The older man, JOHNNY 'BLUE BOY' OLA, gestures to his
bodyguards, and they follow Lampone.

                    MICHAEL
          You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.
          Johnny Ola.

                    OLA
          Sure, I remember Tom from the old
          days.

Tom shakes hands with Ola, remembering him, and his
importance.

                    MICHAEL
          Tom isn't going to sit in with us,
          Johnny.  He only handles specific
          areas of the family business.  Tom?

                    HAGEN
          Sure, Mikey.

He gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain
silent, waiting for him to go before they talk.  It's clear
Tom doesn't want to be excluded.

                    HAGEN
          If you need anything, just...

                    MICHAEL
          Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.

Hagen nods and leaves.  As soon as the door closes:

                    OLA
          I just left our friend in Miami.

                    MICHAEL
          How is his health?

                    OLA
          Not good.

                    MICHAEL
          Is there anything I can do; anything
          I can send?

                    OLA
          He appreciates your concern,
          Michael, and your respect.

There's a KNOCK on the door; a moment, and then Rocco
quietly enters and takes his place without disturbing the
conversation.

                    OLA
          The hotel's registered owners are
          one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney
          Barclay, both Beverly Hills
          attorneys.  In reality it's split
          between the Old Lakeville Road
          Group from Cleveland, and our
          friend in Miami.  He takes care of
          others outside the country, you
          know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman
          runs the store, and does all right,
          but I've been instructed to tell
          you, that if you move him out, our
          friend in Miami will go along with
          you.

                    MICHAEL
          He's very kind, tell him it's
          appreciated.  I'm sure it will be
          profitable all the way around.

                    OLA
          He always makes money for his
          partners.  One by one, our old
          friends are gone.  Death, natural
          or not, prison, deported.  Our
          friend in Miami is the only one
          left, because he always made money
          for his partners.

The door opens suddenly, and standing there in his white
Communion suit, is Michael's boy Anthony.  A moment later,
Kay appears, and takes the boy's hand.

                    KAY
          Anthony, Daddy's busy.

                    MICHAEL
               (rising)
          This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr.
          John Ola of Miami.

                    KAY
          I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator
          Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs.
          Barrett wanted to thank you before
          they left.  Won't you join us, Mr.
          Ola?

                    MICHAEL
          Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay.
          Please tell the Senator I won't be
          a minute.

Pause; she stands there a moment.

                    MICHAEL
               (continuing)
          Kay.

                    KAY
          Yes, Michael.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Kay closes the door.  It seems as though Michael has violated
some sort of promise to her by having this man here today.
She looks up toward the first boathouse.

WHAT SHE SEES:

The covered launch, and Ola's three bodyguards, eating while
they wait.

MED. VIEW

Anthony runs away from her, heading toward the house.

                    KAY
          Anthony!
               (she runs after him)
          Anthony, where are you going?

Moodily, the boy stops, turns, and walks back to his table
of honor without answering her.

EXT. TAHOE TABLES AND PAVILION - VIEW ON THE PAVILION - DAY

The orchestra has taken its break; now two couples in formal
dress are performing the Quartet from Rigoletto.

VIEW ON HAGEN

sitting by himself, a little down, having a drink.  He's
waiting for Michael to re-summon him.  SANDRA, Sonny's
widow, sits opposite him.

                    HAGEN
          Where's my wife?

                    SANDRA
          With Mama, putting the baby to
          sleep.  Francesca's very happy.
          Michael was kind to her.  She
          idolizes him.
               (pause; she looks at
               a despondent Hagen)
          The children are all out in the
          speedboat.  I'm going to my house.

Sandra gets up, still an attractive woman, and walks alone
to the back path that leads to her home on the estate.

VIEW ON THE PAVILION

The returned orchestra strikes a big, show-biz chord,
intended to command the guests' attention.

The orchestra LEADER raises his hands for silence, and makes
an announcement over the P.A. system.

                    MAESTRO
          Ladies and gentlemen, a most
          distinguished guest would like to
          say a few words: Senator and Mrs.
          Pat Geary of the state of Nevada!

A big hand, as the smiling SENATOR introduces his WIFE by
holding her arm up to the crowd, and then proceeds alone to
the bandstand.

MED. VIEW

Michael stands with Kay and Mrs. Geary.  The Senator's
presence seems to be a statement of political and social
status.

A little distance away, his beautiful son Anthony sits
quietly, in an unmistakably morose mood.

INT. TAHOE - SANDRA'S HOUSE - DAY

We HEAR the applause and whistles echoing in the distance.
Sandra stands in her bedroom, looking at the door.  We SEE a
photograph of SONNY, and also one of their wedding.

A moment goes by, and then Tom Hagen enters, closing the
door behind him.

We begin to HEAR Senator Geary's amplified voice resounding
over the lake.  Hagen moves to Sandra.  She takes him in her
arms, comforting, holding his head against her full breast.

                    HAGEN
               (quietly)
          He doesn't want my help any more.
          He doesn't need it.

                    SANDRA
          We don't know that's true, he never
          said that.

                    HAGEN
          I can feel it in the way he talks
          to me.

He moves to the dresser; pours himself a drink.

                    HAGEN
          Just now when Johnny Ola showed up,
          he asked me to leave them alone.
          Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian
          contact.  I was on the inside of
          ten, twenty meetings with him.  But
          today Mike asked me to leave, like
          an outsider.

                    SANDRA
          Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.

                    HAGEN
          It's as though he blames me for the
          ground the family lost when I was
          Consigliere to Sonny.

Sandra pulls Hagen to her, and kisses him passionately on
the mouth.

                    HAGEN
          I love Michael, I want to help him,
          be close to him.  I don't want to
          end up a third string lawyer making
          property settlements for the hotels.

Sandra knows he needs her.  Slowly she begins to undress.

                    SANDRA
          We have a little time now.

EXT. THE PAVILION - VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY - DAY

                    SENATOR GEARY
          ...my thanks, and the thanks of the
          young people of the State of
          Nevada, for this most impressive
          endowment...
               (he holds a check in
               his hand)
          ...made to the University in the
          name of Anthony Vito Corleone.
          Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Michael
          Corleone.

Applause.  Senator Geary returns the microphone to the
Maestro who adds:

                    MAESTRO
          And now, the Nevada Boys' Choir
          have prepared a special thank you
          for Mr. Michael Corleone.

He turns to a small Choir Master, who leads the Boys' Choir
in a choral arrangement of "MR. WONDERFUL."

VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY

shaking hands with Michael, as Press Photographers snap
pictures, showing the check; showing a special award of
Gratitude from the State; Mrs. Corleone and Mrs. Geary; all
together; Michael and his son; Senator Geary and Michael's
son; and on and on.  In the midst of this:

                    SENATOR GEARY
          Where can we meet alone?

Michael indicates the boathouse a distance away, where Neri
seems to be waiting for them.  Then Michael leans to Rocco:

                    MICHAEL
          Find Hagen.

Rocco sets off; as more pictures are taken, and the:

BOYS' CHOIR

sings its lovely arrangement of "Mr. Wonderful."

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael, the Senator, Neri and Rocco make a group in the
dark, large room.

                    MICHAEL
          It was very kind of you to come to
          my home on this occasion, Senator.
          My wife has been very concerned
          with making a good impression on
          the people who are our neighbors,
          and your appearance here has made
          her very happy.  If I can ever
          perform a service for you, you only
          have to ask.

The door opens, and Hagen sheepishly makes his way in.

                    MICHAEL
          My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged
          this all through your man Turnbull.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          I thought we would meet alone.

                    MICHAEL
          I trust these men with my life.
          They are my right arms; I cannot
          insult them by sending them away.

                    SENATOR GEARY
               (taking out some medication)
          Some water.

He addresses that to Neri, who resentfully goes to fetch the
Senator a glass of water.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          Alright, Corleone.  I'm going to be
          very frank with you.  Maybe more
          frank than any man in my position
          has ever spoken to you before.

Michael nods, indicating that he should do so.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          The Corleone family controls two
          major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno.
          The licenses were grandfathered in,
          so you had no difficulties with the
          Gaming Commission.  But I have the
          idea from sources...
               (takes the water from
               Neri and swallows his pills)
          ...that you're planning to move in
          on the Tropicana.  In another week
          or so you'll move Klingman out,
          which leaves you with only one
          technicality.  The license, which
          is now in Klingman's name.

                    MICHAEL
          Turnbull is a good man.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          Let's forget the bullshit, I don't
          want to stay here any longer than I
          have to.  You can have the license
          for two hundred and fifty thousand
          in cash, plus a monthly fee equal
          to five percent of the gross...

Michael is taken aback; he looks at Hagen.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          ...of all three Corleone hotels.

Hagen is frustrated; all his information was wrong.

                    MICHAEL
          Senator Geary, I speak to you as a
          businessman who has made a large
          investment in your state.  I have
          made that state my home; plan to
          raise my children here.  The
          license fee from the Gambling
          Commission costs one thousand
          dollars; why would I ever consider
          paying more?

                    SENATOR GEARY
          I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone,
          because I don't like you; I don't
          like the kind of man you are.  I
          despise your masquerade, and the
          dishonest way you pose yourself and
          your fucking family.

VIEW ON HAGEN

glances at Michael.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

makes no outward reaction.

                    MICHAEL
               (quietly)
          We're all part of the same
          hypocrisy, Senator.  But never
          think it applies to my family.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          All right, then let me say you'll
          pay me because it's in your
          interests to pay me.

VIEW ON GEARY

rising.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          I'll expect your answer, with
          payment, by tomorrow morning.  Only
          don't contact me...from now on,
          deal only through Turnbull.

He is almost out the door.

                    MICHAEL
          Senator...
               (cold and calm)
          ...you can have my answer now if
          you'd like.

Geary turns back.

                    MICHAEL
          My offer is this.  Nothing...not
          even the thousand dollars for the
          Gaming Commission, which I'd
          appreciate if you would put up
          personally.

Geary returns Michael's hard look; then laughs and leaves.
Slowly Michael turns to Hagen.

VIEW ON HAGEN

embarrassed at being so off the mark.

                    MICHAEL
          It's all right, Tom, we'll talk
          later.  Tell Frankie Pentangeli I'd
          like him to have dinner at my
          family table before we do business.

EXT. THE PAVILION - NIGHT

Now the light has faltered, and the young waiters have put
up the night lights.  The tables are all properly set for
dinner, with candles on each one.

The orchestra is playing quiet, unobtrusive dinner music,
and many of the guests have begun to help themselves to the
impressive buffet, under a party tent.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a large table with Kay, his son Anthony,
Mama, Hagen and TERESA, Connie and Merle' Fredo and Deanna,
and Frankie Pentangeli.

                    MAMA
          Cent' Anne.

This, the table of honor, all raise their glasses and repeat
the toast.

                    DEANNA
          What's 'cent' Anne?'

                    FREDO
          A hundred years...it's a toast.

                    CONNIE
          It means we should all live happily
          for one hundred years.  The family.
          If my Father were alive, it'd be
          true.

                    MAMA
          Connie.

                    CONNIE
          Merle, have you met my sister-in-
          law Deanna?

                    DEANNA
          What a pleasure, Merle.
               (shaking hands)


                    MAMA
               (Sicilian)
          Those two are perfect for each other.

                    MERLE
          What's that mean?

                    CONNIE
          Mama!

                    PENTANGELI
               (Sicilian)
          Michael, in all respect, I didn't
          come three thousand miles for dinner.

                    MICHAEL
               (Sicilian)
          I know.

                    PENTANGELI
               (Sicilian)
          When do we talk?

                    MICHAEL
               (Sicilian)
          After dinner.

By now, the conversation has become exclusively Sicilian,
with Merle and Deanna, looking from side to side like in a
tennis match.  Finally, Kay, to be polite:

                    KAY
          Anthony, you were talking to Mr.
          Pentangeli?

                    ANTHONY
          His name is "Five-Angels."

                    PENTANGELI
          Yeah, the kid and me talked Sicilian.
          A one-way conversation!

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Pentangeli is angry; but because it is Michael he is talking
to, he keeps his voice low and represses his desire to shout.

                    PENTANGELI
          Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart
          attack, but the Rosato Brothers
          gave it to him.

                    MICHAEL
          We were all heartbroken at the
          news; but that wasn't cause to
          start a war.

                    PENTANGELI
          Okay, now it's my family in
          Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up
          Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how
          can I run my family with you
          challenging my every move?  You're
          too far from the street, Mike, the
          only way to reason with the Rosato
          Brothers is to whack 'em and whack
          'em fast.

                    MICHAEL
          You were unfair with them.

                    PENTANGELI
          Says who?

                    MICHAEL
          Clemenza promised Rosato three
          territories in the Bronx after he
          died, and then you took over and
          welched.

                    PENTANGELI
          Clemenza promised them nothing, he
          hated the sonsuvbitches.

                    MICHAEL
          They feel cheated.

                    PENTANGELI
          Michael, you're sitting up here in
          the Sierra Mountains with champagne
          cocktails making judgment on the
          way I run my family.

                    MICHAEL
               (suddenly in Sicilian)
          Your family still carries the name
          Corleone, and you will run it like
          a Corleone!

                    PENTANGELI
               (Sicilian)
          And while I feed my family in New
          York, you put the knife in my back
          in Miami.

                    MICHAEL
               (firm)
          Frankie, you're a good old man, and
          you've been loyal to my Father for
          years...so I hope you can explain
          what you mean.

                    PENTANGELI
          The Rosatos are running crazy;
          taking hostages, spitting in my
          face, because they're backed by the
          Jew in Miami.

                    MICHAEL
          I know.  That's why I want you to
          be fair with them.

                    PENTANGELI
          How can you be fair with animals?
          They recruit niggers and spicks;
          they do violence in their own
          Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And
          everything is dope and whores; the
          gambling is left to last.  Let me
          run my family without you on my
          back.  I want them taken care of.

                    MICHAEL
          No.  There are things that I have
          planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't
          want them disturbed.

                    PENTANGELI
          You give your loyalty to a Jew over
          your own blood.

                    MICHAEL
          Frankie, you know my father
          respected Roth, did business with
          him.

                    PENTANGELI
          He did business...but he never
          trusted him.

Pentangeli takes his hat, and leaves.

                    NERI
          Should he go?

                    MICHAEL
          The old man had too much vino
          rosso, or he'd never talk openly
          that way.  Let him go back to New
          York; I've already made my plans.
               (he checks his watch)
          It's late; I've spent so little
          time at the party.

EXT. THE LAWNS AND TABLES - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

By now the sun has fallen and the lawns of the Corleone
estate are lit by moonlight.  Beautifully dressed couples
dance as the orchestra plays a foxtrot of the late fifties.

VIEW ON THE DANCE FLOOR

Deanna has been dancing with Fredo; she has gotten drunk and
it teasing her husband by flirting with other men on the
floor.

                    DEANNA
          I wanta dance...whatsa matter with
          that?

                    FREDO
          Dancing is alright; you're falling
          on the floor.

                    DEANNA
          Whatsamatter, you don't want me to
          dance with him 'cause he's a man!

                    FREDO
          Deanna, I'm going to belt you right
          in the mouth!

                    DEANNA
          These Eye-ties are really crazy
          when it comes to their wives.

By now guests are starting to notice the disturbance;
Michael is with Kay, and some friends; Rocco catches his eye.

                    DEANNA (O.S.)
          Jesus, never marry a WOP, they
          treat their wives like shit.

VIEW on Kay, listening, embarrassed by her flashy sister-in-
law.

VIEW ON FREDO AND DEANNA

Rocco passes by Fredo and whispers:

                    ROCCO
          Freddie, Mike says take care of it,
          or I have to.

                    DEANNA
          He's a friend of your brother!

Without another word, Rocco grabs firm hold of her and
whisks her out of the crowd.

                    DEANNA
          "Shuffle off to Buffa...
          Shuffle off to Buffa...
          Shuffle off to Buffalooooo..."

Freddie mops his forehead, and moves to Michael.

                    FREDO
          Hey Mike, what can I say?

                    MICHAEL
          Forget it, just go take care of her.

                    MICHAEL
          Does it feel like a boy?

                    KAY
          Yes, Michael, it does.

                    MICHAEL
          I'm sorry about some of the people
          I had to see today.  It was bad

                    KAY
          It made me think of what you told
          me once.  In five years, the
          Corleone family will be completely
          legitimate.  That was seven years
          ago.

He has no answer for her; except that he loves and values
her, and holds her tight, as they dance amid their guests,
all dressed elegantly for the social event of the season.

The VIEW LOOSENS to show the entire, night-lit party.

A Cadillac limousine waits for some people inside the tacky,
Las Vegas marriage mill.

INT. THE CHAPEL - NIGHT

Some quiet, informally dressed couples wait in the rear of
the chapel; some talking, others sitting nervously.

A single organ plays some standard wedding music.

The VIEW PANS up to the altar, where Connie and Merle, in
the same clothing they wore to the Tahoe party, are being
married by a Justice of the Peace.

The Justice goes through the bored, simple ceremony, and we
begin to HEAR an echo of the waltz Connie danced with her
father, when she was married all those years ago in Long
Island.

EXT. THE TROPICANA - LAS VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A dark car pulls up to the glitter of the neon facade.
Albert Neri, alone, leaves it to the parking valets, and
moves quickly through the automatic doors, into the main
casino.  We still hear the CORLEONE WALTZ.

INT. THE TROPICANA - DAY

Albert Neri enters the room; glances around a moment, and
then heads toward the crap table, where a short, middle-aged
man, KLINGMAN, stands by the pit boss.  Several security
guards of the casino, are at their posts.

                    NERI
          Are you Klingman?

                    KLINGMAN
          Who's asking?

                    NERI
          Where can we talk?

                    KLINGMAN
          Right here.

                    NERI
          I represent the interests of the
          Corleone family.  We make the
          invitation to you to tie up your
          affairs and be out of the hotel by
          Monday morning.

                    KLINGMAN
          Who do you think you're talking to?

                    NERI
          You said you were Klingman.

                    KLINGMAN
          You don't come in here, talk to an
          owner in Las Vegas like that.

                    NERI
          You missed my point; you are no
          longer an owner.

                    KLINGMAN
          Get out of my hotel.

Neri stands in front of him, smiling.

                    KLINGMAN
          Boys, get him out of here.

Quickly, Neri moves toward Klingman, and slaps him hard
several times in the face, knocking off his glasses... Red-
faced, Klingman gets down on his knees to pick them up once,
again.  Glasses on, he looks to his guards.

WHAT HE SEES

They stand, motionless.

Humiliated, Klingman moves across the casino floor, past a

Neri keeps moving, then heads past the terrified man, sits
down at a table, and looks up at the stage.

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - 1915 - NIGHT

VITO CORLEONE is a shy young man of 23, holding his hat in
his hand, being led down the crowded aisle of this Italian
Vaudeville theatre by an energetic and fulfilled GENCO
ABBANDANDO, his friend in America.  This entire sequence is
played in Sicilian.

                    GENCO
          Come on, you've got to see her!

VIEW ON THE STAGE

A tattered melodrama is in progress in Neapolitan.  The sets
are two-dimensional, and flap whenever there's an entrance
or exit.

The hero, PEPPINO, is weeping as he sings about how he's
left his Mother in Italy, while he is in this new country,
America.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

All poor, Italo-Americans.  Genco finds a few seats, and
leads Vito to them, stepping on a few shoes in the process.
They have barely come to their seats, when an excited Genco
nudges Vito, and points to the stage.  People shout that
they should sit down.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

There is a knock on the door, and a young girl enters,
delivering a letter to Peppino in his tenement in America.
The girl is pretty; and obviously the object of Genco's
affection.  The letter brings bad news.  Peppino's Mother is
dead.  He weeps, and sings the final song, which most of the
audience knows: SENZA MAMMA.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

Genco is enthralled with the young actress.  The people in
the audience are singing along with Peppino.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

The actress, object of Genco's affection, makes a dramatic
exit.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

Genco pulls on Vito's jacket, indicating that now that his
love is offstage, they should leave.  Vito rises with him,
and they make their way all the way down the aisle.

INT. BACKSTAGE THEATRE - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Genco hurrying down the backstage corridor, hoping to catch
a glimpse of the actress.  He is followed by Vito.  Suddenly,
Genco stops short.

GENCO'S VIEW

A heavy-set, fierce looking Italian wearing an expensive
light-colored suit and a cream colored fedora.  This is
FANUCCI.  He is discussing a business matter with the
theatre IMPRESARIO; a large, strong looking man, who is
sweating nonetheless.  He doesn't seem to be giving in to
Fanucci.  He holds a locked strongbox.

VIEW ON VITO

MED. VIEW

The young ACTRESS crosses into the area, unaware of the
difficulties.  The impresario sees her, and frightened,
motions that she should keep away.

                    IMPRESARIO
          Carla!

But Fanucci grabs her easily by her slender wrist, and with
lightning speed, produces a knife which he holds against her
cheek.  The impresario wrings his hands in agony.

                    IMPRESARIO
               (Sicilian)
          No...please, not my daughter.

Whereupon he begins to unlock the box which holds the
receipts for the night's box-office.

VIEW ON GENCO AND VITO

would rush up to help his enamorata.

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          The Black Hand.

Then he backs away.  Vito looks at him shocked and
disappointed in this cowardly behavior.  Genco shakes his
head, and points, as though to say that where Fanucci is
concerned, there is nothing to be done.

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)

          Because you protested, it will cost
          a hundred more.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

Genco and Vito; Genco leans against the wall, breathlessly,
as though he's had a near escape.

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          I know what you are thinking,
          Vitone, but you don't understand
          yet how things are.  Fanucci is of
          the Black Hand.  Everyone in the
          neighborhood pays him, even my
          father.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          He's an Italian?

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          A pig of a Neaponitan.
               (spits)


                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          Why?  Why does he bother other
          Italians?

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          Because he knows them; he knows
          they have no one to protect them.
          Vitone?  What do you think of my
          angel?

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          Beautiful.

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          Beautiful.

                    VITO
          For you, she is beautiful.  For me,
          there is only my wife!

                    GENCO
          I know.  That's why I brought you
          with me!

Genco embraces his good friend, and they laughingly walk
down the alley.

The stage door opens, and Fanucci exits, a sinister figure
in white, moving down the alley just in front of them, into
the night.

The two friends hold their breath, until he disappears.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Vito moves through the street, carrying groceries that he is
to deliver.

It is cold, and so vendors are huddled around fires they
have lit in old cans and drums.

He turns up an alleyway, and then stops.

VIEW UP THE ALLEY

With great strength, Fanucci lifts one of them up into the
air and throws him down hard to the concrete; but another,
holding onto his back, manages to produce a switchblade
knife and awkwardly reaching around from behind the moving
man, slits Fanucci's throat from one side to the other.

Fanucci groans like some great hurt animal.  Blood pours
from the deep, smile-like slit in his throat.

He throws the young man off his back.

VIEW ON VITO

stepping back in the alley.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

He takes off his white fedora, and runs down the alley
toward Vito, catching the flowing blood in his hat.

The young attackers scurry off in various directions.

INT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY STORE - DAY

A tiny shop featuring imported food: trays of cured meats,
prosciutto, copagole, mortadella lies on the counter covered
with netting to keep away the thousands of flies.

Olive oil is sold in bulk, as well as wine, cheese and bacala.

Genco works here for his father, and is busy slicing paper
thin prosciutto for a customer, by hand.  Vito works in the
back as a stock clerk.

Finished with his customer, Genco moves to his friend.

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          I bet you can't guess what happened?

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          What?

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped
          Fanucci today; slit his throat from
          ear to ear.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers.
          They wanted to scare him, that's
          all.  Make him look bad.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          In Sicily, when you attack a man,
          you had better finish him.

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          I wish they had.  He takes fifty
          dollars a week from my father's
          cash drawer.  But you can't kill a
          man like Fanucci.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          Why?

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          Because he's what we say...
          "connected"... You wait, see what
          happens to those guys from Ninth
          Avenue.

A customer enters; and Genco moves away to serve him.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

recalling what he had seen and thought.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEYWAY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A young man, one of those who had tried to kill Fanucci,
runs down an alleyway, breathlessly.  Then he stops, and
looks behind himself.  Whoever was following him is gone.
He turns and walks ahead.  Then the mammoth, white-suited
figure of Fanucci leaps down before him from the fire-escape.
He grins at the young man, and then raises his neck, showing
the gruesome wound that marks his throat.

He takes out his pistol and fires point-blank at his attacker.

INT. TINY TENEMENT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The very small, railroad type flat where Vito lives with his
new family.

It is late at night, and he is exhausted.

He returns home; where his young wife, CARMELLA, goes
through the silent ritual of preparing a simple meal for him.
He sits and eats quietly.

INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

Vito and Carmella enter the darkened bedroom, and approach a
metal crib.  Vito reaches down and takes the small hand of
the baby between his thick peasant fingers.  Carmella waits
a respectful distance behind him.

INT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY - DAY

The shop bell RINGS; SINGER ABBANDANDO turns to see a
smiling Fanucci tipping his hat, like an old customer.

                    FANUCCI
          Buon giorno.

Immediately, Vito turns back to his work, and Signor
Abbandando moves to Fanucci with a sigh.

Vito notices the two men talking quietly at one side of the
store, while he goes about his work.  Genco works his way
closer to his friend.

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          What did I tell you.  The one who
          cut him was found in an alley.  And
          the family of the others paid
          Fanucci all their savings to make
          him forswear his vengeance.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
                (surprised)
          And he agreed?

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          He took the money.  Now he wants
          double from everybody in the
          neighborhood, including Papa.

Vito watches the heated, but inevitable transaction.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
                (almost to himself)
          A real mafioso doesn't sell his
          vengeance.

MED. VIEW

Signor Abbandando seems to be arguing with Fanucci, and
every so often they turn and relate to where Vito is working.
Then Fanucci leaves, the little bell RINGING; and Signor
Abbandando reluctantly moves to Vito.

               (Sicilian)
          Vitone.  How is your son?

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          We are all well.

It is clear that he has something difficult to tell the
young man.

                    SIG. ABBANDANDO
          Vitone...I...Fanucci has a nephew.

Vito looks at him a while, as the old man struggles to tell
him.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          And you must give him my job.

The old man nods, regretfully.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          You have been kind to me since I
          was a boy; taken care of me, and
          been as a father.  I will always be
          grateful to you.  Thank you.

Vito takes off his apron, and leaves, passing the youth who
loiters by the counter.

He turns, and Abbandando has followed him out of the shop,
holding a basket of some groceries.

                    SIG. ABBANDANDO
          Here...for your family.

                    VITO
          No...please understand...I cannot
          accept.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito and his wife sit quietly at the table; the two are
quiet and sad.

Suddenly, we HEAR a noise, and Vito is astonished to see a
young man, PETER CLEMENZA, leaning out of the window on the
other side of the air shaft which separates their apartments.

                    CLEMENZA
          Hey Paisan!  Hold this for me until
          I ask for it.  Hurry up!

Automatically Vito reaches over to the empty space at the
air shaft, and takes the bundle of rags.  Clemenza's round
face is strained and urgent, obviously in some kind of
trouble.  Suddenly, he closes the window and there is
activity that we cannot see in the other apartment.

Vito looks to his wife, and then closes the window and
window dressing and takes the bundle into a private part of
his kitchen and begins to unwrap it.

WHAT HE SEES:

Five oily guns.  He immediately wraps them again, and
carries them to a private closet, and hides it, and returns
to his wife.  He sits down back at the table; and she knows
not to ask him what has happened.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

Vito is walking through the crowded streets with a group of
workmen; they all wear work clothes, and paper hats on their
heads.

Vito looks to his left, and realizes that Clemenza is
walking silently with him; by contrast, Clemenza dresses well.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
                (casually)
          Do you have my goods still?

Vito nods.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          Did you look inside?

Vito, his face impassive, shakes his head 'no.'

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          I'm not interested in things that
          don't concern me.

Vito and Clemenza drinking wine; they've become friends.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          I have a friend who has a fine rug.
          Maybe your wife would like it.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          We have no money for a rug.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          No.  He would give it away.  I know
          how to repay a consideration.

Vito thinks, then nods.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          She would like it.

INT. HALLWAY WEALTHY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The two men proceed up the hallway; Vito is impressed with
the opulence.

          Your friend lives in a fine building.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          Oh yes, the very best.

Clemenza knocks on the door as though he is well known here;
then rings.  No answer.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          Ah, he's not at home.  Oh, well, he
          wouldn't mind.

Quickly and expertly he takes out a tool and pries open the
door.

Vito looks in awe at the luxurious apartment, which features
a fabulous rich red wool rug.

Clemenza immediately moves some of the furniture away, and
drops to the floor.

                    CLEMENZA
          A little help.

Vito joins him, and the two begin rolling the rug.  We HEAR
a BUZZER RING.  Clemenza immediately drops his side of the
roll, and moves to the window.  He pulls a gun from his
jacket.

EXT. DOWNTOWN WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Clemenza knocks on the steel door of this downtown building.
Vito waits with him, holding some packages; and another
youth, TESSIO, tall and thin and deadly waits with them.

The door is lifted, and they are greeted by a bright,
middle-aged Italian named AUGUSTINO who leads them into a
machine shop.

INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          Good, you waited for us.

Clemenza looks up on a higher level.

HIS VIEW

There is a nine year old boy, operating a drill press.

MED. VIEW

                    TESSIO
               (Sicilian)
          Who is he?

                    AUGUSTINO
               (Sicilian)
          My son, Carmine...it's all right.

The men then quickly open the packages they've brought;
revealing gun, including a more sophisticated machine weapon.

Augustino takes them and expertly begins to clean and
prepare them.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
                (to Vito)
          Paisan Augustino was a gunsmith in
          the Italian army.  We do each other
          favors.

                    AUGUSTINO
               (Sicilian)
                (while he works)
          My boy is studying the flute.  He
          plays very well.  He helps me at
          night so we can buy him a silver
          flute someday.  Now he has one made
          of wood.  Carmine...play...play for
          my friends.

VIEW ON THE BOY

wide-eyed... he shuts off the press; and takes out a shabby
wooden flute.  And begins to play a simple and pure melody.

CLOSE ON VITO

listening.

CLOSE ON AUGUSTINO

proudly smiling, as he prepares the machine gun.

CLOSE ON TESSIO

listening, smiling.

FULL VIEW

The men listening, as the boy's father prepares their guns.

EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - NIGHT

Tessio and Clemenza quickly load racks of cheap dresses.

Vito sits behind the wheel of the truck.  He seems reserved,
and we get the impression that he is studying every move his
two friends are making.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Clemenza runs up a flight of stairs with an armful of
dresses.  He knocks on a door, and a pretty HOUSEWIFE answers.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          Lady, I got a bargain on these
          dresses.  Five dollars each.  You
          gotta pay at least fifteen, maybe
          twenty in a store.  Look at them,
          first class.

He holds the dresses up and the woman seems interested.  She
handles a couple of them and stands aside so Clemenza can
enter her apartment.

                    WOMAN
               (Sicilian)
          I don't know which one I like best.

She holds the dresses against her body, Clemenza approving
of each one; and then she goes to her purse and takes out
five singles and gives them to him.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          You'd look beautiful in all of
          these.  You should buy at least two.

                    WOMAN
               (Sicilian)
          Are you kidding?  My husband will
          kill me if he knows I paid five
          dollars for one dress.

She holds one up, then another.  She is torn.  Clemenza
shakes his head and straightens the dress on her body.  His
hand brushes her arm; she looks at him smiling.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          You can have two for five.

She smiles back.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

Clemenza jumps down the stairs, and out to the middle of the
street, where Vito and Tessio are waiting in the car with
some of the stock.

                    TESSIO
               (Sicilian)
          What took so long?

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          She couldn't decide.

Tessio and Clemenza each take more armsful of dresses and
divide the neighborhood.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          Vito, take the rest of the stock
          over to Dandine's warehouse; he'll
          move it to a wholesaler.

The three part.  Vito drives the truck off.

MOVING VIEW

Vito drives the truck through the downtown streets; he turns
a corner and stops for a light.

Suddenly, to his left, he sees the formidable figure of
Fanucci.

He grabs young Corleone by the shoulder.

CLOSE VIEW ON FANUCCI

frightening, revealing the large circular scar, now healed.

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
          Ahhh, young fellow.  People tell me
          you're rich, you and your two
          friends.  Yet, you don't show
          enough respect to send a few
          dresses to my home.  You know I
          have three daughters.

Vito says nothing.  Fanucci thumbs through the stock.

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
          This is my neighborhood.  You and
          your friends have to show me a
          little respect, ah?  This truck you
          hijacked was in my neighborhood.
          You should let me wet my beak a
          little.

Fanucci takes a few of the dresses.

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
          I understand each of you cleared
          around six hundred dollars.  I
          expect two hundred dollars for my
          protection and I'll forget the
          insult.  After all, young people
          don't know the courtesies due a man
          like myself.

Vito smiles at him and nods.

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
          Otherwise the police will come to
          see you and your wife and children
          will be dishonored and destitute.
          Of course, if my information as to
          your gains is incorrect, I'll dip
          my beak just a little.  Just a
          little, but no less than one
          hundred dollars, and don't try to
          deceive me, eh paisan?

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
                (quietly)
          My two friends have my share of the
          money.  I'll have to speak to them
          after we deliver these to the
          wholesaler.

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
          You tell your friends I expect them
          to let me wet my beak in the same
          manner.  Don't be afraid to tell
          them.  Clemenza and I know each
          other well, he understands these
          things.  Let yourself be guided by
          him.  He has more experience in
          these matters.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
                (shrugging innocently)
          You must understand, this is all
          new to me...

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
          I understand...

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          But thank you for speaking to me as
          a Godfather.

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
                (impressed)
          You're a good fellow.

He takes Vito's hands and clasps them in his own.

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
          You have respect.  A fine thing in
          the young.  Next time, speak to me
          first, eh?  Perhaps I can help you
          make your plans.

Fanucci turns with the dresses draped over his arms, waving
to Vito.

Vito throws the truck in gear, and drives off.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

We know that throughout this encounter he has seethed with
an icy rage.

INT. VITO'S APARTMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

He wife serves a dinner for her husband and his two friends.
They discuss Fanucci as they eat.

                    TESSIO
               (Sicilian)
          Do you think he'd be satisfied with
          the two hundred dollars?  I think
          he would.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          That scar-faced bastard will find
          out what we got from the wholesaler.
          He won't take a dime less than
          three hundred dollars.

                    TESSIO
               (Sicilian)
          What if we don't pay?

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
                (gestures, it's hopeless)
          You know his friends...real animals.
          And his connections with the police.
          Sure he'd like us to tell him our
          plans so he can set us up for the
          cops and earn their gratitude.
          Then they would owe him a favor;
          that's how he operates.  We'll have
          to pay.  Three hundred, are we
          agreed?

                    TESSIO
               (Sicilian)
          What can we do?

Clemenza doesn't even bother checking for Vito's opinion.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          They say Fanucci has a license from
          Maranzalla himself to work this
          neighborhood.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          If you like, why not give me fifty
          dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I
          guarantee he will accept that
          amount from me.

                    TESSIO
               (Sicilian)
          When Fanucci says two hundred he
          means two hundred.  You can't talk
          with him.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          I'll reason with him.  Leave
          everything in my hands.  I'll
          settle this problem to your
          satisfaction.

Tessio and Clemenza regard him suspiciously.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          I never lie to people I've accepted
          as my friends.  Speak to Fanucci
          yourself tomorrow.  Let him ask you
          for the money, but don't pay it,
          and don't in any way quarrel with
          him.  Tell him you have to get the
          money and will send me as your
          messenger.  Let him understand that
          you're willing to pay what he asks,
          don't bargain.  I'll go to his
          house, and quarrel with him.  He
          likes me; enjoys explaining how
          things are here.  He uses ten
          sentences when he only needs one,
          so while he talks, I'll kill him.

Clemenza, irritated, makes a large belch, and washes his
food down with wine.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
          Vitone!
               (to Tessio)
          Our driver has drunk too much wine.

                    TESSIO
               (Sicilian)
                (laughs at himself)
          He's going to kill Fanucci.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
                (stern)
          Then, after that, what?  Joe
          'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie
          Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla
          himself, c'mon!

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          Fanucci is not connected; he is
          alone.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
                (sarcastically)
          What?  You read it in the papers?

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          This man informs to the police;
          this man allows his vengeance to be
          bought off... No, he is alone.

                    TESSIO
               (Sicilian)
          If you're wrong...

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          If I'm wrong, they will kill me.

Both Clemenza and Tessio are impressed with their young
friend; his willingness to risk his life on his perception
of the situation.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A ten piece Italian street band plays in front of the church
to commemorate the first night of the Festa di San Gennaro.
People swarm in crowds, delighted by the music, as out of
the church four men carry the statue of San Gennaro down to
the street.

MOVING VIEW

Clemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along
the street: sausage cooking on an open fire; pork livers and
sweetbeards.  He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated
gesture when the vendor expects to be paid.  He crosses to a
church-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and
slaps a dollar on a number.  Standing next to him is Vito;
they embrace.

                    CLEMENZA
               (Sicilian)
                (quietly)
          All three daughters are at church;
          he is alone.  It's important that
          you let his neighbors see you leave.
          Tessio has broken the latch on the
          skylight of his building.

The wheel stops; they both lose.

                    CLEMENZA
               (English)
          See, Brother Carmello, even the
          church makes numbers.

                    PRIEST
               (English)
          It's only the way we collect that's
          different.

Vito has left while Clemenza jokes with the Priest.

EXT. FESTA STREET - NIGHT

Vito passes the booths of food, crossing toward a small and
dark club.

INT. SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT

We can still HEAR the crowds and music of the festa.  Vito
enters; the club is empty, except for the large white figure
sitting alone at a small table.  Fanucci barely acknowledges
Vito as he joins him.

Without a word, Vito counts out two hundred dollars on the
table.  Fanucci looks, then takes off his fedora and puts it
on the table over the money.

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
          I think there's only two hundred
          dollars under my hat.
               (he peeks)
          I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          I'm a little short.  I've been out
          of work.  Let me owe you the money
          for a few weeks.

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
          Ah, you're a sharp young fellow.
          How is it I've never noticed you
          before
               (he takes the two
               hundred and pours
               some wine for Vito)
          You're too quiet for your own
          interest.  I could find some work
          for you to do that would be very
          profitable.
               (he rises)
          No hard feelings, eh?  If I can
          ever do you a service let me know.
          You've done a good job for yourself
          tonight.

EXT. FESTA STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

By now the musicians have left, but still families are
walking the street, and stopping at the booths.

Fanucci stands there a moment; he is known by everyone, and
considers himself highly loved.

Then Fanucci begins the walk through the festa, on his way
home.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito silently moves along the rooftop; paralleling Fanucci's
walk.

We HEAR the sounds of the festa, and every so often catch a
glimpse of the patterned lights, and the crowds below.

EXT. FESTA STREETS - MOVING VIEW ON FANUCCI - NIGHT

walking through the crowded streets.  The statue of San
Gennaro is arranged in some midnight religious ceremony.

The VIEW LIFTS UP, to the rooftops.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Vito makes the leap that separates two buildings; then
crosses toward the large skylight in the center of the
building.

EXT. THE STREETS - NIGHT

The procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys;
and the glittering Monstrance, something of an altar carried
out into the streets.

The priest begins this nocturnal service, as the crowds in
the street kneel down in prayer.

INT. FANUCCI'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Fanucci unlocks the door to his building; we can HEAR the
services in the background.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Vito tries the trap door on the roof; it is stuck firmly
shut; despite Clemenza's instructions.  He struggles with
it, but no luck.

From the distance, the Choir begins to Latin.  Vito moves
around the skylight, to an identical trap, tries this one;
it opens.

EXT. THE MONSTRANCE - MED. VIEW ON THE PRIEST - NIGHT

performing the services in Latin.  The ten altar boys are in
attendance.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Vito reaches down into the trap, and pulls out the newly
oiled gun that has been left for him.  He slides down into
the building.

INT. FANUCCI'S HALLWAY - DOWN ANGLE - NIGHT

Fanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud, heavy steps.
An OLD WOMAN on one of the flights sees him, and immediately
moves to her apartment.

                    FANUCCI
               (Sicilian)
          What's the matter, Signora?  You
          don't say 'good evening'?

                    WOMAN
               (Sicilian)
          'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci.

She quickly disappears behind her door.  Fanucci laughs,
continues up, singing to himself.  The MASS outside is
always in evidence.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Vito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear
door open.  He slips in, and makes his way past the open
windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the
Mass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut.

He moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.

WHAT HE SEES:

Three young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking.

VIEW ON VITO

A slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside
to the alley where he can look into the apartment.

ANOTHER VIEW

Fanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

He begins to wrap the gun.

VIEW ON THE DAUGHTERS

Their father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious
gift he has bought for each.

CLOSE ON THE GUN

wrapped in this primitive method of a silencer.  The VIEW
TILTS to Vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all
or none of them.  Then something catches his eye.

WHAT HE SEES:

A small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes
up to him and rubs itself against him.  Vito rubs the
animal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its
confidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's
apartment.

He steps back, holding the gun.  We HEAR some Italian
shouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of
the thumping footsteps of Fanucci.

VIEW ON VITO

holding the wrapped gun, waiting.

WHAT HE SEES:

The white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in
Italian as he throws the cat out.

VIEW ON VITO

squeezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST
resounding in the building.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

He holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying
to reach for his gun.  The force of his struggle has torn
the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose.  His gun
is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront
of his stomach.  Carefully, as if plunging a needle into
this vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet.

Fanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a
terrible groan.  We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside
the apartment.

Vito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred,
quickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek.
Now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire,
literally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the
ground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito moves like a cat along the rooftops; we HEAR the
conclusion of the Mass down below.

CLOSE ON VITO

Pausing; we can SEE the great spectacle of lights and
candles on the streets below.

He empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against
the side of the roof ledge.  He reverses it in his hand, and
breaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney.
He smashes it again, and the pistol breaks into barrel and
handle, two separate pieces.

He then moves along the rooftop, dropping the two separate
fragments into various air shafts.

EXT. THE STREET PROCESSION - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

The Priest, having completed the ceremony, follows as the
Monstrance is carried off through the streets, as the Choir
sings.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito is a dark figure, moving with agility across the
rooftops.

INT. FANUCCI'S VESTIBULE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The corpse that was Fanucci, stained with blood.

EXT. PROCESSION - CLOSE VIEW - NIGHT

The statue of San Gennaro, followed by the altar boys.

EXT. CORLEONE TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito's wife; her baby and several friends and neighbors sit
happily on the front stoop of their tenement.  Some of the
men drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR
the music and night sounds of the Festa.

A neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song.

Quietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance
from his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of
wine, and listens to the song.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

listening to the song.  He reaches out and takes the small
hand of his son.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          Santino, your papa loves you.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ANTHONY'S TAHOE ROOM - NIGHT

The room is large, lit from the outside by a bright evening.
We can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built
along the wall.  We see the dark figure of Michael Corleone
enter the room and approach the bed where his son Anthony
lies curled in messy blankets.  Michael quietly arranges his
small hands and feet and covers the little boy.  Suddenly,
Anthony turns, his eyes open.  He is staring, perfectly
awake, at his father.

                    MICHAEL
          Can't you sleep?

No answer.

                    MICHAEL
          Are you alright?

                    ANTHONY
          Yes.

                    MICHAEL
          Did you like your party?

                    ANTHONY
          I got lots of presents.

                    MICHAEL
          Do you like them?

                    ANTHONY
          I didn't know the people who gave
          them to me.

                    MICHAEL
          They were friends.

He kisses his boy, and then turns.

                    ANTHONY
          Did you see my present for you?

                    MICHAEL
          No, where is it?

                    ANTHONY
          On your pillow.

                    MICHAEL
          I'm leaving very early tomorrow,
          before you wake up.

                    ANTHONY
          I know.  How long will you be gone?

                    MICHAEL
          Just a few days.

                    ANTHONY
          Will you take me?

                    MICHAEL
          I can't.

                    ANTHONY
          Why do you have to go?

                    MICHAEL
          To do business.

                    ANTHONY
          I can help you.

                    MICHAEL
          Some day you will.

Michael kisses him again.

INT. MICHAEL-KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is lit from a small night lamp on Michael's side of
the large bed.

Kay is huddled in blankets, asleep.  Michael closes the door
to his room, moves to his side of the bed, and glances down
to the pillow.

VIEW ON THE PILLOW

is a child's drawing of a long limousine, with a man in a
hat sitting in the back seat.

An arrow pointing to him is marked "DAD." Under it, a nine
year old's handwriting says: "Do you like it?  Check YES __
I liked it or NO __ I didn't like it." Michael turns,
looking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he
places a check next to "YES."

He starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay
turns, almost in her sleep:

                    KAY
          Michael?  Why are the drapes open?

His eyes dart back to the curved, beautifully leaded windows
of the room.  The DRAPES are opened.  Then, without a
second's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding
his son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep
across the windows; glass shattering all over the room.

Kay screams out; rising, still half-asleep.  Michael crawls
toward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him.

Then, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the
shouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as
guards with flashlights come running.

Michael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived,
and then gently:

                    MICHAEL
          Go with the kids.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT

Suddenly, the great floodlights are turned on, bathing lawns
in an intense blue light.

Groups of ordinarily dressed security men drawn in from all
directions; a state of confusion prevails.  There is no sign
of the attackers.

VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE

Michael is joined by Rocco Lampone, his gun drawn.

                    ROCCO
          They're still on the property.
          Maybe you better stay inside.

                    MICHAEL
          Keep them alive.

Six men take up posts by Michael's house.

                    ROCCO
          We'll try.

                    MICHAEL
          It's important.

He returns inside.

EXT. MAIN GATE AND KENNELS - NIGHT

The character of the summer estate has changed: bright
floodlights illuminate the main points of entry: the main
gate; the waterway; the stone wall that encompasses the
estate on all sides.

Several men with flashlights reinforce the guard at the main
gate.

FULL VIEW

Off in the distance, we see another group of men with
flashlights combing the waterline.  We hear indistinguishable
shouts.

VIEW ON THE KENNELS

The wire gates are opened, and the trained dogs go out
yelping into the outer edge of the estate.

ROOFTOP

One of Rocco's men turns the large floodlight scanning
darkened forest areas, where men could hide.

MOVING VIEW

Men with flashlights and dogs.  Moving through the dark areas.

LOOSE VIEW

A small Corleone launch, with a bright spotlight slowly
cruises the boundaries of the estate.  We SEE the silhouette
of men with guns, quietly waiting and watching.

EXT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Some of the bodyguards by the shattered windows of Michael's
bedroom.

The curtains are drawn from inside.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kay, the children, and some women servants have come down
from the various rooms into the central living area, that
can be most easily secured.  The little girl is still
asleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with
their blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a
central room.

Michael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:

                    MICHAEL
          It will be all right.  We were lucky.

She says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels
over the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in.  She
holds her young daughter in her arms.

The door opens, and Rocco enters.  He quickly realizes he is
holding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and
puts it away.  Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance
away from Kay.

                    ROCCO
          Your family all seem to be okay in
          the other houses; your Mother's
          still sleeping.

                    MICHAEL
          And?

                    ROCCO
          No sign of them yet; but they're
          still on the Estate.

We HEAR loud shouting from outside.

                    DEANNA (O.S.)
          Goddamn you!  You're all nuts here,
          I'm not goin' to calm down...

MICHAEL'S VIEW

Through the door, that Rocco opens.

Deanna, in her nightgown, has been frightened by the
gunshots; while Fredo in his bathrobe, tries to get her back
into the house.

                    FREDO
          Deanna, will you get back into the
          house!

                    DEANNA
          I'm getting out of here I said;
          these guys all have guns!

                    MICHAEL
          Fredo, can't you shut that woman up!
               (to Rocco's men)
          Get her in here!

The bodyguards, gracefully help Fredo bring the hysterical
Deanna into the safety of the house.

                    DEANNA
               (whimpering)
          I don't want to stay here...

                    FREDO
          Mike, what can I do, she's a
          hysterical woman...

                    KAY
          Leave her alone!  You're talking as
          though she has no right to be
          frightened when there are machine
          guns going off in her backyard.

                    MICHAEL
               (to Rocco)
          Have Tom Hagen meet me in the
          Harbor House.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

Michael walks the short distance from his house, to the
boathouse where he conducts his business away from his family.

A small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the
walk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away.
It gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his
compound, followed by teams of Secret Service men.

The boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily
wakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure
where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of
emergency.

FULL VIEW

In the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with
their lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the
estate.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - EMPTY VIEW - NIGHT

Michael alone in the great room.  He moves to a walk-in
safe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it.
He takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket;
there's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters.  He had been
asleep, and has quickly thrown on a robe.

                    MICHAEL
          Sit down, Tom.

EXT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

From outside the leaded windows, a disoriented Hagen sits
down; Michael starts to talk to him; obviously about
something very serious.

The patrol securing the boathouse, walk past the window.
Michael says something to Tom, who rises, and pulls the
drapes, obscuring OUR VIEW.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Michael talks intimately to Tom.

                    MICHAEL
          There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.
          I know that's upset you in the
          past; and you've felt that it was
          because of some lack of trust or
          confidence.  But it is because I do
          trust you that I've kept so much
          secret from you.  It's precisely
          that at this moment, you are the
          only one that I can completely
          trust.  In time, you'll understand
          everything.

                    HAGEN
               (nods with this statement)
          But your people... Neri... Rocco;
          you don't think...

                    MICHAEL
          No, I have confidence in their
          loyalty... but this is life and
          death, and Tom, you are my brother.

Hagen in very moved.

                    HAGEN
          Mikey, I hoped...

                    MICHAEL
          No Tom, just listen.  All my people
          are businessmen; their loyalty is
          based on that.  One thing I learned
          from my father is to try to think
          as the people around you think...and
          on that basis, anything is possible.
          Fredo has a good heart, but he is
          weak...and stupid, and stupid
          people are the most dangerous of
          all.  I've kept you out of things,
          Tom, because I've always known that
          your instincts were legitimate, and
          I wanted you to know very little of
          things that would make you an
          accomplice, for your own protection.
          I never blamed you for the setbacks
          the family took under Sonny; I know
          you were in a position of limited
          power, and you did your best to
          advise and caution him.  What I am
          saying is that now, for how long I
          do not know, you will be the Don.
          If what I think has happened is
          true; I will leave tonight, and
          absolutely no one will know how to
          contact me.  And even you are not
          to try to reach me unless it is
          absolutely necessary.  I give you
          complete power: over Neri... Fredo,
          everyone.  I am trusting you with
          the lives of my wife and children,
          and the future of this family,
          solely resting on your judgment and
          talent.

VIEW ON HAGEN

A man who has steadily declined over the last five years,
realizing that total power and responsibility is being
placed on him.

                    MICHAEL
               (continuing)
          ...But Tom, you must know that I do
          this only because I believe you are
          the only one who is capable of
          taking over for me.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

taking out the envelope.

                    MICHAEL
          I've prepared this; have had it for
          over a month.  It won't explain
          everything; but indicates where I
          will be, so in a sense, it is my
          life.
               (he hands the envelope
               to Hagen)
          Also, there are three tasks that
          must be executed immediately.  Pop
          would have given those to Luca --
          You knew Pop as well as anyone, act
          as though you were him.  It
          discusses Kay as well; that will be
          the most difficult.  The men who
          tried to kill me tonight, will
          never leave the estate.

                    HAGEN
          Will we...be able to get who
          ordered it out of them?

                    MICHAEL
          I don't think so.  Unless I'm very
          wrong...they're already dead.
          Killed by someone inside...very
          frightened that they botched it.
          That's why I am going to disappear
          in a few minutes, and leave
          everything to you.

                    HAGEN
          But if you're wrong...

                    MICHAEL
          If I'm wrong...

There is a KNOCK on the door.

                    MICHAEL
          ...I don't think I'm wrong.
               (he indicates the knock)
          Yes.

The door opens; it is Rocco; Michael rises, after making a
knowing glance toward Tom, and moves to talk quietly to a
frightened and agitated Rocco.

EXT. STONE WALL AND STREAM - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

A group of men with flashlights and guns lead Michael, Tom
and Rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs
through the estate.

LOW CLOSE VIEW

Michael's dispassionate face, looking down.  THE VIEW MOVES
to Hagen's, and then down to the murky water under the
bridge, where we see the bodies of three strangers, lying in
the moving water; machine-type guns nearby, with their
throats cut.  Light from the many flashlights illuminates
the grotesque scene.

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
          Fish them out.

Several of the men wade down into the stream; Rocco helps,
and even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they
were.  They are total strangers; Rocco examines the type of
guns they used.

When they climb back onto the ground, Michael is gone.
Everyone notices it, but no one says anything.

Hagen stands there, holding the envelope Michael had given
him in his hand.

He realizes that now, he is the DON.

                    HAGEN
          Get rid of the bodies.  Tomorrow
          morning I want a report made to the
          local police, and paper, that some
          explosives we keep on the property
          were accidentally ignited.

The men respond; Hagen makes the lonely walk back to the
lighted section of the compound, which now resembles a
prison camp.

                                   FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. STATE SENATE FLOOR - DAY

The Senate is in session; Senator Geary is on the floor
during a vote.  An aide approaches him, with a slip of paper.

INT. GEARY'S OFFICE - DAY

The Senator steps behind his desk.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          All right, Mr. Hagen, you've got
          ten minutes.

He flicks the switch of a small tape recorder.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          ...and the tape will be running.

                    HAGEN
          Actually, I've come with good news;
          the Corleone family has done you a
          favor.

The Senator immediately shuts the tape recorder off.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          What the hell are you talking about?

                    HAGEN
          We know you're a busy man, with
          plenty of enemies -- we saw the
          opportunity to do you a favor, and
          we did.  No strings.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          No strings.

                    HAGEN
          You know there's a Senate
          Investigating Committee recently
          set up; we thought it would be
          unfortunate if they were to trace
          anything though-provoking to your
          name.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          No one can trace anything to me; I
          pride myself on that.

                    HAGEN
          Do you gamble?

                    SENATOR GEARY
          A little; what's so thought-
          provoking about that?

                    HAGEN
          Do you owe markers?

                    SENATOR GEARY
          Maybe two, three thousand dollars.

Hagen leans forward, and deposits a handful of paper on the
Senator's desk.

                    HAGEN
          The Corleone family has paid them
          off for you...as an expression of
          our esteem.

Geary quickly looks through the paid markers.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          There's thirty grand worth of paid
          off markers -- I never owed that
          much.

                    HAGEN
          Our mistake.  But what does it
          matter; it was our money.
               (rising)
          We don't even expect thanks.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          You paid off thirty grand I never
          owed.

                    HAGEN
          We'll keep it quiet; the people who
          know are trustworthy...the Committee
          needn't find out.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          And what's the price of their not
          finding out.

                    HAGEN
          Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not
          hostile.

                    SENATOR GEARY
               (he despises Hagen)
          Thanks...friend.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - FULL VIEW - DAY

There are more men on duty than usual; not that there are
guns apparent, but it's clear that the boundaries are being
patrolled.

VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE

Kay exits her house, followed by her children; she helps
them into her station wagon like any housewife, and drives
along the path leading to the main gate.

She's about to drive through, when one of the men steps in
front of her, raising his hand.

                    KAY
               (graciously)
          Yes.

                    MAN
          I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're
          not to let you through.

               (disbelieving)
          I'm going to the market.

                    MAN
          If you could just give us a list,
          we'll pick up anything you want.

                    KAY
          Whose orders are these?

                    MAN
          Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

We notice Hagen walking to them in the background.

                    HAGEN
          Kay.

VIEW THROUGH THE GATE

Hagen approaches the car; Kay gets out so they can talk away
from the children.

                    HAGEN
          I wanted to explain this myself...
          I had business in Carson City.

He walks with her a little way from the others; the children
run out of the station wagon, and start to play.

                    HAGEN
          It's Michael's request...for your
          safety.  We can send out for
          anything you need.

                    KAY
          I'm supposed to stay in my house.

                    HAGEN
          Within the compound will be fine.

                    KAY
          I was supposed to take the children
          to New England next week.

                    HAGEN
          That's off now.

                    KAY
          I'm going to see my parents.

                    HAGEN
          Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot;
          and what he did tell me, I can't
          repeat.  But the responsibility for
          you and the kids was the most
          important thing he left me with.

                    KAY
          How long does this go on?

                    HAGEN
          I don't know.
               (pause)
          I'm sorry, Kay...

                    KAY
          Am I a prisoner?

                    HAGEN
          That's not the way we look at it.

Angrily, without another word, Kay turns away from him, and
walks to her children, ignoring the running station wagon.

EXT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - DAY

The luxury liner making its way across the Atlantic.

INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - MED. VIEW - DAY

The PURSER followed by several white uniformed associates
knocks on the door of something designated the "Leonardo
Suite." He is holding a telegram.

The door opens, and a tanned Merle peeks out of the door.

                    PURSER
               (holding up the telegram)
          I'm terribly sorry to disturb you
          but we have received two telegrams.

                    MERLE
               (reluctantly)
          Well...come in.

This entourage enters the suite, an impressive and
beautifully spacious luxury suite.  Connie is relaxing.

                    CONNIE
          What is it?

                    PURSER
          Yes.  One is from our office in New
          York.  The check that you wrote for
          your passage has been returned.

                    CONNIE
          Can't be...

                    MERLE
          Why don't you wire your bank?

                    PURSER
          The other telegram is from your
          bank.  Your account has been closed
          and the company is warned not to
          extend any credit.

                    CONNIE
          I'll take care of it in Naples.

                    PURSER
          The company hopes so.  But for now,
          we have orders to change your
          accommodations.

And with that, the men in white begin to pack Connie and
Merle's luggage.

                    CONNIE
          That son of a bitch!

INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - TINY THIRD CLASS CABIN - NIGHT

Connie and Merle are attempting to sleep in the miniature
cabin in bunk beds.  The little space is crowded with their
trunks and luggage.  Merle can barely hang onto the bunk,
the boat pitches so violently below.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A train speeds across the countryside.

INT. THE TRAIN - DAY

Inside the corridor, a porter advances, and knocks on the
door of a stateroom.  A voice tells him to enter.  OUR VIEW
enters with him as he carries a tray of lunch.  From this
POV we see Michael Corleone sitting in the compartment.

                    PORTER
          Mr. Paul?

                    MICHAEL
          Yes.

                    PORTER
          You ordered lunch?

                    MICHAEL
          Put it right there.

The porter does so; as he places the tray down, he catches a
glimpse of a second person in the compartment with Michael.

HIS VIEW

A very fierce, almost maniacal looking man, BUSSETTA.  He
nods that the porter should leave.

                    MICHAEL
          Thank you.

The porter takes his advice and leaves quickly, closing the
door behind him.

VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW

Michael and his mysterious companion have lunch together on
the moving train.

EXT. GULFSTREAM RACE TRACK IN MIAMI - HIGH FULL VIEW - DAY

The empty parking lot of the Gulfstream track, on an off-
race day.

CLOSER VIEW

Michael sits behind the wheel of a nondescript late model
car.  Bussetta sits in the rear.

Another car swings into the lot.  Michael starts his car,
and pulls out of the lot; the second car following.

NEW VIEW

This car pulls out and begins to follow them.  Michael
glances back by adjusting the rear view mirror, and nods to
Bussetta.

Michael's car begins to slow down, allowing the other car to
overtake them.

The overtaking car hesitates a moment, moving side by side
with them.

Michael glances toward the driver.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

We recognize Johnny Ola, who waves a greeting to Michael,
and then continues on to lead him.

EXT. SUBURBAN MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Ola's car leads Michael's through a middle-class suburban
area of $30,000 to $40,000 homes.  There are small channels
with sporting and fishing boats parked near the houses.
Ola's car pulls up in front of a very simple, tract-type
home.  Michael's car parks nearby.

                    MICHAEL
               (Sicilian)
                (to Bussetta)
          You'll wait in the car.

Ola has gotten out of his car and walks up the little path
to the front door.  Michael waits.

Ola rings the bell, and after a moment, a rather pretty,
middle-aged WOMAN answers, remaining behind the screen door.
Ola says a few things to her and she disappears, leaving the
door open.

Ola comes down the steps, looks at Michael, nodding to him.
Ola then gets into his car and drives off.  Michael walks up
the walkway and enters the little house, closing the door
behind him.

This woman, TERRI ROTH, is in the kitchen, looking out at
Michael.

                    TERRI
          I'm just going to make lunch.  How
          about a tuna fish sandwich?

                    MICHAEL
          Thank you, Mrs. Roth.

She hurries halfway up the staircase.

                    TERRI
          Hyman...HYMAN, your friend is here.
               (turning to Michael)
          Why don't you go right upstairs, Mr.
          Paul?

                    MICHAEL
          Fine.

He continues upstairs; she goes into the kitchen.

                    TERRI
          I'll give a yell when lunch is ready.

Michael continues up to a small den on the second floor; we
can HEAR the sound of a baseball game coming over the
television.

INT. HYMAN ROTH'S DEN - DAY

Michael enters the den: it's very comfortable, but somewhat
like a senior citizen's retirement home in Florida.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

There, sitting before the television is a small man in his
middle sixties, thin, with a wizened face, looking like a
small-time retired Jewish businessman.  This is HYMAN ROTH.

                    ROTH
          Sit down, this is almost over.  You
          follow the baseball games?

                    MICHAEL
          Not for a few years.

                    ROTH
          I like sporting events -- I really
          enjoy watching them in the afternoon.
          One of the things I love about this
          country.  I loved baseball ever
          since Arnold Rothstein fixed the
          World Series of 1919...I heard you
          had some trouble.

                    MICHAEL
          Yes.

                    ROTH
          What a mistake; people behaving
          like that, with guns.
               (he shakes his head)
          It was my understanding we left all
          that behind.  But, let me tell you,
          the important thing is that you're
          all right.  Good health is the most
          important thing; more than success;
          more than power; more than money.

                    MICHAEL
          The incident of the other night is
          a nuisance that I can take care of.
          I came to you because I want
          nothing to affect our agreement; I
          wanted to clear everything I'm
          going to do with you, just in case.

                    ROTH
          You're a considerate young man.

                    MICHAEL
          You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I
          have much to learn from you.

                    ROTH
               (warmly)
          However I can help you...

                    MICHAEL
          The Rosato Brothers have performed
          services for you in the past; I
          understand that they are under your
          protection.

                    ROTH
               (simply)
          We do favors for each other...

                    MICHAEL
          Technically, they are still under
          the Clemenza wing of the Corleone
          Family, now run by Frankie
          Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died,
          the Rosatos wanted territory of
          their own.  Pentangeli refused, and
          came to me, asking for permission
          to eliminate them.  I, of course,
          knew of their relationship with
          you, and in gratitude for your help
          with the Tropicana matter, turned
          him down.  Pentangeli was furious,
          and paid one hundred and fifty
          thousand dollars to have me killed.
          I was lucky and he was stupid.
          I'll visit him soon.
               (leaning toward the
               old man, sincerely)
          The important thing is that nothing
          jeopardize our plans, yours and
          mine.  This thing of ours, that we
          will build.

The old man touches Michael's hand, warmly.

                    ROTH
          Nothing is more important.

                    MICHAEL
               (quietly)
          Pentangeli is a dead man; do you
          object?

                    ROTH
          It's always bad for business; but
          you have no choice.

                    MICHAEL
          Then it's done.  I must choose his
          replacement: it cannot be Rosato.

                    ROTH
          Of course you must keep control of
          your family.

He turns to Michael, turning the volume higher on the
television, and moving closer to his young partner.

                    ROTH
          Michael, these things are
          unimportant.  Who should be the
          manager of a dime store, Joe or
          Jack?  Unimportant.  You do what
          you think is right.  You're a young
          man, and I'm old and sick.  What we
          do together in the next few months
          will be history, Michael; it has
          never been done before.  We will do
          this historical thing together, and
          even your Father could never dream
          it would be possible.  We are
          bigger than U.S. Steel, you and
          me... because in America, anything
          is possible!
               (pause)
          But soon I will be dead, and it
          will all belong to you.

There is a KNOCK on the door, and Terri Roth pushes the door
open with her hip.

                    TERRI
          My goodness, you'll rupture your
          eardrums, Hyman.

She puts the tray down, and turns down the television.

EXT. ROTH'S HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

The sinister Bussetta waits patiently in the rear seat of
the car, outside Roth's modest house.

EXT. DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - MOVING VIEW - DAY

A black Cadillac moves down the street, slowed by the
Festivities of the Festa that is in progress: people milling
around, buying souvenirs at the many stands set up.

Sausage and grilled meats are prepared, just as they were
years ago.  Electric lights are strung from the street
lamps, and brightly colored banners pronounce the "Festa of
the Madonna."

MOVING CLOSE VIEW

Willy Cicci drives, frustrated that he cannot go any faster.
Next to him, Frankie Pentangeli sits, catching a few seconds'
snooze.

MED. VIEW

The black car pulls up; another car that had been following
it parks nearby.

One of Pentangeli's button men gets out of the car, and
steps into a small Italian restaurant; he exits quickly, and
nods affirmatively toward Pentangeli's Cadillac.

The group of them step out quickly, men huddled around
Pentangeli, and enter the restaurant.

INT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY

The restaurant is quite empty, despite the excitement out on
the street.

Pentangeli immediately sits at a table with a tall, dark,
snappily dressed young man, CARMINE ROSATO.

Nearby, on the other side of the room is Rosato's brother,
TONY, seated with a group of their men.

At another table in the restaurant is a table of Pentangeli's
people: they are joined by bodyguards.

                    PENTANGELI
          Rosato, where's your brother?

                    ROSATO
          Sitting right behind you.

Pentangeli glances behind himself.

                    PENTANGELI
          He don't want to talk?

                    ROSATO
          We worked it all out beforehand.

                    PENTANGELI
          Are we going to eat or what?

                    ROSATO
          Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.

                    PENTANGELI
               (sarcastically)
          Forget it; I'm suddenly without an
          appetite.  You're making big
          trouble, Carmine.

                    ROSATO
          You weren't straight with us,
          Frankie, what else could we do?

                    PENTANGELI
          We could have talked first, saved a
          lot of running around.

                    ROSATO
          You wasn't listening, you didn't
          want to talk.

                    PENTANGELI
          Don't I look like I'm listening?

                    ROSATO
          We want Brooklyn one hundred
          percent.  No more taxes to you.  We
          want to be only loosely connected
          with your family -- sort of a
          under-family all of our own.  Then
          we can act on all internal matters
          without talking.  Also we want you
          to inform Michael Corleone that we
          can deal directly with him.

                    PENTANGELI
          I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll
          order something.  Joe.
               (one of his men)
          Get me some bracciole or something.
          And pay cash.
               (to Rosato)
          And in return for these concessions,
          what do you do for me?

                    ROSATO
          We will release the hostages,
          number one.  Number two, we're here
          for you to count on when you need
          us.  We're independent, but we're
          here if you need us.  In general,
          we'll cooperate with you and your
          businesses, and you in turn will
          cooperate with us.  Pari persu.

                    PENTANGELI
          Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari
          persu...?

                    ROSATO
          My lawyer went over this beforehand.

                    PENTANGELI
          What assurances do I have that
          there will be no more kidnapping,
          no more hits?

                    ROSATO
          The same assurance we got from you.

                    PENTANGELI
          What if I say shove it?

                    ROSATO
          Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue
          DeRosa will need to be fitted for
          slabs.

                    PENTANGELI
          You want a war?

                    ROSATO
          We got no choice.

                    PENTANGELI
          You know if there's a way I'll go
          to the commission and the commission
          will side with me.  That puts me
          and the other New York families
          against you.

                    ROSATO
          We got friends in the commission.

                    PENTANGELI
               (getting angry)
          I'm talking about Italians!

                    ROSATO
          What about Michael Corleone?

                    PENTANGELI
          He supports me.

                    ROSATO
          Maybe, yes... maybe no.

One of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian
food.

Pentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he
pushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's
hands.

                    PENTANGELI
          You drove old Pete Clemenza to his
          grave, Carmine; you and your
          brother.  Turning on him; trouble
          in his territories -- you and your
          demands.  I hold you responsible,
          just as though you shot him in the
          head.  And I ain't gonna let that
          go for long!

Pentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little
tension between the bodyguards of the two factions.

                    ROSATO (O.S.)
          Hey, Five-Angels...

He gives him the arm.

Frankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here
and now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make
their move out.

EXT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY

Pentangeli gets into the car.

                    PENTANGELI
          Nobody I hate calls me Five-Angels
          to my face!

He slams the door.

EXT. PENTANGELI'S LONG BEACH ESTATE - DAY

Part of the old estate of Don Corleone.  By now, the wall
has been torn down, and the other houses sold off.

His car is parked; Pentangeli steps out, still angry over
the confrontation.  As he approaches the house, he notices
something strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard
his house.  No one seems to want to tell him.

                    PENTANGELI
          What's up?

Pentangeli glances over to the front door foyer.

PENTANGELI'S VIEW

The strange and silent Bussetta, the man who now always
travels with Michael.

INT. PENTANGELI'S HOUSE - DAY

Pentangeli enters; he sees his WIFE, standing oddly in the
hallway.

                    PENTANGELI
               (Sicilian)
          What's this?

                    WIFE
          Michael Corleone.

                    PENTANGELI
          One Michael Corleone...Dove?

                    WIFE
               (Sicilian)
          He's in your study.

He knows it is very very serious for Michael to be here in
his home.

He automatically moves into his study.

INT. PENTANGELI'S STUDY - DAY

Michael stands quietly in the room.  This was once his
father's study, although it is totally redecorated.
Pentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don,
and kisses his hand.

                    PENTANGELI
          Don Corleone, I wish you let me
          know you was coming.  We could have
          prepared something for you.

                    MICHAEL
          I didn't want you to know I was
          coming.  You heard what happened in
          my home?

                    PENTANGELI
          Michael, yes, we was all relieved...

                    MICHAEL
               (furious)
          In my home!  In the same room where
          my wife was sleeping; where my
          children come in their pajamas, and
          play with their toys.

He's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as
suddenly, he talks quietly, calmly.

                    MICHAEL
          I want you to help me take my
          revenge.

                    PENTANGELI
          Michael, anything.  What is it I
          can do for you?

                    MICHAEL
          I want you to settle these troubles
          with the Rosato Brothers.

                    PENTANGELI
          I was just going to contact you,
          Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' -
          in fact, I just come from there.

                    MICHAEL
          I want you to settle on their terms.

                    PENTANGELI
          Mike, I don't understand.  Don't
          ask me to do that.

                    MICHAEL
          Trust me; do as I ask.

                    PENTANGELI
          It would be the beginning of the
          end for my family.  How can I keep
          all my other territories in like if
          I let two wise-guys stand up and
          demand this and that, and then give
          it to them?

                    MICHAEL
          Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I
          have your loyalty?

                    PENTANGELI
          Always... But sometimes I don't
          understand.  I know I'll never have
          your kind of brains, in big deals.
          But Mike, this is a street thing.
          And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind
          the Rosato Brothers.

                    MICHAEL
          I know.

                    PENTANGELI
          Then why do you want me to lay down
          to them?

                    MICHAEL
               (coldly, but convincing)
          Frankie, Roth tried to have me
          killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I
          don't know yet why.

                    PENTANGELI
          Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's
          hit 'em now, while we still got the
          muscle.

                    MICHAEL
          This was my father's old study.
          When I was a kid, we had to be
          quiet when we played near here.
          When I was older, I learned many
          things from him here.  I was happy
          that this house never went to
          strangers; first Clemenza took it
          over, and then you.  My father
          taught me, in this room, never to
          act until you know everything
          that's behind things.  Never.  If
          Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
          with you in the Rosato Brothers'
          favor, he'll think his relationship
          with me is still sound.  I'm going
          somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We
          have friends in some very important
          business that we're making.  Do
          this for me; you make the peace
          with the Rosato Brothers on their
          terms.  Let the word out that I
          forced you; you're not happy wit
          hit, but acquiesced, just because
          of me.  It will get back to Hyman
          Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can
          trust me.

                    PENTANGELI
          Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.

                    MICHAEL
          Good.

They embrace; Michael kisses him.  He looks at the young
Don, thoughtfully.

INT. TROPICANA HOTEL - CLOSE VIEW - DAY

The money trays are carefully unloaded from the gaming
tables, and put on a cart with others.

The cart, preceded and followed by security guards, is then
wheeled through the casino, into a private, counting room.

INT. COUNTING ROOM - MED. VIEW - DAY

The guards leave the room; the door is locked after them,
leaving only Hagen.  Neri and an ACCOUNTANT, a very fat man.
The numbered boxes are opened, and cash and checks are
spread out on the counting table.

The accountant begins with amazing speed and skill, to count
and divide the money.

                    NERI
          Fifteen percent skim?

                    HAGEN
          Twenty-five this time.

The accountant stops, and looks up to Neri.

                    NERI
          It might show.

                    HAGEN
          Mike wants it.

Neri nods, and the accountant continues.  Neri opens a door,
allowing a sandy-haired man, a COURIER, into the room.  The
cream is placed into his pouch personally by Neri.

                    NERI
          We've never sent this much with one
          courier.

                    HAGEN
               (to the courier)
          Your plans are a little different
          this time.  You skip Miami, and go
          straight to Geneva.  It's to be
          deposited to this number.
               (handing him a small envelope)
          And it's got to be there by Monday
          morning, no slip-up.

                    COURIER
          I think I was 'picked-up' last trip.
          That hour layover I had at Kennedy.
          I went over and bought a paper...

Neri has finished putting the 'creamed' money into the pouch.

                    NERI
          Those were our people.

                    COURIER
          Okay, just thought you should know.

He is just about to close and lock the pouch, when Hagen
gestures that he should wait, and adds more stacks of
carefully packaged bills into the pouch.  Then Neri locks
it, and handcuffs it to the courier's arm, looking
inquiringly at Hagen.

                    HAGEN
          Let them count.

The courier is shown out through a private door, and then
the first door is opened.  Two accountants come in with the
guards, and the trays are opened, and the counting process
is begun all over again, this time with the State Tally
sheets.

INT. TROPICANA CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW - DAY

The courier continues on his way; followed by Hagen and Neri.

                    NERI
          What's up?

                    HAGEN
          No questions.

                    NERI
          I got to ask questions, Tom,
          there's three million dollars cash
          in that pouch; Mike is gone and I
          have no word from him.

                    HAGEN
          Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm
          the Don.

                    NERI
          How do I know you haven't gone into
          business for yourself?

This hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he
owes Neri some explanation.

                    HAGEN
          You've been through a lot with us
          so I'm going to give you the truth.
          Mike knows it was someone within
          the compound that set him up for
          that hit.  So nobody is to know
          where he is, not you, not Rocco,
          not even his brother Fredo.  Sorry,
          Al, I know how you feel about
          Mike...but he still remembers Tessio.

EXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT

Michael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock.  He is
followed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped
onto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser.  The crew cast
off various ropes, and the boat sets out into the night.

                                   FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

A seaplane lands nicely by the private Corleone harbor;
Hagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase.
He continues down the ramp, past several Buttonmen, dressed
in summer casual attire, and who resemble secret service men
rather than thugs.

His wife THERESA lies on a blanket on the great lawn, with
her youngest children, who run to their father for a kiss.

                    THERESA
          Hungry?

                    HAGEN
          Just a little.

                    THERESA
          I've invited Mama, Sandra and the
          kids for barbecue.

                    HAGEN
          What about Kay?

                    THERESA
          I couldn't find her.  She's been so
          broody, sticks to herself.

EXT. TAHOE LAWN BARBECUE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Hagen and Sonny's boys are throwing a football around on the
lawn; the littler kids running after them.

Coals are burning in the old style stone barbecue, and
several tables are set for the family.

In the distance, there is always evidence of the bodyguards.

Theresa, Mama and Sandra prepare the steaks.

Hagen relaxes in a sports shirt.

                    HAGEN
          Let me try Kay.

He crosses the lawn, to the house on the beach where Michael
and his family live.  Is about to knock on the door:

                    HAGEN'S SON
          Hey, Pop, heads up!

The football is flying in his direction; he catches it and
throws it back.  Then he cracks the door open, and peeks in.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

                    HAGEN
          Kay?

He steps in, the beautiful summer living room is neat, but
empty.

                    HAGEN
          Anyone hungry?

He moves through the house more quickly; into the dining and
recreation room areas.  A cat jumps off a pile of cushions
and runs across the room.

                    HAGEN
          Hello?

                    SANDRA (O.S.)
          She's gone, Tom.

Sandra has followed him into Michael's house.

                    HAGEN
          What do you mean gone?

                    SANDRA
          The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came
          by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried
          to say she wasn't in, but Kay
          spotted them and asked if they
          would take her and the kids for a
          ride.  That was three hours ago.

                    HAGEN
               (furious)
          Why didn't someone tell me!

                    SANDRA
          I wanted to tell you alone; your
          wife doesn't know what's going on.

Hagen rushes out of the house.

EXT. TAHOE LAWN - DAY

Hagen moves quickly out of Michael's house; moving across
the lawn to the boathouse.

                    HAGEN'S SON
          Hey, Dad!

This time he ignores the thrown ball, and moves directly to
Rocco, who is by some men near the boathouse.

                    HAGEN
          Rocco!

                    ROCCO
          I know.  I went down to the Barrett
          house.  But she's gone.  They drove
          her and the kids to North Tahoe
          airport.

                    HAGEN
          Goddamn it, where were you?

                    ROCCO
          I was in my house.  Willy tried,
          but it would have taken some
          strong-arm to stop her, and he
          figured you wouldn't want that.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

They enter the boathouse.

                    HAGEN
               (to one of the men)
          Get me a Scotch and water.

The man hurries behind the bar.

                    ROCCO
          She took a flight to San Francisco.
          We figure she's going to connect to
          New Hampshire; her parents' place.

                    HAGEN
               (almost to himself)
          I can't let him down.

He swallows the drink down in several gulps.  And then looks
up to his men watching him.  He's embarrassed to have shown
such weakness.

                    HAGEN
          All right, let me think a minute.

Rocco clears the men out.

                    ROCCO
          Me too, Tom?

                    HAGEN
          Yeah, give me a minute.

Rocco gone, Hagen moves behind the enormous bar, and pours
himself a giant drink.  He drinks that, and calms himself.

                    HAGEN
          Oh Christ, Pop.  It was so good
          when you were alive.  I felt I
          could handle anything...

EXT. VIEW FROM BOAT - FULL VIEW - DAY

A beautiful coastal view of a tropical Caribbean city.  An
extraordinary view, high buildings, palm trees, all set
right on the bay.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

on the cruiser, Bussetta a little distance away, watching,
but never speaking.  The dark-skinned CAPTAIN of the cruiser
keeps pointing repeatedly.

                    CAPTAIN
          Habana, Habana.

EXT. HAVANA STREET - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Michael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making
its way through the streets of Havana.

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out the window.

MICHAEL'S POV

Crowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the
tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans
walking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we
see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat,
carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all
of these street impressions, the city is booming with
activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and
pimps and little children begging in the streets.

MED. VIEW

The big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is
sitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in
the back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees
four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their
hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry.
The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away
in Spanish.

INT. HAVANA CASINO LOBBY - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Michael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the
hotel, done in Spanish style, apparently just recently
completed.  He is approached by a thin, mousy man, SAM ROTH,
who ushers him toward the casino entrance.

                    SAM ROTH
          Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth.
          Welcome to the Capri; my brother's
          upstairs.  You wanta take a rest
          before you see him, or can I get
          you something, anything at all?

                    MICHAEL
          No, I'm fine.

He leads Michael into the main casino.

                    SAM ROTH
          This is it!  We think it makes
          Vegas look like the corner crap game.

                    MICHAEL
          Very impressive.

                    SAM ROTH
          Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike,
          I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he
          manages the casino for us.

                    COHEN
               (appreciating
               Michael's status)
          Mr. Corleone.

Sam turns to Bussetta and extends his glad-hand.

                    SAM ROTH
          Pleasure to meet you, I'm sure...

He gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

An extremely tall, well-built Cuban, tanned and wearing an
attractive mustache, LEON, in his middle forties, reads from
a prepared paper.  His sentences are translated by a smaller
man, standing to his rear.

                    LEON
               (Spanish)
          Most respected gentlemen, allow me
          to welcome you to the City of
          Havana, the Republic of Cuba on
          behalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio
          Batista.

THE VIEW BEGINS TO MOVE along the various men gathered for
this meeting.

                    LEON (O.S.)
          I'd like to thank this distinguished
          group of American Industrialists,
          for continuing to work with Cuba,
          for the greatest period of
          prosperity in her entire history.
          Mr. William Proxmiro, representing
          the General Fruit Company... Messrs.
          Corngold and Dant, of the United
          Telephone and Telegraph Company; Mr.
          Petty, regional Vice-President of
          the Pan American Mining Corporation;
          and, of course, our friend Mr.
          Robert Allen, of South American
          Sugar.  Mr. Nash of the American
          State Department.  And Mr. Hyman
          Roth of Miami, and Michael Corleone
          of Nevada representing our
          Associates in Tourism and Leisure
          Activities.

VIEW ON THE ENTIRE GROUP

Leon pauses to take a drink of water.  Then proudly, he
lifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see.

                    LEON
          The President would like to take
          this opportunity to thank U T&T for
          their lovely gift: a solid gold
          telephone!  He thought all you
          gentlemen would care to take a look
          at it.

He hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides, and it is
passed in turn to each of the men in attendance.

                    CORNGOLD
          Your Excellency, perhaps you could
          discuss the status of rebel activity
          and how this may affect our
          businesses.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

He receives the telephone, and glances at it before passing
it on to Hyman Roth.

                    LEON (O.S.)
          Of course.  The rebel movement is
          basically unpopular, and since July
          of 1958 has been contained in the
          Oriente Province, in the mountains
          of the Sierra Muestre.

Michael passes the phone on to Roth.

                    LEON
               (continuing)
          We began a highly successful
          offensive against them in March,
          and activities within the city
          itself are at a minimum.  I can
          assure you we'll tolerate no
          guerrillas in the casinos or
          swimming pools!

General subdued laughter.

A CUBAN STREET - LATE DAY

Police are stopping traffic.  Michael's Mercury is among the
cars; a police officer, seeing that some important person is
being driven, walks up to the driver.  He leans forward, and
says something in Spanish to the driver.

The driver, in turn, leans over to Michael.

                    DRIVER
          He says it will just be a short
          time and they'll let us through.

Michael looks out the window.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

The old building has been totally surrounded by police and
military vehicles.  Right at this moment, they are waiting
lazily, but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready.
There is a momentary commotion inside the building, and the
men brace up.  A Captain of the Army detachment says
something in Spanish over a megaphone; and his men put their
weapons at the ready, as other policemen lead a group of
civilians out of the building with their hands up.

They are moved over to some military truck, where they are
frisked before being loaded.

All of a sudden, one of the civilian rebels breaks loose,
and rushes toward the command vehicle.  He hurls himself
into the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out.  A
second later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously
having hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own
life to take the life of the Captain.

There is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it.

EXT. HAVANA COUNTRY CLUB - CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Some glasses; rum is poured into them; then Coca Cola.
Quarter limes are squeezed.

                    SAM ROTH (O.S.)
          Rum... Coca Cola...a squeeze of
          fresh lime...

Sam prepares the drinks for his brother, Hyman, and a group
of men, including Michael.

                    MAN
          Cuba Libres.

                    MICHAEL
          I was told the Cubans now call this
          drink: "La Mentira."

                    ROTH
          I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.

                    MICHAEL
          It means... "The Lie."

A moment's hesitation, then a few of the men laugh.  Now two
Cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake
on it.

                    SAM ROTH
          The cake is here.

They all raise their glasses to the old man.

                    EVERYONE
               (ad lib)
          Happy Birthday!

Roth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased.

                    ROTH
          I hope my age is correct: I am
          always accurate about my age.

Some laugh.  He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece
on plates, and carry them to the different men.

                    ROTH
          Everything we've learned in Vegas
          is true here; but we can go further.
          The bigger, the swankier, the
          plusher the store, the more a sense
          of legitimacy, and the bigger
          business we do.
               (looking at the plate
               brought to him)
          A smaller piece.  What we've
          proposed to the Cuban Government is
          that it put up half the cash on a
          dollar for dollar basis.
               (accepting a smaller piece)
          Thank you.  We can find people in
          the United States who will put up
          our share for a small piece of the
          action, yet we will retain control.

                    ONE OF THE MEN
          How much?

                    ROTH
          A hundred million dollars.  But
          only if this Government relaxes its
          restrictions on importing building
          materials; we'll need some new
          laws, too, but that will be no
          difficulty.

                    ANOTHER MAN
          What are import duties now?

                    ROTH
          As much as seventy percent.  Also,
          I'm working out an arrangement with
          the Minister of Labor so that all
          our pit bosses, stick-men and
          Dealers, can be considered
          specialized technicians eligible
          for two year visas.  As of now
          they're only allowed in Cuba for
          six months at a time.  In short,
          we're in a full partnership with
          the Cuban Government.

documents.

                    ROTH
               (continuing)
          Here are applications from Friends
          all over the States.  I understand
          Santo Virgilio in Tampa is trying
          to make his own deal.  Well, the
          Cuban Government will brush him off.
          The Lakeville Road Boys are going
          to take over the Nacionale here.
          I'm planning a new hotel casino to
          be known as Riviera.  The new Capri
          will go to the Corleone Family.

MED. VIEW

The cake is sliced and carried to each of the men.

                    ROTH
          Then there's the Sevilla Biltmore;
          the Havana Hilton, which is going
          to cost twenty-four million --
          Cuban banks will put up half, the
          Teamsters will bankroll the rest.
          Generally, there will be friends
          for all our friends including the
          Lieutenant Governor of Nevada;
          Eddie Levine of Newport will bring
          in the Pennino Brothers, Dino and
          Eddie; they'll handle actual casino
          operations.

And seeing that all of his friends have been served, Roth
raises his fork.

                    ROTH
          Enjoy.

                    MICHAEL
          I saw an interesting thing today.
          A man was being arrested by the
          Military Police; probably an urban
          guerrilla.  Rather than be taken
          alive, he exploded a grenade hidden
          in his jacket, taking the command
          vehicle with him.

The various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wondering
what the point of it is.

                    MICHAEL
          It occurred to me: the police are
          paid to fight, and the Rebels are
          not.

                    SAM ROTH
          So?

                    MICHAEL
          So, that occurred to me.

VIEW ON ROTH

He understands Michael's point, if the others do not.

                    ROTH
          This country has had rebels for the
          last fifty years; it's part of
          their blood.  Believe me, I know...
          I've been coming here since the
          twenties; we were running molasses
          out of Havana when you were a baby.
          To trucks owned by your father.
               (he chuckles warmly
               over the memory)
          We'll talk when we're alone.

And he returns his attention to the men who are gathered
with him on his birthday.

EXT. ROTH'S PRIVATE TERRACE - DAY

Michael sits alone with the old man, on a terrace that
overlooks the city.

                    ROTH
          You have to be careful what you say
          in front of the others... they
          frighten easy.  It's always been
          that way, most men frighten easy.

                    MICHAEL
          We're making a big investment in
          Cuba.  That's my only concern.

                    ROTH
          My concern is that the three
          million never arrived at Batista's
          numbered account in Switzerland.
          He thinks it's because you have
          second thoughts about his ability
          to stop the rebels.

                    MICHAEL
          The money was sent.

                    ROTH
          Then you have to trace it.  Michael,
          people here look at me as a reliable
          man.  I can't afford not to be
          looked on as a reliable man.  But
          you know all that; there's nothing
          you can learn from me.  You
          shouldn't have to put up with a
          sick old man as a partner.

                    MICHAEL
          I wouldn't consider anyone else.

                    ROTH
          Except the President of the United
          States.

He laughs slyly, as though this is some private joke between
them.  Then his laughter becomes a cough, which he painfully
stifles with a handkerchief.

                    ROTH
          If only I could live to see it,
          kid; to be there with you.  How
          beautifully we've done it, step by
          step.  Here, protected, free to
          make our profits without the
          Justice Department, the FBI; ninety
          miles away in partnership with a
          friendly government.  Ninety miles,
          just a small step, looking for a
          man who desperately wants to be
          President of the United States, and
          having the cash to make it possible.

                    MICHAEL
          You'll be there to see it; you'll
          be there.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - NIGHT

The telephone has just rung; Michael listens.

                    OPERATOR
          We have your call to Tahoe, Nevada,
          sir.

                    MICHAEL
          Thank you.
               (click, click)
          Tom?  Tom, is that you?

                    ROCCO (O.S.)
          No, Tom's out of town.  This is
          Rocco.  Who is this?

Michael is openly disturbed that Hagen is not there.  He
hangs up without answering.

EXT. NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - DAY

Tom Hagen steps out of a taxicab a bit tentatively, and then
steps toward the door of a pleasant New England house.  He
rings the bell and waits, hat in hand.  A moment later, the
door opens, and Kay is standing there.

                    KAY
          I'm not surprised to see you, Tom.

INT. SMALL ROOM - NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

playing by himself.

                    KAY (O.S.)
          I can't love a man like that; I
          can't live with him, I can't let
          him be father to my children.  Look.

The little boy, moodily by himself.

VIEW ON KAY

obviously moved.

                    KAY
          He's not like a little boy... he
          doesn't talk to me; he doesn't want
          to play; he doesn't like other
          children, he doesn't like toys.
          It's as though he's waiting for the
          time he can take his Father's place.
               (almost in tears)
          You know what he told me when he
          was four years old.  He said he had
          killed his Grandfather...

VIEW ON HAGEN

listening, calmly.

                    KAY
          ... He said he had shot his
          Grandfather with a gun, and then he
          died in the garden.  And he asked
          me... he asked me, Tom, if that
          meant now his father would shoot
          him out of... revenge.
               (she cries)
          How does a four year old boy learn
          the word... 'revenge'?

                    HAGEN
          Kay... Kay...

VIEW ON KAY

                    KAY
          What kind of a family is this...
          are we human beings?  He knows his
          Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He
          heard Connie.

                    HAGEN
          You don't know that's true.  But
          Kay, just for the sake of an
          argument, let's assume it is, I'm
          not saying it is, remember, but...
          What if I gave you what might be
          some justification for what he
          did... or rather some possible
          justification for what he possibly
          did.

                    KAY
          That's the first time I've seen the
          lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not
          your best side.

                    HAGEN
          Okay, just hear me out.  What if
          Carlo had been paid to help get
          Sonny killed?  What if his beating
          of Connie that time was a deliberate
          plot to get Sonny out into the open?
          Then what?  And what if the Don, a
          great man, couldn't bring himself
          to do what he had to do, avenge his
          son's death by killing his
          daughter's husband?  What if that,
          finally, was too much for him, and
          he made Michael his successor,
          knowing that Michael would take
          that load off his shoulders, would
          take that guilt?

                    KAY
          He's not the same as when I met him.

                    HAGEN
          If he were, he'd be dead by now.
          You'd be a widow.  You'd have no
          problem.

                    KAY
          What the hell does that mean?  Come
          on, Tom, speak out straight once in
          your life.  I know Michael can't,
          but you're not Sicilian, you can
          tell a woman the truth; you can
          treat her like an equal, a fellow
          human being.

There is a long silence.

Then Hagen shakes his head; he can tell her no more.

                    HAGEN
          If you told Michael what I've told
          you today, I'm a dead man.

                    KAY
          When is it finally over?  I want it
          to be over before my baby is born.

                    HAGEN
          I don't know.  I hope soon; but
          it's not over yet, and that's why
          you and the kids have to come back
          to me.

He looks at her; it's clear that he has been entrusted with
her safety and her children's.

He is a kind, good man, and seems very nervous and
overwrought.

EXT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY

There is a light rain.  Pentangeli steps out of his car;
points to Willy Cicci.

                    PENTANGELI
          Wait in the car.

He walks up the street, to the bar, where he is greeted by
the tall, handsome Carmine Rosato.  They shake hands.
Pentangeli looks in his hand.

CLOSE VIEW

Rosato has put a crisp one hundred dollar bill in his hand,
folded sharply in two.

                    PENTANGELI
          What's this?

                    ROSATO
          That's a lucky C note for our new
          deal.

He puts his arm around Pentangeli, and they walk into the bar.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

The bar is fairly empty; and very dark.  Pentangeli and
Rosato step up to the bar; the bartender momentarily stops
polishing glasses to pour a couple of drinks.

                    ROSATO
          We were all real happy about your
          decision, Frankie; you're not goin'
          to regret it.

He holds up the glass.

                    PENTANGELI
          I don't like the C-note.  I take it
          like an insult.

Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around Pentangeli's throat;
and he is forcefully yanked back into the shadows, all the
way into a wooden telephone booth.

MED. CLOSE - THE PHONE BOOTH

We see only Pentangeli's feet and legs, struggling.  We HEAR
the terrible sounds of a man being strangled.

CLOSE ON ROSATO

Calm, and then he sees something that disturbs him.

                    ROSATO
          Shit, your friend the cop!

Suddenly, the side door opens, and a shaft of sunlight cuts
through the darkness.

                    COP
          Everything all right in there,
          Ritchie?  The door was open.

          You okay?

                    COP
          Is that something on the floor?

                    ROSATO
          Take him!

          Okay.

                    RITCHIE
          Not here; not a cop, not here!

Two figures race through the shadows and race through the
doors.

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

We see that a patrol car had stopped for its routine visit.
STUTZ, the second patrolman, is just stepping out of his
car; Pentangeli's bodyguard, seeing the commotion, leaps out.
Three men, including Rosato, rush out.  There is gunfire;
Cicci is wounded.

The patrolmen is grazed across the face; trying to stop the
flow of blood with his hand.

          The bastard.  The dirty bastard, he
          gave me a C-note.  He gave me a C-
          note.

He sees the patrolman leaning over him.

EXT. PATROL CAR - DAY

The Sergeant is on the car radio.

                    SERGEANT
          Frankie Pentangeli murder attempt.

INT. ROTH'S SUITE IN HAVANA - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON ROTH - DAY

His wizened face, pale.  Right now, though, his eyes have a
sparkle as he watches three million dollars in cold cash
being counted on a card table in front of him.

His brother Sam is present, and the sandy-haired Courier, a
little nervous; the one who had left from the Tropicana with
the Corleone skim-money.  Also Johnny Ola.  The money is
evidently all there; Roth picks up a packet; probably a
hundred thousand dollars, and throws it over to the Courier.

                    ROTH
          Make it fast; I don't want to
          chance him being seen.

                    COURIER
               (frightened)
          What about the arrangements?  How
          can I be sure about the arrangements?

                    OLA
          Relax.  You're under our protection;
          the Corleone family will never find
          you.

Ola leads the Courier to the adjoining room where two
smartly dressed Military (Cuban) Police are standing, and a
civilian.  The Courier sees them, looks back to Ola.  One of
the police steps forward, placing the Courier under arrest;
handcuffing him.

                    COURIER
          Hey, what's this?

The other takes the packet of money, and hands it to the
civilian, who places it in the briefcase he carries.  The
other officer kneels down and fastens leg manacles.

                    COURIER
          The arrangements... YOU BASTARDS!
          What...

The Captain strikes him expertly across the side of his head
with his pistol.

Ola closes the door on this scene.

EXT. THE HAVANA CAPRI - DAY

Fredo Corleone steps out of a car, squints up at the sunshine
and palm trees.  He is holding on tightly to a small satchel,
which he won't let the bellman carry along with his other
things.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Michael and Fredo in a brother's embrace; they kiss each
other.  Fredo is still in his jacket, holding the satchel.

                    FREDO
          Mikey.  How are you?

He glances up at Bussetta, who doesn't say a word.  Fredo
extends his hand.

                    FREDO
          Hiya, Freddie Corleone.

                    MICHAEL
          Mio fratello.

Then Bussetta offers his hand back to Fredo.

                    FREDO
               (taking off his jacket)
          What a trip, Jesus Christ, the
          whole time I'm thinking what if
          someone knew what I got in here.

He undoes the combination of the briefcase starts taking out
cash.  Then he stops, remembering that there's a stranger in
the room.

                    FREDO
          Oh, 'scuse me.

                    MICHAEL
          It's all right.  He stays with me
          all the time.

                    FREDO
          Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally
          in the dark.

                    MICHAEL
          We're making an investment in Havana.

                    FREDO
          Great, Havana's great.  Lots of
          activity in Havana!  Anybody I know
          here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?

                    MICHAEL
          Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.

                    FREDO
          I never met them.

                    MICHAEL
          Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed
          by the Rosato Brothers.
               (pause)
          Didn't you know that?

                    FREDO
          No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me
          anything?  I been kept in the dark
          so long, I'm getting used to it.

                    MICHAEL
          I want you to help me, Fredo.

                    FREDO
          That's what I'm here for.

                    MICHAEL
          Tonight I want to relax with you.
          The Senator from Nevada is here
          with some people from Washington.
          I want to show them a good time in
          Havana.

                    FREDO
          Count on me; that's my specialty.

                    MICHAEL
          I'd like to come along.  There's
          been a lot of strain, and I've been
          cooped up in this room for three
          days.

                    FREDO
          Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour
          to wash my face and do my research
          and we'll have these Washington
          suckers right where you want 'em.
               (then a thought
               strikes him)
          Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He
          always wanted to die in bed...with
          a broad.

INT. ROTH'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael stands at Roth's door carrying the briefcase that
Fredo had brought.

A hotel DOCTOR takes Hyman Roth's blood pressure, while his
wife waits nervously.

                    DOCTOR
               (Spanish)
          You must not exert yourself; I will
          write out a prescription and come
          back tomorrow.

                    HOTEL MAN
          He's going to write a prescription.

                    ROTH
          I want my own doctor; fly him in
          from Miami.  I don't trust a doctor
          who can't speak English.

The doctor is shown out.  Roth gestures to the hotel man,
who also leaves.  Then he looks to his wife.

                    ROTH
          Honey, go down to the casino?

                    TERRI
          If you feel better...

                    ROTH
          I do.  Play the Bingo game.

They kiss, and she leaves.  Also Bussetta and Ola remain.

                    ROTH
          My sixth sense tells me you have a
          bag full of money in your hand.

Ola locks the door; Michael nods, and opens the bag, spilling
its contents on the card table.

                    MICHAEL
          This doubles my investment.

                    ROTH
          Still no word of your courier?
          We'll find him.  But at least this
          will satisfy our friends here.
          You've been invited to the New Year
          reception at the Presidential Home.
          I understand your brother is here
          as well; I hope he'll come.

                    MICHAEL
          Six million dollars in cash is a
          high price for a piece of a country
          in the middle of a revolution.

Roth looks patiently at Michael, as though he were a child
who hadn't minded the lesson that he had been taught over
and over again.

                    ROTH
          You're a careful kid, and that's
          good.  But look.  An international
          dispatch on the wire service.
          American journalism, not propaganda.
          The government troops have all but
          eliminated the rebels.  All but
          their radio station.

                    MICHAEL
          I've read it; I'm pleased that the
          government is doing so well.  As a
          heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How
          did the doctor find you?

                    ROTH
          Terrible.  I'd give twice this
          amount to take a piss without it
          hurting.

                    MICHAEL
          Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?

                    ROTH
               (taken a bit off-balance)
          Why...the Rosato Brothers.

                    MICHAEL
          I know that; but who gave the go
          ahead.

Roth glances to Ola; he is not a fool; he realizes Michael
has begun to suspect him.

                    MICHAEL
          I know it wasn't me...so that
          leaves you.

                    ROTH
          There was this kid that I grew up
          with; he was a couple years younger
          than me, and sort of looked up to
          me, you know.  We did our first
          work together, worked our way out
          of the street.  Things were good
          and we made the most of it.  During
          prohibition, we ran molasses up to
          Canada and made a fortune; your
          father too.  I guess as much as
          anyone, I loved him and trusted him.
          Later on he had an idea to make a
          city out of a desert stop-over for
          G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast.
          That kid's name was Moe Greene, and
          the city he invented was Las Vegas.
          This was a great man; a man with
          vision and guts; and there isn't
          even a plaque or a signpost or a
          statue of him in that town.  Someone
          put a bullet through his eye; no
          one knows who gave the order.  When
          I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I
          knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong,
          and talking loud, and saying stupid
          things.  So when he turned up dead,
          I let it go, and said to myself:
          this is the business we've chosen.
          I never asked, who gave the go
          ahead because it had nothing to do
          with business.

He regards Michael silently a moment.

                    ROTH
               (continuing)
          There's three million dollars on
          that table.  I'm going to lie down,
          maybe take a nap.  When I wake up,
          if it's still there, I'll know I
          have a partner.  If it's gone, then
          I'll know I don't.

The old man turns, and moves in his slippers, toward his
bedroom.

INT. THE CORRIDOR - DAY

Michael closes the door, and moves down the hallway.  He is
followed by Bussetta, who had waited in the corridor.

                    MICHAEL
               (Sicilian)
          How sick do you think the old man is?

                    BUSSETTA
               (Sicilian)
          He'll live longer than me.

INT. TROPICOR NIGHT CLUB - VIEW ON THE SHOW - NIGHT

A Havana extravaganza, with tall, beautiful showgirls done
up in flamboyant, 'South-of-the-Border' Carmen Miranda
costumes; the lead singer is a six foot blonde doing "Rum
and Coca Cola" in that style.  Her name is YOLANDA.

MED. VIEW

At a large round table, located in an obvious VIP section of
the high, tropically draped room with living ferns and other
tropical planting with artificial stars.

Michael rises, to be introduced by Fredo to some conservative
looking Senatorial types, including Senator Pat Geary of
Nevada.  We notice Bussetta standing nearby.

                    FREDO
          Does everyone know everyone, or
          nobody knows nobody.  Here, my
          brother, Michael Corleone... well,
          you know Senator Geary.

Geary warmly shakes Michael's hand.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          Good to see you, Mike; I'm glad we
          can spend this time together.

                    FREDO
          This is Senator Payton from Florida;
          Judge DeMalco from New York...
          Senator Ream... Mr. Questadt from
          California, he's a lawyer with the
          Price-Control Administration.  And
          Fred Corngold of U T&T.

They all make themselves comfortable.  A waiter with a tray
of drinks appears.

                    FREDO
          Gentlemen... your pleasure?  Cuba
          Libres, Pina Coladas, you name it.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          I'll take a Yolanda.

Laughter.

                    FREDO
          Later, later.  All those girls look
          like they're on stilts!

The various tropical drinks are distributed.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          To a night in Havana!

They all join in.

                    FREDO
               (aside to Michael)
          Jeeze, it's great you came along,
          Mike... You know, we've never spent
          a night out on the town together.
          I always thought you looked down on
          me for liking a good time.

                    MICHAEL
          I never looked down on you, Fredo.
          You don't look down at a brother.

INT. THE CASINO - NIGHT

By now the group has made its way into the casino.  Some of
them are crowded around the crap table; Senator Geary is
with the enormous and beautiful Yolanda, who barely speaks
English.  There are other girls with some of the men; not
with Michael, who gambles dollars while talking to Corngold.

                    CORNGOLD
          Our information is that Castro is
          dead.  There are maybe a few
          hundred die-hards in the Sierra
          Muestra; but government troops are
          going to clean them out any day.

Johnny Ola approaches Michael.

                    OLA
          Mike, can I talk to you.

Michael follows Ola toward the Baccarat table; a watchful
Bussetta moves, a distance away, with them.

                    OLA
          Listen, this Senator from Florida
          already has a hundred grand worth
          of markers on the table.

We can see Senator Ream at the table, making thousand dollar
bets on the Bank.

                    OLA
          They asked him to sign paper to
          take down the markers; but he got
          mad; told them to wait until he was
          finished.

                    MICHAEL
          Let him gamble.

                    OLA
          Okay.  You know he doesn't have
          that kind of money.

                    FREDO
          Mike said let him gamble.

Fredo puts his arm around his brother; he is high with the
first attention Mike has ever given him, as though finally
he is being taken seriously; as though his brother needs him.

                    FREDO
          Mike, I got something special up my
          sleeve for these boys.  You ever
          hear of "Superman?" And I don't
          mean the comic book.

                    MICHAEL
          No.

                    FREDO
          Wait'll you see!

INT. HAVANA BAR - NIGHT

Our group are in a large Havana bar; the walls totally
covered with hundreds of fifths of different types of rum
and other liquor.

A couple of the girls from the show are out with the men;
Yolanda herself is giving them a private song and dance.

Fredo is a little loaded, and especially attentive to
Michael this night.

                    FREDO
          Mikey, why would they ever hit poor
          old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved
          that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember
          when he was just a 'button,' when
          we were kids.  We used to put
          bedsheets on our heads, you know,
          like we were ghosts.  An' ole
          Frankie come peek into our room,
          we'd jump up, and he'd always
          pretend like he was really scared.
          You remember?

                    MICHAEL
          It was hard to have him killed.

                    FREDO
          You?  What do you mean you, I
          thought...

                    MICHAEL
          It was hard to have him killed.

                    FREDO
          You?  What do you mean you, I
          thought...

                    MICHAEL
          It was Frankie tried to have me hit.

                    FREDO
          No.  I mean, are you sure?

                    MICHAEL
          You know otherwise, Freddie?

                    FREDO
          Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything.
          Fellas!  You're all falling asleep.
          We got to see Superman.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

A growing feeling about his brother.

EXT. GARISH HAVANA STREET - NIGHT

The street is lit with tons of neon signs; it is alive with
people; some roving bands of musicians.  Everywhere are
little boys running around, begging for money.  And in
doorways and windows are silent, dark-skinned women.

                    SENATOR REAM
               (pushing away from
               the palm outstretched
               little hands of the boys)
          Goddamn beggers.  Goddamn city of
          beggars and pimps and whores.  And
          we bend over backwards to support
          them with the goddamn sugar quota.

                    FREDO
               (to Geary)
          What's eating him?

                    SENATOR GEARY
          He lost a quarter million dollars
          at the casino.

                    SENATOR REAM
          ...goddamn city of whores...

                    SENATOR GEARY
          He gave them a bad check.

INT. 'SUPERMAN SHOW' - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A large room with a succession of platforms arranged step-
like around a circular area which becomes a stage.

There are a hundred or so people, practically all men,
tourists and business men, standing on the different levels,
forming the audience.

In the center of the stage is a thick, telephone type pole,
to which is tied a young Cuban girl, in a flimsy white
sacrificial slip.  A small band, mostly drummers, play some
Latin music.

MED. VIEW

Fredo's party standing on the ramp, looking down at the
spectacle.  They're a little woozy from the drinks and late
hour.  Michael is with them, but now we sense he is using
this time, with all exhausted and drunk, to come to some
important conclusions.

                    QUESTADT
          Why do we have to stand?

                    FREDO
          Everyone stands.  But it's worth
          it, watch!

VIEW ON THE ARENA

Now two high priestesses, scantily clad, bring in a tall and
muscular Cuban, done up in chains and loin cloth, as though
he were a captured slave.  This is SUPERMAN

VIEW ACROSS THE MEN TO THE STAGE

                    FREDO
          That's him; that's Superman!

Some preliminary pornographic proceedings go on, as the
priestesses lead the slave to the virgin tied to the post.
The music is percussive and wild.

MED. VIEW ON THE MEN

                    SENATOR GEARY
          Ohmygod.  I don't believe it.

                    QUESTADT
          It's got to be fake.

                    FREDO
          That's why they call him Superman.
          Johnny Ola told me about this; I
          didn't believe it.

CLOSE on Michael turning away.  Not because of the spectacle
which he finds disgusting, but at what his brother is saying.

                    FREDO (O.S.)
          ... but seeing is believing.  Ole
          Johnny knows all the places.  I
          tol' you... can you believe it?

If Michael would ever allow himself to cry, it would be now.

                    FREDO
               (continuing)
          The old man Roth, would never come;
          but Johnny knows these places like
          the back of his hand...

                                   FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - MORNING

Michael is alone in his bedroom; it seems as though he
hasn't slept very much, but sits by his window, looking out
at the city.  He is troubled and tired.

His radio is on:

                    RADIO
               (Spanish)
          "This is Rebel Radio: Rebel troops
          of Column Four 'Jose Marti' took
          the town of Baire yesterday at 8:30
          p.m.  The enemy has retreated..."

EXT. CUBAN STREET - MORNING

This street in Havana is like a Caribbean tourist city with
no indication of the revolution in progress.

Michael walks along the street, alone, past the Cubans on
their way to work; past the American ladies who have gotten
up early for their shopping spree.

                    RADIO
               (Spanish)
                (continuing)
          ... An important military action is
          developing along a 35-kilometer
          stretch of the Central Highway.
          Numerous enemy garrisons are left
          with two alternatives, surrender or
          annihilation...

One full block away, Bussetta rides in the front seat of the
dark Mercury, driving slowly, giving Michael his privacy,
but never letting him out of Bussetta's sight.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

watching.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

Shopkeepers happily luring the tourists into their shops in
broken English.  Havana is prosperous.

                    RADIO
               (continuing)
          ... Victories in war depend on a
          minimum on weapons and to a maximum
          on morale...

VIEW ON MICHAEL

glances back to the dark car following him.  In a moment, it
pulls up to him, and he gets into the back seat.

EXT. AMERICAN MILITARY MISSION - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

standing by his car, looking through the cyclone fencing
that borders this military training camp operated by the
American Army near the city.

                    RADIO
          ... War is not a simple question of
          rifles, bullets, guns and planes...

CLOSER VIEW INTO THE CAMP

EXT. HAVANA STREET - DAY

A street singer, followed by a guitarist sings Jose Marti's
words of "Guantanamera." It is solemn, as though it is a
song of protest, a song of the revolution.

Nearby, in a restaurant, Michael has lunch with Fredo.

                    MICHAEL
          How is your wife, Fredo...your
          marriage?

                    FREDO
               (eating)
          You know her; drives me crazy, one
          minute she's a popsicle, the next
          she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I
          think... I think - I should a
          married someone, like you did.  To
          have kids, to have a family.

Michael turns, distracted for a moment at something the
singer has sung.

                    MICHAEL
          "Yo soy un hombre sincero..."
          I am a sincere man,
          From the land of the palms...

                    FREDO
          What's that?

                    MICHAEL
          The song.  Are you sincere with me,
          Fredo?

                    FREDO
          Sincere.  What are you talking
          about, of course I'm sincere with
          you, Mike.

                    MICHAEL
          Then I'm going to confide in you;
          trust you with something.

                    FREDO
               (Sicilian)
          Mike, are you crazy, I'm your
          brother.

                    MICHAEL
          Tonight we've been invited to a
          reception at the Presidential
          Palace; to bring in the New Year.
          You and I will go in a special car
          that's being sent.  They'll have
          cocktails... then dinner, and a
          reception with the President.  When
          it's over, it will be suggested
          that you take Questadt and his
          friends from Washington to spend
          the night with some women.  I'll go
          home alone in the car; and before I
          reach the hotel, I'll be
          assassinated.

                    FREDO
          ...Who?

                    MICHAEL
          The same man who tried in Nevada...
          Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

                    FREDO
          But, you told me yourself...

                    MICHAEL
          It was never Pentangeli... I've
          always known that.  It was Roth all
          along.  He talks to me as a son; as
          his successor, but the old man
          thinks he'll live forever.

                    FREDO
          What do you want me to do?

                    MICHAEL
          To go tonight, with me, as though
          we know nothing.  I've already made
          my move.

                    FREDO
          What is it?  Can I help?

                    MICHAEL
          The old man will never bring in the
          New Year.

Fredo realizes what he means; looks immediately to Bussetta,
who had been sitting near the door and the musicians.  He is
gone.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW ON BUSSETTA - NIGHT

The first time ever away from Michael, moving toward us
quickly.  He stops, knocks on the door of Roth's suite.
Then quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to
the adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears
inside.

A moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused
Johnny Ola, opens the first door.  He steps out into the
corridor, to see who had knocked.  Confused, he is about to
return inside, when Bussetta easily breaks his neck in two
from behind.

INT. THE SUITE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

as Bussetta quietly pulls the limp body of Johnny Ola, his
head bent at an impossible angle, and lays it at the foot of
the couch.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

Guards who are regular troops patrol the Palace in twos,
carrying machine weapons.

Now an elite officer, checks the identification of the
various cars carrying dignitaries, as they are driven up to
the Palace.  The one being inspected at the moment contains
Fredo and Michael.  We can see the beautifully dressed
people on their way to the reception, and sense the cheerful
mood of this New Year's Eve.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta bends over Ola's body, tying the wrists and knees
with electrical extensions.  He then easily carries the body
to the small balcony which all the rooms have.

EXT. THE BALCONY - NIGHT

Bussetta swings the body over the side of the balcony
railing; tying the extension cord to the railing, and
suspending the body so that it is invisible both from the
inside and out during the night.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - VIEW ON THE MAIN FOYER - NIGHT

The PRESIDENT, his WIFE and six oldest CHILDREN great
formally the many beautifully and affluently dressed guests.
He speaks to them in Spanish, as one by one they file to him.

Michael and Fredo are presented in a group with several
other Americans, including several of the American
businessmen with interests in Cuba.

EXT. STREETS OF HAVANA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The excitement of the night is beginning to build; people
are out in the streets; poor people, but they are
enthusiastic and lively.

NEW VIEW

Traffic stops, as an ambulance speeds its way to a hospital;
SIREN going.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta delicately picks up a small satin cushion that had
fallen from the couch, and replaces it as though nothing had
happened.  Slowly he cracks the door open which adjoins
Roth's bedroom.  There is a slight commotion; whispered
voices.

BUSSETTA'S VIEW

Terri, Mrs. Roth, is crying.  A group of men lift Hyman
Roth's frail body onto a stretcher.

CLOSE ON BUSSETTA

realizes that this is the man he is to kill.

CLOSER VIEW ON ROTH

He is alive; breathing hard with his mouth dry and open.
The doctor examines him, and then gives instructions to the
orderly who carries him out, presumably to the ambulance.

Bussetta closes the door on this VIEW.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

An orchestra plays for the guests, as an army of waiters
serve champagne and hors d'oeuvres.  Michael relaxes with
Senator Geary, Major Leon, and several of the Americans.

                    QUESTADT
          The embargo on arms shipments from
          the U.S. to your government, was
          just a necessary public relations
          move... Only last month, your air
          force received a major shipment of
          rockets...

Michael glances at his watch; Fredo concentrates on this.

                    SENATOR GEARY
          We believe in non-intervention...
          but the agreement stipulates that
          our forces may be withdrawn... but
          as you've seen, we have not
          withdrawn them.

                    CORNGOLD
          And my guess is that President
          Eisenhower won't pull out while we
          have over three billion invested
          over here.

                    MICHAEL
          Fredo.  Where are you going?

                    FREDO
          Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a
          refill.  How about you?

EXT. HAVANA HOSPITAL - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The ambulance makes its way up to the emergency section of
the hospital.  The orderlies quickly carry the old man
inside.  His wife and the doctor, and several of his men,
follow in another car.

THE VIEW ALTERS

and we see Bussetta waiting in the shadows.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

The growing crowds of Cubans begin their celebration.

NEW VIEW

A Cuban military detachment speeds along in the night,
motorcyclists clear a path through the celebrants.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

A full sitdown dinner is being served the guests.  Michael
sits at a table at dinner with several of the distinguished
Cubans, and some of the American businessmen.

                    QUESTADT
          What's kept Mr. Roth?

Fredo looks up at Michael.

In the back of the room, we notice the detachment of military
moving quickly through the reception room on their way to
the President's private quarters.  Michael notices it as well.

INT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The activity at the end of the hall has come to rest; we can
tell that the doctor tells Mrs. Roth that she should go, the
old man will be taken to a room where he can rest.
Gradually, these people leave him in the care of the hospital
staff.

Bussetta watches from the distance of the hallway; after the
old man has been moved, he quietly walks down the hallway to
the room.

HIS VIEW

A nurse sits in the room in attendance; Hyman Roth is
asleep, his mouth wide open, breathing noisily.

VIEW ON BUSSETTA

hears footsteps, quickly steps away from the door, and into
another room.

Some nurses and attendants speak to the nurse in the room in
Spanish; one has brought a small bottle of wine, and
obviously they are inviting the nurse to have a New Year's
toast with them.  They laugh; and the nurse steps away from
the room for a moment.

Bussetta moves slowly back into the room, alone with the
helpless Roth.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW ON THE GUESTS - NIGHT

seeing in the New Year; a great banner is hoisted up in
Spanish, welcoming 1959.

Hands are shaken; kisses exchanged.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

Michael and Fredo in an embrace; they kiss one another.

                    MICHAEL
          I've arranged for a plane; we're
          going to Miami in an hour.  Try not
          to make a big thing of it.

He kisses his brother once again.

                    MICHAEL
               (Sicilian)
          I know it was you, Fredo.  You've
          broken my heart.

Slowly, understanding, Fredo backs away from his brother,
taking the kiss another way.

A little distance away, Major Leon notices an old woman, one
of the President's maids, moving across the alcove, carrying
her suitcases.

                    LEON
          What a pity; she's crying.  Must
          have been fired, and she's been
          with the President's family for
          twenty years.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

The gathered crowd joyously welcomes the New Year.  We
notice the continual military movement.

MED. VIEW

A family surreptitiously leaves their home, carrying
suitcases and belongings.

INT. ROTH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Bussetta raises a hospital pillow, and easily begins to
smother the thin old man, who can barely struggle.

OUT IN THE HALL

A detachment of military move quickly, accompanied by some
of Roth's men, as though they have important news that must
be dealt with.

They pass the small group of aides and nurses welcoming the
New Year.

Seeing them, the nurse assigned to him, puts down her glass
and moves quickly to the room.

She opens the door, and lays bare the sight of Bussetta
smothering Roth.  Bussetta turns quickly; and one of the
military takes out his pistol and shoots several times at
his head.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

The entire reception has been disrupted for an announcement;
all the guests in their formal dress and evening gowns,
standing with frightened faces like first class passengers
on a doomed ship.  The President himself, his back to our
VIEW, is making an announcement in Spanish.  While he
speaks, we notice continuous movement of his personal staff,
carrying suitcases and possessions.

                    PRESIDENT
          ...Because of serious setbacks of
          our troops in Guantanamo and
          Santiago, we feel reluctantly, that
          we must leave the Capital at once.
          Myself and my family must bid you
          goodbye, and good fortune.  We will
          go directly to Ciudad Trujillo.

The crowd is stunned; already whispers are moving throughout
the guests.

The only one who is not completely taken off guard is
Michael, who quietly steps back, and disappears from the room.

                    PRESIDENT
          ...My only regret is that there
          could not have been more warning...
          As my last official act as
          President, I hereby appoint a
          provisional government with Dr.
          Carlos M. Piedra, as its President.

By now, there is only one thought among the guests: how can
they get out, and with what.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

We see evidence of the confusion at this late hour; already
cars are beginning to move; people leaving the Palace in
haste.  Michael moves quickly toward his car.  He sees
Fredo, watching him in fear.

                    MICHAEL
          Come with me.  It's your only way
          of getting out!

VIEW ON FREDO

Terrified of his brother, and what he knows; Fredo backs
away into the growing noise and confusion of the crowd.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

Finally, he has to step into the car and it roars off.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

Rebel cars with loudspeakers have already picked up the news
that Batista has conceded...this throws the crowds already
gathered for the New Year into cheers of joy.

They harass a wealthy family who are trying to get away in
their car.

The people pull them out of the car, opening their suitcases,
out of which spill piles of cash and jewelry into street.

Michael's car makes its way as the crowd cheers: "El animale
se fue!"

EXT. THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Crowds of panicked and frightened tourists, and Batistianos
are trying to get to the safety of the Embassy with the
families and possessions.

We see Geary, and some of the Americans we had met, working
their way through the crowds, shouting that they are
Americans in order to get preference on the line.  Often
that declaration brings 'boos' from the crowds.

Sometimes the joyous Cubans will let a family through, but
again, taking away the suitcases, rich leather, filled with
money and valuables.  Money seems to be stuffed everywhere.

EXT. THE YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

All forms of private transportation are jammed with people
trying to get out, holding cash in their hands for anyone
with a yacht or small boat to get them to Florida.

A car pulls up; and we see Sam Roth, Terri Roth and some of
their men, carry the sickly, but still alive Hyman Roth to a
private cruiser which is protected by men with machine guns.

Within seconds, they are on their way to Miami.

EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT

Things are no different at the airport; where anything that
can fly is being jammed with refugees and their money.

A wealthy family is arguing with the pilot of a fast
airplane; trying to force cash on him, and his family into
the plane.  The PILOT steadfastly refuses, although checking
his watch, as though his passengers are late.  He speaks
only English.

                    PILOT
          No, this is a private plane.  No,
          this plane is taken.

Finally Michael's Mercury pulls up, and Michael approaches
the Pilot.

                    MICHAEL
          He isn't here.

                    PILOT
          We've got to leave, they'll take
          this thing apart.

                    MICHAEL
          All right.  Go now.

The Pilot lets Michael in, as the Cuban screams curses at
them, and begins searching for another plane for his family.

INT. THE PLANE - VIEW ON THE PILOT - NIGHT

as the propeller turns over.

EXT. THE AIRPORT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

Groups of the cheering, celebrating Cubans sing
"Guantanamera," now as a song of triumph.

INT. THE PLANE - MOVING VIEW - MICHAEL - NIGHT

Closer to him, his personal and business life caught in the
middle of history.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - DAY (1920)

He stops to pick out some choice oranges and peaches from a
fruit stand.  Then he reaches into his pocket for change.

                    VENDOR
          No, no.  It is my pleasure to make
          this a gift.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

                    VITO
          You are kind.  If ever I can do
          something for you, in return,
          please come to me.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY

Despite his new position of 'respect,' there is little
changed about his home.  Only that they have lived there a
while now, and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable
possessions a young family acquires.

He kisses his wife, who seems a big apprehensive.  He shows
her the fruit; and from her reaction knows she has something
on her mind.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          What is it?

                    CARMELLA
               (Sicilian)
          Come...

They step into the tiny parlor, where we see an older woman,
waiting nervously.

                    CARMELLA
          The Signora is a friend of mine.
          She has a favor to ask of you.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          Why do you come to me?

                    SIGNORA COLOMBO
               (Sicilian)
          She told me to ask you.

He seems surprised; looks to his wife.

                    CARMELLA
          She is having some trouble.  Her
          landlord has received complaints
          because of her dog.  He told her to
          get rid of it, but her boy loved
          it, so they tried to hide it.  When
          the landlord found out, he was so
          angry, he ordered her to leave.
          Even if she truly will let the dog
          go.

                    SIGNORA COLOMBO
               (Sicilian)
          He said he would have the police
          put us out.

                    VITO
               (thoughtfully)
          I can give you some money to help
          you move, is that what you want?

                    SIGNORA COLOMBO
          My friends are all here; how can I
          move to another neighborhood with
          strangers?  I want you to speak to
          the landlord to let me stay.

Vito nods to the frightened old woman.

                    VITO
          It's done then.  You won't have to
          move; I'll speak to him tomorrow
          morning.

Carmella breaks into a smile; which her husband des not
acknowledge.

The old woman starts to leave the room; but she is not
convinced.

                    SIGNORA COLOMBO
          You're sure he'll say yes, the
          landlord?

                    VITO
          I'm sure he's a good-hearted fellow.
          Once I explain how things are with
          you, I'm sure he'll take pity on
          your misfortunes.  Don't let it
          trouble you any more.
               (as he shows her out)
          Guard your health, for the sake of
          your children.

EXT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAY

SIGNOR ROBERTO, a pompous, rather well-dressed Patrone
angrily walks down the steps of one of his tenement buildings.

He carries a check list, and makes marks with a pencil
concerning the condition of his various buildings; a broken
window here, some missing tile there.  He bends over to pick
up some garbage left by a thoughtless tenant, muttering to
himself, when he sees the shoes and legs of a young worker.

                    VITO (O.S.)
          Signore Roberto...

He rises to be face to face with a polite Vito Corleone.

                    VITO
          The friend of my wife, a poor widow
          with no man to protect her, tells
          me that for some reason she has
          been ordered to move from your
          building.  She is in despair.  She
          has no money, she has no friends
          except those that live here.

Signor Roberto brusquely answers, and continues on his way.

                    ROBERTO
          I have already rented the apartment
          to another family.

MOVING SHOT ON THE TWO

                    VITO
          I told her I would speak to you,
          that you are a reasonable man who
          acted out of some misunderstanding.
          She has gotten rid of the animal
          that caused all the trouble, so why
          shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian
          to another, I ask you the favor.

                    ROBERTO
          I've already rented it; I cannot
          disappoint the new tenants.  They're
          paying a higher rent.

                    VITO
          How much more a month?

                    ROBERTO
          Eh...
               (we sense he is lying)
          Five dollars more.

Vito reaches into his pocket, and takes out a roll of bills.

                    VITO
          Here is the six month's increase in
          advance.  You needn't speak to her
          about it, she's a proud woman.  See
          me again in another six months.
          But of course, you'll let her keep
          her dog.

                    ROBERTO
          Like hell!  And who the hell are
          you to give me orders.  Watch your
          manners or you'll be on your
          Sicilian ass in the street there.

Vito raises his hands in surprise; his voice is reasonable.

                    VITO
          I'm asking you a favor, only that.
          One never knows when one might need
          a friend, isn't that true?  Here,
          take this money as a sign of my
          good-will, and make your own
          decision.  I won't quarrel with it.
               (he puts the money in
               Roberto's hand)
          Do me this little favor, just take
          it and think carefully.  Tomorrow
          morning if you want to give me the
          money back, by all means do so.  If
          you want the woman out of your
          house, how can I stop you?  It's
          your property, after all.  If you
          don't want the dog in there, I can
          understand.  I dislike dogs myself.
               (he pats Roberto on
               the shoulder)
          Do me this service, eh?  I won't
          forget it.  Ask your friends in
          this neighborhood about me, they'll
          tell you I'm a man who believes in
          showing his gratitude.

Without a word more, Vito leaves a hypnotized Roberto
standing in front of the tenement, his hand clasping the
money.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

A thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in
this Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY.

He carries his tools as he comes home from work.  He is
pursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about
his own age, eighteen.

                    ITALIAN BOY
          Kid, where do you live?

                    ANOTHER
          Where'd you get those nigger lips?

He tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys,
steps in front of him and stops him.

                    ITALIAN BOY
          Say 'bread' in Italian.

                    ANOTHER
          He dunno.

                    ITALIAN BOY
          Go on; how do you say 'bread' in
          Italian?  If you're from the
          neighborhood, you should know how
          to say 'bread' in Italian.

An amused Peter Clemenza steps forward from a local coffee
house, to preside over the fuss.  He's a 'big' man in the
neighborhood, and loves a fight.

                    CLEMENZA
          What's up?

                    ITALIAN BOY
          This kid lives around here, but he
          can't say bread in Italian.

                    CLEMENZA
          That's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at
          those pregnant lips!

He giggles at his own joke.

                    ITALIAN BOY
          Are you a Jewboy?

The boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.

                    ITALIAN BOY
          Well, if you're not a Jew, say
          'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't.

And with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face,
sending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a
clatter.

The other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to
the boy's stomach.  Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold
of his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement
as well.  For a moment, they are rolling around on the
sidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it.

                    CLEMENZA
          Alright, alright, cut it out.

                    SECOND ITALIAN
          What for?  He killed Jesus Christ!

Clemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass.

                    CLEMENZA
          I said cut it out!
               (to the beaten kid)
          What's your name?

                    HYMAN
          Hyman Suchowsky.

                    ITALIAN BOY
          I don't believe it.  In our
          neighborhood, with a name like that!

                    CLEMENZA
          What are those tools?  You work on
          cars?

                    HYMAN
          Yeah.

                    CLEMENZA
          Maybe I know how you can make a
          couple of extra bucks working as a
          mechanic.

The boy seems agreeable.

                    CLEMENZA
          But you gotta know how to keep your
          mouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get
          rid of that name.  I'll call you
          Johnny Lips.
               (he giggles at his
               own humor again)
          Come on...

He leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the
side:

                    CLEMENZA
          Bread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E,
          pane.  Don't forget.

INT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY

A newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new
product "GENCO PURA" olive oil.  It is the beginning of a
new business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one
rattling old truck, and a few stock boys.

Genco has become the accountant-business manager, based on
the experience working with his father.  But it is clear,
that Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the
new enterprise.

Genco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the
small divided area that Vito uses as his office.

                    GENCO
               (Sicilian)
          The 'patrone' is here.

                    VITO
          Chi?

                    GENCO
          Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'

Vito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on
tiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.

                    ROBERTO
          Excuse me, I hope I am not a
          disturbance, Don Corleone.

                    VITO
          Yes.

                    ROBERTO
          What a terrible misunderstanding.
          Of course, Signora Colombo can stay
          in the flat.  Who were those
          miserable tenants to complain about
          noise from a poor animal...when
          they pay such low rent.

Then abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table,
and steps back a respectful distance.

                    ROBERTO
          Your good heart in helping the poor
          widow has shamed me, and I want to
          show that I, too, have some
          Christian charity.  Her rent will
          remain what it was.

                    VITO
          What was that?

                    ROBERTO
          In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!

Vito embraces him warmly.

                    VITO
          I accept your generosity...

                    ROBERTO
          I won't keep you another minute...

He quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then
makes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs,
deflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned
too jelly with fear at his narrow escape.  He all but runs
out of the warehouse.

Genco laughs as he watches.

                    GENCO
          We won't see him for weeks!  He'll
          stay in bed in the Bronx!

Clemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic.  We notice
the subtle difference in the way he treats Vito.  He is no
longer a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an
imposing leader.

                    CLEMENZA
          This kid is good with cars; he
          kiijed at the truck, and says he
          can keep it going.

Vito looks over the lanky young man.

                    CLEMENZA
          What's your name?

                    HYMAN
          Suchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky.

                    CLEMENZA
          He's gonna dump that; I call him
          Johnny Lips.

                    VITO
          Who is the greatest man you can
          think of?

                    CLEMENZA
          Go on, answer him when he talks to
          you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi...
          Garibaldi.

                    HYMAN
          Arnold Rothstein.

                    VITO
          Then take that as your name: Hyman
          Rothstein.

Genco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.

                    GENCO
          Vitone!  Look at this!

Vito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly
christened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind.

EXT. THE ALLEY - DAY

Genco stands beaming, as two workers raise up high, the
freshly painted sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL COMPANY."

                    GENCO
               (enthusiastically)
          God bless America!  We're in
          business!

The young men watch as the sign is hoisted into place.  OUR
VIEW goes from one to the other: Clemenza, Genco, Vito and
Hyman Rothstein.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Willy Cicci, Pentangeli's associate and bodyguard takes a
drink of water.

                    SENATOR (O.S.)
          Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to
          the present time, you were an
          employee of the "Genco Olive Oil
          Company."

                    CICCI
          That's right.

                    SENATOR (O.S.)
          But in actuality, you were a member
          of the Corleone Crime organization.

                    CICCI
          The Corleone Family, Senator.  We
          called it, "The Family."

                    SENATOR (O.S.)
          What position did you occupy?

                    CICCI
          At first, like everybody, I was a
          soldier.

VIEW ON SENATOR KANE

A thin, angular Baptist with a Mid-Western accent.

                    SENATOR KANE
          What is that exactly?

                    CICCI
          A button.  You know, Senator.

                    SENATOR KANE
          No, I don't know, explain that
          exactly.

                    CICCI
          When the boss says push the button
          on a guy, I push the button, see,
          Senator?

The Senators treat Cicci with a surface courtesy, as if he
were a curious kind of animal, not really human.  Cicci
reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than
he has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a
hypocrisy.

The VIEW ALTERS from Senator Kane to the Committee's
attorney, Mr. Questadt.

                    QUESTADT
          You mean you killed people at the
          behest of your superiors?

                    CICCI
          That's right, counsellor.

                    QUESTADT
          And the head of your family was
          Michael Corleone.

                    CICCI
          Yeah, counsellor, Michael Corleone.

                    SENATOR KANE
          Did you ever get such an order
          directly from Michael Corleone?

                    CICCI
          No, Senator, I never talked to him.

                    SENATOR SAVOY
               (very autocratic,
               deep South,
               gentlemanly man)
          There was always a buffer, someone
          in between you who gave you orders.

                    CICCI
          Yeah, a buffer, the Family had a
          lot of buffers.

EXT. THE TROPICANA IN VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A limousine pulls up at a private area near the side of the
hotel.  Michael exits the limousine followed by Hagen and
Neri.

                    MICHAEL
          Do you think they have somebody to
          back up Cicci?

                    HAGEN
          No.  But if they do have somebody,
          you'll do three years for perjury
          if you give them so much as a wrong
          middle name.

Michael smiles to him, but it's a cold, deadly smile.

                    HAGEN
          Michael, take the Fifth all the
          way, that way you can't get into
          trouble.

EXT. PRIVATE BALCONY OF CORLEONE APARTMENT AT TROPICANA - DAY

A Corleone bodyguard waits outside on the balcony overlooking
the pool area.  Through the translucent draperies, we see a
grouping of me.

INT. CORLEONE APARTMENT AT THE TROPICANA - DAY

Michael, Hagen, Neri and Rocco are seated in this luxury in
the hotel.  Michael sits in a comfortable chair in his
apartment.  Neri comes and brings him a drink without
asking, but Michael refuses it.

                    MICHAEL
          Al, get me a wet towel.  Does Kay
          know I'm back?

Hagen nods.

                    MICHAEL
          Did the boy get something from me
          for Christmas?

                    HAGEN
          I took care of it.

                    MICHAEL
          What was it, so I'll know.

                    HAGEN
          A little care he can ride in with
          an electric motor.

Neri comes around with a wet face towel, which Michael uses
to cool his eyes.  He puts the used towel down on the table.

                    MICHAEL
          Fellas, can you wait outside a
          minute?

They know what he means and leave the apartment, going out
to the balcony where we can see them but they cannot hear.
Only Hagen remains.

                    MICHAEL
          Where's my brother?

                    HAGEN
          Roth got out on a private boat.
          He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a
          stroke but he's recovered okay.
          Bussetta's dead.

                    MICHAEL
          I asked about Fredo?

                    HAGEN
          The new government arrested him,
          held him for a couple of days with
          a lot of the other casino people,
          including Roth's brother, Sam.  The
          American Embassy arranged flights
          for citizens; I'm not sure, but I
          think he's somewhere in New York.

                    MICHAEL
          I want you to reach Fredo.  I know
          he's scared, but have one of our
          people reach him.  Assure him that
          there will be no reprisals.  Tell
          him that I know Roth misled him.

                    HAGEN
          My information is that Fredo
          thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth
          assured him nothing would happen to
          you.

                    MICHAEL
               (indicating Rocco and
               Neri on the balcony)
          They can come in now.

                    HAGEN
          Wait... there's something else.

                    MICHAEL
          Alright.

Hagen pauses; doesn't know how to begin.

                    MICHAEL
               (impatiently)
          Go on, tell me.

                    HAGEN
          Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the
          baby.

After a moment:

                    MICHAEL
          Was it a boy or a girl?

                    HAGEN
          Mike, at three and a half...

                    MICHAEL
          What is it, can't you give me
          straight answers anymore!

                    HAGEN
          It was a boy.

                    MICHAEL
          And Kay...she's all right?

                    HAGEN
          She took the Senate Investigation
          worse.

                    MICHAEL
          Does she blame it on me?  The baby?

                    HAGEN
          I don't know.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The first snow of the New Year has fallen; the trees are
bare, and there is hush all over this part of the Sierras.
Michael is driven in his car, looking out at the familiar
sight of the home he has been forced to be away from.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out from his window.  The last time he had seen the
estate it was warm, and the trees were full.

MOVING VIEW

approaching the great stone gates; closed.  The bodyguards
are not readily visible, but they are there.  The iron gates
are opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect,
as the car pulls in.

NEW VIEW

Inside the estate, the private roads have been freshly
plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the
car as it passes.

The Grandchildren are in school now, and so the estate is
especially quiet.  Although there are signs that children
live here; a bicycle, a sled, a swing and gymnastic set, wet
and with a rim of snow still on it.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE - DAY

to the outside, where Michael walks slowly.  He stops and
looks at a little Italian red sportscar made for children.

NEW VIEW

The front door opens, and Michael enters his own home.  It
is very quiet, no one is at home to greet him.  He can see
the evidence of his family; things his wife and his children
have been using, and left on a sofa or a table.

He moves toward his and Kay's bedroom, where we can HEAR the
SOUND of a sewing machine running.

Quietly he opens the door.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

into the bedroom.  Kay is sitting by the window, lit by the
cold afternoon light, at work with her sewing machine.  She
hasn't noticed that he's in the room yet, and goes on with
her work.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

stands there a moment, watching, not making a sound.  And
then without a word, he steps back, and closes the door, so
that she doesn't see him.

VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE

onto Michael, moving outside, walking through the snow, he
moves to the house next to his own.

INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY

This is the house where Mama lives with Connie's children,
Connie so rarely is there.

He steps in; his mother is asleep in a chair in the living
room.  He moves to her, and bends low, whispers.

                    MICHAEL
          Mom... Mom...

She opens her eyes, which are red and small with age.

                    MICHAEL
               (Sicilian)
          It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?

                    MAMA
               (Sicilian)
          I'm alright.  Will you stay home
          for awhile?

                    MICHAEL
               (Sicilian)
          There are still things I have to do.

                    MAMA
               (Sicilian)
          Well, we can all have a nice dinner
          together tonight.  How are your eyes?

                    MICHAEL
          Alright.  They bother me once in
          awhile.
               (a pause as he thinks)
          Tell me, when Pop had troubles...
          did he ever think, even to himself,
          that he had gone the wrong way;
          that maybe by trying to be strong
          and trying to protect his family,
          that he could... that he could...
          lose it instead?

                    MAMA
               (Sicilian)
          You talk about the baby.  She can
          have another baby.

                    MICHAEL
               (Sicilian)
          No, I meant lose his family.

                    MAMA
               (as best she ever
               understood it)
          Your family?  How can you ever lose
          your family?

                    MICHAEL
               (almost to himself)
          But times are different...

FULL VIEW IN ROOM - MICHAEL AND HIS MOTHER

Quietly we HEAR the music of a small band playing an Italian
march.  From the orchestration, we know it is from the past.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TRAIN STATION AT CORLEONE - DAY

Vitone and his young family: Mama, Santino, Fredo and the
baby Michael are met at the small station in Sicily by
friends, and Mama's relatives.  There is a small band,
playing for the occasion.  A small man has brought a motor
car to pick the family up; and there are certain dark men,
with shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the
occasion.

The family is helped into the car; the luggage is packed on
the roof, and the car drives off.  The second car, with
bodyguards following.

EXT. DON TOMASINO'S VILLA OUTSIDE OF CORLEONE - DAY

The villa is bloomed with flowers and DON TOMASINO at this
point is a man in his late twenties.  He embraces Vitone and
pats the heads of his children, and leads them all into the
garden.

INT. THE VILLA - SUMPTUOUS MED. VIEW - LATE DAY

A sumptuous table is set for the visiting family from
America.  There is a warm atmosphere as Vito, his wife and
children eat.  Tomasino and his family received presents
from Carmella and to Tomasino's mother, and gifts are given
to all of the children.

All typically American representing some of the prosperity
and interests in the consumer goods that followed a great war.

EXT. CORLEONE PLAZA - DAY

The family exits the church on the plaza of the town.  Vito
shakes hands warmly with the priest.

INT. VILLAGE COTTAGE - NIGHT

The door is open -- the footsteps of a man enter the room.
We follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they
belong.  They lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an OLD
MAN.  He sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered
by mosquito netting.

VIEW ALTERS

and we realize that it is young Vito looking at the MAN.

We remember that the man is MOSCA, one of three men, who
almost twenty years before had hunted down Vito when he was
a boy.  With lightning speed, Vito slashes through the
mosquito netting with a knife.  And with the movement
precise as a butcher's he disembowls this man.

EXT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - FULL VIEW

Vito has brought his wife and children to see the Olive Oil
Depot which is the link to his New York importing business.
They go inside.

INT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - DAY

They are led by one of Vito's associates through rows and
rows of large vats of olive oil.  Vito very proudly shows
his associates in Italy the olive oil can that will be used
in the United States.  They all stand around at the link to
their new importing business and share a toast of wine.

EXT. THE BAY - DAY

A team of Sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets.
One sings accompanied by a guitar.

VIEW MOVES TO ONE OF THE OLD FISHERMAN

He is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted
Vito down.  STROLLO.  As he walks we notice there is a
figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels,
it is Vito.  He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old
man.  In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his
throat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little
sound.

Then, almost silently dragging him through the space hidden
by the drying sails.

EXT. THE IMPRESSIVE ESTATE OF DON FRANCESCO - DAY

We see an old car approach.  Its driver is the young Tomasino.
Sitting in the car with him is Vito.

The car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and
recognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter.

MED. VIEW

on an almost decrepit DON FRANCESCO.  He must be in his
early nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as
ever, in his throne-like chair from which he manages the
power as the Mafia Chieftan of this village.  Young Don
Tomasino is speaking.

We notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some
younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders.

                    TOMASINO
               (Sicilian)
          Don Francesco, if you will honor
          me, by allowing me to introduce my
          associate in America, in New York.
          His name is Vito Corleone.

The old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who
has taken the name of this town as his name.

                    TOMASINO
          We will supply him with olive oil
          exclusively in the town of Corleone.
          His company is called the "Genco
          Olive Oil Company." Here we have
          brought you an indication of how he
          will sell the product.

Tomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old
man can look at it.  The old man nods, accepting the notion
of this business.

                    TOMASINO
               (Sicilian)
          We have come to ask your blessing
          and permission to continue this
          enterprise.

                    DON FRANCESCO
               (Sicilian)
                (in a shrill, high,
               raspy voice)
          Where is this young man?

                    TOMASINO
          He is right here, standing next to
          me, Don Francesco.

                    DON FRANCESCO
               (Sicilian)
          Have him come closer, I can't see
          very well.

Vito takes those several steps, so that he is standing right
in front of the old man.

VIEW ON DON FRANCESCO

looking up, squinting against the sun.

DON FRANCESCO'S VIEW

Strangely backlit, almost blurry image of the young man from
America.

                    DON FRANCESCO
               (Sicilian)
          What is your name?

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          Vito Corleone.

                    DON FRANCESCO
               (Sicilian)
          You took the name of this town, eh?
          What was your father's name?

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          Antonio Andolini.

CLOSE VIEW ON THE OLD MAN

The recognition of the name throws a shudder through him.
It is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son
of his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had
tried to wipe out.  The old man raises his feeble hands
signalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts:

                    DON FRANCESCO
               (Sicilian)
          Kill him!  Kill him!

But he is too late; Vito steps forward.

                    VITO
               (Sicilian)
          In the name of my Father, and my
          Brother...

And uses the knife, ritualistically plunging it into the old
man's belly, and then up to his throat, which is severed.

has drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards,
helping Vito to escape back into the motor car.

Just as Tomasino is about to get into the car, the shotgun
is fired, and he is hit in the legs.

Vito manages to pull him up into the car, and they make
their escape.

EXT. RAILROAD STATION IN CORLEONE - DAY

Some of the townspeople have come bringing flowers and gifts
for Vito and his family.

His wife is radiant with the flowers given her.

The train has arrived and the crowd shout "Ciao, come back
soon."

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

                    SENATOR KANE (O.S.)
          Are you the son of Vito Corleone?

                    MICHAEL
          Yes.

                    SENATOR KING
          Did he use at times an alias?  Was
          this alias in certain circles
          GODFATHER?

                    MICHAEL
          It was not an alias.  GODFATHER was
          a term of affection, used by his
          friends, one of respect.

                    SENATOR WEEKLER
               (Senator from New
               York, very smooth,
               partly liberal,
               Tammany Hall)
          Let me agree with that.  Many of my
          constituents are Italian and have
          been honored with that certain
          friendship by my close Italian
          friends.  Up to this point before I
          have to leave this hearing to join
          my own committee, let me say, that
          this hearing on the Mafia is in no
          way a slur on the Italians by the
          Senate; nor is it meant to be; nor
          will I allow it to be.  Italian
          Americans are the hardest working,
          most law abiding patriotic Americans
          of our country.  It is a shame and
          a pity that a few rotten apples
          give them a bad name.  We are here
          to weed those rotten apples out of
          the vast healthy barrel of Italian
          Americans, who are one of the
          backbones of our country.

There is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator
poses for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he
will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.

                    SENATOR KANE
          I'm sure we all agree with our
          esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr.
          Corleone, you have been advised as
          to your legal rights.  We have had
          testimony from a preceding witness
          who states you are head of the most
          powerful Mafia family in this
          country.  Are you?

                    MICHAEL
          No.

                    SENATOR KANE
          This witness has testified that you
          are personally responsible for the
          murder of a New York Police Captain
          in the year 1947 and with him a man
          named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny
          this?

                    MICHAEL
          I deny his every charge.

                    SENATOR KANE
          Is it true that in the year 1950
          you devised the murder of the heads
          of the Five Families in New York,
          to assume and consolidate your
          nefarious power?

                    MICHAEL
          That is a complete falsehood.

                    SENATOR KANE
          Is it true that you own a
          controlling interest in three of
          the major hotels in Las Vegas?

                    MICHAEL
          That is not true.  I own some stock
          in some of the hotels, but only
          very small amounts.  I also own
          some American Telephone and IBM
          stock.

Michael had checked this point with Hagen, before answering,
and then once again after the answer.

                    SENATOR ROGERS
          Why is it necessary for your
          counsel to advise you on that
          question?

                    MICHAEL
          Senator, I've observed the head of
          General Motors before a Senate
          Committee, and his lawyer whispered
          in his ear.  That was not commented
          upon in the way you have just done.

                    SENATOR KANE
          Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel
          interests in the state of Arizona?
          Or any gambling interests in that
          state?

                    MICHAEL
          I do not.

                    SENATOR KANE
          Do you have interests or control
          over gambling and narcotics in the
          state of New York.

                    MICHAEL
          I do not.

A pause.  Silence, as the Chairman whispers something to his
assistant.

Tom Hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase, and addresses
the Chair.

                    HAGEN
          Senator, my client would like to
          read a statement for the record.

                    SENATOR KANE
          I don't think that's necessary.

                    HAGEN
          Sir, my client has answered every
          question asked by this committee
          with the utmost cooperation and
          sincerity.  He has not taken that
          Fifth Amendment as it was his right
          to do, and which because of the
          extreme legal complexity of this
          hearing, counsel advised him to do.
          So, I think in all fairness this
          committee should hear his statement
          and put it in the record.

                    SENATOR KANE
          Very well.

At this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the
hearing room.

                    MICHAEL
               (reading)
          In the hopes of clearing my family
          name, in the sincere desire to give
          my children their fair share of the
          American way of life without a
          blemish on their name and background
          I have appeared before this
          committee and given it all the
          cooperation in my power.  I consider
          my being called before this
          committee an act of prejudice to
          all Americans of Italian extraction.
          I consider it a great dishonor to
          me personally to have to deny that
          I am a criminal.  I wish to have
          the following noted for the record.
          That I served my country faithfully
          and honorably in World War II and
          was awarded the Distinguished
          Service Cross for actions in
          defense of my country.  That I have
          never been arrested or indicted for
          any crime whatsoever... that no
          proof linking me to any criminal
          conspiracy, whether it is called
          Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever
          other name you wish to give, has
          ever been made public.  Only one
          man has made charges against me,
          and that man is known to be a
          murderer, arsonist and rapist.  And
          yet this committee had used this
          person to besmirch my name.  My
          personal protest can only be made
          to the people of this country.  I
          can only thank God that in this
          country we have a legal system and
          courts of law to protect innocent
          people from wild accusation.  I
          thank God for our democratic due
          process of Law that shields me from
          the false charges made by this
          committee's witness.  I have not
          taken refuge behind the Fifth
          Amendment, though counsel advised
          me to do so.  I challenge this
          committee to produce any witness or
          evidence against me, and if they do
          not, I hope they will have the
          decency to clear my name with the
          same publicity with which they have
          now besmirched it.  I ask this
          without malice, in the interests of
          fair play.

The television cameras have documented this moment, as Hagen
hands the document over to the committee lawyer.

                    SENATOR ROGERS
          We are all impressed.  The committee
          will now recess over the weekend.
          However, it will continue Monday
          morning, at eleven a.m.  At that
          time, this committee will then
          produce a witness directly linking
          Mr. Corleone to the charges we have
          made.  And then, Mr. Corleone may
          very well by liable for indictments
          of perjury.  However, this document
          will be made a matter of record.

          one shot in my favor, and I lose.

                    FBI MAN #1
          Get a good night's sleep.  We got a
          new suit, new shirt, new tie, and
          I'm going to shave you myself.
          Tomorrow we want you to look
          respectable for fifty million of
          your fellow Americans.

                    PENTANGELI
          My life won't be worth a nickel

          We have a special home for you for
          the rest of your life.  Nobody gets

          place.

                    PENTANGELI
          Yeah, some deal I made.

                    FBI MAN #2
          You live like a king.  You'll be a
          hero.  You'll live better in here
          than most people on the outside.

                    PENTANGELI
          Some deal.
               (pause)
          I just wish Mike had took the Fifth.

          Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After
          all these years, why'd you turn
          against him?

                    PENTANGELI
          I didn't turn against nobody; he
          turned against me.

          How did they get their hands on
          Pentangeli?

                    HAGEN
          Roth engineered it, Michael.  He
          made Pentangeli think you hit him.
          Deliberately letting him get off
          alive.  Then the New York detectives
          turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My
          informants say he was half dead and
          scared stiff -- talking out loud
          that you had turned on him and
          tried to kill him.  Anyway, they
          had him on possession, dealing in
          heroin, murder one and a lot more.
          There's no way we can get to him
          and you've opened yourself to five
          points of perjury.

                    NERI
          They've got him airtight.  He's in
          a military base, twenty-four hour
          guards.  Trying to kill him is like
          trying to like the President --
          it's impossible.

                    MICHAEL
          What does Fredo know?

                    HAGEN
          He says he doesn't know anything,
          and I believe him.  Roth played
          this one beautifully.

                    MICHAEL
          Alright.  I'm going to go outside
          and talk to Fredo.

EXT. BOATHOUSE FOYER - DAY

Fredo sits on the couch.  When Rocco sees Michael, he
automatically takes his leave.  Michael sits in the chair
opposite Fredo.

                    FREDO
               (after a pause)
          I don't have a lot to say, Michael.

                    MICHAEL
          We have time.

                    FREDO
          I was kept pretty much in the dark.
          I didn't know all that much.

                    MICHAEL
          What about now, is there anything
          you can help me out with?

                    FREDO
          I know they get Pentangeli, that's
          all I know.

Fredo gets up, walks to the glass panel that separates the
terrace from the lake.

                    FREDO
          I didn't know it was a hit.  I
          swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny
          Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills --
          said he wanted to talk.  He said
          you and Roth were in on some big
          deal, and there was a place for me
          in it if I could help them out.
          They said you were being tough on
          the negotiation, and if they had a
          little bit of help, they could
          close it fast and it would be good
          for you.

                    MICHAEL
          And you believed that story.

                    FREDO
          He said there was something good in
          it for me...me on my own.

                    MICHAEL
          I've always taken care of you.

                    FREDO
          Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my
          kid brother, and you take care of
          my.  Did you ever think of that.
          Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do
          this, send Fredo to take care of
          that... take care of some little
          unimportant night club here, and
          there; pick somebody up at the
          airport.  Mike, I'm your older
          brother; I was stepped over!

                    MICHAEL
          It's the way Pop wanted it.

                    FREDO
          It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I
          can handle things.  I'm not dumb
          Christ, not like everyone says.
          I'm smart; and I want respect.

                    MICHAEL
          There's nothing more you can tell
          me about this investigation?

                    FREDO
          The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to
          Roth.

                    MICHAEL
          You're nothing to me now, Fredo;
          not a brother, not a friend, I
          don't want to know you, or what
          happens to you.  I don't want to
          see you at the hotels, or near my
          home.  When you visit our Mother, I
          want to know a day in advance, so I
          won't be there.  Do you understand?

Michael turns, and starts to leave.  A frightened voice
behind him:

                    FREDO
          Mikey?

Michael doesn't stop, doesn't turn back.  He continues off
through the veranda, and out the summer doors.

Neri stops by him.

                    MICHAEL
          I don't want anything to happen to
          him while my Mother's alive.

Michael leaves.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

Five cars brimming with Army guards and Agents are waiting
to move Pentangeli.  There is one empty car.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

The two FBI Agents are helping Pentangeli get dressed.  He's
in brightly colored striped shorts and bare-chested.  The
Agents help him with the shirt and tie.  One holds out the
trousers but Pentangeli ignores it and looks at himself in
the mirror.

                    FBI MAN #1
          Ready, Frankie.

                    PENTANGELI
          Let's go.

The Agents open the door, and precede him, surveying the
area.  They check the cars waiting, each with two Agents.
They check the gate and note the military sentries.  Then
they stand aside, and let Pentangeli come out.  They get
close to his side, and it is obvious they will protect his
life with their own.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

The Agents put him in the front seat of the empty car, and
get in with him, one at each side.  Another Agent drives.
Now, the first cars start out; the Sentries opening the
gates, and letting the caravan pass.

An Army supply truck comes very close to them, and the
Agents next to Pentangeli become very tense.  Pentangeli
grins.  Then the truck passes on, and they relax.

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY

The room is crowded with TV journalists, cameras, etc.  We
pick Pentangeli up, closely guarded, being led to witness
chair.

Pentangeli is seated, and made to take his oath.  FBI Agents
are all around him.

MED. VIEW

Anyone given entrance to the caucus room is being frisked.
The five Senators take their places.

VIEW ON HAGEN

waiting at his long table, very nervous.  He seems startled
by the appearance of Pentangeli.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

catching Hagen's eye.  It's as though he is pleading for
some kind of understanding of the fact that he has become a
traitor.

VIEW ON HAGEN

cold; then he turns away.

VIEW ON THE ENTRANCE

The bustle is settling down; then Michael Corleone enters,
and with him is someone very peculiar and out of keeping for
this setting.  A burly-chested imposing man of middle age.
Very powerful-looking with frightening magnetic eyes.  His
dress is odd: boots, rough tie, and shirt.  He could be the
tenor out of a Sicilian opera.  He is clearly a country Don,
direct from Sicily, and he dominates the room.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

At first his view is blocked.  Then he sees Michael and is a
bit shamefaced, but still defiant.

PENTANGELI'S POV

Michael returns his glances without emotion.  Then the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the Sicilian.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

He is terror stricken; obviously he recognizes the man.

VIEW ON HAGEN'S TABLE

Michael and the Sicilian sit by Hagen, where they can stare
directly at Pentangeli; he is frozen with fear.

VIEW ON THE SENATOR

Notices the tension in the room.  The Chairman commences:

                    SENATOR KANE
          We have here a witness who will
          testify further on Michael
          Corleone's rule of the criminal
          empire that controls gambling in
          this country and perhaps in other
          countries.  This witness had no
          buffer between himself and Michael
          Corleone.  He can corroborate our
          charges on enough counts for this
          committee to consider a charge of
          perjury against Michael Corleone.
               (then he turns to Pentangeli)
          Your name please, for the record.

                    PENTANGELI
          Frank Pentangeli.

                    SENATOR KANE
          Were you a member of the Corleone
          Family?  Were you under the
          Caporegime Peter Clemenza, under
          Vito Corleone, known as the
          Godfather?

There is a long silence.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

He seems unable to speak.

VIEW ON THE SICILIAN

gazing at him.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

                    PENTANGELI
          I never knew no Godfather.  I got
          my own family.

Senator Kane is stunned.  The two FBI men are alert, their
eyes searching the room for what has intimidated their
witness at the last moment.

                    SENATOR KANE
          Mr. Pentangeli, you are
          contradicting your confessions to
          our investigators; I ask you again,
          were you a member of a crime
          organization headed by Michael
          Corleone?

                    PENTANGELI
          No.  I never heard of it.  I never
          heard of nothing like that.  I was
          in the olive oil business with his
          father a long time ago.  That's all.

                    SENATOR KANE
          We have your confession that you
          murdered on the orders of Michael
          Corleone.  Do you deny that
          confession and do you know what
          denying that confession will mean
          to you?

The die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will go
all the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the
Senator.

                    PENTANGELI
          The FBI guys promised me a deal.
          So I made up a lot of stuff about
          Michael Corleone.  Because then,
          that's what they wanted.  But it
          was all lies.  Everything.  They
          said Michael Corleone did this,
          Michael Corleone did that.  So I
          said, "Yeah, sure."

He makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of
everybody.

VIEW ON THE FBI AGENTS

glancing around the room; their eyes have settled on the
Sicilian.  One of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper,
and passes it to the Committee lawyer.  Then in turn it goes
to Senator Kane.

                    SENATOR KANE
          Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify
          to this committee that gentleman
          sitting on your right hand?

                    HAGEN
               (coolly)
          Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo
          Pentangeli.

                    SENATOR KANE
          Is he related to the witness?

                    HAGEN
          He is, I believe, a brother.

VIEW ON MICHAEL AND VINCENZO PENTANGELI

They wait with no expression.

                    SENATOR KANE
               (to Vincenzo Pentangeli)
          Sir, I would like you to take the
          stand.

Vincenzo stares at him, uncomprehending.  There may just be
a shadow of contempt.  He doesn't answer.

                    HAGEN
          Sir, the gentleman does not
          understand English.  He would not
          in any case, take the stand.  He
          came, at his own expense, to aid
          his brother in his trouble.  He is
          not under any jurisdiction of our
          government and his reputation in
          his own country is impeccable.

                    SENATOR KANE
               (furious)
          The witness is excused; take him out.

The guards and FBI Agents quickly remove Pentangeli, as
everybody else in the room is required to sit still.

                    HAGEN
          Senator Kane.

                    SENATOR KANE
          This meeting is adjourned.

                    HAGEN
               (rising and shouting)
          This committee owes an apology!

                    SENATOR KANE
          The committee is adjourned until
          further notice.

For the first time, in the midst of the confusion, Hagen
smiles.  A bitter, contemptuous smile.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

The modest champion.  He rises and they take their leave.

VIEW ON THE TWO FBI AGENTS

They watch the Corleone party as they exit.

INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

The Corleone nurse is waiting, playing with the little girl
MARY.  A distance away, the boy, Anthony, is standing by
himself.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - WASHINGTON HOTEL - DAY

The door to Michael's suite opens; Rocco leans in.

                    ROCCO
          It's Kay.

Michael is sitting in an easy chair; he seems to have
difficulty with his eyes.

                    MICHAEL
          On the phone?

                    ROCCO
          No, she's here.

Michael rises, surprised.  Rocco steps back, and Kay enters.

                    MICHAEL
          I had no idea...

                    KAY
          I wanted to see you before you went
          back to Nevada.  Also, the
          children - Michael, they're here.

                    MICHAEL
          Where?

                    KAY
          In a minute.  They're outside with
          Esther.  I'm very happy for you...
          I suppose I knew that you're simply
          too smart for anyone ever to beat
          you.

                    MICHAEL
          Why don't you sit down?

                    KAY
          I'm not going to stay long; I can't.

                    MICHAEL
          There are a lot of things I want to
          talk to you about.  Things I've
          been thinking about -- changes I
          want to make.

                    KAY
          I think it's too late for changes,
          Michael.  I promised myself I
          wouldn't talk about it and I've
          gone and spoiled it.

                    MICHAEL
          Why too late?

                    KAY
          Tell me, Michael.  What really
          happened with Pentangeli?

                    MICHAEL
          His brother came to help him.

                    KAY
          I didn't even know he had a brother.
          And where is he now?

                    MICHAEL
          On a plane back to Sicily.

                    KAY
          And that's all he had to do.  Just
          show his face.

                    MICHAEL
          That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in
          the old days... there was only one
          legitimate reason to kill a blood
          relative... only one.  IF he was a
          traitor.

                    KAY
          You would have killed his brother?

                    MICHAEL
          Kay, you've got it wrong.  That
          kind of thing's all over, I promised
          you.  This was between the two
          brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a
          young girlfriend; he called her his
          co-wife.  That was his joke, but he
          meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his
          wife... because she was a great
          cook.  He said he girlfriend made a
          spaghetti sauce once and it was so
          terrible he knew he could never
          marry her.  He set her up in a
          house in Jersey.  She had to be
          faithful... and she had to have kids.
          And she did, two, a boy and a girl.
          He had her checked out and watched
          so she couldn't cheat... but the
          girl couldn't stand that kind of
          life.  She begged him to let her go.
          He did.  He gave her money and made
          her give up the kids.  Then Frankie
          took them to Italy, and had them
          brought up by his brother Vincenzo.
          Where he knew they'd by safe.

Kay begins to realize.

                    MICHAEL
          When he saw his brother in the
          hearing room, he knew what was at
          stake.
               (pause)
          I don't think Vincenzo would have
          done it.  He loves the kids, too.
          Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It
          had nothing to do with me.  It was
          between those brothers.

                    KAY
          I'll bring the children up now;
          they want to say goodbye.

                    MICHAEL
          Kay, I told you...

                    KAY
          Goodbye, Michael.

                    MICHAEL
          I won't let you leave!  Christ, do
          you think I'm going to let you leave.

                    KAY
               (meekly)
          Michael.

                    MICHAEL
          No, I don't want to hear anything.
          There are things between men and
          women that will not change; things
          that have been the same for
          thousands of years.  You are my
          wife, and they are my children...
          and I love you and I will not let
          you leave, because you are MINE!

                    KAY
          Oh, I do feel things for you,
          Michael; but now, I think it's pity.
          For the first time since I've known
          you, you seem so helpless.  You
          held me a prisoner once; will you
          try again?

                    MICHAEL
          If that's what it takes; then yes,
          I will.

                    KAY
          At this moment, I feel no love for
          you at all.  I never thought that
          could happen, but it has.

                    MICHAEL
          We'll go back tonight.  Bring the
          children.

                    KAY
          You haven't heard me.

He moves to her; he does love her, and is tender with her.

                    MICHAEL
          How can I let you leave; how can I
          let you take my children away?
          Don't you know me?  You understand,
          it's an impossibility.  I would
          never let it happen; no, never, not
          if it took all my strength, all my
          cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll
          feel differently.  You see, you'll
          be happy that I stopped you.  I
          know you.  You'll forget about
          this; you'll forget about the baby
          we lost... and we'll go on, you and
          I.

                    KAY
          The baby I lost...

                    MICHAEL
          I know what it meant... and I'm
          prepared to make it up to you.  I
          will make changes; I can.
               (he clenches his fist tightly)
          I CAN change; that I have learned,
          that I have the strength to change...
          And we have another child, a boy...
          and you'll forget the miscarriage.

                    KAY
          It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you
          with your cunning, couldn't you
          figure it out!  It was an abortion;
          an abortion, like our marriage is
          an abortion, something unholy and
          evil.  I don't want your son; I
          wouldn't bring another of your sons
          into this world.  An abortion,
          Michael... it was a son, and I had
          it killed, but this must all end!

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He had no hint, not in his wildest imagination could he have
guessed that she would do such a thing.

                    KAY
          And I know that now it's over; I
          knew it then, there would be no way
          you could ever forgive me, not with
          this Sicilian thing that goes back
          two thousand years.

He is silent, though raging -- then, with all his passion,
and his strength, he raises his arms, and strikes her across
her neck, literally knocking her down to the floor, and
hurting her badly.

                    MICHAEL
               (coldly)
          You won't take my children.

                                   FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. THE CORLEONE ESTATE AT TAHOE - FULL VIEW - DAY

A collection of dark cars and black limousines are gathered
to one side.  A few drivers wait quietly.

And then, to the other extreme of the estate, is a small
grouping of about twenty to thirty people, gathered near
Michael's house.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Connie Corleone, dressed simply and now showing her age
without the carefully applied makeup which we have been used
to, kneels down before the shrine of Santa Theresa, and puts
down a bouquet of flowers, along with others that have been
placed there.  We see that some have the simple silk ribbon
with the word "Mama" hand-lettered upon it.

Her two children stand close behind her; they had been
raised by their Grandmother.

Connie steps back, and moves through the small group of
friends and relatives, into Michael's house.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - CONNIE'S VIEW - DAY

Fredo, kneeling by the coffin of his mother in a portion of
the house that has been set aside for the wake.  Fredo
concludes his prayer, wipes away the tears in his eyes and
steps away from the coffin.

He stops when he notices Neri, a little distance away,
looking at him.

VIEW ON NERI

After a moment, he nods respectfully to Fredo, and steps
forward, moving to the old woman's coffin.  Fredo moves to
Hagen, who is there with his wife and children.

                    FREDO
          Tom.  Where's Mike?

                    HAGEN
               (difficult to tell him)
          He's waiting for you to leave.

                    FREDO
          Can I talk to him?

                    HAGEN
          No chance.  I'm sorry, Freddie.

                    CONNIE
               (who has heard this)
          Can I see him?

                    HAGEN
          He's in the boathouse.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael sits quietly in the darkened room in one of the big
sofas, dressed immaculately in suit and tie.  His two
children, also dressed for the wake sit opposite him in the
other oversized sofa, their shoes not touching the floor.
We regard this tableau for a long moment.

                    CONNIE (O.S.)
               (quietly)
          Michael?  It's Connie.

She comes in, and sits down by his knees.

                    CONNIE
          I want to stay close to home now,
          is that alright?

Michael nods.

                    CONNIE
          Is Kay coming?

                    MICHAEL
          No.

                    CONNIE
          Michael, Fredo's in the house with
          Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom
          said he couldn't see you.

                    MICHAEL
          Tom is right.

                    CONNIE
          Kids, why don't you go outside for
          a while?

The children don't move; Connie realizes they will only
listen to Michael.

                    CONNIE
          I want to talk to you, Michael.

                    MICHAEL
          The children can stay.

                    CONNIE
          I hated you for so long, Michael;
          for so many years.  I think I did
          things to myself, to hurt myself,
          so that you would know -- and you
          would be hurt too.  But I understand
          you now; I think I do.  You were
          being strong for all of us, like
          Papa was.  And I forgive you, and
          want to be close to you now.  Can't
          you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet,
          and helpless without you.

Slowly, Michael puts his hand on her hair, and touches her
gently.

                    CONNIE
          You need me, Michael.  I want to be
          with you now.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

Friends, relatives; Francesca and her new husband, Gardner
and their baby; Sandra Corleone; Teresa, her children; all
the familiar faces of the family are present, quietly paying
their respects to Mama.

Some of the men can be seen in the kitchen, drinking wine,
and talking in low voices.

Fredo is there, broken-hearted over the loss of his Mother;
like some lost child with no friends.

MED. VIEW

Michael enters the room, followed by Connie, who tends
little Mary and Anthony.

He approaches his brother, and then embraces.  Fredo breaks
into tears.

                    FREDO
          Christ, Mike.  Jesus Christ, Mike.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

embracing his brother, he glances up.

VIEW ON NERI

quiet, and deadly.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Tom Hagen is talking in the distance to his wife, and one of
his older sons; he kisses, and moves toward the boathouse.
After crossing the lawn, he stops.

VIEW ON SANDRA CORLEONE

waiting there; obviously wanting to talk to him.  He
continues, and she walks with him.

MOVING VIEW ON THE TWO

as they cross toward the boathouse.

                    SANDRA
          You're going to talk to him now.

                    HAGEN
          Yes.

                    SANDRA
          Will you tell him?

                    HAGEN
          I don't know.

She stops him.

                    SANDRA
          Tom, think of yourself for once.
          Don't let this opportunity slip
          through your fingers; don't do it.
          We're all trapped here, don't you
          see?

He continues past her, without answering her.  Continues up
to the boathouse.  He stops before he enters.

HAGEN'S VIEW

Fredo is sitting by the edge of the harbor with Michael's
son Anthony; he is helping him with some fishing rig.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

looking through the window at his son and brother.  Neri
sits in the room, dressed informally.

                    MICHAEL
               (without looking back)
          Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard
          about our friend and partner, Mr.
          Hyman Roth?

                    HAGEN
          I know he's in Israel.

                    NERI
               (hands Hagen the paper)
          The High Court of Israel turned
          down his request to live as a
          'returned Jew.' His passport's been
          invalidated except for return to
          the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires
          yesterday, offered a gift of one
          million dollars if they would give
          him citizenship.  They turned him
          down.

                    HAGEN
               (reading)
          He's going to try Panama...

                    MICHAEL
          They won't take him; not for a
          million, not for ten million.

                    HAGEN
          His medical condition is reported
          as... "terminal."

                    MICHAEL
          He's been dying of the same heart
          attack for twenty years.

                    HAGEN
          That plane goes to Miami...

                    MICHAEL
          I want it met.

                    HAGEN
               (understanding)
          Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be
          met by the Internal Revenue; the
          Customs Service, and half the FBI.

                    MICHAEL
          I don't like it when you use the
          word impossible; nothing is
          impossible...

                    HAGEN
          Mike, it would be like trying to
          kill the President; there's no way
          we can get to him.

                    MICHAEL
          I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If
          there's anything certain; certain
          in life; if history has taught us
          anything, it's that you can kill...
               (he stops, then coldly)
          ANYBODY.  But perhaps your
          relucatance is because you've come
          to tell me that you're moving your
          family to Vegas, that you've been
          offered the Vice-Presidency of the
          Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't
          you going to tell me at all?

                    HAGEN
          Are you so hungry for traitors; do
          you want to find them everywhere?

                    MICHAEL
          They are everywhere!

                    HAGEN
          I turned Houstan down; I didn't see
          why I should tell you about an
          offer I turned down.
               (Michael begins to
               confuse him)
          Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure
          of what we're doing; what we'll
          gain; what does the family gain?
          Forget that, Mike; I already know
          the answer.

                    MICHAEL
          I know you do, Tom.  Then I can
          count on you to help me do the
          things I have to do.  If not, call
          Houstan, and become a Vice-President.
          Take your family and your mistress
          and move them to Las Vegas.

                    HAGEN
          Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've
          always been loyal to you.

                    MICHAEL
          Good.  Then you're staying.

                    HAGEN
          I'm staying.
               (he pauses...then,
               without being asked)
          Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of
          all this; Sonny never listened to
          me about that.
               (then he sits down,
               and opens his briefcase)
          Now, explain everything to me.

EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

Fredo sits with Anthony, with a silly-looking fishing hat on
his head, covered with lure and flies.

                    FREDO
          Anthony, ole buddy, your Uncle
          Fredo's gonna teach you how to
          catch the big fish.  You know, when
          I was a kid, I did this amazing
          thing.  I went out on a fishing
          trip; me and my brothers and my
          Pop, and no one could catch a fish
          except me.  And this was my secret:
               (confidentially)
          Every time I would put the line
          down I would say a "Hail Mary" and
          every time I said a "Hail Mary" I
          would catch a fish.  Now, when it's
          sunset, we're gonna go out on the
          lake, and we're gonna try it.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

The guards step aside as Tom Hagen enters the foyer of the
house.  He shows a court order to them and they lead him up
the stairs where he knocks on the door.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

There is a KNOCK at the door.  The two guards show Hagen in
and Hagen presents the court order to one of the FBI men.

                    HAGEN
          I think I prefer to see my client
          privately.

                    PENTANGELI
          The room has a bug in it.

                    HAGEN
               (to the FBI men)
          I'd like to go outside with him, in
          the open air.

                    FBI MAN #1
          This room is not bugged.

                    HAGEN
          You have guards outside and the
          electric fence.  There's no security
          reason for not letting us talk in
          the yard.

                    FBI MAN #1
          Okay.

They pass out of the room.

EXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY

Hagen and Pentangeli outside, by the electric fence.  They
cannot be overheard.  Pentangeli takes out some cigars and
offers Hagen one.  Hagen takes it and Pentangeli lights both
their cigars.  They puff on them contentedly.  They are
comfortable together, almost.

                    HAGEN
          Everything is going to be okay,
          Frankie, don't worry.

                    PENTANGELI
          Did my brother go back?

                    HAGEN
          Yeah, but don't worry.

                    PENTANGELI
          He's ten times tougher than me, my
          brother.  He's old-fashioned.

                    HAGEN
          Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to
          dinner.  Just wanted to go home.

                    PENTANGELI
          That's my brother.  Nothing could
          get him away from that two mule
          town.  He coulda been big over
          here -- he could of had his own
          Family.

                    HAGEN
          You're right.

                    PENTANGELI
          Tom, what do I do now?

The light is beginning to turn reddish as the sun falls.

                    HAGEN
          Frankie, you were always interested
          in politics, in history.  I remember
          you talking about Hitler back in
          '43.  We were young then.

                    PENTANGELI
          Yeah, I still read a lot.  They
          bring me stuff.

                    HAGEN
          You were around the old timers who
          dreamed up how the Families should
          be organized, how they based it on
          the old Roman Legions, and called
          them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos'
          and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.

                    PENTANGELI
          Yeah, it worked.  Those were great
          old days.  We was like the Roman
          Empire.  The Corleone family was
          like the Roman Empire.

                    HAGEN
               (sadly)
          Yeah, it was once.

They both puff on their cigars.  Pentangeli lets himself be
carried away by thoughts of old days of glory; Hagen thinks
of other days too.

                    HAGEN
               (very gently)
          The Roman Empire... when a plot
          against the Emperor failed, the
          plotters were always given a chance
          to let their families keep their
          fortunes.

                    PENTANGELI
          Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The
          little guys got knocked off.  If
          they got arrested and executed, all
          their estate went to the Emperor.
          If they just went home and killed
          themselves, up front, nothing
          happened.

                    HAGEN
          Yeah, that was a good break.  A
          nice deal.

Pentangeli looks at Hagen; he understands.

                    PENTANGELI
          They went home and sat in a hot
          bath and opened their veins, and
          bled to death.  Sometimes they gave
          a little party before they did it.

Hagen throws away his cigar.  Pentangeli puffs on his.

                    HAGEN
          Don't worry about anything, Frankie
          Five-Angels.

                    PENTANGELI
          Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.

They shake hands.  The FBI Agents come out to let Hagen out
the gate.  Pentangeli is led back to the house.

                    FBI MAN #1
          Your lawyer tell you he can get
          that 600 years reduced to 500?

Pentangeli puffs on his cigar and reflects.

                    PENTANGELI
          You boys sure you can't get me a
          broad for tonight?  Give me a
          little party?

                    FBI MAN #2
          We got some nice books.

Pentangeli puffs on his cigar and gives the Agent a smile an
old man gives a child.  He starts upstairs.

                    PENTANGELI
          I guess I'll just take a hot bath.

EXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY

Hagen walks away; glances back.  Then gets into his waiting
car and drives off.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - FULL VIEW - SUNSET

Michael sits alone in the empty boathouse; in the shadows.

INT. BOAT DOCK - SUNSET

Neri stands by the dock area under the boathouse.  He pushes
the button which lowers a boat by winch and tackle.  He
wears a fishing cap.

He steps into the boat, and pulls the small outboard, which
glides the boat out into the harbor.

MED. VIEW

The boat pulls up alongside Fredo and Anthony.

                    FREDO
          Here we go; and remember the secret.

He lifts Anthony into the boat.

                    CONNIE (O.S.)
          Anthony.

THEIR VIEW

Connie, in houseclothes, is calling Anthony.

                    FREDO
          He's here; we're goin' fishing.

                    CONNIE
          He can't go; Michael wants to take
          him into Reno.

                    FREDO
          Ah.  Okay, kid, you got to go to

He lifts the boy out of the boat, and puts him on the shore.

                    FREDO
          I'll catch one for you, with the
          secret.

                    CONNIE
          Hurry, Anthony.

Neri stands the motor; and the boat with the two fisherman
glides off.

INT. HIGH SECURITY HOUSE IN ARMY POST - NIGHT

The FBI man knocks on the bathroom door in the house where
they have kept Pentangeli.

                    FBI MAN #1
          Frankie, open up.  You okay?

No answer; he hammers on the door.  Using his elbow, and
then a kick he breaks into the bathroom.

HIS VIEW

Pentangeli lying in a tub of water.  His stomach shows above
it.  His wrists are cut and covered with blood.  The bath
water has a purplish tone.

INT. MIAMI AIRPORT - NIGHT

An exhausted Hyman Roth, ill-shaven, and in shirt-sleeves in
taken into custody by a swarm of Customs, and FBI men.  They
allow him to be photographed by press people; and television
cameramen.

                    FBI MAN
          Mr. Roth, we have to take you into
          custody.

                    ROTH
          Yes, I know.

Some flashbulbs go off.

                    REPORTER
          Can you give us your reaction to
          the High Court of Israel's ruling.

                    ROTH
          I am a retired investor on a
          pension, and I wished to live there
          as a Jew  in the twilight of my
          life...

                    LAWYER
          Mr. Roth is not a well man; he's
          tired of running.

                    ROTH
          I'm an old man; at my age, it's too
          late to start worrying.

                    REPORTER
          Is it true you are worth over three
          hundred million dollars, Mr. Roth?

                    ROTH
          I'm a retired investor, living on a
          pension... I came home to vote in
          the Presidential election, because
          they wouldn't give me an absentee
          ballot...

The newsmen and photographers all laugh, as the FBI men move
him away.

CLOSE VIEW

One of the newspapermen laughing we recognize to be Rocco
Lampone.

He moves closer to Roth, and shoves his revolver right
against his head, and in a second, on camera, assassinates
Roth.  People scream, as Rocco attempts to run down the
airport corridor, limping as he does.

FBI men easily pick him off.

                                   FADE OUT.

EXT. THE DRIVEWAY BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

A taxi cab waits by the house; its driver sleeping with a
newspaper over his face.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

The cleaning woman, Esther, who had been with Kay for years,
sits by the dining room table, weeping profusely.  Behind
her, in the recreation room, we can see the tableau of Kay
sitting on the couch, her little daughter Mary, between her
knees, talking quietly about things we cannot hear.  Her son
Anthony sits by himself, in another chair by the side of the
room.

MED. VIEW

Connie comes into the house quickly, and moves toward them.

                    CONNIE
          Kay, you have to go.

This prompts Esther to weep all the more.  Kay hugs her
daughter, and kisses her many times.

                    CONNIE
          You have to hurry; he's coming.

Kay puts her coat on; then stands, and reaches out for her
son.

                    KAY
          Anthony, kiss Mama goodbye.

He doesn't move.

                    CONNIE
               (angrily)
          Anthony, you kiss your Mother
          goodbye!

He rises, and walks to her.  Hugs her lifelessly.

          loves you.

                    ANTHONY
          Goodbye.

She restrains any tears; she has become too strong for tears.
Kay starts to go; picks up Mary, kisses her, and starts to go.

NEW VIEW

She steps out the kitchen door; then she cannot help herself.
Crouches down, outside, and calls to her son.

                    KAY
          Anthony, kiss me once.

Then she looks up, and slowly rises.

HER VIEW

Michael has stepped into the dining room.  He seems older
somehow; as though some sickness has taken more years away
from him.

VIEW ON KAY

looks at him; instinctively, she takes a step back.

slowly steps toward her.

VIEW ON KAY

Another step back; the door is still open.

He moves closer to the door; stops, looks at her.  And then
closes it obscuring any view of her.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

It is late fall -- most of the leaves have fallen on the
grounds and there is quite a wind.

MED. VIEW

The water is whipped up by the wind, and the waves are high
as they break against the pavilion.  We HEAR the MUSIC of
time passing, of Michael, of the Godfather over these images.

VIEW ON THE SWIMMING POOLS

They have not been used in several months; they are drained
and the bottoms are mossy and dark.

VIEW ON THE MAIN GATE

Leaves blowing past it; we don't see the button men; only a
hint of someone in the gatehouse.

VIEW ON THE HOUSES

Some of the houses have had the summer awnings taken down,
and put away.  Some of the windows have been boarded up.

VIEW ON THE KENNELS

There are still the guard dogs; some sleeping, some moving
impatiently.

As the MUSIC concludes its statement.

MED. VIEW

The peninsula of the private Corleone Harbor.  We see the
figures of two people, seated at a table.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a table having a sparse lunch.  He is
attended by his sister Connie, who seems to be the closest
person now living on the estate with him.  We see from the
way she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into
the role of a surrogate Mother-Wife.  He seems older than
his years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its
toll.

                    CONNIE
          Don't worry; I'm sure he got here
          on time.  The roads from the
          airport are so windy, it takes
          forever; I've driven them myself.

She picks up some of the serving plates that he has left
untouched.

                    CONNIE
          I'll bring him out to you as soon
          as he comes.

She moves back to the main house.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

He turns and looks at the rough water of the lake for a
moment.  He slowly takes a sip of wine.

EXT. A PLACE IN THE GARDEN - DAY

There are a few chairs.

MED. VIEW ON ANTHONY CORLEONE

He is eighteen years old.

          Hello, Dad.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

squinting up at his son.

                    MICHAEL
          Anthony.

He rises, and reaches up to his son, who is now taller than
he; he embraces him.

                    MICHAEL
          You've grown so tall... so tall in
          the last year.  You're much taller
          than me.

                    ANTHONY
          I was taller than you when I was
          fourteen.

                    MICHAEL
          Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I
          waited for you to have some lunch,
          but now it's all dried out.

                    ANTHONY
          I'm not hungry.

                    MICHAEL
          Well, that's alright... alright.
          Good.  You'll graduate in another
          year, isn't that right?  You know...
          I never finished college.  I was a
          good student, but I never finished.
          Of course, there was a war then.

Connie approaches them.

                    CONNIE
          Don't let me interrupt anything,
          this will just take a second.  Here.
               (she takes out a
               small needle, and
               begins to prepare it)
          Your father has to have his insulin
          shot.  Why don't you go to your
          room and put your things away,
          Anthony.

She begins to give Michael the shot.

                    MICHAEL
          Hurry back; we'll talk.  We'll talk.

Anthony goes on his way to the house with his things.
Connie gives Michael the shot.

                    CONNIE
          Whenever I see that lake so cold, I
          think of poor Fredo, drowned.  Lake
          Tahoe is very cold.  They say if a
          person drowns in it, that the body
          will remain mid-suspended --
          perfectly preserved.  Some say it
          will remain forever.

She finishes the shot, puts her things away.

                    CONNIE
          Your boy will be right back.

She leaves.

Alone in the garden.

OUR VIEW begins to MOVE CLOSER to him.  We begin to HEAR
MUSIC of the forties; happy music, swing music, as we move

INT. OLD CORLEONE HOUSE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

SONNY CORLEONE, his arm wrapped around a smiling red-faced
Carlo Rizzi, pulls him into the Corleone dining room.

                    SONNY
          Hey, who knows my buddy Carlo Rizzi.
          Here... my brother Fredo, here's my
          Mom.  Mom, whatcha got cooking?
          And Carlo, this is my kid sister
          Connie.  Here, pull up a chair,
          Carol is sitting next to Connie.
          Oh, the droopy kid over there is
          Mike.  The college boy.

An older, lanky man enters the room, his arms laden with
presents.  This is TESSIO.

                    TESSIO
          Buon Natale, everybody.  Buon
          Natale...

Now the study door opens, and DON CORLEONE enters.

          Is dinner ready?

                    MOM
          Two minutes.

The Don happily regards his family; his sons and daughters
and even some Grandchildren.  He raises a glass.

                    DON CORLEONE
          A good life, a long life to all my
          children, and friends.  To my
          grandchildren, and those that will
          be.  To our family.

They all drink.

They refill glasses; then Tessio proposes a toast.

                    TESSIO
          To our Godfather.

They all drink.

INT. THE DINING ROOM - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The family is happily at Christmas dinner.  Don Corleone
seated at the head of the table.

                    SONNY
          What'd you think of those Japs, eh?
          The nerve of those Japs, coming
          right here in our own backyard
          dropping bombs!

                    HAGEN
          Well, we could have expected it
          after the embargo.

                    SONNY
          Hey!  Expect it or not, those Japs
          don't have a right to drop bombs in
          our backyard.  Whose side you on?

                    MAMA
          Please, do we have to talk about
          the war at the table?  On Christmas,
          much less.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He has been listening to this discussion.

                    MICHAEL
          Pop, I've decided I'm going to
          enlist.

A quiet hush descends over the table, as though everyone
knows the effect this will have on the old man.  Sonny tries
to make light of it.

                    SONNY
          Kid, stay in college.  The girls
          are cuter, if you know what I mean.

                    HAGEN
          Pop had to pull a lot of strings to
          get you your deferment.

                    MICHAEL
          I never asked for it; I don't want
          it.

VIEW ON DON CORLEONE

Disturbed; but wise and prudent.

                    DON CORLEONE
          My son wants to talk about this,
          and so we'll talk, but not at the
          dinner table.

He rises, and starts across the room toward his study.  Then
he looks back.

                    DON CORLEONE
          Michael.

He disappears into his study.  Michael rises, glances around.
People are generally tense over the situation.  Michael
follows his father into the study.

INT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD STUDY - NIGHT

The Don closes the door behind his son, and then moves
across the room.  He stops at the little bar there, and
pours himself a brandy.

                    DON CORLEONE
          Would you like some?

                    MICHAEL
          No, Dad.

          the army?  Eh?

                    MICHAEL
          It's not talk; I'm doing it.

                    DON CORLEONE
          You would risk your life for
          strangers?

                    MICHAEL
          Not for strangers; for my country.

                    DON CORLEONE
          Anyone not in your family, is a
          stranger.  Believe me, when trouble
          comes, your country won't take care
          of you.

                    MICHAEL
          That's how it was in the old world,
          Pop, but this is not Sicily.
