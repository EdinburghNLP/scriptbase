Alex Manning (Megan Ward) is a troubled suburban teenager.
Her mother committed suicide and the school counselor feels that she has not dealt with her feelings properly.
Manning and her friends decide to visit the local video arcade known as "Dante's Inferno" where a new virtual reality arcade game called "Arcade" is being test marketed by a computer company CEO who is more than willing to hand out free samples of the home console version and hype up the game as if his job is depending on it, and it is.

However, it soon becomes clear that the teenagers who play the game and lose are being imprisoned inside the virtual reality world by the central villain: "Arcade".
It would seem that "Arcade" was once a little boy who was beaten to death by his mother, and the computer company felt it would be a good idea to use some of the boy's brain cells in order to make the game's villain more realistic.
Instead, it made the game deadly.

Nick and Alex enlist the help of the game's programmer and head to the video arcade for a final showdown with "Arcade" and his deadly virtual world.
While Alex is able to release her friends from a virtual prison, she also ended up freeing the evil little boy, who taunts Alex in the final moments of the film.
