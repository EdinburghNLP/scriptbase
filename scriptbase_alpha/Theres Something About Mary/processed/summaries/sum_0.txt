Ted was a geek in high school, who was going to go to the prom with one of the most popular girls in school, Mary.
The prom date never happened, because Ted had a very unusual accident.
Thirteen years later he realizes he is still in love with Mary, so he hires a private investigator to track her down.

But soon Ted finds himself back into Mary's life, as we watch one funny scene after another.
