<b>                        MARGOT AT THE WEDDING
</b>


                             Written by

                            Noah Baumbach

</b><b>1   INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY                                          1
</b>
    A cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. The
    boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. He lifts the cardboard
    tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two Cokes. This
    is Claude.

    We follow him: He carefully carries the meal down the aisle,
    balances it in one hand as he opens the door.

    The train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars.

    He enters the new car repeating the balancing act. He waits
    while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above
    the seats. Claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration
    alternating between the food and the path.

    He sits next to a brunette woman.   He hands her a hot dog.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>              Here.

    He's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black
    circles -- there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly
    blushes and mumbles:

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>              Sorry.

    He gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next
    to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder
    length hair. Her name is Margot.

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              That was quick.

<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              I sat next to the wrong person.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>              Really?   Where?
    She stretches up and peers over the seats.   He grabs her
    shirt.
<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              Please don't look.    She'll see you.
<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              Careful with my blouse.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             2.
</b>

<b>2   CUT TO:                                                       2
</b>
    Margot is sleeping, her head against the window. Claude
    listens to his iPod. He takes out the earphones, gets up,
    and walks to the front of the car. Opens the door and goes
    between cars.

    The train roars and screeches. Claude screams.   He stops,
    looks around. He screams again.

<b>3   CUT TO:                                                       3
</b>
    Claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a
    river. An old castle-like structure emerges from the water.

    Houses are run-down. In the distance there's a power plant.
    Electrical lines crisscross the sky. Claude puts his finger
    against the glass and traces the wires.

<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              Will the wedding be crowded?

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              I don't know. I think she doesn't
              know anyone anymore.

<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              How long has she known Malcolm?

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              Only a year.

<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              Is that short?

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>                  (pointedly)
              Would you marry someone you'd only
              known a year?
<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              I'm not going to ever get married.
<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              I can't say I have a lot of hope
              for the whole thing.
<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              Why are we going then?

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              We're supporting her.
<b>
</b><b>                                                               3.
</b>

<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              I thought she wasn't speaking to
              you.

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              No...no...I wasn't speaking to her,
              but I'm over it.

<b>4   EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY                                           4
</b>
    A ferry is docked. Cars pull up onto the boat. Margot runs,
    clutching a suitcase, holding down a floppy wine colored sun
    hat. Claude hurries alongside her, a bag slung over his
    shoulder.

<b>5   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                                5
</b>
    The rumbling and sputtering of the boat.    People get out of
    their cars and stretch their legs.

    Claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his
    face. Margot's cell vibrates. The caller ID: HOME. She
    stuffs the phone in her pocket.

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              Why aren't you wearing your new
              shades?

<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              I don't think I need them right
              now.

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              You begged for those glasses.

<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              I know, but...I will wear them, I
              just feel like people might think
              it's weird that a kid is wearing
              dark shades.
<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              That's ridiculous.
    Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk
    sunglasses and puts them on. He looks around self-
    consciously.
<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              You look very cool.
    He takes them off.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             4.
</b>

<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              I don't need them right now.

<b>6   CUT TO:                                                       6
</b>
    Margot and Claude wait.   The ferry has emptied out.

<b>                        CLAUDE
</b>              Do they know we're here?

    A maroon Volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops
    across the road. Two eyes peer out from just below the
    backseat window. A man, 40, in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down
    the window. He has a small moustache -- he's harried and
    sweaty. This is Malcolm. He points at Margot and Claude.

<b>                        MALCOLM
</b>              Are you...?

<b>7   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                              7
</b>
    Malcolm drives. He smokes with the window open. Margot is
    in the passenger seat. In the back, Claude and the girl,
    Ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind.
    Ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a
    panda on it.

<b>                        MALCOLM
</b>              Paul apologizes for not coming,
              she's still getting the house
              ready.

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              I'm sorry it was such short notice.

<b>                        MALCOLM
</b>              I don't care. Paul's frantic, but
              I don't give a shit. Oh, and
              Ingrid wants me to tell you that
              she made us all bracelets.
<b>                        INGRID
</b>                  (embarrassed)
              No, I wanted...I wanted to wait...
<b>                        MALCOLM
</b>              Oh, I thought you asked me to tell
              them. Anyway...

    Malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange
    bracelet.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           5.
</b>

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          I got Knicks colors.

<b>                    INGRID
</b>          They're not Knicks colors!

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          It's beautiful, Ingrid.

<b>                    INGRID
</b>              (to Claude)
          I made this one for myself.

She shows him the purple and green one around her wrist.

<b>                    INGRID
</b>          Yours is yellow. Is that okay?

<b>                          CLAUDE
</b>          I guess.

<b>                    INGRID
</b>          Where's your dad and Josh?

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          They might come later.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Josh's spring break is next week.
          Jim teaches through Friday and then
          they open the house in Vermont on
          the weekend.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>              (bluntly)
          It means a lot to Pauline that
          you're here.

Margot nods awkwardly -- she blushes.
<b>                          MARGOT
</b>          Oh.     Good.
A car suddenly pulls out of a driveway, but nowhere near

<b>                    MALCOLM

Ingrid giggles.    Margot clutches the handle above the door.

</b><b>                                                                 6.

<b>                        MALCOLM
</b>              If you're wondering about the
              moustache --

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              No, I wasn't.

<b>                        MALCOLM
</b>              I had a full beard   for a while and
              then when I shaved   it I left this
              part for last, you   know to see how
              it looked, and...    It's meant to be
              funny.

    Margot nods politely.   The sound of tires on gravel:

<b>8   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                                  8
</b>
    The trunk slams shut. The Volvo is parked in a driveway
    alongside a grey Colonial house that sits above the water.
    They lift bags. An old mutt ambles toward them.

    Pauline emerges from the house. She's pretty like her
    sister, late 30's. She walks briskly toward them. Margot
    smiles and opens her arms, but Pauline passes her and dips
    down to embrace Claude. She kisses him on the lips.

<b>                        PAULINE
</b>              You're so handsome.

    Now she hugs Margot.    They both tear up.   Claude beams.

<b>                        PAULINE
</b>              I never thought I'd get you here.

    A loud thud. They all turn toward the property fence. A
    large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped
    into their yard. There's whispering and movement through
    brush on the other side. Margot looks at Pauline with
    concern.
<b>                        PAULINE
</b>              You're arriving in the midst of a
              drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is
              inside.
    Malcolm trudges over to the trash cans.

</b>              The neighbors want us to cut down
              our tree.

    She indicates a large oak that extends up and into the
    adjoining property.

<b>                        MARGOT
</b>              No, that's our tree!

<b>                        INGRID
</b>              They think it's sick and rotting
              their property.

<b>                        PAULINE
</b>              We're having the ceremony under it.

<b>                        MARGOT

<b>                        MALCOLM
</b>              Pauline thinks this is their way of
              trying to be friends. I think they
              resent us because we're...

    He searches for the word, but can't come up with anything.
    He says wearily:

<b>                        MALCOLM
</b>              I don't know what we are.

    Claude sits on the squeaky bed, a yellow bracelet on his
    wrist. An old flip-clock hums on the night-table. A door
    opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto
    another bedroom.

    Ingrid sits on her bed observing Claude. She holds a
    realistic-looking stuffed rooster in an old-style tuxedo.

     Ingrid shrugs.   She says, already bored with the topic:

     Pauline and Margot carry bags up the stairs. Margot now
     wears a knit red bracelet. They're tentative with one
     another.

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               Is Malcolm what you thought he'd

<b>                         MARGOT

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               The moustache is temporary. He
               left it for last when he was
               shaving. It's meant to be funny.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               He told me.

<b>                          PAULINE
</b>               Yeah...

     They enter the guest room. The windows are wide open, the
     curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               I'm sorry -- with so little time to
               prepare, we had to put you in
               Malcolm's storage room --

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               This was Becky's room.   Poor Becky.

</b>               Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a
               storage room. I've just started to

<b>                         PAULINE

Pauline jimmies down the stiff windows. Margot begins to
unpack and hang up clothes in the closet.

<b>                     PAULINE
</b>           Well, music's officially a hobby...
           He's painting now. And writing
           letters to newspapers and
           magazines. He's very meticulous,
           he'll spend up to a week writing a
           response to a music review. He's
           incredibly smart. Maybe too smart.
           I don't know. We're doing very
           well.

<b>                       MARGOT
</b>           Good.    I mean, you must be.

Silence.

<b>                     PAULINE
</b>           I don't know where to begin. What
           can I tell you? It seems I'm
           pregnant, but it's really early
           so... I haven't told anyone. I
           mean, I haven't told Malcolm or
           Ingrid.

</b>           Wow...

<b>                     PAULINE
</b>           Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I
           hope so. Things are good. We did
           a couples seminar two months ago or
           so in Maine. They give you
           exercises and things to do. I know
           you're not convinced, but...
<b>                     MARGOT

           Mm hm.
<b>                     PAULINE
</b>           We got engaged right afterwards.
           The guy who runs it, Strickland,
           wrote a really interesting book
           about loving which I'll lend you if
           you want.

          Okay.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          But only if you'll read it.
          Because I need it back. I made
          notes in the margins.

</b>          I may not get to it for a while.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Well, I'm not going to lend it to
          you if you're not going to read it.

They meet eyes.   Pauline quickly turns away.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          It's going to be very informal by
          the way. Just Mom and Becky.
          Malcolm's brother. Few friends.
          And now you and Claude. Nothing
          like the first one.

</b>              (wary)
          Becky's coming?

</b>          You go.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          I was going to say, "I'd really
          like some white wine."
<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Oh. Yeah. We have a...
          Well...I'm glad you changed your
          mind and came. I never heard from
          you after I sent the invite...I
          even wondered if you got it.
<b>                    MARGOT
</b>              (quickly)
          Well, I'm so pleased we're here.
<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Did you get it?

</b>

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               Yeah.

     Pauline waits for an explanation.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               I'm sorry you were so angry...

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               I wasn't angry. I
               was...disappointed.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               Uh huh. But you see when you say,
               "disappointed" it puts me in a
               crummy situation. Like I let you
               down.

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               But you did in a way.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               I don't see it like that.

<b>                          PAULINE
</b>               Fine. I felt betrayed.    Is that
               word okay?

<b>                          MARGOT
</b>               Again, you're making me the
               aggressor.

<b>                          PAULINE
</b>               You were the aggressor.
                   (pause)

     feet with Ingrid and Claude. The kids look at a record
     sleeve. Margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little
     brown notebook. She wears oval tortoise-shell glasses.

     scary image on the cover. She quickly turns it over and
     hands it to her mother.

          Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek
          once?

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          In the late `80's. It was a solo
          gig after he left the Cars.

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          So, you're kind of famous.

Malcolm reddens.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I
          used to want to be, but, No. Do
          you want to be famous?

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Claude wants to be very famous.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          Well, make sure you can handle
          rejection. I can't. For me,
          expectation just turns to
          disappointment. So, ultimately I'd
          rather not try. It'll all go black
          for us soon enough anyway.

Pauline sneaks a look at Margot who is watching Malcolm with
an expression of either contempt or confusion. Pauline grows
uncomfortable. She says to Claude:

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          When your mother moved to New York

</b>          You only liked top forty.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Yeah, but I love REM now.

Margot takes off her reading glasses and rubs her eyes.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          I don't really listen to music
          anymore.

Pauline and Margot crack up laughing.   Malcolm raises an
eyebrow at Claude.

</b>          Our father used to strip down to
          his skivvies and beat us with a

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          It's awful -- that stuff that

               certain words now too. Like the
               other day, I couldn't remember the
               word for...
                   (laughs)
               I've forgotten it again. The stuff
               in wine. Sediment! That was it.

<b>                         MALCOLM
</b>               I know that. I was talking more
               about not remembering who was the
               bassist for Motley Crüe.
     Malcolm lights up a cigarette.   He offers one to Claude who
     shakes his head, No.

Claude reluctantly follows Ingrid and Bruce.      He looks back
longingly at the table of adults.

<b>                    TOBY
</b>          Margot, I don't want to have this
          conversation with you.

We follow the kids inside.   We hear in the background:

</b>          It's vital. If you keep telling
          him he's like everyone else he'll
          wonder why he isn't. He's
          suffering.

<b>                     TOBY
</b>          He's tested very well.    He does B's
          in school.

Claude stops -- his mother and Toby are arguing out the
window. Her eyes meet his for a second -- they make no
connection -- she goes back to Toby.

     hesitates and exhales a deep, anxious breath.

     Margot paces while talking on a cell phone in the herb
     garden. She drinks a white wine with ice cubes and smokes a
     joint. The bottle lies at her feet, three-quarters empty.

     whispers:

</b>          Yes.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          I just talked to your dad...

Claude's eyes remained closed, but he smiles.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          I'm only going to tell you if you
          won't remember.

<b>                       CLAUDE
</b>          Okay.

Margot hesitates.    She changes her mind and says
thoughtfully:

<b>                     MARGOT
</b>          Everyone finds you so funny and
          charming. I always get compliments
          about you.

Margot stands. She catches herself in a warped mirror and
smears some eye make-up off of her face.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Are you having fun?    Is it nice to

          Yeah, I really like her.

</b>          Yeah.     She is crazy though.
<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          In what way?
<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          She's really berserk. Maybe it's

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               She's pregnant -- she told me. But
               she's keeping it a secret -- I mean
               from Malcolm and even Ingrid.
               Which I think is unforgiveable.
               Now she'll have to marry him.
               What's she planning -- to get
               married and not drink champagne?
               Then she'll just be lying. I guess
               she's afraid she'll miscarry. She
               probably will. I think on some
               level she's ambivalent about the
               marriage and that's why she's not
               telling him.

<b>                         CLAUDE

     Water runs from the bathroom. Malcolm cradles a glass of
     whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror.

</b>                   (shakes his head)
               My scrotum is longer than my penis.

     He turns around and looks at his ass. Pauline walks out of
     the bathroom. She wears mens pajamas, the top open.

</b>               Margot doesn't seem as crazy as you

          Well, she cares deeply.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          Yeah, she's really worried about
          Bruce.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          This has nothing to do with Bruce.
          She thinks everyone is autistic.

Malcolm is about to speak, but instead he halts, paralyzed.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          What?

<b>                    MALCOLM

<b>                    PAULINE

     Margot lies on her front, her hand underneath her. She tries
     to masturbate. The bed creaks. Finally, she flips over and
     gives up. She wears a rubber night-guard in her mouth.

     A croquet game in progress. Pauline and Malcolm play Margot
     and Claude. Ingrid lies in the grass singing to herself.
     The dog next to her. Malcolm concentrates -- he carefully
     lines up his shot. Finally, he swings --

     The ball misses the wicket.    He shakes with frustration.

<b>                          MALCOLM
</b>               Fuck it!

     Claude looks through a slit in the wooden fence and into the
     neighbor's yard: A naked man, 40's, crouches. Arms extend
     from below and pull him downward. His ass pokes up over the
     weeds.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               Honey, you're up.

     Claude shakes out of his reverie. He walks briskly up to his
     ball and smacks it. It bullets forward and lands just short
     of Pauline's ball.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               Claude, don't just whack it.    Think
               about it before you hit.

<b>                          CLAUDE
</b>               Sorry.

     Pauline knocks her ball into Claude's. She holds her ball
     down with her foot and prepares to swing.
<b>                         MALCOLM
</b>               Paul, what are you doing?
<b>                         PAULINE

<b>                         MALCOLM
</b>               Take the extra hit.

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               I don't want to do that.

</b><b>                                                         22.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          It's the smarter play.

She whacks -- Claude's ball travels about two feet.

<b>                       PAULINE
</b>          Shit.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          Pauline! See, I knew you
          couldn't... Your feet are too
          small!

Margot steps up to take her turn.   She regards the house.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          You took the awnings down.

Claude looks back into the adjacent yard: Flashes of skin. A
breast. Pubic hair. Claude crouches to see more clearly --
the bodies disappear from sight.

Malcolm draws a deep breath and takes a few practice strokes.
He swings -- his ball rockets past Margot's, rolls up over a
ridge and onto the cement drive. It quickly sails down into
the road and bounces into a ditch.

Malcolm shakes furiously. He lifts his mallet, turns toward
the house, rethinks momentarily, and hurls it up over the
incline and down to the water. Pauline puts her hands on her
hips.

<b>                       PAULINE
</b>          Well done.

<b>                       MALCOLM
</b>          Fuck you.

Malcolm hesitates then tramps down the stairs to the beach.
Claude watches the pink of flesh moving up and down.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Honey, you're up.
He approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double
wickets.
<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          You're going the wrong way.
<b>                       CLAUDE

     He blushes and laughs.    Pauline laughs.   Margot shakes her
     head.

<b>                            MARGOT
</b>               So stupid.

<b>                         CLAUDE
</b>               Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.

     Margot places her mallet down and starts toward the house.

<b>                         CLAUDE
</b>               We're in the middle of it.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               This is why I hate games.    I hate
               what it does to me.

     Pauline cackles loudly. Margot turns around and stares at
     her. Malcolm calls from the stairs:

<b>                         MALCOLM (O.S.)
</b>               Wait, we're not finished!

     The five eat a salad nicoise lunch.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               Malcolm, do you notice how Pauline
               sometimes can't make eye-contact.
               How her gaze hovers just above your
               head.

<b>                         MALCOLM
</b>               Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               I always think I have something in
               my hair. It's not necessarily bad,
               Paul. It's just something you do.

     Pauline looks mildly horrified.   She suddenly turns to
     Claude.
<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               Claude have you ever seen your

</b>               As kids Margot climbed everything.
               She could even climb that tree.

     She points at the tall oak that stretches over the fence into
     the neighbor's property.

<b>                         CLAUDE
</b>               Can you do it, mom?

     Margot strides toward the tree.   The group follows behind.

     She grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself.

     Claude grins, impressed.

     With brisk dexterity, Margot scales the tree.

     Claude, Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid watch with glee from
     below.

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               I told you.
     Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the
     gang. They wave. She waves back.
     The sun is hot. She sweats, flushed. She takes a deep
     breath and relaxes against the bark. Trees for miles. The
     neighbors' house is faded and grey. In the far distance,
     toxic white smoke comes out into the sky.

     An earwig walks across her arm. She flicks it off, slips for
     a moment and catches herself. Her breathing grows more
     rapid.

     A bug buzzes around her head.   She swats at it.

     Her family has stopped watching. Claude and Malcolm throw a
     baseball. Pauline's gone back inside. Ingrid clears the
     table.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>                   (under her breath)
               Shit.

     She wipes her face, her shirt is almost entirely soaked.    The
     buzzing continues.

     Close on Margot's ear. A small black gnat lands on the lip
     of the lobe. It hesitates and darts inside the hole.

     Margot gasps.   She jams her pinky in her ear.

     Pauline comes back out with an ice tea.

<b>                         CLAUDE
</b>               What's she doing now?

     A young volunteer fireman climbs a long ladder up the side of
     the tree and toward Margot. He reaches out his hand to her.

</b>                   (annoyed)

     She slowly lowers herself.

</b>     Pauline is laughing, recounting the story. Claude and Ingrid
     laugh too. Margot shakes her head, embarrassed and furious.

                It's mean.

     Silence.   Margot puts her pinky back in her ear.   She frowns.

     Pauline and Margot hike along a dirt trail. Claude and
     Ingrid idle behind, carrying walking sticks.

<b>                           PAULINE
</b>                I thought Claude could hand out

</b>                You know I can't speak in front of

</b>          Did I tell you, Becky got her tubes
          tied.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Why? Is she seeing someone?   She's
          still obese, I assume.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          I think it's symbolic.

<b>                     MARGOT
</b>          I bet mom paid for it.   We should
          audit mom.

          fucking so many guys?

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          I think it was the only time we
          could really feel unselfconscious
          and get out of our heads.

<b>                    PAULINE

          I don't think that's it. I just

Behind, Ingrid smacks her walking stick into Claude's.

Up ahead -- in the path -- is a couple, 40's, with a six year
old girl. The back of the man's pants are smeared with dirt
and the woman is packed into acid washed jeans. The little
girl whines and lags behind.
Margot and Pauline slow down.   Claude and Ingrid catch up.

The girl screams.

</b>          Hey!

The man and woman turn around sharply.

     away.

<b>                         WOMAN

     The woman turns back around. She lifts the girl into her

the stairs, across the carpet and onto the porch.

A man, 50's, opens the passenger door. He smokes a brown
cigarette. Margot gets in. The man waves at the group on

</b>               I think about a hundred.    They bank

     The front door of the Vogler's opens and a boy, 14, pees from
     the entrance-way into the plants in the yard.

<b>                         BOY
</b>               Just let me live!

     The toy lands a few feet short.   He goes inside and closes
     the door.

     Claude watches: Malcolm scurries around the side of the
     Vogler house holding a dead mole by its tail. He stumbles,
     recovers and flings the animal at the front door.   He races
     back toward his property.

     Pauline flings herself in and is off. Margot hesitates then

     side.

     Margot stops short and follows her sister. They're neck and
     neck. Their arms cut in and out of the water.

second.

Pauline beams. Margot immediately drifts to the ladder.
She's panting heavily.

Pauline floats on her back, exhausted.

Ingrid swims beneath Claude -- long strands of hair stream up
from beneath the surface.

Margot gets out of the water and Dick wraps her in a towel.
For a moment it's an embrace. Margot looks quickly over at
Claude --

His foot slips.

He topples in.
Water roars around him.

He opens his mouth.   Bubbles spurt out.
He drifts down.
Lying next to the drain is a field mouse.       Its eyes are
white.

Splash.   Hands wrap around him.
He goes up.

     The sounds of wind and blurry voices now clearer.

     Pauline brings Claude to the surface and pushes him to the
     ladder. She helps him climb out. Ingrid and Maisy are
     grinning. Their expressions slowly shift as they see
     Claude's face.

     Claude is sobbing.

<b>                            PAULINE

     Margot immediately wrenches Claude from Pauline's grasp.    She
     looks shocked and angry.

<b>                            MARGOT

     She leads her son behind the bushes out of everyone's sight.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               It's okay, my baby.

     She gently lets him down. His sneakers squeak and slosh.
     Claude, soaking wet and ashamed, looks at his mother. She
     breaks into laughter. Claude wipes the water and tears from
     his eyes.

          We could teach Claude how to swim.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          He won't want to do it.   It's too
          late.

Pauline waits for more -- nothing comes. She takes a couple
steps into the room. She holds out her hand for the glass.
Margot passes it to her. Pauline sips.

<b>                    MARGOT

     Margot's fist is raised about to knock on the front door.
     She stops herself. She puts the note on the Welcome mat and
     holds it in place with the child's shoe. She wanders around
     to the back of the house. She looks into a lighted window:

     It's a white tiled bathroom.

     A wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced
     on the sink. Mr. Vogler tears into the plastic. The carcass
     is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs.

     Mrs. Vogler runs the tub. She pours salt from a box in the
     water. The man slides his hand in her waist-band. She rubs
     against him.

     Margot chews her cuticle.

     The man saws the legs. His arm jerks back and forth,
     straining to cut through the bone. Sweat pours down his
     temples.

     Margot raises her hand to her face and presses against the
     window. She peers through her fingers. The blade pierces
     the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the
     floor.

     Margot moves to another window.   The pig's face now looks at
     her.

     Blood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile. The
     woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid.

     Suddenly a face appears in the glass. Margot leaps back.
     It's a thin boy. He says something. The family turns to the
     window. The father flicks off the bathroom light.
     From inside Margot illuminates like an apparition.
     Margot scampers into the trees.   She pushes through branches,
     her shirt tears. She runs.

     her, in the mirror.

Testicles.

     Claude's POV through the window: Dick and Margot in the back
     seat of the Volvo. Malcolm and Pauline the front. The
     ignition turns.

     Claude leaves the window. We hear the car rumble away.
     Claude and Ingrid sit on the couch, hamburgers in front of
     them. Maisy is cross-legged on Wizard's dog bed and chews a
     stalk of celery.

Ingrid looks stricken.

</b>          How do you know that, Claude?

<b>                    CLAUDE

But he does. Claude bites into his burger. His eyes fix on
the crease between Maisy's breasts. Maisy says to Claude:

</b>          Do you think your mom is fuckable?

          anyway. I mean if she came on to
          me.

     There's a scraping sound on the window.   The kids turn
     quickly:

<b>                         CLAUDE

     The three kids lie in the grass and watch through the slats
     in the fence: The Vogler family eats at an outdoor table. A
     pig turns on a spit over a smoky barbecue. Mrs. Vogler says
     something and the kids and Mr. Vogler laugh.

     Maisy climbs over Claude to see better. He feels her breasts
     press against his back. Suddenly he swats crazily at his
     ear. Ingrid is poking him with a blade of grass.

     Malcolm drives quickly with Pauline next to him. He's
     smoking with the window open, Dick and Margot in the
     backseat.

<b>                         PAULINE

               remember when we went on a double
               date in high school, that kid Ron
               asked you if English was your first

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Malcolm, can you slow down.

<b>                    MALCOLM

<b>                    DICK

          Margot would insist on driving if
          she knew how.

<b>                     MARGOT
</b>               (to Dick)
          My license elapsed.   But I know
          how.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          It's probably for the best. I have
          this theory, I think, historically,
          women have been held back in so
          many ways that when they get power,
          like they do behind the wheel, they
          can't help but abuse it. It's akin
          to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory
          about prison guards and prisoners
          switching rolls.
<b>                    DICK

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          This isn't a blanket thing. I
          mean, women can be great drivers
          too...

He takes a long satisfied drag on his cigarette.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Said the man with the moustache
          that he thinks he's wearing in
          quotes.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          It's meant to be funny.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>              (to Pauline, re: Margot)
          Are you doing this for her benefit
          or mine?

Malcolm pumps the brake.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          What the fuck?

<b>                      PAULINE

<b>                    MALCOLM

          No, there they go. Okay. It's
          fine. I thought I had no brakes
          for a minute...

Malcolm pitches his cigarette out the window -- it flies
through Margot's window and lands on her lap.
<b>                      MARGOT
</b>          Malcolm!
Dick grabs the lit butt and chucks it in the road.
<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>              (turning around)
          What?!

The car swerves again -- everyone jumps.

     Malcolm screeches the vehicle over to the shoulder.   They
     jolt to a stop.

</b>                   (quietly furious)
               Oh, God.

     Pauline opens the door and staggers toward the brush. She
     leans against a tree and looks like she might vomit. Malcolm
     watches in the rearview mirror.

<b>                         MARGOT

     Malcolm sighs heavily and gets out of the car. Margot and
     Dick watch out the back window. Pauline sees Malcolm coming
     and bolts into the woods. Malcolm charges after her.

Claude hears footsteps creak downstairs. He goes to the door
and peers out: Pauline and Malcolm, a little disheveled and
dirty, climb the stairs. Neither speaks. Malcolm goes into
the hall bathroom. Pauline into their room. Running water
groans through the old pipes.

     bedside table.   He hesitates then opens it:

     It's packed with writing -- a nearly indecipherable cursive
     in black ink. The name Claude can be made out on the page.

     Claude takes the book and climbs up into bed. He nestles

     Claude takes a long pillow and places it like a barrier in
     the bed. We stay on him as he waits. Finally Margot climbs
     into the covers in a nightgown.

     Malcolm, his moustache gone, a cigarette dangling from his
     mouth, hammers in a stake at the base of a collapsed, white
     tent. A workman holds a pole steadily.

     Pauline sets up chairs around a series of tables. Ingrid
     idles a few feet away. They're in the midst of talking:

<b>                         INGRID
</b>               Why was it a secret?

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               Because I didn't want to get you
               excited before it was real. It's
               not really a baby yet. In two more
               weeks we can celebrate together,
               okay?

<b>                         INGRID
</b>               Why did you tell Margot?

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               Because she's my sister and I trust
               her. How do you feel about it?

<b>                         INGRID
</b>               I don't want a sister.
     Pauline touches Ingrid's hair gently.
<b>                         INGRID
</b>               I'm going to go get Wizard.
     She runs toward the house.   Pauline marches toward Malcolm.
<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               Margot told Claude something I

Malcolm puts his hand awkwardly on her shoulder.

</b>          Ingrid's really upset about it.

     Ingrid is watching from across the field.

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               Come here, honey!

     Ingrid hurries through the sparkly, dewy grass.   Pauline hugs
     her and they spin.

     Margot watches from the upstairs window. The mother and
     daughter walk arm in arm down what will be the aisle.
     Finally, Margot turns away -- she's in Pauline and Malcolm's
     room.

     She opens drawers: Underwear, socks, bras. Topless photos
     of Pauline posing in the bedroom. A photograph of Margot and
     Pauline in their teens on Halloween dressed as Pat Benatar
     and Patty Smyth respectively.

     Margot grins.

     Another photo of Margot, Pauline and an obese woman -- Becky -
     - in their 20's.

     Margot's expression saddens. She opens another drawer.
     Polaroids of Pauline and Malcolm in different sexual poses.

     She flips through these and drops them on the bureau.

     Amidst the underwear and socks she finds pill containers.
     She squints to read the labels. She opens one and shakes out
     a few blue pills into her palm. She swallows one and puts
     the rest in her pocket.

     More drawers open: Self-help books, incense, pamphlets on
     Buddhism. A stack of pornographic DVD's.

<b>                         CLAUDE (O.S.)

     Margot starts and shoves the drawer shut.
<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               Hey. I'm just looking at Pauline's

               don't understand it. This junk
               makes her look stupid and she's
               not. I don't like to think of her

               I'm more talking about her

She stands a few feet away from Pauline.   The kids can be
heard shouting in the distance.

     Margot enters and opens the refrigerator. She gets out a
     white wine bottle. She turns around and jumps, startled.

<b>                           MARGOT

     Malcolm sits at the table, eating saltines out of the box, a

<b>                         MALCOLM
</b>               Oh, hey, Ingrid is asking me if I
               was ever gay. Do you know what
               that's about?

<b>                          PAULINE
</b>               No.

     Mr. Vogler, wearing a fleece vest and carrying a hatchet over
     his shoulders, tramples out of the brush.
<b>                          PAULINE
</b>               Hi.
     Vogler stops.   His face is jagged and worn.
<b>                          PAULINE
</b>               Hi, I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm.
               We've met before. We're your
               neighbors.
     The man watches them strangely with icy blue eyes.

</b><b>                                                           60.
</b>

<b>                    VOGLER
</b>          You gonna cut that tree down?

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Well, we grew up with that tree and
          we're getting married under it
          Saturday and --

She waits for Malcolm to jump in.    He doesn't.   Vogler says
softly, but sternly:

<b>                    VOGLER
</b>          The roots are growing into our
          property. It's rotting, it's
          killing our plants.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          We had a tree doctor out and he
          said it was healthy.

Pauline smacks Malcolm's arm.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Would it hurt you to say anything?

<b>                     MALCOLM
</b>          What?   What do you want from me?

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          You're making me do the whole
          fucking thing.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          You brought up the tree.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          He brought up --

She stops herself.   She says to Vogler:
<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          I'm sorry... This was better
          thought-through back at the house.
Pauline's gaze goes above Vogler's head -- like Margot
described earlier. He runs his hand through his hair as if
something might be caught in there.
<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          We were wondering if you and your
          wife -- I'm sorry I forgot her name
          -- would like to come over for...
<b>
</b><b>                                                           61.

<b>                    VOGLER
</b>          You should ask her. She makes the
          plans. I'm going to go in now.

He tramps inside.   The screen door bangs.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          I felt like you didn't give me a
          chance to say what I wanted to say.

Pauline hits him in the chest and starts to walk away.
Malcolm comes after her, his rage growing.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          I want to punch that guy in the
          nose!

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          You've never hit anyone.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          I have too!

<b>                     PAULINE
</b>          Who?

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          Lots of -- You don't know them.
          They're not around because I've
          punched them.

A smile breaks across Pauline's face.   Malcolm seethes.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not
          funny. I'll fucking punch your
          sister.

Malcolm clenches his fists.    He points at Vogler's place.
<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          The threat is not out there. It's
          in our house. It's sleeping in my
          studio. I mean, I wouldn't
          actually hit her, but I feel...I
          feel like doing it. She's such a
          fucking idiot.
<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          She's not an idiot.    You might not
          like her --
<b>
</b><b>                                                            62.
</b>

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          She is. She is an idiot!    You're
          an idiot.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Jesus.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          You're both fucking morons. I'm so
          fucking... I'm trying so hard.
          You don't give me any credit.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          What is wrong?

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          I don't know, I have the emotional
          version of whatever bad feng shui
          would be. I don't know. You tell
          me, you understand this shit.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Did you drink your teas?

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          Yeah, I drank my fucking teas!
          Don't judge me now. Really, I
          think when you look back at this
          you're going to see I'm not acting
          like a crazy person. That this is
          the right reaction. In proportion
          with what is going on. This is
          right!

Malcolm looks around furiously. The only thing available to
him is a leafy stalk. He pulls on it, but it won't uproot.
He tears the leaves off in a rage.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          You have the most oddly self-
          conscious form of rage I've ever --

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          I hate you.
Exhausted he approaches her.   He says, still with anger:
<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          Let's make love.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             63.

     Pauline walks back to the house, buttoning her dress. She
     looks up suddenly and stops: A man watches her from the lawn.
     He holds a bouquet of flowers. Pauline runs to him.

<b>                           PAULINE
</b>               Jim...

     They embrace.    Her hand cups the back of his neck.

<b>                           CLAUDE (O.S.)
</b>               Dad!

     Claude runs from the house.

<b>48   EXT. PATIO - LATE DAY                                       48

     Pauline, Malcolm, Margot, Jim, Claude and Ingrid eat fish
     stew and peasant bread. Jim's flowers sit in a vase. He
     wears a tan knit bracelet that Ingrid made.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               It was a difficult    decision because
               Claude has so many    friends at
               school now, but it    is expensive and
               Bronx Science is a    great public
               school.

<b>                         CLAUDE
</b>               I didn't get into Stuyvesant.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               He's not a good test taker.

<b>                         MALCOLM
</b>               I went to Stuy.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>                   (caught off-guard)
               Really?

<b>                           MALCOLM
</b>               Really.
<b>                         CLAUDE
</b>               I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's
               so expensive.

     Malcolm lifts up a bottle of Jameson from the floor near his
     chair and pours himself another stiff drink.
<b>
</b><b>                                                64.

<b>                    JIM
</b>          Josh is a great test taker, but
          Claude thinks more abstractly.
          He's more creative. Right?

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          I guess so.

Jim smiles warmly at his son.

<b>                    JIM
</b>          I saw the one armed man who really
          has two arms at the bodega.

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          Did you give him confusing change?

<b>                   JIM
</b>          I did. I tripped him up with some
          nickels. And a Canadian quarter.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          You know what I tried the other
          day? Sitting down to pee. Have
          you done this, Jim?

<b>                     JIM
</b>          No...no.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          I did it as a lark. As a joke
          really. I was going to call
          Pauline in and say, guess what I'm
          doing here...

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          I'm sorry I didn't get to have that
          experience.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          I was thinking, you know, my dad
          used to say, "Why stand when you
          can sit." And this is a really
          good example of that. I mean, it
          took me so long to try because I
          was embarrassed.
              (to the sisters)
          You guys do it all the time.
<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          I never sit down in a public place.
          I squat and hover.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           65.

Ingrid goes wide eyed for a moment.

<b>                     MALCOLM
</b>          Anyway, I recommend it.     At least
          to try it.

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Jim, I'm sorry about the room.
          It's usually Malcolm's storage room
          so it's kind of make-shift right
          now.

<b>                       JIM
</b>          It's fine.

Margot stares at Jim.

<b>                    JIM
</b>          Margot, open your gift.

An unopened present in blue tissue paper sits beside Margot's
plate.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          I get self-conscious opening
          presents in front of people.    This
          weekend is about Pauline.

<b>                       PAULINE
</b>          Oh...poo.     Open it Margot.

Margot slowly unties the white ribbon and peels away the
tape. Pauline groans:

<b>                    PAULINE
</b>          Come on, get to it.

Margot takes out a pair of furry slippers.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          Those look warm.
<b>                    JIM
</b>          I remember last year in Vermont you
          said your feet were freezing.
Her eyes find Claude who watches his parents carefully. She
leans across the table to Jim and they kiss chastely and
briskly on the lips.

<b>                       MARGOT
</b>          Thank you.

     Jim drives with Margot in the passenger seat.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               I already have slippers.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Well, that's okay.   Two sets are
               fine, right?

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               It makes me sad to get a present
               that I already have.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Why?

</b>               It makes me feel like you don't
               know me.

     She jams her pinky into her ear trying to get at the bug.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               What's wrong with your ear?

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               I asked you not to come. I was so
               clear and you did it anyway so
               blithely.

<b>                         JIM

               Well, now you're putting too much
               pressure on me.
     Jim smiles crookedly at her. She half-smiles back.   He takes
     a moment, preparing to speak. Then:

     Jim gets out of the car.     A sobbing woman crouches, cradling
     a bloody dog.

     Margot stubs out the joint on the car roof. Jim suddenly
     removes his sweater and puts it around her shoulders. He
     fishes into his pants pocket for his keys. Tears start down
     Margot's cheeks.

     Margot smokes by the open door. She drinks a glass of white

The animal is gone.

A figure appears in the distance behind Claude. The boy, the
Vogler's son, approaches shirtless in swimming trunks.
Ingrid's attention goes to him.

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          You're not watching.

The boy comes into focus. He holds a dead squirrel by its
tail. Ingrid backs up next to Claude. The boy stops a few
feet away and hurls the squirrel at them. The kids jump back
as it lands at their feet.

<b>                    BOY

     Claude sneaks a look over his shoulder -- the boy follows.
     Claude's gait quickens.

<b>                         CLAUDE
</b>               Come on, Ingrid.

     Ingrid slows, lifts her leg and removes a sandal. The boy is
     behind them. Claude yanks Ingrid's arm and she topples over.

<b>                            INGRID
</b>               Oww!

     Claude leans down to help her. The boy leaps on Claude.
     They both crash to the ground and roll through the grass.

</b>               Get him off me. Ingrid!

     Ingrid hesitates then runs toward the house.

     Claude wrestles with the boy. The boy growls. He grabs hold
     of Claude's arms and sinks his teeth into Claude's shoulder.

<b>                            CLAUDE
</b>               Ayy!     Help me!

     Claude kicks and yanks himself free.     He runs wildly.

     Close on Claude.    Tears stream down.   He coughs and spits.

               wonder for someone who writes so
               nakedly about family, how
               autobiographical is this portrait?

     Margot rests her lips on the tip of the microphone.

</b>          My father was a loving person. He
          had his days, of course, but...he
          was devoted to us as children. I
          wouldn't have written this portrait
          were it true.

Pauline nods slightly.

</b>          But I'm interested in how the
          father could be in fact a portrait

Margot stares, dumbstruck.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Umm...I don't... Why do you assume
          it's based on... We all take from
          life. I had to have our
          refrigerator repaired the other day
          at our apartment in Manhattan. I
          was alone with a guy, I think he
          was Puerto Rican, sent over
          by...Whirlpool, I think it is who
          made our fridge. Although he said
          he worked for an independent
          organization who Whirlpool
          subcontracts. I think he was
          retarded. There was an anger in
          him and suddenly I became afraid
          for my life. I called Jim at NYU.
          I asked him to come home.

Margot stops.   Her face is awash in sweat.

Pauline takes Claude's hand and presses it to her chest.    His
eyes widen, fixed on his mother.

     and drinks from the faucet. There is a knocking. Margot

     Pauline's Volvo rolls into the drive. She and Claude get out
     of the front seats. Margot climbs out of the back holding a
     big cake box. No one speaks.

     Malcolm, in a fleece vest and safety goggles, drags a
     chainsaw toward the oak tree. Ingrid runs to her mom.

     Pauline passes Maisy reading on the patio.

</b>               You're not a pain.

     Margot sits on the back stairs drinking a glass of wine with
     ice. The tent is up. The tables and chairs are placed
     around the lawn. She watches Malcolm prepare to take the
     tree down. She puts her pinky in her ear and twists. Claude
     approaches.

Margot tosses the remainder of her drink into the weeds.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Pauline told me she's very

Malcolm reddens and starts the chainsaw again.   They yell
over the noise:

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          I didn't say that. I said I

          would matter if she did.

<b>                    PAULINE

guns the chainsaw. Tears spill suddenly from his eyes.

               tell me what you're thinking.

     Pauline rushes at the tree -- she smacks her hands on the
     trunk and throws all her weight behind one great shove. It
     doesn't budge. In frustration and rage, she runs.

     Ingrid is the only one on the patio as Pauline approaches.

<b>                         INGRID
</b>               Has anyone seen Wizard?

<b>                          PAULINE

     Pauline enters in a daze.   A toilet flushes.    Maisy comes out
     of Pauline's bathroom.

<b>                         MAISY
</b>               Oh, hi. Sorry, I had to go. I
               hope that's okay I used yours.

     Pauline nods strangely. She goes to the window. Her dove
     grey wedding dress hangs on the back of the door.

<b>                         MAISY
</b>               I love your wedding dress.   It's so
               unconventional and great.
     Pauline nods. Her eye catches the Polaroids of her and
     Malcolm nude which lie on top of the bureau. Maisy looks at
     the pictures too.
     Maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room. Pauline follows.
     Maisy walks down the hallway, aware that Pauline is right
     behind her.
<b>                         MAISY
</b>               Is everything okay?

</b>                   (pause)
               Nothing.

     Maisy stops at the landing. Claude sits at the bottom of the
     staircase playing with a string.

<b>                         MAISY
</b>               Claude, do you want to play

<b>                          CLAUDE
</b>               Okay.

     Pauline raises her leg -- her foot hovers at Maisy's lower
     back. She hesitates. Claude reacts with horror. Maisy
     turns around to see Pauline with her foot in the air like
     she's doing karate. Pauline's eyes dart around aimlessly.

     Maisy stares, confused. Pauline slowly lowers her leg.
     Something dawns on Maisy. She races down the stairs.

     The deafening shriek of the blade as it cuts into the tree.
     Malcolm is soaked in sweat. Ingrid watches from a few feet
     away.

     In the distance -- Dick's orange BMW grinds into the
     driveway. Maisy hurries toward him.

     Ingrid says, buried in the noise:

<b>                         INGRID
</b>               There's Dick.

     Malcolm sees Dick.   He pushes the blade harder into the wood.

<b>                         INGRID
</b>               Is it almost ready?

</b>                   (distracted)
               Almost.
     Maisy is talking to her father. Dick spots Malcolm. He
     immediately starts toward him. Malcolm hesitates. Cold fear
     creeps up his neck.

     Dick speeds up.
     Malcolm backs up slowly -- drops the chainsaw -- and bolts
     toward the water. Ingrid watches, confused.

Dick takes off after him. Malcolm stumbles down the long
wooden stairs to the beach.

Malcolm runs wobbily -- he pants, already out of breath.
Sweat pours down his face and body.

Dick's gait is swift -- his arms stiff, bent at the elbow.
His jeans make a swish swish. He takes the stairs two at a
time.

Malcolm grasps the railing, moving as fast as he can
sideways, trying not to fall. He reaches the beach, his feet
sinking in the sand. He trips and topples forward.

He looks up -- Dick lunges.

Dick pounds Malcolm's head and face.     Malcolm throws his arms
up and tries to block the punches.

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          I didn't do anything!    I didn't do
          anything!

<b>                    DICK
</b>          Fucking sleazebag!

Dick gets up.   He kicks Malcolm hard.

<b>                    DICK
</b>          I don't ever want to see you again.

Malcolm balls himself up against a rock.    He cries:

<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          Fuck off, dickhead.

Dick marches forward and kicks Malcolm again hard.

<b>                     MALCOLM
</b>          Ow!
Dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away.    Malcolm
screams:
<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>          Fucking dickbag! She's lying!
He touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers.
<b>                    MALCOLM
</b>              (choking on tears)
          Oh, man.

</b>

     There's a rustling noise in the wind. Malcolm looks -- a mud-
     and sea-coated Wizard watches him with a panting smile.

<b>66   CUT TO:                                                     66

     Wheels sputter in the gravel. Dick's car peels out with
     Maisy in the passenger seat. Claude and Margot watch from
     the porch.

     Pauline is seated at the table with place cards, flowers,

     Pauline looks at Claude strangely.    She leans down and kisses
     him on the lips.

Pauline shoves a stack of plates and silverware off of the
table. The plates shatter. Silence save for their
breathing.

     The purple of Ingrid's batik shirt shines in the grass
     beneath the tree.

     The trunk -- a gash at its base -- teeters.

     Pauline takes off into the field.

     Ingrid sings to herself and traces the branches in the air
     with her finger.

     Pauline sprints --

<b>                            PAULINE
</b>               Ingrid!

     Ingrid says to no one in particular:

<b>                            INGRID
</b>               What?

     Pauline's breaths are rapid, jagged.

     Ingrid stands.

     A wind whips up.    The tree sways.

     Pauline thrusts her arms out, seizes Ingrid and hurls herself
     away from the tree.

<b>                            INGRID
</b>               Ow!

     Ingrid sobs as they run. Pauline looks back. The tree is
     still standing. They embrace a few feet out of its range.

<b>                         INGRID
</b>               It wasn't going to fall!

     Malcolm trudges up the stairs.   He's bloody and tattered.
     Wizard trots behind him.
<b>                            INGRID
</b>               Wizard!
     She hugs the dog and holds him by the collar.   The three of
     them stand a few feet apart.
     There's a horrible creak -- and suddenly --

     -- crack --

     Malcolm pulls both girls toward him --

     The tree topples -- the thick trunk rips through the wedding
     tent and crashes through tables and chairs and the fence --

     -- onto the Vogler's property.

     The speedometer needle wavers around 30. Margot clutches the
     steering wheel. Claude looks morose. Pauline and Ingrid sit
     stonily in the back seat. The Volvo jerks into the oncoming
     lane and back. Margot draws a deep breath.

<b>                         CLAUDE

               I can drive. Why does everyone say
               that? I used to drive.

     They inch up a small hill. A car cascades down past them.
     The Volvo shakes. Pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze:

<b>                         PAULINE
</b>               We have to call people and cancel.

<b>                         INGRID

     Margot rolls down the window.

</b>               Well, I'm not wearing any

     They reach the top of the hill, over the crest, and descend.
     The vehicle picks up speed. Margot presses down on the
     brake.

     Margot places her arm stiffly across Claude's front.

     Pauline wraps her body around her daughter.

     Margot swerves into the shoulder -- she makes a sharp turn
     into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck.
     The car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of
     a tree.

     Margot and Claude, Pauline and Ingrid trudge through the bony

     Pauline's face screws up. She's suddenly in pain.   She races
     behind a tree. Margot follows.

     She tosses them in the brush.

     Margot and Claude sit, streaked with mud and perspiration.
     Margot drinks a beer, Claude a Coke. Margot pops a blue pill
     in her mouth and swallows. Ingrid swings on the rail.

     Pauline hangs up a cell phone and hands it back to her
     sister. She takes the beer and swigs.

     Claude turns his head. In the Chevy next to them sits Mrs.

     She runs her hand through her son's hair gently. He nestles

     Claude follows Margot to the window. Ingrid and Pauline are
     already looking out.
     Clumps of demonstrators march in the street. Some people
     hold up signs with slogans -- NO MORE -- BRING BACK -- the
     rest is obscured from the window. Some marchers are dressed
     in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard
     coffins.

Pauline points to a guy in a vest. As he turns around we see
it isn't him. Pauline withdraws, suddenly on the verge of
tears.

Margot tightens.

     Pauline emerges from behind the armoire doors wearing a long
     nightshirt that reads: I Spent The Night With Arsenio Hall.
     She enters the bathroom. She mutters to herself.

               done?

     Margot jimmies up the stiff window to let in some air. A few
     stragglers still march in the street. Trash and pieces of
     signage line the gutter. Margot turns into the room. She
     puts her hand to her cheek and strokes her smooth skin. She
     watches her son who removes his jeans for bed.

     Pauline tucks in Ingrid who lies next to Claude. Margot sits
     on the other bed scribbling in her brown notebook. Pauline
     marches around and across to the other side of the room. She
     snatches the book out of Margot's hands.

Pauline glances at the book.

          will fucking take your bowels out.

Pauline thrusts the book back at Margot --

The kids sleep in one bed.    Margot and Pauline lie awake in
the other.

     Cheap plastic tables. A small karaoke stage in front.
     Margot, Claude, Pauline and Ingrid sit at the bar. Margot
     drinks her wine with ice. She wears Jim's sweater. The kids
     have Cokes. The remains of ketchup-soaked french fries in a
     plastic red basket lie between them.

     A man with a mullet climbs up on the karaoke stage. The
     music begins. The man sways and sings "On and On" by Stephen
     Bishop. He croons sweetly and beautifully. Claude's eyes
     moisten. Margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the
     wine. She takes her son's hand and whispers:

pocket.

Malcolm is bawling on the other end.

Malcolm clutches Wizard and sputters:

Margot finishes her glass of wine, her eyes still on her
sister.

ice cream cones and looking in a boarded-up shop window.

</b>          I don't want to go with you mad at
          anyone.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Everything's fine.    I'm not mad at
          anyone.

Up ahead is a tiny depot.    People climb onto a white bus.

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          Can you come with me?

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          No, you know that.
              (pause)
          We should talk about the next few
          months a little bit and what's
          going to happen --

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          I don't like Vermont.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Your dad will be very happy to see
          you. And I'm sure Josh is dying to
          hang out.

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          Please come, mom.
<b>                    MARGOT
</b>              (suddenly irritable)
          Claude, stop it. Okay?
She watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man.
Margot closes her eyes. She breathes deeply.
<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          You used to need me to watch you
          when you played.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       105.
</b>

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          What do you mean?

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>              (vaguely)
          When you first started to play with
          friends, you wouldn't do it unless
          I watched you. You were afraid I
          would go out the back door. I
          don't know where I would go. Our
          yard didn't lead anywhere anyway.

She takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow T-
shirt. She isn't wearing a bra. Claude says suddenly:

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          I masturbated last night. While
          everyone was asleep I went into the
          bathroom and did it.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          You don't have to tell me, sweety.

The bus driver slams the luggage compartment closed.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          You've got to go.

Margot ties her sweater around her waist and takes Claude's
hand. They approach the bus. Claude's body tenses.

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          How will you get home?

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          I don't know. I'll see. Maybe
          Dick can drive me to the...
              (pause)
          Jesus, I lost the word for a
          second. The train.
<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          Uh huh.
He looks at her longingly.
<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Come on. You always don't want to
          leave me and you always have a good
          time once you do.
              (provocatively)
          I think you like getting away from
          me.
<b>
</b><b>                                                      106.
</b>

<b>                      CLAUDE
</b>          I do not.    I like hanging out with
          you.

She hugs him.   He clutches her.

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          The world feels strange to me right
          now.

Margot nods sympathetically. She kisses his lips and
releases him. He reaches into his bag and shyly puts on his
wrap-around punk sunglasses. Margot makes a face.

<b>                      CLAUDE
</b>          What?

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          They make your face look too wide.

Claude removes them and puts them back in the bag.

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          See you soon.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Bye, sweety.

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          Say, you'll see me "soon."

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          You're acting like a baby.

She backs away --

<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          Don't see Dick.

<b>                    MARGOT
</b>          Don't worry. I don't think he
          wants to see me anyway.
<b>                    CLAUDE
</b>          Please, Margot. Promise me.
<b>                    MARGOT
</b>              (hesitates)
          Don't call me that.

Claude doesn't move. Margot points at the bus and mouths
"Go". She turns in the other direction. Claude, frustrated
and anxious approaches the vehicle.
<b>
</b><b>                                                               107.
</b>

<b>81   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                        81
</b>
     Claude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat.    He
     puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass.

     Claude's POV: Margot, her back to him, puts her finger in her
     ear and shakes her head.

     The sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the
     pavement. She starts walking.

     The bus hisses and lurches forward.    Claude strains to see:

     Margot looks back.

     The bus groans as it picks up speed.   Margot sprints.

<b>                          MARGOT
</b>               Wait!

     She's runs full speed, waving her arms wildly.

<b>                          MARGOT
</b>               Wait!   Wait!

     She pants, breathless.

     The bus brakes.

     She passes Claude's window. We stay on Claude. He waits.
     Finally, she appears next to him, covered in sweat, and
     panting. She kisses him on the head. The bus starts moving.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>                   (almost euphoric)
               Did you see me running out there?

<b>                          CLAUDE
</b>               Yeah.
     Margot cranes her neck to see outside.

<b>                         MARGOT
</b>               Good. That was a lot of running.
               I'm out of breath.
     Claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window.
