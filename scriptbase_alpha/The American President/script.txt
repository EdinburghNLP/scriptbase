THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT




     T H E   A M E R I C A N   P R E S I D E N T

     Screenplay by Aaron Sorkin

     --------------------------------------------------------------

     FADE IN:

     As the OPENING TTTLES ROLL against a series of shots of
     statues and paintings of former presidents, we HEAR shards of
     dialogue from various presidential speeches.


     MAIN TITLES END ON


     EXT. BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come
     over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment
     before we

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY

     A SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private
     elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff.

                    AGENT COOPER
          Liberty's moving.

     Another AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is
     followed a step or two later by

     PRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD.

     SHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy,
     professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old.

                    JANIE
          The 10:15 event's been moved inside
          to the Indian Treaty Room.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to Janie)
          The 10:15 is American Fisheries?

                    JANIE
          Yes, sir. They're giving you a
          200-pound halibut.

                    SHEPHERD
          Janie, make a note. We need to
          schedule more events where somebody
          gives me a really big fish.

     JANIE starts to make a note.

                    JANIE
          Yes, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
          Janie, I was kidding.

                    JANIE
          Of course, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
                 (to the AGENT at the
                  elevator)
          Hey, Cooper.

                    AGENT COOPER
          'Morning, Mr. President.

     SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...

                    JANIE
          Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment
          with you this morning.

                    SHEPHERD
          Is he upset about the speech last night?

                    JANIE
          He seemed concerned.

                    SHEPHERD
          Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning
          unless Lewis was concerned about
          something I did Sunday night.

     The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32,
     LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It
     would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night,
     though that doesn't seem to slow him down.

                    LEWIS
          You skipped the whole paragraph.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to Janie)
          And Monday morning it is.

     LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the
     double doors leading to the South Lawn.

                    LEWIS
          "American can no longer afford to
          pretend that they live in a great
          society"...and then nothing. You
          dumped the whole handguns paragraph.

                    SHEPHERD
          This is a time for prudence, Lewis.

                    LEWIS
          That was the kick-ass section.

     The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down
     the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West
     Wing.

                    SHEPHERD
          I thought what with being the
          President and all...

                    LEWIS
          Sir, of course I didn't mean to
          imply--

                    SHEPHERD
          I thought you'd be turning cartwheels
          this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job
          approval.

                    LEWIS
          That's great news, sir, but...

     They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.

                    GROUNDKEEPER
          'Morning, Mr. President.

     Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting,
     JANIE quickly and quietly said--

                    JANIE
          Charlie.

                    SHEPHERD
          'Morning, Charlie.

                    LEWIS
          Sir, the press is gonna need an
          explanation.

                    SHEPHERD
          For what?

     SHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held
     open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make
     their way through the corridors of


     INT. THE WEST WING - DAY

     They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES
     AND OFFICE WORKERS.

                    LEWIS
          Because you dropped the whole kick-ass
          section, now we've got this thing hanging
          out there.

                    SHEPHERD
          There's a thing hanging out there?

                    LEWIS
          "Americans can no longer afford to
          pretend that they live in a great
          society." Then ...nothing. No
          explanation. No context. So now it's
          just this thing.

                    SHEPHERD
          And it's hanging out there?

                    LEWIS
          Yes, sir.

     SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--

                    SHEPHERD
          Maria--

                    STAFFER (MARIA)
          Good morning, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
          Did they tell you I'm gonna need--

                    STAFFER (MARIA)
          --overall consumer spending and not
          just first homes. Yes, sir. We'll have
          it for you in 15 minutes.

                    SHEPHERD
          Thanks.

     SHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.

                    LEWIS
          Mr. President, I really feel we need
          to focus on...

                    SHEPHERD
          Lewis, however much coffee you drink
          in the morning, I want you to reduce it
          by half.

                    LEWIS
          I don't drink coffee.

                    SHEPHERD
          Then hit yourself over the head with
          a baseball bat, would you please?

     Another STAFFER crosses their path--

                    JANIE
          Happy birthday, Laura.

                    SHEPHERD
          Hey, Laura, happy birthday.

                    STAFFER (LAURA)
          Thank you, sir.

     Once out of earshot--

                    SHEPHERD
               (to JANIE)
          I should send her some flowers.

                    JANIE
          You already did, sir.

     And, with that, they walk through a doorway and into


     INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

     In the OUTER OFFICE, MRS. CHAPIL, the President's secretary,
     is hard at work on a word processor. She stands as SHEPHERD
     walks in--

                    MRS. CHAPIL
          Good morning, Mr. President.

                    SHEPHERD
          How're you, Mrs. Chapil?

                    MRS. CHAPIL
          Fine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left
          the detailed breakdown of the approval
          poll for you. He seemed to indicate that
          it was very good news.

                    SHEPHERD
          Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate.

     And by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has
     gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight
     briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used
     to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading,
     listening, and talking at the same time.

                    MRS. CHAPIL
          Lucy called just a moment ago. You
          forgot to sign her permission slip
          for her class--

                    JANIE
          --the museum trip. I'll go get it.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to JANIE)
          What time does she get home today?

                    JANIE
          Three-twenty.

                    SHEPHERD
          How's my afternoon look?

                    JANIE
          Very crowded.

                    SHEPHERD
          Schedule some time for me at 3:30.

                    WOMAN (O.S.)
          Buenos dias, Senor Presidente.

     This from ROBIN McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the
     President's press secretary, as she strides into the room.

                    SHEPHERD
          Too-tall McCall, how was Mexico?

                    ROBIN
          I didn't truly appreciate it until I
          came back and discovered that America
          isn't a great society.

                    LEWIS
                  (to ROBIN)
          He dumped a whole section.

                    SHEPHERD
          Now there's a thing hanging out there.

                    ROBIN
          Not a great society, sir?

                    SHEPHERD
          Well, with you out of the country, it
          wasn't, Robin. Now that you're back,
          we're great again.

                    ROBIN
          There's a press room full of people
          saying "What did he mean by that?"

                    LEWIS
          See?

                    SHEPHERD
                  (re: a memo he's been
                   looking at)
          A.J., did you get one of these?

     This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a
     separate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition
     to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor,
     he's the President's closest and oldest friend.

                    A.J.
          Is that the letter from Solomon at
          the GDC?

                    SHEPHERD
          It would appear to be a letter from
          the entire environmental community.
          These people are outta control.

                    A.J.
          I think they're just frustrated,
          Mr. President.

                    ROBIN
          Are they blaming the President for
          global warming?

                    A.J.
          Well, they don't think he caused it,
          if that's what you mean.

                  (continuing;
                   to SHEPHERD)
          Sir, I'm on the phone with these
          people twice a week. I honestly
          don't know what they want at this
          point.

                    LEWIS
          What they want is a 20 percent reduction in
          fossil fuel emissions.

                    A.J.
          It won't pass at 20 percent.

                    LEWIS
          We haven't really tried.

                    A.J.
          Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane
          hold too many markers. If we try to
          push this through and lose, there will
          be a very loud thud when we hit the
          ground, and that's not what you want in
          an election year.

                    SHEPHERD
          Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them
          the President resents the implication
          that he's turned his back on the
          environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to
          the floor. But we're gonna ask for a
          10 percent reduction. If they want to pull
          their support, fine. At 63 percent job
          approval rating. I don't need their help
          getting a bill passed. We gotta get going--
          where's Leon?

                    A.J.
                  (to an AIDE)
          Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him
          the President's--

     A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on
     pedestrian collision in the outer office--

                    MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.)
          Aaagh!

                    KODAK (O.S.)
          Sorry! Sorry, my fault.

                    A.J.
                  (to the AIDE)
          Never mind.

     LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House
     pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along
     with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's
     Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close
     over the past few years.

                    KODAK
          Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.

                    SHEPHERD
          You all right?

                    KODAK
          They keep moving that big ficus plant.

                    A.J.
          We're all here, Mr. President.

                    SHEPHERD
          Okay. First, I wanted to say
          congratulations. Three years ago, we
          were elected to the White House by
          one of the narrowest margins in history,
          and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of
          registered voters think we're doing a
          good job.

                    KODAK
          Wait a second. You wanted me to poll
          registered voters?

     Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...

                    SHEPHERD
          But the poll also tells us what we
          already knew: We don't get this
          crime bill of ours through Congress
          and these numbers are gonna be a
          memory. So, starting today, we're
          shifting it into gear.

                    ROBIN
          Can I tell my morning press gaggle
          that gun control--

                    A.J.
          Crime control, Robin. Gun control
          means we're wimps and we're soft on
          crime.

                    LEWIS
          Hang on, are we not--

                    A.J.
          Lewis--

                    LEWIS
          Are we not putting back the handgun
          restrictions?!

                    A.J.
          We're leaving 'em out.

                    LEWIS
          Sir, we campaigned on this issue.
          Now, I understand we took it out when
          we were in the low forties, but we
          can push it through now.

                    SHEPHERD
          After the elections.

                    LEWIS
          Sir, we may never have an opportunity
          like this again. Let's take this 63
          percent out for a spin and see what
          it can do.

                    SHEPHERD
          We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis.
          We need it to get re-elected. For
          reasons passing understanding, people
          do not relate guns to gun-related crime.

                    A.J.
          Robin, you can brief the press this
          afternoon. As of today, the crime
          bill's priority one on the President's
          domestic agenda.

                    ROBIN
          Got it.

                    A.J.
          Leon, you're gonna run the war room.
          We're gonna need detailed projections
          for all the target districts by the
          end of the week. And, Leon, don't be
          a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do
          what the N.R.A. does.

                    KODAK
          Scare the shit out of 'em?

                    A.J.
          Yeah.

                    KODAK
          I can do that.

                    A.J.
          Lewis, we want you to be legislative
          liaison on this. You're gonna run
          the show on the hill.

                    LEWIS
          Can I just say, to return to the
          subject for one moment, that it might
          be easier to fight a war on drugs if
          we weren't arming drug dealers.

     SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a
     temper.

                    SHEPHERD
          Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights
          we can win.

                    LEWIS
          Yes, sir.

                    A.J.
          We want to announce the crime bill at
          the State of the Union, which is 72
          days from today. The last nose count

          everyone. Janie, what's next?

                    A.J.
          Thank you, Mr. President.

     The meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Thank
     you, Mr. President"'s as they exit.

     EXT. THE WASHINGTON BUSINESS DISTRICT - DAY

     It's around 10 o'clock the same morning as the capital district,
     in its own way, is showing signs of the approaching Thanksgiving
     and Christmas holidays.


     EXT. A CHROME AND GLASS BUILDING - DAY

     On the seventh floor of the building. A RECEPTIONIST tells us
     where we are by answering the phone--

                    RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
          Global Defense Council...

                    SUSAN (V.O.)
          You wanted to see me?

     INT. LEO SOLOMON'S OFFICE - DAY

     LEO, a white-haired man in his early 60's is meeting with
     SUSAN SLOAN, a 40'ish lawyer who seems to go out of her way
     to create an issue where none exists.

                    SUSAN
          Did the President read the letter?

                    LEO
          The President's pissed as hell,
          Susan. That letter was a stupid move.

                    SUSAN
          It was aggressive, and we should
          stand by every--

                    LEO
          This isn't the guy who needed us four
          years ago, Susan. He's incredibly
          popular. He's gonna win re-election
          in a walk, and he could give a shit
          what we stand by! If the President
          passes the most important piece of
          environmental legislation in history,
          and does it despite our negative
          endorsement, our political weight in
          the future will rank somewhere below
          the Save the Spotted Owl Society.
                  (beat)
          I'm bringing in some help.


                    SUSAN
          We don't need another environmental
          expert to confirm what every other
          environmental expert--

                    LEO
          Not an environmental expert, a
          professional political strategist.
          We're playing hardball with Andrew
          Shepherd, and we need a heavy bat.

                    SUSAN
          Who?

                    LEO
          Sydney Ellen Wade.

                    SUSAN
          Oh Christ. That woman doesn't know
          the first thing about the
          environmental lobby.

                    LEO
          She's a closer, Susan. She gets the
          job done.

                  (entering)
          David Sasser from the Times called
          and wanted to know what the White
          House felt was a great society.

                    LEWIS
          What did you tell him?

                    ROBIN
          I told him I couldn't speak for the
          President, but for my money: Bermuda.

                    SHEPHERD
          Perfect.

     JANIE steps in--

                    JANIE
          Mr. President, your cousin Judith's
          come down with the flu and won't be
          able to join you Thursday night.

                    SHEPHERD
          That's too bad. Remind me to give
          her a call later.

                    JANIE
          Yes, sir.

                    ROBIN
          You gonna go stag?

                    SHEPHERD
          That's not a problem.

                    ROBIN
          No. We've never gone wrong parading
          you around as the lonely widower.

     The words came out casually, but they instantly freeze everyone.

          My God.

          I can't believe I said that.
                  (beat)
          Mr. President, that was an incredibly
          thoughtless remark. I would never
          dream of insulting you or the memory
          of your wife.

                    SHEPHERD
          That's okay, forget it.

          and the trade representative at 4:30.
          Somewhere in there you promised NPR

     LUCY, Shepherd's 12-year-old daughter, stops playing.

                    SHEPHERD
          No, keep going. I liked what you
          were playing? What's it called?

                    LUCY
          Scales.

                    SHEPHERD
          Well... you play it with gusto!

                    LUCY
          Are my lips swollen?

                    SHEPHERD
          Are they supposed to be?

                    LUCY
          Yeah.

                    SHEPHERD
          Then you're doing fine.

                    LUCY
          Whatcha got behind your back?

                    SHEPHERD
          A little gift.

                    LUCY
          Is it a dirt bike?

                    SHEPHERD
          Nope.

                    LUCY
          Is it a really old seventh-grade
          textbook of yours that you're gonna
          make me read cover to cover and
          discuss at dinner and drive me crazy
          with?

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm not comfortable with the "really
          old" part, but everything else you
          said was true.

          Your social studies teacher said your
          class would be starting on the
          Constitution this week.

                    LUCY
          You talked to Mr. Linder?

                    SHEPHERD
          Yes. It's called a Parent-Teacher
          Conference. Mr. Linder and I were
          the key player in that discussion.
          Why don't you like social studies,
          Luce?

                    LUCY
          I like it fine, Dad.

          All your other teachers say you're
          happy, you're enthusiastic, you've
          always got your hand up...Mr. Linder
          says you don't participate unless he
          calls on you, and even then it's a
          one-word answer.

                    LUCY
          I don't know what to say, Dad. I

          It's a page-turner.

          Do you see it as part of your job to
          torture me?

                    SHEPHERD
          No, it's just one of the perks. See
          you tonight.

     DEPUTY or AIDE. A.J. is also present.

                    DEFENSE SECRETARY
          The C-STAD hardware's been in place
          for a month. We've got 22 instructors
          from the Army Air Defense School waiting
          to go down and train the Israelis.

                    A.J.
          How soon can you deploy them?

                    CHAIRMAN
          We can airlift 'em in the morning.
          They'll have C-STAD operational in 20
          days.

                    A.J.

          If anybody wanted to hit it, they'd

          and get everybody focused on the
          crime bill. I don't want to win
          this. I want to win it by a couple of

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

     A meeting with the EDUCATION SECRETARY, the HUD SECRETARY,
     several AIDES and LEWIS is breaking up. SHEPHERD is ushering
     people out.

                    SHEPHERD
          The day the government starts
          subsidizing private schools is the
          day we give up on public education.

               EDUCATION SECRETARY
          I know the proposal only scratches
          the surface, but it's the least we
          can do.

                    SHEPHERD
          We're already doing the least we can
          do, but I can't think of anything
          better, so we'll go with this for now.
                  (to HUD SECRETARY)
          Jerry, say hello to Linda for me.
          And if I don't see you again, have a
          good Thanksgiving.

                    HUD SECRETARY
          Thank you, Mr. President.

     The room has cleared...JANIE is arranging new papers on the
     President's desk.

                    SHEPHERD
          How're we doing?

                    JANIE
          You're running four minutes ahead of
          schedule.

                    SHEPHERD
          Ahead?

                    JANIE
          Yes, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (exited)
          Janie, this is unprecedented. I don't
          know what to do with myself.

                    JANIE
          Mr. MacInerney asked me to remind you
          to pop your head in on--

                    SHEPHERD
          The GDC meeting. Right.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. A.J.'s OFFICE - DAY

                    A.J.
          Your concerns are not falling on deaf
          ears. The environmental lobby has
          known no greater alley in the White
          House than President Shepherd.

                    SYDNEY
          Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J.

     SUSAN is trying to avert the inevitable--

                    SUSAN
          Sydney, we should leave Mr. MacInerney
          alone now. He's already given us more
          time than--

                    SYDNEY
          Susan, Mr. MacInerney doesn't want
          us to leave, because Mr. MacInerney's
          not yet done what he needs to do today.

                    SUSAN
          Sir, Ms. Wade's been thrown into the
          deep end of the pool on her first day.
          She hasn't even had a chance to read
          the report of the Quebec Conference.

     SYDNEY -- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes,
     check her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides,
     instead, to hit the gas and swing away. The OTHERS are watching
     this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck.

                    SYDNEY
          You're right. I haven't read it. If
          someone had asked me yesterday, I'd
          have told them the Quebec Conference
          was made up of six professional hockey
          teams. But what I do know is that it's
          time for the President to run for
          president again. Leon Kodak is as good
          as it gets when it comes to electoral
          strategy, and I'm certain he's told the
          President exactly what I'd tell him:
          Nail down Michigan and California,
          where they make cars and airplanes --
          and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if
          I had read these eight hundred pages,
          I would have discovered that it's the
          burning of fossil fuels that's been
          mostly responsible for global warming and
          that the 20 percent reduction recommended
          by the GDC is a necessary first step
          toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse
          effect that has gone unchecked by this
          administration...

                    SUSAN
                  (to SYDNEY)
          It's really time to--

                    SYDNEY
          Susan, I promise you, the White House
          Chief of Staff will not let us leave
          here until he's broken the bad news.

     No one in the room really understands what's going on...
     except A.J., who would like to take the time to admire
     SYDNEY but, of course, can't.

                    A.J.
                  (pause)
          I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although
          not about Michigan and California.
          The President has asked me to convey
          to you that he's sending his energy
          bill to the floor with a call for a
          reduction of 10 percent.

     There's an uncomfortable silence in the room...

                    A.J.
                  (continuing)
          The President is willing to go it
          alone on this, but he's asking for,
          and frankly he's expecting, the full
          support of the GDC.

                    SYDNEY
          The President's expecting our full
          support?

                    A.J.
          Yes, he is.

                    SYDNEY
          The President's dreamin', A.J.

                    SUSAN
          Sydney!

                    SYDNEY
          --the President has critically
          misjudged reality. If he honestly
          thinks that the environmental
          community is going to whistle a
          happy tune while rallying support
          around this pitifully lame mockery of
          environmental leadership just because
          he's a nice guy and he's done better
          than his predecessors, then your boss
          is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Let's take him out back and beat the
          shit out of him.

     SYDNEY's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the
     direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in
     person, The President of the United States.

     She is frozen. Mortified. If she were capable of thought
     process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on
     her head right now.

                    A.J.
          Good morning, Mr. President. How are
          you today?

                    SHEPHERD
          Couldn't be better.
                  (to the GROUP)
          I apologize for the interruption, but
          A.J. asked me to stop and say hello.
          You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by
          any chance, would you?

                    SYDNEY
          Mr. President, I'm...don't know what
          to say. I'm speechless.

                    SHEPHERD
          All evidence to the contrary.

                    SUSAN
          Mr. President, we haven't met. My
          name is Susan Sloan. I used to work
          with Congressman Myers. I hope this
          episode in no way--

                    SHEPHERD
          Sydney?

                    SYDNEY
          Yes, sir?

                    SHEPHERD
          You got a second?

                    SYDNEY
                  (quietly)
          Of course.

     SYDNEY gets up to leave. SHEPHERD escorts her out of A.J.'s
     office and into the hallway.

                    SHEPHERD
          I thought maybe we might have a word
          in private. Someplace a little less
          intimidating.
                  (calling)
          Janie?

                    JANIE
          Yes, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to SYDNEY)
          This is my personal assistant, Janie
          Basdin. Janie, would you show Ms.
          Wade into the rec room. I'll be there
          in a second.

     SHEPHERD enters a doorway off of the hall. SYDNEY continues
     down the hallway.

                    JANIE
                  (to SYDNEY)
          This way...

     JANIE leads SYDNEY into...


     INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

     ...where SYDNEY just stands uncomfortably, not knowing
     whether to sit or stand. Waiting. Trying -- the way a jumper
     on a window ledge tries not to look down -- trying not to
     notice things like the JFK Desk, the Seal of the President of
     the United States, the bust of Lincoln...

     SHEPHERD strides in--

                    SHEPHERD
          Sorry to keep you waiting.

                    SYDNEY
          Mr. President--

                    SHEPHERD
          Is it okay if I call you Sydney?

                    SYDNEY
          Of course. Mr. President--

                    SHEPHERD
          Have you ever been in the Oval Office?

                    SYDNEY
          I've just been on the regular tour.
          It didn't include...

                    SHEPHERD
          I hear it's pretty good.

                    SYDNEY
          Mr. President, what you saw in there
          was nothing more than vanity run amok.
          I was showing off for a colleague who
          doesn't think very much of me. It'd
          be a real injustice for you to hold the
          GDC accountable for my behavior today.
          On top of which, I'm monumentally sorry
          for having insulted you like that.

                    SHEPHERD
          Are you under the impression that I'm
          mad at you?

                    SYDNEY
                  (pause)
          Well...

                    SHEPHERD
          Sydney, seldom does a day go by that
          I'm not burned in effigy.

                    SYDNEY
          Not by a professional political
          operative standing 30 feet from the
          Oval Office.

                    SHEPHERD
          No, I'll give you that.

                    SYDNEY
          Mr. President--

                    SHEPHERD
          Did you know that when the City
          Planners sat down to design
          Washington, D.C., their intention was
          to build a city that would intimidate
          and humble foreign heads of state?
          It's true.

                    SYDNEY
          I didn't know that.


                    SHEPHERD
          The White House has the single
          greatest home court advantage in the
          modern world.

                    SYDNEY
          Learned that one the hard way.

                    SHEPHERD
          Sydney, this bill is important to me.

                    SYDNEY
          Yes, sir, I'll convey your message.

                    SHEPHERD
          But you don't believe me?

                    SYDNEY
          The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
          It's not gonna pass at 20 percent.
          It's a long shot at 10.

                    SYDNEY
          How do you know that until you put
          the full weight of the White House
          behind--

                    SHEPHERD
          Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes
          shy in the House. It can't be done.
          But I tell you what. I'll make you a
          deal with you. If you can get 24
          votes, I'll get you the last 10.

                    SYDNEY
          Twenty-four votes?

                    SHEPHERD
          If you can swing 24 votes by the
          State of the Union, I'll promise you
          full White House support.

                    SYDNEY
          Do I have your word on that, sir?

                    SHEPHERD
          Absolutely. Listen, are you hungry?
          I skipped breakfast. You wanna have
          some coffee? A donut or something?

                    SYDNEY
          Sir, I'm a little intimidated by my
          surroundings, and yes, I've gotten
          off to a rocky and somewhat stilted
          beginning, but don't let that
          diminish the weight of my message:
          The GDC has been at every president
          for the last decade and a half that
          global warming is a calamity, the
          effects of which will be second only
          to nuclear war. The best scientists
          in the world have given you every
          reason to take the GDC seriously.
          But I'm gonna give you one more. If
          you don't live up to the deal you
          just made, come New Hampshire, we're
          gonna go shopping for a new candidate.

     SYDNEY heads for the door--

                    SHEPHERD
          You can't do that, Sydney.

                    SYDNEY
          With all due respect, Mr. President,
          who's gonna stop me?

                    SHEPHERD
          Well, if you go through that door,
          the United States Secret Service.
          That's my private office.
                     (pointing)
               You need to go out that way.

                    SYDNEY
                  (beat)
          Ah.

     SYDNEY, with as much dignity as she can muster, leaves the
     Oval Office. SHEPHERD muses about what has just transpired.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. THE BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

     SHEPHERD has converted one of the rooms on the second floor
     residence. His expert shot demonstrates that playing pool is
     something he does almost as well as being President. A.J.
     stands to the side with his pool cue.

                    A.J.
          McSorley, McCluskey and Shane know
          we're making our move on the crime
          bill. They're circling the wagons on
          the assault weapons.

                    SHEPHERD
          Should I meet with them?

                    A.J.
          Let Lewis take a pass at them first.

                    SHEPHERD
          Fine. 2 in the side.

     SHEPHERD sends the two-ball flying into the corner pocket.

                    A.J.
          Nice shot, Mr. President.

                    SHEPHERD
          Nice shot, Mr. President? You won't
          call me by my name when we're playing
          pool.

     A.J. assesses the table.

                    A.J.
          I will not do it playing pool, I will
          not do it in a school, I do not like
          green eggs and ham, I do not like
          them Sam I am.

                    SHEPHERD
          At ease, A.J., and get away from the
          pocket. 9 in the corner.

     SHEPHERD makes the shot.

                    A.J.
          Leo Solomon phoned. He said he was
          thrilled with the deal you made this
          morning.

     SHEPHERD lifts his cue for a moment...trying to think it
     there was something he was supposed to tell A.J.

                    SHEPHERD
          I forgot to tell you.

                    A.J.
          It's a waste of time.

                    SHEPHERD
          Not our time. GDC makes a big
          push for the votes, and when they
          come up short, we move in with the
          softer bill, to get passed, we're
          everybody's hero. 3 in the side.

                    A.J.
          Also, Sydney Wade called.

     SHEPHERD, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mile.

                    SHEPHERD
          Sydney Wade?

                    A.J.
                  (beat)
          She wanted to apologize one more time
          for her behavior. 3 in the side.

                    SHEPHERD
          Did she say anything about me?

                    A.J.
                  (beat)
          Sydney Wade?

                    SHEPHERD
          When she called.

                    A.J.
          Did she say anything about you?
          13 in the corner.

                    SHEPHERD
          No, it's just that we had a nice
          couple of minutes together. She
          threatened me and I patronized her
          and we didn't have anything to eat,
          but I thought there was a connection.

     A.J. is staring at him in disbelief.

                    SHEPHERD
          She didn't say anything about me?

                    A.J.
               (quietly)
          Well, no, but I could pass her a note
          before study hall and--

                    SHEPHERD
          Tell me this: Hypothetically, what
          would happen--

                    A.J.
          I feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in
          the corner.

     He misses the shot.

                    SHEPHERD
          --if I called Sydney and asked her
          to be my date at the State Dinner
          Thursday night?

                    A.J.
          You're not serious.

                    SHEPHERD
          Don't I sound serious?

                    A.J.
          The President can't just go out on
          a date.

                    SHEPHERD
          Why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did.

                    A.J.
          You're not--

                    SHEPHERD
          Wilson was widowed during his first
          term. He meets a woman named Edith
          Gault. He dated her, courted her,
          married her, and somewhere in there
          managed to form the League of Nations.

                    A.J.
          Mr. President, this is an election
          year. If you're looking for female
          companionship, we can make
          arrangements that'll insure total
          privacy and--

                    SHEPHERD
          I don't want you to get me a girl,
          A.J. What is this, Vegas?

                    A.J.
          No, sir, this is the White House.

                    SHEPHERD
          And I'm talking about something
          that in no way is at conflict with
          my oath of office. I'm a single
          adult, and I met a woman that I'd
          like to see again socially. How's
          that different from what Wilson did?

                    A.J.
          The difference is he didn't have to
          be the president on television.
          You've said it a million times:
          If there were a television set in every
          living room 60 years ago, this country
          does not elect a man in a wheelchair.

                    SHEPHERD
          What are you saying?

                    A.J.
          We'll take a hit.

                    SHEPHERD
          How big?

                    A.J.
          I don't know. Five points. Maybe
          more.

                    SHEPHERD
          Five points we're standing here
          talking about?!

                    A.J.
          It could be more.

                    SHEPHERD
          I drop five points when Wisconsin
          doesn't make it to the Rose Bowl.
          5 in the corner.

                    A.J.
          Do you want me to have Kodak put
          together some numbers so we know
          what we're talking about?

                    SHEPHERD
          Yeah.
                  (beat)
          No. No. I don't want to check a
          polling sample to see if this is
          okay, like I'm asking permission
          to stay out an hour past curfew.
          This isn't the business of the
          American people.

                    A.J.
          Mr. President, the American people
          have a funny way of deciding on
          their own what is and what is not
          their business.

                    SHEPHERD
          I like her, A.J.
                  (pause)
          Stop being my chief of staff for one
          minute.

                    A.J.
                  (beat)
          Give her a call.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (calling out)
          Janie!
                  (to A.J.)
          She didn't say anything about me?

                    A.J.
          She said you're taller than she
          thought you'd be.

                    SHEPHERD
          That's something.

     JANIE enters--

                    JANIE
          Yes, sir?

                    SHEPHERD
          I need you to track down a phone
          number.

     INT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A few suitcases and two or three moving cartons serve as
     evidence that SYDNEY's staying with her sister BETH
     temporarily.

     BETH, still in hospital scrubs from a 12-hour shift, opens a
     bottle of wine while SYDNEY, in a bathrobe and wet hair,
     tries to get off the phone.

                    SYDNEY
                  (into phone)
          Richard...Richard, it wasn't funny.
          I acted like a college freshman at a
          protest rally.

                    BETH
          Tell him the part about walking out
          the wrong door.

                    SYDNEY
          Oh God, I forgot about that.
                  (back into phone)
          No, Richard...Richard, I don't want
          to hear your Andrew Shepherd imitation...

                    BETH
          I wanna hear it.

                    SYDNEY
          I'm hanging up now, Richard...
          Tonight? I was gonna go to bed early
          and wake up when there's a new
          president.

     She hangs up.

                    SYDNEY
                  (continuing)
          The President must think I'm a third-
          rate jerk.

                    BETH
          If he thinks you're a jerk, I'm sure
          he thinks you're a first-rate jerk.

                    SYDNEY
          I'll tell you one thing, boy. I
          regrouped, you gotta gimme that.
          I pulled it together at the end. I
          stood in the middle of the Oval
          Office and I made it very clear that
          from now on, he who doesn't take the
          GDC seriously does so at his peril!

                    BETH
          And then you walked out the wrong
          door.

                    SYDNEY
          Are you gonna be throwing that back
          at me the rest of my life?

                    BETH
          That's my current plan, yes.

     The TELEPHONE RINGS...

                    SYDNEY
          That's gonna be Leo Solomon. He said
          he'd call at nine.

     SYDNEY picks up the phone--

                    SYDNEY
                  (continuing;

          Hello?

                    SHEPHERD
          Uh, hi, is this Sydney?

     SYDNEY doesn't recognize the voice--

                  (into phone)
          Leo?

                    PHONE VOICE
          No, this is Andrew Shepherd.

     SYDNEY looks at BETH and rolls her eyes, then explains to
     her--

                    SYDNEY
          Andrew Shepherd.
                  (back in the phone)
          You're hilarious, Richard. You're a
          regular riot.

     And we CROSS-CUT between SYDNEY and SHEPHERD.

                    SHEPHERD
          Uhh...this isn't Richard, it's Andrew
          Shepherd.

                    SYDNEY
          Oh, really. Well, I'm so glad you
          called, because I forgot to tell
          you today what a nice ass you have.
          I'm also impressed that you were able
          to get my phone number, considering
          I don't have a phone. Good night,
          Richard.

     SYDNEY hangs up the phone.

          You want me to deal with him?

                    SYDNEY
          No way. I may choke in front of
          Shepherd, but Richard Reynolds I

          Hello.

                    SYDNEY
          Mr. President, I'm sure there's an
          appropriate thing to say at this
          moment. Probably some formal apology
          for the nice-ass remark would be in
          order. I just don't quite know how
          to word it.

                    SHEPHERD
          It's my fault. I shouldn't have
          called you at home. Should I call
          you at the office tomorrow?

                    SYDNEY
          No, sir, of course not. I mean --
          yes, you can call me anytime you want
          -- this is fine. Right now is fine.
          When I said "of course not," I meat
          that...You know what? The hell with it
          -- I'm moving to another country.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (smiling)
          What did you mean when you said you
          don't have a phone.

                    SYDNEY
          I just moved to Washington over the
          weekend, and my apartment isn't ready
          yet. This is my sister's apartment.
          Come to think of it, how did you get
          this number?

                    SHEPHERD
                  (beat)
          How did I get the number. That's a
          reasonable question. I don't know.
          Probably the FBI.

                   it's just another

          The FBI. Sure. 'Cause i-if you want
          to find someone and you're the
          president, that's who you would call.

                    SHEPHERD
          You know who else is good at that?

                    SYDNEY
          The C.I.A.?

                    SHEPHERD
          Well, yeah, but I was thinking of the
          Internal Revenue Service. They have
          computer files that...Well...I should
          stop stalling. As I'm sure you know,
          the French have elected themselves a
          new president, and we're having a formal
          state dinner at the White House, and I
          was wondering -- and you're under no
          obligation at all -- but I thought it
          might be fun... I was wondering if you
          maybe wanted to go...with me, and uh...
          there it is. That's why I was calling.

          Sydney, this is just a dinner. We're
          not gonna be doing espionage or
          anything.

                    SYDNEY
          No. Of course. I'm a little...uh...what
          do I do? I, I mean, where do I go?
          Should I meet you? Will you...

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm gonna have a very nice woman
          named Marsha Bridgeport call you.
          She's the White House Social Director,
          and she'll help you with anything you
          want. Now when she calls you and tells
          you her name is Marsha Bridgeport,
          it'll help if you give her the
          benefit of the doubt.

                    SYDNEY
          Of course.

                    SHEPHERD
          I'll see you Thursday night.

     use of a half-dozen STAFFERS as well as ten or twelve
     interns, some of them high school age. A sign on a
     corkboard reads, "17 Votes in 69 Days."

     The two numbers are written on two separate pads of paper so
     that the top sheets can be torn off to reveal the following
     numbers in descending order.

     There is also a bulletin board that lists every member of the
     House of Representatives and is divided up into five columns:
     FOR, LEANING TOWARDS, UNDECIDED, LEANING AGAINST, and AGAINST.

          We've got Jarrett.

                    KODAK
          What?

                    LEWIS
          George Jarrett. He's ours. Solid
          "yes."

                    KODAK
          I don't believe it.
                  (to an INTERN)
          You. New guy. "Jarrett, Democrat,
          Minnesota." Slide his name on over
          to "for."
                  (to Lewis)
          We just had his name laminated under
          "Undecided." How'd you get the fence
          pole out of his butt?

                    LEWIS
          I wish I could take credit. He just
          said, "Lewis, I support the President
          a hundred percent ." Not the bill,
          the President.

                    LEWIS
          We're gonna win this in a walk. It's
          like a kissing booth at a carnival.
          Give us a vote, get a photo-op with
          number 63.

     LEWIS reaches to the tote board and pulls the "17" off,
     revealing "16."

                    LEWIS
          We should have gone after the
          handguns.

                    KODAK
          We gotta do one thing at a time.

                    LEWIS
          We don't have time to do one thing at
          a time.

     INT. FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY

     A GDC conference room that SYDNEY, her assistant, DAVID, and
     two INTERNS have made into their 72-day headquarters. A
     similar tote board reads "23 Votes in 69 Days."

     The two interns are marking spreadsheets. DAVID is on one
     phone, SYDNEY is on another.

                    DAVID
                  (into phone)
          Carol, it's David in Sydney Wade's
          office. I want to confirm her lunch
          with the Congressman.

                    SYDNEY
                  (into phone)
          We could do with a little party
          leadership, Mike. Is the Majority
          Whip takin' a break? Congress is in
          session, right, I'm not wrong about
          that?

     LISA, another intern, is hanging up a phone in the background
     and crossing to the corkboard.

                    LISA
          I just got off with Luther Simons.
          Brock's on board.

                    SYDNEY
          Terrific!

     She rips the "23" off, making it "22." SYDNEY reaches for
     her coffee and knocks over a cup of pencils. In righting the
     pencils, she knocks over her coffee.

                    DAVID
          You're awfully jumpy today. What do
          you have -- a big date tonight?

     With that, a big pile of papers is sent flying off the desk.

     It's a beautiful night. The White House, lit up and shimmering
     in its golden glow, would appear now to be exactly what the
     poet was looking at when he described The Shining City on a
     Hill.

     Limousines, several of which fly the flag of foreign
     diplomats, pull up one by one, their doors opened by white-
     gloved MARINES.

     White lights from television cameras mix with the fireworks
     of flashbulbs from the print media.


     INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

     The GUESTS -- of whom there are a couple hundred -- in black tie
     and evening gowns, are entering the receiving area.

     All this happening, of course, under the eye of the SECRET
     SERVICE AGENTS, both American and French, who are
     strategically placed throughout.

     The light from a TV camera comes on as a reporter begins a
     quick stand-up interview with ROBERT RUMSON, a handsome man
     in his late forties.

          I'm standing here with Senate
          Minority Leader Robert Rumson, just
          one of the many guests arriving at
          what, for a few hours at least, is a
          non-partisan White House. Senator,
          the latest public opinion survey
          shows the President with approval
          ratings that would make him all but
          unbeatable, come next November. Is
          there a Republican who can mount a
          serious challenge, and are you that
          candidate?

                    RUMSON
          Lloyd, it's a long time till next
          November. Right now, I'm just
          looking forward to a pleasant evening.

                    LUCY
          It's supposed to be tight. It's
          supposed to make you look regal.

                    SHEPHERD

     He looks in the mirror.

          Social studies.

          You know, I'm a little nervous.

          I promise you there's no hidden

     SHEPHERD approaches SYDNEY.

          Sydney. Andrew Shepherd. We spoke on
          the phone.

                    SYDNEY
          Yes, sir. I remember.

     ESTHER, MACINERNERY, A.J.'S wife, joins them.

                    A.J.
          You know my wife, Esther.

                    SYDNEY
          Sure. It's nice to see you again.

                    ESTHER
                  (affectionately)
          Sydney, the President told me about
          how you two met. I think it's
          priceless.

                    SYDNEY
          I don't know what happened. One
          minute I was calling him a mockery of
          an environmental leader. The next
          minute I had a date.

                    ESTHER
          Men like being insulted by women.
          It makes them feel loved. Don't ask
          me why.

                    A.J.
          Sydney, when you meet the French
          President, don't make him feel too
          loved, all right? We just signed a
          new trade agreement.

                    SYDNEY
          Got it.

     The French President, D'ASTIER, and his WIFE approach.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to D'Astier)
          Mr. President, would allow me to
          introduce Sydney Ellen Wade of the
          Commonwealth of Virginia. Sydney,
          this is President Rene-Jean D'Astier
          and his wife Monique Danielle
          D'Astier of France.

                    SYDNEY
          An honor to meet you both.

                    JANIE
          Mr. President, I'm sorry to
          interrupt. The receiving line is in
          place.

                    SHEPHERD
          Sydney, it sounds like our table's

     SHEPHERD's guests make their way out of the residence,
     leaving SHEPHERD with SYDNEY and the FRENCH PRESIDENT and
     MDME. D'ASTIER.

     INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

     SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are walking down the staircase that leads
     to the red-carpeted hall through which the President enters
     the East Room.

     The GROUP escorting the President gives them wide berth so
     that the two of them can have some privacy.

                    SHEPHERD
          Once we hit the bottom of the
          stairs, I gotta do a thing.
          You'll be escorted...

                    SYDNEY
          They took me through it.

     After a slight pause--

                    SYDNEY
                  (continuing)
          Do you do this often, sir?

                    SHEPHERD
                  (beat)
          This is, actually, only our second
          State Dinner. The first was for the
          Emperor of Japan, who died shortly
          after that, so we stopped having them
          for a while, just in case.

                    SYDNEY
          I meant do you go out on...do you--
          often--do you--

                    SHEPHERD
          Do I date a lot?

                    SYDNEY
          Well, yeah.

                    SHEPHERD
          No. How 'bout you?

                    SYDNEY
          Me? Lately, I seem to be going out
          on a lot of first dates.

                    SHEPHERD
          Then you're experienced at this.

                    SYDNEY
          Oh yeah, you can ask me anything.

                    SHEPHERD
          How are we doing so far?

                    SYDNEY
          It's hard to say at this point. So
          far it's just your typical first date
          stuff.

     And all of a sudden an INCREDIBLE SOUND from inside the East
     Room--

     --The Marine Corps Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays four
     ruffles and flourishes.

                    SHEPHERD
          Damn. And I wanted to find a way to
          be different from the other guys.

     A BOOMING VOICE over the P.A. announces--

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Ladies and gentlemen, the President
          of the United States.

     And now -- the whole walk timing out with incredible precision --

                    SHEPHERD
          By the way, nice shoes.

     --SHEPHERD walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion
     Ensemble plays HAIL TO THE CHIEF.

     The 180 GUESTS come to their feet and applaud long and loud.

     The GROUP following the President catches up to the spot
     where SYDNEY has stopped walking. They all join in the
     applause. We can see in SYDNEY's face that she's been quite
     swept up.

                    D'ASTIER
          Je ne connais pas la tradition en
          Amerique, mais dans mon pays, si les
          invites de Louis XVI et Marie
          Antoinette avaient ose danser devant
          le roi et la reine, ils auraient
          perdu la tete.

                    SYDNEY
          Really?

                    MADAME D'ASTIER
          Absolument.

                    SHEPHERD
          Sydney, you didn't dissolve the NATO
          treaty, did you?

                    SYDNEY
          I just said that we're sitting in this
          beautiful room, listening to the music
          of this wonderful orchestra, and I
          wondered why nobody was dancing.

                    D'ASTIER
          And I informed Ms. Wade that in my
          country, a guest at the palace of
          Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would
          soon find their head in a guillotine
          if they made the impertinent gesture
          of dancing without so much as a
          by-your-leave from the King and the Queen.

                    A.J.
          I'll bet no one accused Louis of
          being soft on crime.

                    SYDNEY
          There's a lesson there, Mr. President.

                    SHEPHERD
          More beheadings at the White House?

                    A.J.
          Bob Rumson would embrace it.

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm sure he would, but I have a
          better idea.

     SHEPHERD stands, holds out his hand to SYDNEY.

                    SHEPHERD

          Would you like to dance?

                    SYDNEY
          Uh, yeah, I guess. I mean, yes, sir,
          I'd love to.

     SHEPHERD and SYDNEY move to the dance floor, accompanied by
     the appreciative "oooh's" and "ahh's" of the GUESTS.

          I don't know how you do it.

          Arthur Murray. Six lessons.

                    SYDNEY
          That's not what I mean. Two hundred
          pairs of eyes are focused on you
          right now, with two questions:
          "Who's this girl, and why's our
          president dancing with her?"

                    SHEPHERD
          First of all, the 200 pairs of eyes
          aren't focused on me. They're
          focused on you. And the answers are
          "Sydney Ellen Wade" and "Because she
          said 'yes.'"

          Lovely.

          We've got troubles.

          Good morning, Mrs. Chapil.

                    MRS. CHAPIL
          Good morning, Mr. President. Mr.
          Rothschild and Miss McCall are in the
          office, sir. They said they needed to
          speak with you before scheduling.

                    SHEPHERD
          Fine. Janie, can you get me the
          number of a local florist?

                    JANIE
          I'll take care of it, sir. Where do
          you want them sent?

                    SHEPHERD
          I want to do it myself. I just need
          the phone number.

          I don't understand.

                    SHEPHERD
          I want the phone number of a florist.

                    JANIE
          You just want the phone number?

                    SHEPHERD
          I want to send some flowers, Janie.
          I want to do it myself. I don't want
          to staff it out, and I don't want to
          issue an Executive Order. I just
          want a phone number.

                    JANIE
          I'll get it for you right away, sir.

          Mr. President, we need five minutes
          before scheduling if you can spare it.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to Robin)
          I just need two minutes to make a
          call and I'll be right with you.

     JANIE enters and hands SHEPHERD a piece of paper.

                    SHEPHERD

          Thank you, Janie.

          So there I was, thinking maybe I
          should give Sydney a call. She's
          new in town, doesn't know many
          people...

     LEO produces a copy of the morning paper, which has a photo
     of SHEPHERD and SYDNEY dancing.

                    SYDNEY
          Leo--

                    LEO
          Then I picked up the Times--

                    SYDNEY
          It was crazy. He called me at home.

                    LEO
          What's going on?

                    SYDNEY
          Nothing. It was innocent. His
          cousin got the flu at the last
          minute.

                    LEO
          Did you sleep with him?

                    SYDNEY
          What?

                    LEO
          Did you sleep--

                    SYDNEY
          That's none of your business, Leo.

                    LEO
          Yeah, it is, Sydney.

                    SYDNEY
          You wanna tell me how my personal
          life in any way--

                    LEO
          Because when it's the President, it's
          not personal. Sydney, I hired your
          reputation. I hired a pit bull, not
          a prom queen.

                    SYDNEY
          That's unfair.

                    LEO
          It's incredibly unfair. But you've
          spent a lot of time over the year
          telling me the trouble with the
          environmental lobby is that we don't
          understand the fundamental truth that
          politics is perception. This is a
          bad time to develop ignorance.

                    SYDNEY
          You're making way too much of this.

                    LEO
          Am I? This is your time, Sydney.
          You're sitting at the grown-ups'
          table. You have a chance to get
          everything you want -- run a national
          campaign, be a major player inside
          the party. But this relationship had
          better go all the way, because with
          the leader of the free world there is
          no halfway. Politics is perception,
          and if thing don't work out, the
          amount of time it'll take you to go
          from being a hired gun to a cocktail
          party joke can be clocked with an egg
          timer.

     There's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's SECRETARY steps in
     with a strange-looking package.

                    SYDNEY
          Leo, there is no relationship. It
          was one night. It's done.

                    LEO'S SECRETARY
          Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered
          by White House messenger. It's
          marked "Perishable."

                    LEO
          The White House has sent me something
          perishable?

                    LEO'S SECRETARY
          It's for Ms. Wade.

                    LEO
          Here we go...

     SYDNEY begins unwrapping the package.

                    SYDNEY
          Relax, Leo. I'm sure it's just a
          formality.

                    LEO'S SECRETARY
                  (exited)
          It's from him.

                    LEO
          Of course it's from him.

                    SYDNEY
          So he had some staff flunky send
          me a fruit basket.

                    LEO'S SECRETARY
          He wrote the note himself.

                    SYDNEY
          I'm sure he didn't take the time to--

                    LEO'S SECRETARY
          The messenger said he was waiting in
          the Oval Office for ten minutes while
          the President wrote the card.

                    SYDNEY
          Okay, listen, so he--
                  (to LEO'S SECRETARY)
          --it took him ten minutes to write a
          card?!

                    LEO'S SECRETARY
          Apparently he went through several
          drafts.

     SYDNEY can't stifle her laugh -- she sees what the gift is.

                    LEO
          What is it...what is it?

                    SYDNEY
          A ham.

                    LEO
                  (beat)
          A ham?

                    SYDNEY
          He sent me a Virginia ham.

                    LEO'S SECRETARY
          Dig it, Ms. Wade. You're the
          President's girlfriend.

     SYDNEY's smile fades away...she looks at LEO.

                    LEO
          There's never an egg timer around
          when you need one.

          Sir, they're gonna be pressing today
          about whether the White House is
          prepared to soften the assault
          weapons section of the crime bill.

                    LEWIS
          There is no need to entertain that
          at this point.

                    ROBIN
          How do you want me to handle the
          Sydney issue?

                    SHEPHERD
          The Sydney issue?

                    LEWIS
          We should have a consensus on how the
          White House is going to handle it.

                    SHEPHERD
          I sure hope the Sydney issue refers
          in some way to a problem we're having
          with Australia, because if it's
          anything else...

     JANIE pokes her head in.

                    JANIE
          Mr. President, Ms. Wade is here to
          see you.

                    SHEPHERD
          Tell her she can come right in. I'm
          finished here.

                    JANIE
          Yes, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
                (to LEWIS and ROBIN)
          There is no Sydney issue.

     SYDNEY enters, crossing paths with LEWIS and ROBIN. They
     exchange pleasantries.

                    SYDNEY
                  (to SHEPHERD)
          Thanks for seeing me on such short
          notice.

                    SHEPHERD
          No problem. Did you get the ham?

                    SYDNEY
          I got the ham, yes. Thank you very
          much.

                    SHEPHERD
          I wanted to send you flowers, but
          there seem to be some kinks in the
          system. I'm really glad you stopped
          by. I had such a good time last
          night.

                    SYDNEY
          So did I. It's just that...

     JANIE enters.

                    JANIE
          They're 45 seconds away, sir.

     During the following, JANIE will go to the desk, pick up two
     briefing books and stick them in a briefcase and gather up
     his things -- all without interrupting the conversation a beat.

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm delivering a luncheon speech at
          the Governor's Conference this
          morning. I'm sorry to--

                    SYDNEY
          No, no, that's fine. I just stopped
          by to...

                    SHEPHERD
          Are you free for dinner tomorrow night?

                    SYDNEY
          Dinner?

                    SHEPHERD
          Casual. In the Residence. Without
          the United Nations. My daughter'll
          be with us, so it may seem like the
          United--

                    SYDNEY
          I'd love to meet Lucy, but...

     An AIDE has slipped in and hands SHEPHERD a note.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (reading to himself
                  as he talks SYDNEY)
          She's gonna like you.
                  (calling to the AIDE)
          Excuse me -- Jeff!

                    SYDNEY
          Actually, I have some concerns that--

     The AIDE (JEFF) steps back in--

                    JEFF
          Yes, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (reading the note)
          I can't do this.

                    JEFF
          Which? Robbins or Stackhouse?

                    SHEPHERD
          Either one. I have to be in and out.

                    JEFF
          Sir, Governor Stackhouse said he just
          needed 10 minutes. I think he wants
          to talk about the assault weapons.

                    SHEPHERD
          Stackhouse wants to talk about
          grazing rights. Trust me.

                    JEFF
          Got it.

     And he's gone.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to Sydney)
          Sorry. You have concerns.

                    SYDNEY
          Yes. Not many. A few. One. I have
          one concern.

                    SHEPHERD
          Does it having anything to do with
          one of us being the President?

                    SYDNEY
          You like to make jokes about this,
          but--

                    SHEPHERD
          I am not mocking you, honest. I'm
          just a guy asking a girl over for a
          meal.

     And, as if from out of nowhere, a LOUD CLAAAMMERING, like the
     sound of a jackhammer against cement, comes from somewhere
     outside -- growing louder and closer --

                    SYDNEY
          What's that?

                    SHEPHERD
          My ride's here.

     And, sure enough, coming into view outside the windows of the
     Oval Office, is MARINE-1, the President's helicopter. JANIE
     comes back in and helps him on with his coat and scarf.

                    SYDNEY
          Leo Solomon has serious concerns
          about my exploring a social, you
          know, scenario, with the President
          of the United States.

                    SHEPHERD
          Yeah, well, when you put it that
          way, it doesn't sound that great
          to me either.

                    SYDNEY
          It's just not--

                    SHEPHERD
          Have dinner with Lucy and me. It's
          meat loaf night -- how presidential
          can it be?

     As SHEPHERD rushes out...

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          Seven-thirty.

     SYDNEY now stands alone in the OVAL OFFICE, trying to figure
     out what just happened.

                                                          CUT TO:

          Are you Ms. Wade?

          Sydney.

          Lucy Shepherd.

                    SYDNEY
          Nice to meet you.

                    LUCY
          My dad told me to tell you he's on
          the phone with his dentist and that
          I should behave myself and entertain
          you till he gets here.

                    SYDNEY
          Your father's on the phone with his
          dentist?

                    LUCY
          No. He told me to tell you he's on
          the phone with his dentist. He wants
          you to think he's a regular guy.

                    SYDNEY
          Who is he on the phone with?

                    LUCY
          The Prime Minister of Israel.

                    SYDNEY
          They're probably not discussing his
          teeth.

                    LUCY
          No. They're talking about that
          abbreviation I can never remember.

                    SYDNEY
          C-STAD?

                    LUCY
          Yeah.

                    SYDNEY
          Capricorn Surface To Air Defense.

                    LUCY
          Right.

     SHEPHERD enters.

                    SHEPHERD
          Let meat loaf night begin.

                    SYDNEY
          Everything all right with your teeth?

                    SHEPHERD
          My teeth?

                    SYDNEY
          The dentist.

                    SHEPHERD
          Oh, right. I've got a cavity in my
          upper bicuspid region.

                    SYDNEY
          You've got a short-range weapons
          system outside Tel Aviv.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to LUCY)
          You turned on me.

                    LUCY
          Can we eat?

     A cocktail party is underway. This is a fat cat fundraiser

          You're over-thinking this.

     INT. THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

     The look and feel of old money. Rumson is holding court with
     a half-dozen political insiders. Some smoke cigars; others
     sip their drinks.

                    RUMSON
                  (continuing)
          Voters aren't interested in how to
          achieve economic growth, and they
          don't want to hear our plans to
          strengthen foreign policy.

                    STAFFER #1
          So it comes down to character.

                    STAFFER #2
          The press like him, Senator. The
          networks, the newspapers, they're--

                    RUMSON
          Reporters like him. Networks and
          newspapers like ratings and circulation.
          For all the bitching we do about liberal
          bias in the press when it comes down to
          a character debate...

                    STAFFER #3
          The press is an unwitting accomplice.

                    CARL
          Bob, the character debate didn't work
          out for us.

                    RUMSON
          Because it couldn't. Our polling
          told us that attacking his character
          less than a year after he'd lost his
          wife was gonna be a turn-off and was
          gonna make people feel sorry for him.
          We couldn't run the campaign we wanted
          because the opponent was a widower.

                    CARL
          He's still a widower. Time's passed,
          but--

                    RUMSON
                  (to the rest)
          You'll have to forgive my friend.
          He's been on a hunting trip and cut
          off from the world.

                    CARL
          What's going on?

     And four STAFFERS grab whatever newspaper is closest to their
     hand and toss them to CARL.

                    RUMSON
          The President's got a girlfriend.

     LUCY, SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are finishing up a game of Scrabble.

                    SYDNEY
                  (to LUCY)
          Your dad says you're studying the
          Constitutional Convention.

                    SHEPHERD
          She's not having any fun, though.

                    LUCY
          Dad--

                    SYDNEY
          You're not having fun?

                    LUCY
                  (to herself)
          This is a nightmare. This is a
          social studies nightmare.

                    SHEPHERD
          They're doing a mock Congress. Each
          kid is playing one of the original
          delegates, and they debate the
          Amendments. Now what's not fun about
          that?

     LUCY gets up from the table and kisses her father.

                    LUCY
          G'night, Dad.

                    SHEPHERD
          G'night, sweetheart.

          It was nice meeting you, Sydney.

                    SYDNEY
          Thank you. It was nice meeting
          you.

          Sleep well, honey. I love you.

                    LUCY
          I love you, too.

     LUCY leaves. SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are alone now.

          She's wonderful.

                    SHEPHERD
          She's her mother.

                    SYDNEY
          She's you.

     After a pause...

                    SHEPHERD
          Would you like the 25-cent tour?

     INT. THE EAST WING - NIGHT

     This is the "museum" area of the White House, the part you
     see when you take the official tour. Only a few lights are
     lit, and while the SECRET SERVICE AGENTS give SHEPHERD plenty
     of breathing room when he's in the residence, we'll still
     catch a glimpse of one of them rounding a corner in the
     distance or checking a doorway ahead.

                    SYDNEY
          I thought C-STAD wasn't gonna be
          operational until January.

                    SHEPHERD
          It was ready ahead of schedule.
          We've just been waiting for the
          personnel.

                    SYDNEY
          The Israelis?

                    SHEPHERD
          No, our guys. We've sent a team of
          Army instructors to train the
          Israelis.

     SYDNEY and SHEPHERD enter the:


     INT. THE CHINA ROOM - NIGHT

     Named for its beautiful glass display cases featuring full
     place settings of the official White House china and
     silverware from every administration since Jackson.

                    SHEPHERD:
                  (remembering)
          I think this is the dish room.

                    SYDNEY
          It's not the dish--

                    SHEPHERD
          Yeah, it is. It's the room with all
          the dishes.

                    SYDNEY
          It's the China Room.

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm more of a West Wing President.
          If you're curious about the mansion,
          there's probably a book you can get--

                    SYDNEY
          There're about seven-thousand books.
          I'll get one for you.

     SYDNEY's been walking slowly around the room, looking at the
     display cases, and as she gets near one of the large windows,
     she takes another step which drapes her in a shaft of
     incredibly flattering moonlight.

     The vision isn't lost on SHEPHERD. They stare at each other
     for a moment.

                    SHEPHERD
          Sydney.

                    SYDNEY
          Mr. President -- have you ever noticed
          how similar the Van Buren flatware is
          to the Buchanan flatware?

                    SHEPHERD
          Do you think there will ever come a
          time when you can stand in a room
          with me and not think of me as the
          President?

                    SYDNEY
          This isn't a state of mind. You are
          the President. And when I'm in a
          room with you, oval or any other
          shape, I'm always gonna be a
          lobbyist, and you'll always be the
          President.

                    SHEPHERD
          I got news for you, Sydney. As a
          lobbyist, you would never be alone in
          a room with the President.

     This last statement is not lost on SYDNEY.

     He moves toward her until they are both bathed in the
     moonlight. He puts his arms around her.

                    SYDNEY
          You think this is a good idea?

                    SHEPHERD
          Probably not.

     They lean in to kiss each other. They barely make contact
     when...

                    AGENT #3 (O.S.)
          Mr. President...

     An AGENT is standing in the doorway -- SHEPHERD and SYDNEY
     break apart.

                    AGENT #3
          We have a secure call from the sit-
          room.

     SHEPHERD knows what that means.

                    SHEPHERD
          Excuse me.

     He moves out the door and into the corridor.

     SYDNEY, knowing something's wrong, instinctively moves to
     follow him and be with him, but the AGENT hasn't moved from
     the doorway, so--

                    AGENT #3
          Sorry, ma'am.

                    SYDNEY
                  (beat)
          No...of course.

     SHEPHERD comes back in.

                    SHEPHERD
          Listen--

                    SYDNEY
          Is anything wrong?

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm sorry, we're going to have to cut
          our evening short. The Libyans have
          just bombed C-STAD. I'll try to call
          you tomorrow.
                  (to the AGENT)
          Can you show Ms. Wade out.

     SHEPHERD exits.

     SYDNEY, alone for a second in the dish room, is finally
     approached by a SECRET SERVICE AGENT, who starts to escort
     her out.

                    CHAIRMAN (V.O.)
          The response scenario's in place...

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

     SHEPHERD, A.J., the SECRETARY OF STATE, the SECRETARY OF
     DEFENSE, and about a dozen or so Pentagon, Security Council,
     and Joint Chiefs OFFICIALS are doing exactly what they're
     trained for.

                    CHAIRMAN
                  (continuing)
          ...The F-18's are fired up on the
          Kimitz and the Kitty Hawk. They're
          just waiting for your attack order,
          Mr. President.

                    SHEPHERD
          And we're gonna hit Libyan
          Intelligence Headquarters?

                    MAN
          The N.S.A. confirmed they're the ones
          who planned the bombing.


                    A.J.
          What's the estimate?

                    GENERAL
          We'll level the building.

                    SHEPHERD
          Libyan I.H.Q's in the middle of
          downtown Tripoli -- are we gonna hit
          anything else?

                    GENERAL
          Only if we miss.

                    SHEPHERD
          Are we gonna miss?

                    GENERAL
          No, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
          How many people work in that building?

                    CHAIRMAN
          We've been all through--

                    SHEPHERD
          How many people work in the damn
          building?

                    DEPUTY
          I've got those number here. There
          are three shifts, so it--

                    SHEPHERD
          The fewest. What shift puts the
          fewest people in the building? The
          night shift, right?

                    DEPUTY
          By far. Mostly custodial staff and
          a few--

                    SHEPHERD
          What time does the night crew go on?

                    DEPUTY
          They're on now, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
          A.J.?

                    A.J.
          It's immediate, it's decisive, it's
          low risk, and it's a proportional
          response.

                    SHEPHERD
          Someday somebody's going to have to
          explain to me the virtue of a
          proportional response.

     There's a SILENCE. SHEPHERD gets up and starts to head out
     the door.

                    CHAIRMAN
          Mr. President?

                    SHEPHERD
          Attack.
                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     SHEPHERD is with A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, KODAK and a couple of
     AIDES, all of whom look as though they've been called out of
     their homes in the middle of the night.

                    A.J.
          Robin, as soon as our planes have
          cleared Libyan airspace, you can call
          the press. I don't know when we'll
          have the full B.D.A.--

                    LEWIS
          General Rork says around O-Eight
          Hundred.

                    ROBIN
          Sir, what do you think about a
          national address?

                    SHEPHERD
          The last thing I want to do is put
          the Lybians center stage.

                    KODAK
          I think it's a great idea, sir. You
          know Rumson's gonna be talking about
          your lack of military service.

                    SHEPHERD
          This isn't about Rumson. What I did
          tonight was not about political gain.

                    KODAK
          But it can be, sir. What you did
          tonight was very presidential.

                    SHEPHERD
          Leon, somewhere in Libyan right now
          there's a janitor working the night
          shift at the Libyan Intelligence
          Headquarters. He's going about his
          job 'cause he has no idea that in
          about an hour he's gonna die in a
          massive explosion. He's just going
          about his job 'cause he has no idea
          that an hour ago I gave an order to
          have him killed. You just saw me do
          the least presidential thing I do.

                    KODAK
          yes, sir.

                    PRESS (V.O.)
          Mr. President...Mr. President!

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

     SHEPHERD is at the podium taking questions. He's flanked by
     his PENTAGON STAFF. A.J. and LEWIS stand to the side. ROBIN
     stands out of the way.

                    SALLY
          Is there anything at all about the
          C-STAD weapons system that could have
          been mistaken by Libyan Intelligence
          as offensive rather than defensive?

                    SHEPHERD
          No. We did everything but show them
          the blueprints. The hardware was
          sitting in a airplane hangar for a
          month. They didn't hit it until the

     American personnel got there. Leslie.

                    LESLIE
          Sir, there's an unconfirmed report
          that you were with Sydney Wade when
          you learned of the attack. Can you
          comment?

                    A.J.
                  (sotto to ROBIN)
          Get him off.

                    SHEPHERD
          Yes, we'd just finished dinner.

                    ROBIN
          Last question.

                    MARK
          Sir, would you care to comment on
          the status of your relationship?

                    SHEPHERD
          We don't have a relationship. We
          just had dinner.

                    CAROL
          Can you tell us if she spent the
          night at the White House or did--

                    SHEPHERD
          Folks, a lot of people got killed
          last night. Let's try to keep our
          eyes on the ball, okay?

     SHEPHERD is herded out of the briefing room amidst a chorus
     of "Mr. President" 's.

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. THE WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

     SHEPHERD walks away from the briefing room with ROBIN. JANIE
     joins him.

                    ROBIN
          That was my fault, sir. We should
          have prepped you for that.

                    SHEPHERD
          There's nothing that needs prepping.
          A.J., let's meet with the leadership
          after we meet with the Security
          Council.

                    ROBIN
          "Newsweek" is begging for ten minutes
          today. Any ten minutes you got.

                    SHEPHERD
          Nobody gets ten minutes today.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

     SHEPHERD sits at his desk, is on the phone. A TELEVISION
     NEWSCAST is doing a report on Congressional reaction to the
     events of the day. ROB RUMSON is talking.

                    SHEPHERD
          Lewis, tell the speaker to wait.
          I want to talk to him. No, I'll be
          right down.

                    RUMSON
          ...Last night, the price of his
          liberal programs was raised to
          include the blood of 22 American
          soldiers.

     He hangs up. On the TV, we see a quick sound bite from RUMSON.

                    RUMSON
          ...Mr. Shepherd's read a lot of
          books, but you didn't need a Harvard
          degree to see this comin' a mile down
          the road.

                    SHEPHERD
          I went to Stanford, you blowhole.

                    RUMSON
          The fat that our Commander-in-Chief
          has not served one day in uniform--

     SHEPHERD clicks off the TV and then stares at

     A SLIP OF PAPER THAT SAYS "SYDNEY"

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                    BETH (V.O.)
          This box just says "Miscellaneous."
          Is this bedroom miscellaneous or
          kitchen miscellaneous?

     INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     SYDNEY and BETH have been getting SYDNEY moved in. BETH is
     holding a carton.

                    BETH
          Sydney?

                    SYDNEY
          Why did I have to kiss him?

                    BETH
          You kissed him?

                    SYDNEY
          Yeah.

                    BETH
          You didn't' tell me that.

                    SYDNEY
          I kissed him.

                    BETH
          Where?

                    SYDNEY
          On the mouth.

                    BETH
                  (exasperated)
          Where in the White House?!

                    SYDNEY
          In the dish room.

                    BETH
          The dish room?

                    SYDNEY
          The China Room.

                    BETH
          Then what happened?

                    SYDNEY
          He had to go and attack Libya.

                    BETH
          It's always something.

                    SYDNEY
          I've gotta nip this in the bud. This
          has catastrophe written all over it.

                    BETH
          In what language?! Sydney, this man
          is the leader of the free world.
          He's brilliant, he's funny, he's
          handsome, and he's an above-average
          dancer. Isn't it possible our
          standards are just a tad high?

     The PHONE RINGS--

     SYDNEY freezes.

     The PHONE RINGS again.

                    BETH
                  (continuing)
          Answer the phone.

                    SYDNEY
          It's him.

                    BETH
          Answer the phone.

                    SYDNEY
          He's gonna ask me to come over
          there.

                    BETH
          Answer the phone.

                    SYDNEY
          I don't want to go over there.

                    BETH
          Answer the phone.

                    SYDNEY

     All right. But I'm gonna end it
          on the phone. I'm not gonna go
          over there.
                                                        CUT TO:

     INT. SHEPHERD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     SHEPHERD opens his door, revealing SYDNEY. Agent COOPER is
     letting her in.

                    SYDNEY
          I just came over here to tell you
          why I can't see you anymore.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to COOPER)
          Thanks, Coop.

     SHEPHERD closes the door.

                    SYDNEY
          Look, I know you've had a tough
          day.

                    SHEPHERD
          Not as tough as some. You want a
          drink? Lemme take your coat.

     But SYDNEY doesn't take her coat off.

                    SYDNEY
          Mr. President, this isn't gonna work.

                    SHEPHERD
          Sure it will. You button the top
          button, and it doesn't fall off
          the hanger.


                    SYDNEY
          That's not what I...

                    SHEPHERD
          I didn't think so. Listen...

                    SYDNEY
          I've really enjoyed the time we've
          spent together, but this has
          catastrophe written all over it.
          Please, Mr. President, don't pursue
          me outside the political arena.

                    SHEPHERD
          Well, I have no intention of pursuing
          you inside the political arena, so
          that leaves everything out, and
          that's unacceptable to me.

                    SYDNEY
          If I were on your staff, I would tell
          you that the absolute worst thing you
          can do coming into an election year
          is to open yourself up to character
          attacks, and the fastest way to do
          that is to prance around like the
          playboy of the Western world.

                    SHEPHERD
          Let's clear up a couple of things.
          Number 1: I seldom prance.
          Number 2: I have no intention of
          engaging in a character debate, and
          Number 3: You're not on my staff.

                    SYDNEY
          Yes, of course, but if you'll follow
          the immutable--

                    SHEPHERD
          Why is that, by the way?

                    SYDNEY
          Why's that?

                    SHEPHERD
          Why aren't you on my staff?

                    SYDNEY
          You can't afford me.

                    SHEPHERD
          How much do you make?

                    SYDNEY
          More than you do, Mr. President.

                    SHEPHERD
          The name's Andy. How much money do
          you make?

                    SYDNEY
          What the hell does it matter how
          much money I--

                    SHEPHERD
          You would raise your voice to the
          President?

                    SYDNEY
          I'm only thinking about the health
          of your Presidency. You think this
          morning's press conference was the
          end of it? Bob Rumson's gotta be
          drooling over this.

                    SHEPHERD
          Are you attracted to me?

                    SYDNEY
          I beg your pardon?

                    SHEPHERD
          I asked if--

                    SYDNEY
                   (of course she is)
          That's not the issue--

                    SHEPHERD
          Well, I tell you what. Let's make
          it the issue. Let's try something
          new, 'cause I know that most couples,
          when they're first getting together,
          are inclined to slam on the brakes
          because they're concerned about Bob
          Rumson's drool.

                    SYDNEY
          You're not most people.

                    SHEPHERD
          You know what your problem is?

                    SYDNEY
          What's my problem?

                    SHEPHERD
          Sex and nervousness.

                    SYDNEY
          Sex and nervousness is my problem.

                    SHEPHERD
          Yes. Last night when we were
          looking at the different place
          settings in the dish room, I
          realized that those place settings
          were provided by the First Ladies.
          And I'll bet none of those First
          Ladies were nervous about having
          sex with their President husbands.
          And you know why?

                    SYDNEY
          No, but I'm sure you'll explain it
          to me.

                    SHEPHERD
          I will. Because they weren't
          presidents when they met them. Not
          the case here.

                    SYDNEY
          Ahhhhhh.

                    SHEPHERD
          You see what I'm getting at?

                    SYDNEY
          Yes. May I use your bathroom for a
          moment?

                    SHEPHERD
          Sure. It's right through there.

                    SYDNEY
          I want to freshen up.

                    SHEPHERD
          As you pass through, you'll see a
          large closet on your left. And if
          you feel comfortable, hang up your
          coat, and when you come back I'll
          have fixed up a drink, we'll sit on
          the couch, and I will explain to
          you my plan.

                    SYDNEY
          You have a plan? Don't make me
          wait. You're on a roll.

     SYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOM/DRESSING ROOM area.
     SHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a
     couple of drinks.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (speaking up)
          Okay. You're attracted to me, but
          the idea of physical intimacy is
          uncomfortable because you only know
          me as the President. It's not always
          gonna be that way, and the reason I
          know that is because there was a
          moment last night when you were with
          me and not the President, and I know
          what a big step that was for you.
          So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's
          my plan: We're gonna slow down.
          When you're comfortable, that's
          when it'll happen.

     SYDNEY comes back into the room...she's wearing one of
     SHEPHERD's dress shirts and nothing else. She walks toward
     him.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          Perhaps I didn't properly explain
          the fundamentals of the "Slow Down"
          plan.

                    SYDNEY
          You explained it great.

     She moves closer to him.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (pause)
          Are you nervous?

                    SYDNEY
          No.

                    SHEPHERD
          Good. My nervousness exists on
          several levels. Number 1 -- and
          this is in no particular order --
          I haven't done this in a pretty
          long time. Number 2: Any expectations
          you might have, due to the fact that
          I'm, you know...

                    SYDNEY
          The most powerful man in the world?

                    SHEPHERD
          Exactly, thank you. Just so you
          remember that's a political
          distinction that comes with the
          office. I mean, if Eisenhower were
          here instead of me he'd be dead by
          now. And number three...

                    SYDNEY
                  (gently)
          Andy...

     They're both standing, facing each other...

     They gently kiss. They just stay with it until it becomes
     easier and better and exactly what they want.

                    RUMSON (V.O.)
          Does New Hampshire want traditional
          American values back in the White
          House?

                    CROWD
          Yes!!

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. AN ELKS LODGE - NIGHT

     A crowd of 300 or so is being whipped into a frenzy.
     Rumson's bringing it home under a campaign banner
     proclaiming: THE PRIDE IS BACK -- BOB RUMSON.

                    RUMSON
          Does New Hampshire want the pride back?

     The CROWD goes nuts upon hearing Rumson's signature phrase--

                    CROWD
          Yeah!!!!!!!

                    RUMSON
          My name is Bob Rumson. And I'm
          running for President.

     And as the CROWD loses its mind, we

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. SHEPHERD'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     It is very early, and SHEPHERD is still asleep. As we PULL
     BACK, WE REVEAL that he is alone in his bed. The PHONE RINGS.

     SHEPHERD picks it up--

                    SHEPHERD
                  (into phone)
          Yeah...put him through.
                  (listens)
          Lewis, it is 5:00 a.m. You gotta
          get yourself a life, man.
                  (listens)
          Yeah...all right.

     He hangs up the phone and looks around the room, only to
     notice SYDNEY is tiptoeing around in the dim light, trying
     to quietly dress herself and gather up her things. SHEPHERD
     watches this odd spectacle for a moment before he says--

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          Sydney?

     SYDNEY turns around.

                    SYDNEY
          Hi.

                    SHEPHERD
          What are you doing?

                    SYDNEY
          I wanted to leave the building before
          the press corps got here.

                    SHEPHERD
          I have those same thoughts every day
          of my life. Say, you know Lewis
          Rothschild, don't you? Well, he's...

                    SYDNEY
          Sure. Boy, Lewis'd go nuts if he
          knew I'd spent the night.

     There's a KNOCK on the door.

                    SHEPHERD
          ...on his way up.

                    SYDNEY
          What?

                    SHEPHERD
          Come on in, Lewis.

     LEWIS comes in--

                    LEWIS
          'Morning, Mr. President. Hi, Sydney.

                    SYDNEY
          Hi, Lewis. Well, Mr. President,
          thank you for taking the time to go
          over those fossil fuel numbers. I'll
          just get my coat, and be on my way.

     SHEPHERD laughs at SYDNEY's purposely lame try--

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to LEWIS)
          What's the situation?

                    LEWIS
          They're camped out at every exit.

                    SYDNEY
          Who? Who's camped out?

                    LEWIS
          The press.

                    SYDNEY
          The press is camped out?

                    LEWIS
          You shoulda taken a cab, Sydney.

                    SYDNEY
          They know my car?!

     ROBIN enters.

                    ROBIN
          Good morning, Mr. President. Hi,
          Sydney. I came over as soon as Lewis
          called.

                    SHEPHERD
          Thank God.

                    ROBIN
          I think the important thing is not
          to make it look like we're panicking.

                    SHEPHERD
          See, and I think the important thing
          is actually not to be panicking.

     A.J. KNOCKS on the open door and walks in.

                    A.J.
          Good morning, Mr. President. Good
          morning, Ms. Wade. I see everyone's
          getting an early start today.

                    LEWIS
          How do we exit Sydney from the
          building and what do we say to the
          press at that point?

                    ROBIN
          We need a diversion.

                    SYDNEY
          A diversion.

                    ROBIN
          You understand that by diversion
          I'm not saying we set the White
          House on fire.

                    SHEPHERD
          No, please, let's do.

                    LEWIS
          Can I state very clearly that I
          can't be party to anything illegal.

                    A.J.
          Good for you, Lewis.

                    LEWIS
          Say what you want, but it's always
          the guy in my job that ends up doing
          eighteen months in Danbury Minimum
          Security Prison.

                    SHEPHERD
          Rest easy, Lewis. We're not creating
          a diversion.

                    ROBIN
          No diversion.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to SYDNEY)
          We'll have somebody take you home.

                    A.J.
          Esther's over in my office. She's
          got the station wagon outside.

     SHEPHERD regards A.J. for a moment...clearly the man planned
     ahead.

                    LEWIS
          Okay. Good. Now, the press
          statement.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to SYDNEY)
          Sydney, when you leave here, you're
          gonna run into reporters and
          photographers. Your picture's gonna
          be taken every day, and you're gonna
          be asked questions every day. Answer
          them, don't answer them -- it's
          entirely up to you. The White House
          has no official position except to
          say "no comment."

                    ROBIN
          No comment?

                    SHEPHERD
          The White House doesn't comment on
          the President's personal life.

                    LEWIS
          We can't just leave it at that, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
          I tell you what, Lewis, we just did.

                    LEWIS
          But, sir...

                    A.J.
                  (the meeting's over)
          Thank you, Mr. President.

     LEWIS, ROBIN and A.J. say their "Thank you, Mr. President"'s
     on the way out ...

                    A.J.
                  (continuing)
          Sydney. Esther'll be in my office.
          You take your time.

                    SYDNEY
          Thanks, A.J.

     A.J. leaves...

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm sorry about all this. We'll do
          it better next time.

                    SYDNEY
          I'm no expert, but I thought we did
          it pretty good this time.

                    SHEPHERD
          No, I mean...

                    SYDNEY
          I know. I had a good time.

                    SHEPHERD
          Me, too. I'll call you. I'll be in
          Panama, but I'll call you.

                    SYDNEY
          I'd like that.

     SYDNEY gives him a good-bye kiss...

                    SYDNEY
                  (continuing)
          Bye.

     She exits the bedroom.

                    SHEPHERD
          All right...okay...this is good.

                    RUMSON
                  (continuing)
          What do you got for me, Stu?

                    STU
          Call me Santa Claus, Senator.

     Several TOP AIDES join this slightly confidential conversation.

                    STU
                  (continuing)
          She's got an FBI file.

                    RUMSON
          Shit, Stu, my mother's got an FBI
          file.

     RUMSON starts to walk away when STU pulls an 8$B!_(J10 photo from
     the manila folder.

                    STU
          I've got art.

     RUMSON comes back. STU hands him the photo.

                    STU
          It's a demonstration outside the
          Department of Commerce. The
          picture's old, and a lot of the faces
          are obscured by the smoke, but this
          is Sydney right there in front.

                    RUMSON
                  (staring at the photo)
          Oh man...tell me the smoke is coming
          from what it looks like it's coming
          from.

                    STU
          Yes, sir -- it's burning flag.

     RUMSON gives it one last look, passes it back to STU, and
     turns back to his phone.

                    RUMSON

     A few more young INTERNS have been added, and most are hard
     at work on the phones -- ("___ from the Global Defense
     Council. We're encouraging voters in your area to phone or
     write your Congressman regarding...etc.")

     The tote board now reads "11 Votes in 42 Days." David is
     supervising things while SYDNEY is trying to lose her
     patience on the phone.

                    SYDNEY
                  (into phone)
          I understand, Congressman...Of
          course you need to deliberate.
          I know the fact that there isn't
          any heavy industry in your district
          doesn't make this decision any
          easier. But we met three weeks ago,
          and at the end of that meeting you
          said that you were leaning our way
          but that you wanted to sleep on it.
          Since I haven't heard from you since
          then, the only conclusion I can
          reach is that you haven't slept in
          21 days.

                    DAVID
                  (to SYDNEY)
          Ask him about his position on
          stateboard for Hawaii.

     SYDNEY wads up some paper and flings it at David to shut him
     up.

                    SYDNEY
                  (into phone)
          Harry, think like a father for a

          kids to be able to take a deep
          breath when they're 30? Thank you.
          You're doing the right thing.

     She hangs up.

          How's this?

                    SYDNEY

     Everyone gets back to work as SYDNEY and DAVID speak among

          Hey, Syd, I saw on your schedule
          you're gonna meet with McSorley,
          McCluskey and Shane.

                    SYDNEY
          Yeah, the Motown Three said they'd
          give me 30 minutes next week.

                    DAVID
          Sydney, these are people who
          represent people who make cars for
          a living.

                    SYDNEY
          Yeah.

                    DAVID
          Cars, you understand, run on gasoline.

                    SYDNEY
          Hey, I know it's a long shot, but if
          I can get one of them, it'll be a
          huge payoff in visibility.

                    DAVID
          Well, if we're gonna try, we should
          do some prep work. You wanna order
          in?

                    SYDNEY
          I can't work tonight. I'm having
          dinner at the White House. We can
          start early tomorrow.

                    DAVID
          Okay. I'm having lunch at the

          types on the street. I mean, how
          much pull can one lobby--

     JANIE catches SHEPHERD's eye and makes a subtle gesture to
     her wristwatch.

          Let me see if I've got this: The
          third story on the news tonight was
          that someone I didn't know 13 years
          ago, when I wasn't President,
          participated in a demonstration where
          no laws were being broken in protest
          of something that so many people were
          against it doesn't exist anymore?
                  (beat)
          Just out of curiosity, what was the
          fourth story?

                    LEWIS
          See, I think it's important, when we
          deal with it, that we--

                    SHEPHERD
          Don't deal with it.

          Excuse me?

                    SHEPHERD
          They're trying to get us to swing at
          a pitch in the dirt. No one ever
          wins these fights. It'll go away.

                    LEWIS

          Never mind that the President takes
          the Fifth anytime a reporter has the
          temerity to ask a question about a
          woman in a position to exert enormous
          influence over a huge range of issues.

          Never mind that this woman's idea of
          how to unwind at the end of a tough

          Doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital

          excellent health.

          Who cares? Let's see some scores.

                    NEWS ANCHOR #2
                  (on T.V.)
          While the President spent the day at
          Camp David, G.O.P. presidential
          hopeful Robert Rumson continued his
          attacks on President Shepherd's
          character. During the Saturday
          morning news program Capitol
          Review with Kenneth Michaels,
          Senator Rumson suggested that GDC
          political director Sydney Ellen Wade,
          whose personal relationship with the
          President has been causing the White
          House headaches over the past two
          months, may have traded sexual favors
          for key votes in the Virginia State
          Legislature while lobbying for the
          Virginia Teachers Association.

     The NEWS PROGRAM goes to the segment showing RUMSON and
     MICHAELS on that morning's show. SHEPHERD and SYDNEY sit and
     watch...knowing they're about to take a punch...powerless to
     stop it...

                  (on T.V.)
          I'm not saying--

                    MICHAELS
                  (on T.V.)
          --'cause that's a heck of an

          I'm not making an acc-- let me be
          very clear. I'm not making an accusation.
          I am saying when we hear one thing,
          we dismiss it. We hear two, we dismiss it.
          But when several, several well-

          You gotta tell him to turn a deaf ear.

          My father doesn't have a deaf ear.
          He hears fine out of both. So do I.
          So does my sister, so do my friends.
          You're the only one who seems to--

          Sydney, I can't challenge the school
          bully to a fight just because he
          picked on my girlfriend.

                    SYDNEY
          I'm not asking you to. I can take
          care of myself. This isn't about me.
          How can you keep quiet? How do you
          have patience for people who claim
          they love America but clearly can't
          stand Americans?

                    SHEPHERD
          I have one more election left, Sydney.
          I don't have the luxury of losing my
          patience.

                    SYDNEY
          I want to say something, but I'm
          gonna fumble it a little bit, so I'd
          just like you to wait till I'm done
          before you respond. I'm in love with
          you. I'm certain of it. And I want to
          be with you more than anything. But
          maybe things would be better for you
          if I disappeared for a while.

                    SHEPHERD
          Things will be better when I pass a
          crime bill. And Sydney, if you
          disappeared, I'd find you.

          You're in good company. I sat with
          'em a week ago. They told me there
          was nothing on the President's
          domestic agenda they were more
          committed to defeating than the crime
          bill.

                    SYDNEY
          Well, congratulations, fellas, you're
          outta the cellar. McSorley told me
          the only thing on the President's
          domestic agenda they were more
          committed to defeating than the crime
          bill was the fossil fuel package.

     This catches SHEPHERD and A.J. by surprise--like accidentally
     drawing to an inside straight.

                    A.J.
          You're kidding, right?


     SYDNEY isn't aware she's said anything of particular
     consequence.

                    SYDNEY
          No, I'm not kidding. It's funny that
          he used the same words.

     A.J. and SHEPHERD are trying to study the situation without
     giving anything away.

                    A.J.
          Yeah...

                    SHEPHERD
          I don't think the Pep Boys know too
          many words.

                    SYDNEY
          I'm gonna get a drink and shake this
          off. When I come back, I'll have
          Christmas spirit.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (beat)
          Okay.

                    SYDNEY
          Is something wrong?

                    SHEPHERD
          No, I was...I was thinking about--
          nothing.

                    SYDNEY
          I'll be back in a minute.

     She goes off.

                    A.J.
          Did what I think just happened, just
          happen? Did the GDC's political
          director just tell the President and
          the White House Chief of Staff that
          there are three votes on the crime
          bill that can be bought by stickin'
          the fossil fuel package in a drawer.

                    SHEPHERD
          No, the GDC's political director
          didn't tell us anything. Sydney Wade
          told her boyfriend and her
          boyfriend's best friend that she had
          a lousy day.

                    A.J.
          It doesn't change the facts, Mr.
          President. If Sydney gets her 24
          votes and we're three short, there's
          some maneuvering to be done.

                    SHEPHERD
          I made a promise, A.J.

                    A.J.
          You made a deal, Mr. President.

                    SHEPHERD
          I made it with Sydney.

                    A.J.
          You made it with the GDC.

                    SHEPHERD
          Yeah, well, this is all academic
          anyway. We're not going to need
          those votes.

                    A.J.
          If your approval rating drops any
          more, things are gonna get tight.

          The bill isn't the issue, fellas.

                    SYDNEY
                  (taking his bowl)
          Tons. I didn't think you liked it.

                    SHEPHERD
          Are you kidding me, of course I did.
          But actually it's not for me. The
          agent who checked the food thought
          it was delicious, and I sort of told
          him I'd bring him some if there was
          any left.

                    SYDNEY
          So you didn't like it.

          No, I loved it.

          Two days before I met you. You
          gave a speech for the Daughters
          of the American Revolution. I was
          there.

          You were?

                    SYDNEY
          You remember the speech?

          "American can no longer afford to
          pretend that they live in a great

          Ah.

                    SYDNEY
          There was supposed to be something
          else after that, wasn't there?

          I told you. The face.

     SYDNEY hands him a glass. They clink glasses and sip.

          Wow...what's the occasion?

                    SYDNEY
          You're looking at a lady who's two

          give you the three votes.

          And we declare victory, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
          We said as a last resort.

                    KODAK
          We're there, sir. The State of the
          Union is 48 hours away.

                    SHEPHERD
          No. Come on. There's gotta be three
          votes someplace else.

                    KODAK
          There isn't.

                    SHEPHERD
          Bullshit, Leon. There's gotta be
          somebody we haven't--

                    KODAK
          There isn't, sir.

                    SHEPHERD
          Storch.

                    KODAK
          I beg your pardon?

                    SHEPHERD
          What about Storch?

          Mr. President--

                    KODAK
          Storch is a "no."

          Wagner.

          No.

          Sobel.

                    KODAK
          No.

          No.

     SHEPHERD is stopped.

                    A.J.
          Mr. President, I think we have to
          do it.

                    SHEPHERD
          She is one vote away, A.J. It's
          important legislation that for the
          first time has a legitimate chance.
           I think she deserves every possible
          opportunity to--

                    LEWIS
          She? You meant "it," didn't you,
          sir? You meant the "important
          legislation" deserves every
          opportunity.

                    A.J.
          Lewis, shut up.

     There's a horrible silence in the room. SHEPHERD has locked
     eyes with LEWIS.

                    SHEPHERD
          You got something to say to me?

                    LEWIS
          Respectfully, sir. I think we should
          examine the new poll for more than
          its value as a box score.

                    SHEPHERD
          Examine what? They don't like that
          I'm going out with Sydney.

                    LEWIS
          It's not that simple, sir. I think
          this poll helps bribg a murky problem
          into specific relief.

                    SHEPHERD
          Whose problem we talking about,
          Lewis? Yours? You worried about
          your job? This poll isn't talking
          about my Presidency. This poll is
          talking about my life. Two hundred
          and sixty-four million people have
          decided--

                    LEWIS
          Mr. President, two hundred and sixty-
          four million people don't give a damn
          about your life. They give a damn about
          their own.

                    A.J.
          All right, that's enough.

                    LEWIS
          Mr. President, you've raised a
          daughter almost entirely on your own,
          and she's terrific. What does it say
          to you that in the last seven weeks,
          59 percent of this country has begun
          to question your family values?

                    A.J.
          The President doesn't answer to you,
          Lewis.

                    LEWIS
          Oh yes, he does, A.J.  I'm a citizen,
          this is my president, and in this
          country it is not only permissible to
          question our leaders, it is our
          responsibility. But you already know
          that, Mr. President, because you have
          a deeper love of this country than
          any man I've ever known, and I want
          to know what it says to you that in
          the past seven weeks 59 percent of
          Americans have begun to question your
          patriotism?

                    SHEPHERD
          Look, if people want to listen to Bob
          Rumson--

                    LEWIS
          They don't have a choice! Rob
          Rumson's the only one doing the
          talking. People want leadership.
          And in the absence of genuine
          leadership, they will listen to
          anyone who steps up to the
          microphone. They want leadership,
          Mr. President. They're so thirsty
          for it, they'll crawl through the
          desert toward a mirage, and when
          they discover there's no water,
          they'll drink the sand.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (evenly)
          Lewis, we've had Presidents who were
          beloved, who couldn't find a coherent
          sentence with two hands and a
          flashlight. People don't drink the
          sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis.
          They drink it 'cause they don't know
          the difference.

     The room is slightly stunned by what their President has just
     said.

     SHEPHERD picks up the polling data and heads to the door...

     SYDNEY, SUSAN, DAVID, INTERNS and STAFFERS are having a
     little office celebration. Champagne flows from paper cups.
     Streamers and balloons adorn the tote board, which reads 0
     Votes in 1 Day.

     SUSAN, maybe a little drunk, has concerned SYDNEY.

                    SUSAN
          I want to go on the record and
          apologize for my attitude toward you
          since your arrival.

                    SYDNEY
          I didn't notice. Was there an
          attitude?

     A PHONE RINGS, and one of the staffers takes it. SYDNEY
     tries to rejoin the party, but--

                    SUSAN
          I think I have a lot of pent-up
          hostility.

                    SYDNEY
          Well--

                    SUSAN
          I wonder who I can blame it on.

                    SYDNEY
          I'm not really qualified to--

                    SUSAN
          'Cause I've been blaming it on my
          mother and my ex-husband, and that
          hasn't been working.

                    DAVID

          Leo needs to see you.

                    SYDNEY
          Tell him to get over here. It's a
          party.

                    DAVID
          He needs to see you in his office.

                    SYDNEY
          It can't wait?

                    DAVID
          He just got off the phone with
          MacInerney. There's been a
          development.

     SYDNEY is going through the closet in search of something.
     The door opens, and SHEPHERD steps in, perhaps a little
     tentatively. He doesn't see SYDNEY at first.

          Syd?

     SYDNEY comes out.

          Have you seen a gray cableknit
          sweater?

                    SHEPHERD
          A grey...sweater? No. I called
          you at the office, but...

                    SYDNEY
          It's Beth's. I wore it here one
          time, and I didn't want to leave
          it.

                    SHEPHERD
          Where were you going?

     SYDNEY continues her search.

                    SYDNEY
          I'm going home, and then I'm going
          to Hartford.

                    SHEPHERD
          Connecticut?

                    SYDNEY
          Yes. Do you know if it was sent with
          your dry cleaning by any--

                    SHEPHERD
          What's in Connecticut?

                    SYDNEY
          Richard Reynolds' campaign. He may
          be able to get me a job.

                    SHEPHERD
          When did you decide to get a new job?

                    SYDNEY
          Not long after Leo Solomon fired me
          from my old one. Beth's gonna kill
          me. She loves that--

                    SHEPHERD
          Why did he fire you?

                    SYDNEY
          Total failure to achieve any of the
          objectives for which I was hired. I
          told him he was being unreasonable.
          After all, I did get to dance with
          the President and ride in Air Force
          One a couple of times. But you know
          those prickly environmentalists.
          It's always gonna be something with
          them. If it's not clean air, then
          it's clean water. Like it isn't good
          enough that I'm on the cover of
          People Magazine.

                    SHEPHERD
          I'll call him.

                    SYDNEY
          You'll call him? You mean you'll
          call him yourself? Personally?
          It'll come from the President?
          That's a great idea. I think you
          should call Leo and make a deal. He
          hires me back for, say, 72 days. I
          go around scaring the hell out of
          Congress, making them think that the
          President's about to drive through a
          very damaging and costly bill.
          They'll believe me, right, 'cause I'm
          the President's Friday Night Girl.
          Now I don't know if you can dip into
          this well twice, especially since
          I've lost all credibility in politics,
          but you never know, I might just be
          able to pull it off again. I might
          be able to give you just the leverage
          you need to pass some ground-breaking
          piece of crime legislation -- like a
          mandatory three-day waiting period
          before a five-year-old can buy an Uzi.
          Fuck the sweater -- she'll have to
          learn to live with disappointment.

     She stops.

                    SYDNEY
          I know exactly what went on here
          today. I got screwed. You saw the
          poll, you needed the crime bill,
          you couldn't get it on your own,
          so I got screwed.

                    SHEPHERD

          The environment got screwed. Nothing
          happened to you today, Sydney.
          Governing is choosing. Governing is
          prioritizing. I've made no secret of
          the fact that the crime bill was my
          top priority.

                    SYDNEY
          Well then, congratulations. It's
          only taken you three years to put
          together crime prevention legislation
          that has no hope of preventing crime.

          Don't--

                    A.J.
          You fight the fights that need
          fighting!

                    SHEPHERD
          Is the view pretty good from the
          cheap seats, A.J.?

                    A.J.
          I beg your pardon.

                    SHEPHERD
          It occurs to me that in 25 years I've
          never seen your name on a ballot.
          Why have you always been standing a
          pace behind me?

                    A.J.
          Because if I hadn't been, you'd be
          the most popular history professor
          at the University of Wisconsin.

                    SHEPHERD
          Fuck you.

     SHEPHERD's tossed his cue stick and is heading out...

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          Have Lewis put the final drafts of
          the State of the Union and the Crime
          Bill announcement on my desk in the
          morning.

                    A.J.
          Yes, sir.

     SHEPHERD gets to the doorway...stops...turns around...

                    SHEPHERD
          If Mary hadn't died...would we have
          won three years ago?

                    A.J.
          Would we have won?

                    SHEPHERD
          If we'd had to go through a character
          debate three years ago, would we have
          won?

                    A.J.
          I don't know. But I would've liked
          that campaign. If my friend Andy
          Shepherd had shown up, I would have
          liked that campaign.

     SHEPHERD looks away...nods absently...

                    SHEPHERD
                  (pause)
          Yeah.

     SHEPHERD exits, leaving A.J. alone as we

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     A series of shots showing SHEPHERD walking down the corridor
     to the dish room, then walking down a long corridor which
     contains a series of paintings of various presidents. Then
     sitting alone in the Oval Office, lost in thought...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. RESIDENCE DINING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

     SHEPHERD and LUCY are eating breakfast in silence, neither of
     them very happy, each with their own problems. A nearby T.V.
     MONITOR glows with the live coverage of ROBIN's morning press
     briefing.

     Finally...

                    SHEPHERD
          You're not hungry?

                    LUCY
          This is oatmeal.

                    SHEPHERD
          Yeah.

                    LUCY
          We never have oatmeal.

                    SHEPHERD
          It's good for you.

                    LUCY
          I'm from Wisconsin. I need food.

                    SHEPHERD
          You're not from Wisconsin. I'm from
          Wisconsin. You've lived in
          Washington your whole life.

     He glances toward the T.V. screen. ROBIN's standing up there
     doing what she's been told: "No comment...No, this President
     is not participating in character debates..." He mutes the
     volume.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          How are you doing in your
          Constitutional debates?

                    LUCY
          We're done.

                    SHEPHERD
          You're done?

                    LUCY
          We ratified it last week.

                    SHEPHERD
          Oh...well...that's good. Why didn't
          you tell me?

                    LUCY
          It's not a big deal, Dad.

                    SHEPHERD
          Okay, I give up. I don't care why
          you're not happy in social studies.
          I care about why you're not talking
          to me about why you're not happy in
          social studies.

                    LUCY
          Dad, I'm perfectly--

                    SHEPHERD
          You're not perfectly happy. You
          don't think I know when something's
          bothering you?

                    LUCY
          Damnit, Dad!

                    SHEPHERD
          Hey!

                    LUCY
          You know--

                    SHEPHERD
          Talk to me.

                    LUCY
          Look--

     LUCY winds herself up. It would appear she's about to burst.
     She's about to say the hardest thing she's ever had to say in
     her life--

                    LUCY
                  (continuing)
          --sometimes when you talk, you say
          things I disagree with.

     SHEPHERD is stunned and totally confused...

                    SHEPHERD
          Almost every time I talk, I say
          things you disagree with.

                    LUCY
          I mean politically.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (pause)
          Politically?

                    LUCY
          Yes.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (pause)
          What do you mean?

     It just starts spilling out in a stream--

                    LUCY
          Yes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean,
          I'm not sure. You know a lot more
          than I do -- but still, I have these
          feelings, and I don't think they're
          wrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm
          not so sure it's all right to burn a
          flag. I mean, it really bothers a lot
          of people, and I don't know why you
          think it's okay. I hear Senator
          Rumson talk, and some of the things
          he says sounds right to me, and I
          think, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?!
          I mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad
          hates this guy!
          Why am I agreeing with him" And then
          I think, "Well, maybe I'm not really
          like Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not
          like Dad either." But the point is
          I'm the President's kid, and people
          pay attention to what I say, and if
          I say something different from what
          you say, it'll be embarrassing for
          you. So I can't just get up in social
          studies class and say whatever I want.

     SHEPHERD is silent...totally blown away...he had absolutely
     no idea...

     He stands up slowly and moves toward her...LUCY doesn't know
     what's coming...

                    SHEPHERD
                  (quietly)
          Stand up please.

     LUCY gets up slowly...

     She's never seen her father like this...

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          I want you to pay very close
          attention to what happens now.

     SHEPHERD knees down, cups her daughter's face in his hands,
     and gently kisses her forehead. He pulls her to him and
     holds her in a tight embrace...

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          In your  lifetime, you will never
          embarrass me. It could never happen.
          You're not the President's daughter,
          Lucy, you're mine.
          And no one's gonna vote me out of
          that job. You're my daughter, and
          everything else is a distant second.
                  (more)
          School is for you, Lucy. You say
          what you want. The only thing you
          have to do to make me happy is
          come home at the end of the day.

     LUCY squeezes her dad tight...they hold the embrace for a
     long moment.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          One more thing. I don't dislike
          Senator Rumson because of his
          political views. And even if you
          voted for everything he would vote
          for, that wouldn't make you like him.
          There's a fundamental difference
     between you and the Bob Rumsons of
          the world.

                    LUCY
          What's that?

                    SHEPHERD
          The difference is that he says he
          loves America. Saying you love
          America is easy. What takes
          character -- and this is what you
          have--

     SHEPHERD trails off, realizing he's about to quote Sydney...

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          What takes character is loving
          Americans.
                  (beat)

     And now it's as if SHEPHERD is waking himself up from the
     longest trip of his life...

     ...he looks over at the T.V. monitor..."No comment"...
     "No, I don't know how many other ways I can say it. The
     White House isn't getting involved in..."

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          Luce, I gotta go.

                    LUCY
          Dad, is everything all right?

                    SHEPHERD
          Everything's fine. I'm just a little
          late for work.

     He heads for the door, shouting out as he goes--

                    SHEPHERD
          Somebody get my daughter some food!
          The girl's from Wisconsin, for cryin'
          out loud!

     And he's gone as we...

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. THE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

     ROBIN is on her last drops of energy and patience.

                    REPORTER #4
          Robin, will the President ever
          respond to Senator Rumson's
          question about being a member of
          the American Civil Liberties Union?

     But instead of hands going up, the PRESS CORPS suddenly
     stands. ROBIN turns to see SHEPHERD stride in and step up to
     the podium.

                    SHEPHERD
          Yes, he will. 'Morning.

                    ROBIN
          Good morning, Mr. President.

     SHEPHERD takes the podium. There's a palpable BUZZ in the
     room as video operators adjust their equipment, etc. People
     starts to stand.

                    SHEPHERD
          That's all right, you can keep your
          seats. For the last couple of
          months, Senator Rumson has suggested
          that being president of this country
          was, to a certain extent, about
          character...

     ANGLE - ROBIN

     who's picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in
     four numbers.

     She turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the
     rest of the room.

                    ROBIN
                  (into phone)
          Lewis...call A.J. and come on down
          here...I don't know, but
          something's happening.

                    SHEPHERD
          ...and although I have not been
          willing to engage in his attacks on
          me, I've been here three years and
          three days, and I can tell you
          without hesitation: Being President
          of this country is entirely about
          character.

     LEWIS enters with A.J. and KODAK.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          For the record: Yes, I am a card-
          carrying member of the A.C.L.U. But
          the more important question is why
          aren't you, Bob? This is an
          organization whose sole purpose is to
          defend the Bill of Rights, so it
          naturally begs the questions.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          Why would a senator, his party's most
          powerful spokesman and a candidate
          for president, choose to reject
          upholding the Constitution? If you
          can answer that question, then,
          folks, you're smarter than I am,
          because I didn't understand it until
          a couple of minutes ago. Everybody
          knows American isn't easy. America is
          advanced citizenship.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's
          gonna put up a fight. It's gonna
          say, "You want free speech? Let's
          see you acknowledge a man whose words
          make your blood boil, who's standing
          center stage and advocating, at the
          top of his lungs, that which you
          would spend a lifetime opposing at the
          top of yours. You want to claim
          this land as the land of the free,
          then the symbol of your country can't
          just be a flag; the symbol also has
          to be one of its citizens exercising
          his right to burn that flag in
          protest." Show me that, defend that,
          celebrate that in your classrooms.
          Then you can stand up and sing about
          the land of the free. I've known Bob
          Rumson for years. I've been operating
          under the assumption that the reason
          Bob devotes so much time and energy to
          shouting at the rain was that he simply
          didn't get it. Well, I was wrong.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't
          get it. Bob's problem is that he
          can't sell it. Nobody has ever won
          an election by talking about what I
          was just talking about.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          This is a country made up of people
          with hard jobs that they're terrified
          of losing. The roots of freedom are
          of little or no interest to them at
          the moment. We are a nation afraid
          to go out at night. We're a society
          that has assigned low priority to
          education and has looked the other
          way while our public schools have
          been decimated. We have serious
          problems to solve, and we need
          serious men to solve them. And
          whatever your particular problem is,
          friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is
          not the least bit interested in
          solving it. He is interested in two
          things and two things only: Making
          you afraid of it and telling you
          who's to blame for it. That, ladies
          and gentlemen, is how you win
          elections. You gather a group of
          middle-aged, middle-class, middle-
          income voters who remember with
          longing an easier time, and you talk
          to them about family and American
          values and personal character. Then
          you have an old photo of the
          President's girlfriend. You scream
          about patriotism and you tell them
          she's to blame for their lot in life,
          you go on television and you call her
          a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done
          nothing to you, Bob. She has done
          nothing but put herself through law
          school, prosecute criminals for five
          years, represent the interests of
          public school teachers for two years,
          and lobby for the safety of our
          natural resources.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          You want a character debate? Fine,
          but you better stick with me, 'cause
          Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your
          league. I've loved two women in my
          life. I lost one to cancer, and I
          lost the other 'cause I was so busy
          keeping my job I forgot to do my job.
          Well that ends right now.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          Tomorrow morning the White House is
          sending a bill to Congress for its
          consideration. It's White House
          Resolution 455, an energy bill
          requiring a 20 percent reduction of the
          emission of fossil fuels over the
          next ten years. It is by far the
          most aggressive stride ever taken in
          the fight to reverse the effects of
          global warming. The other piece of
          legislation is the crime bill. As of
          today it no longer exists. I'm
          throwing it out. I'm throwing it out
          and writing a law that makes sense.
          You cannot address crime prevention
          without getting rid of assault
          weapons and handguns.
          I consider them a threat to national
          security, and I will go door to door
          if I have to, but I'm gonna convince
          Americans that I'm right, and I'm
          gonna get the guns. We've got
          serous problems, and we need serious
          men, and if you want to talk about
          character, Bob, you'd better come at
          me with more than a burning flag and
          a membership card. If you want to
          talk about character and American
          values, fine. Just tell me where and
          when, and I'll show up. This is a
          time for serious men, Bob, and your
          fifteen minutes are up. My name's
          Andrew Shepherd, and I am the
          President.

     SHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his
     wake.

     The MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS. They're talking
     among themselves, confirming that they just saw what they
     just saw. ROBIN steps to the podium.

                    ROBIN
          Any questions?

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. HALLWAY - WEST WING - DAY

     A.J. and LEWIS are following after the President.

                    A.J.
          Well, you don't see that every day
          of the week.

                    LEWIS
          He's got the whole White House Press
          Corps asking each other how to spell
          "erudite."

                    A.J.
          Lewis, call the printer.

                    LEWIS
          I know. Gotta rewrite the State of
          the Union.

                    A.J.
          Every word, Lewis. It's a whole new
          ball game. You've got 35 minutes.

                    LEWIS
          Oh, good. I thought I was gonna be rushed.

     LEWIS goes off in one direction. A.J. heads towards the Oval
     Office.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

     SHEPHERD is on the phone.

                    SHEPHERD
          I don't want the limo. I don't want
          an escort.

     A.J. enters.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          I want a plain, ordinary, non-
          bullet-proof automobile. Someone
          around here must have a Chevy I
          can borrow. Well, find one and
          meet me outside the West Wing
          entrance in five minutes.

                    A.J.
          Where are you going?

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm going to her house. I'm gonna
          stand at her front door till she
          lets me in. And I'm not leaving till
          I get her back.

                    A.J.
          How're you gonna do that?

                    SHEPHERD
          I haven't worked that out yet. But
          I'm sure groveling will be involved.

                    A.J.
          You're just gonna drive over?

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm the Commander-in-Chief of the
          most powerful army in the world.
          You don't think I can drive ten blocks?

                    SYDNEY
          Just stay away from DuPont Circle.
          I hear it's murder this time of day.

     SHEPHERD doesn't need to turn around to know who's standing
     in the doorway, but of course he does anyway.

                    SYDNEY
          Hi, A.J.

                    A.J.
          It's nice to see you, Ms. Wade. If
          anybody needs me, I'll be in the
          Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.

     A.J. exits.

                    SYDNEY
          I heard your speech. I was in my
          car, and it just kind of steered
          its way over here.

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm glad.

     SYDNEY and SHEPHERD just gaze at each other for a moment and
     smile. SYDNEY starts toward him.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          Sydney, I didn't decide to send
          455 to the floor to get you back.

                    SYDNEY
          I didn't come back 'cause you decided
          to send 455 to the floor.

     They move to kiss. It doesn't last very long because...

                    LEWIS
                  (entering)
          Mr. President, I thought you might
          want to look at this. I moved Social
          Security up front. Hello, Sydney.

     JANIE enters--

                    JANIE
          Mr. President, Leventhal at
          Treasury wants two minutes. Hello,
          Sydney.

     MRS. CHAPIL enters--

                    MRS. CHAPIL
          Mr. President -- Excuse me, Miss
          Wade -- Miss McCall is on her way
          over.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to SYDNEY)
          I've got some things to do.

                    SYDNEY
          Yes, you do.

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. THE CAPITOL - NIGHT

     It's lit up and glowing on this cold, clear night.

                    ANCHOR (V.O.)
          We're only a moment or two away from
          the arrival of President Shepherd and
          his State of the Union address.
          Lloyd, you've served on the staffs of
          several past administrations, what
          kind of last-minute activity is the
          President engaged in right now?

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. A VIP ROOM - NIGHT

     It's off the main corridor, and it's being used as a green
     room for SHEPHERD and his group -- LEWIS, KODAK, A.J., JANIE,
     and various AIDES and STAFFERS. People are buzzing around in
     a last-minute flurry. SHEPHERD is fumbling with his cuff
     links.

                    SHEPHERD
          I'm having a cuff links crisis.

     LUCY takes his sleeves.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing; to LUCY)
          I think they've locked.

                    LUCY
          Hold still.

     ROBIN steps in.

                    ROBIN
          Mr. President, they're waiting for
          you.


                    LUCY
          All done.

                    SHEPHERD
          Lewis.

                    LEWIS
          Sir.

                    SHEPHERD
          Things have been a little rough
          between us lately.

                    LEWIS
          I know sir, I'm sorry.

                    SHEPHERD
          Don't stop what you're doing.

                    LEWIS
          That's kind of you, sir, but I
          realize I've been a little
          insensitive about some personal...

                    SHEPHERD
          No, you were right. Two hundred and
          sixty-four million people don't give
          a damn about my life.

                    LEWIS
          Just so you know I've never been one
          of them, Mr. President.

                    ROBIN
          This way, people. Let's go.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (to LEWIS)
          See you after.

     The PEOPLE in the room start to gather their things and exit,
     ROBIN handling any and all last-minute "Mr. President"'s as
     she herds people out the door.

     LUCY walks past SHEPHERD. She holds SHEPHERD's old tattered
     textbook and has it opened to a specific page...

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          Whatcha got there, Luce?

                    LUCY
          Article 2, Section 3, of the U.S.
          Constitution. Executive Powers.
                  (reading)
          "He shall, from time to time, give to
          the Congress information of the State
          of the Union, and recommend to their
          consideration such measures as he
          shall judge necessary and expedient."

                    A.J.
          Sounds right up your alley.

     SHEPHERD looks at his old friend and extends his hand for a
     deeply-felt handshake. A.J. grasps SHEPHERD's hand and then
     pulls him into a strong embrace.

     A.J. whispers a shout into SHEPHERD's ear--

                    A.J.
                  (continuing)
          Give 'em hell, Andy.

     A.J. pulls away, leaving SHEPHERD to enjoy the moment without
     having to speak--

                    A.J.
                  (continuing)
          You've got 30 seconds, Mr. President.

                    SHEPHERD
          Thank you.
                  (to LUCY)
          I'll see you afterward. I want a
          critique.

     The room clears out...revealing SYDNEY, dressed like the
     First Lady she's soon to be, sitting against the window sill.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          There's been something I've been
          trying to give you since our first
          date. I tried a bunch of times, but
          somehow I've always managed to trip
          over my job.
                  (beat)
          Anyay...

     SHEPHERD has picked his black canvas gym bag with the gold
     Presidential seal.

     He reaches in the bag and pulls out a bouquet of flowers.

                    SHEPHERD
                  (continuing)
          These are for you.

                    SYDNEY
          They're beautiful.

     JANIE pokes her head in.

                    JANIE
          Mr. President?

                    SHEPHERD
          Gotta go.

                    SYDNEY
          Should I stay here?

                    SHEPHERD
          No, walk with me.

     They exit into a hallway lined with Congressional STAFFERS,
     SECRET SERVICE, CAPITOL SECURITY, WHITE HOUSE STAFF, and,
     most prominently, A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, JANIE and KODAK.

     SYDNEY is still clutching her flowers as they near the double
     doors to the House Chamber--

                    SYDNEY
          How'd you finally do it?

                    SHEPHERD
                  (raising his voice
                   above the cheering)
          Do what?

                    SYDNEY
          Manage to give a woman flowers and
          be President at the same time.

                    SHEPHERD
          Well...it turns out I've got a rose
          garden.

     SYDNEY is stopped in her tracks as--

     --the doors to the Chamber fly open--

                    DOORKEEPER
          Mr. Speaker!!!...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
          UNITED STATES!!!

     The CHAMBER leaps to its feet in a thunderous ovation,
     shouts of "Bravo!" from the gallery...

     At the back, LEWIS and ROBIN and KODAK are trying to maintain
     their professional cool, but it's a moment impossible not to
     get caught up in...SYDNEY is clutching her flowers with both
     hands...SHEPHERD is making his way down the aisle, shaking
     hands and receiving congratulations and good wishes, and we

     FADE OUT.
