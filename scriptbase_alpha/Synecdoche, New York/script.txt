          A1INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BEDROOM - FALL 2005 - MORNING A1

          Darkness. The sound of a radio and pots and pans clanging
          fades in. Caden, 40, opens his eyes in bed, and groggily
          looks at himself in the bureau mirror. The bedside clock
          reads 7:45.

          1 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S KITCHEN - FALL 2005 - SAME1

          Adele, 40, in t-shirt and sweats, mixes a bowl of instant
          oatmeal, puts it in the microwave.

          RADIO VOICE
          ... a Labor Day luncheon today --

          OLIVE (O.S.) RADIO VOICE
          Mommy! Done! -- at Stuckey Hall --

          ADELERADIO VOICE
          Okay!-- in downtown Schenectady --
          Adele leaves the kitchen. Caden, also 40, enters as she's
          leaving. He's dressed in a ratty terrycloth robe.

          CADENADELE
          Morning. Morning. Tried not to wake
          you.

          CADEN
          Thanks. You didn't. I was just --
          As Caden's voice goes under, we follow Adele into --

          2 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BATHROOM - FALL 2005 - CONTINUOUS 2

          Olive, 4, sits on the toilet. Adele enters, rips some toilet
          paper off the roll and proceeds to wipe Olive. The phone
          rings in the kitchen.

          ADELECADEN (O.S.)
          Caden, could you get that? It's Maria. I don't want to.

          ADELE
          Ugh. Caden!
          (looks at bright green
          smear on toilet paper)
          That's weird.
          The phone stops ringing.

          OLIVE
          Is something wrong with my poop?

          OLIVE (CONT'D)
          I didn't! What's wrong with me?!
          A cellphone rings in the other room.

          ADELE
          Honey, I have to get this. You're
          going to be fine.

          OLIVE
          But, Mommy --

          3 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S KITCHEN - FALL 2005 - CONTINUOUS3

          She rifles through her purse, grabs her cellphone, answers.

          ADELE
          Hey.

          (LAUGHING)
          Oh, wiping Olive's ass. You?
          Caden is pouring himself a cup of coffee. He sips it and
          stares out the window. It's raining.

          ADELE (CONT'D)
          You're kidding! Holy fuck!
          Caden exits with his coffee, annoyed about the phone call.

          CADEN
          I don't feel well.

          4 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BATHROOM - FALL 2005 - CONTINUOUS 4

          Caden passes the bathroom. Olive is staring into the toilet
          bowl. Adele can be heard chatting in the background.

          OLIVE
          Daddy, my poop is green.
          Caden enters the bathroom, looks into the bowl at the green
          feces and smeared toilet paper. He seems freaked out.

          OLIVE (CONT'D)
          Am I going to be okay?

          OLIVE
          Did you have green poop when you
          were little?

          CADENOLIVE
          I'm sure I did, honey. Am I going to die?

          CADENOLIVE
          Of course not. You probablyI didn't! I didn't eat
          ate something -- green!

          CADEN
          It'll be fine, sweetie. I'll be
          back in a minute.

          OLIVE (O.C.)

          (CALLING)
          Is poop alive?

          5EXT. CADEN AND ADELE'S HOUSE - FALL 2005 - MORNING 5

          Caden steps out the front door in his bare feet and hurries
          down the driveway in the rain. He picks up the newspaper,
          pulls the mail from the box. As he heads back inside, he
          flips through the mail. There's a magazine called Attending
          to your Illness addressed to Caden. A diseased person on the
          cover. Across the street a gaunt man watches Caden, unseen.

          6INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S KITCHEN - FALL 2005 - MORNING 6

          Caden sits at the kitchen table with his coffee, reading the
          paper, dated Friday, October 14, 2005.

          ADELE
          All right, baby. See you then.
          Adele clicks off her cellphone.

          CADEN
          Harold Pinter died!

          my poop again?!

          ADELE OLIVE (O.S.)
          No, Olive, it's fine. JustWhat if it's alive? What if
          flush.I kill it? It's green! Like
          plants!

          ADELE CADEN
          It's not alive, honey.God, remember that production
          of The Dumbwaiter I did at
          Albanyfest?
          The toilet is flushed.

          OLIVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Everything's alive. Everything
          grows big. That's how you know.
          Olive enters.

          ADELE
          I have your oatmeal, honey.

          OLIVE
          I want peanut butter and jelly.

          ADELE OLIVE
          Olive, c'mon. You told me I don't want oatmeal.
          oatmeal. This isn't a
          restaurant.
          Adele growls, grabs the oatmeal, dumps it in the sink.

          OLIVE (CONT'D)CADEN
          Sorry, Mommy! I'm sorry!(looking at paper)
          They found Avian flu in
          Turkey. In the country
          Turkey not turkeys. It's in
          chickens.
          Adele is making a peanut butter sandwich for Olive.

          OLIVE (CONT'D)
          Can I watch TV till school?
          Caden clicks the remote for Olive and goes back to his paper.
          A cartoon cow talks to a cartoon sheep.

          COW
          There is a secret, something at
          play under the surface, growing
          like an invisible virus of thought.
          The sheep nods. Caden pours himself some more coffee, opens
          the milk carton to pour some in, then sniffs at the spout.
          He checks the date on the carton. It's October 20.

          CADEN COW
          Man. Milk's expired. Jesus. But you are being changed by
          it. Second by second. Every
          breath counts off time.
          Caden goes back to his paper. Adele puts a peanut butter
          sandwich in front of Olive.

          ADELE
          Here. Now you better eat this.

          OLIVE CADEN

          Adele stares out the window at the rain.

          7 INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - FALL 2005 - DAY 7

          Caden is in the dentist's chair, a bloody bib around his
          neck. The dentist, in surgical mask, probes his open mouth,
          calls out numbers to an assistant, who records them.

          DENTIST

          2, 2, 1.3, 4, 2.3, 4, 4.

          8 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BATHROOM - WINTER 2005 - NIGHT 8

          Caden shaves. A faucet explodes and smacks him in the
          forehead. He is sent staggering backwards with a yelp, into
          the far wall, his razor flying and blood pouring from a
          jagged cut above his right eyebrow. Off-screen, we hear the
          pounding footsteps of someone running toward us. Half of
          Caden's face is covered with shaving cream. Rivulets of
          blood intermingle with it. Water shoots out where the tap
          was, spraying the mirror, which is spattered with blood.
          Adele, dressed in heavily paint-splattered clothes, hurries
          in and takes in the scene: the wet, the mess, the blood.

          ADELE
          Jesus! Caden! What the fuck -- ?!
          Olive, in a nightgown, stands quietly in the doorway, her
          curled toes clenched. She holds a large stuffed owl.

          CADENADELE
          Um. I was shaving and -- My God! Jesus! Look at your
          head!
          Dumbly, Caden tries to look up at his forehead, then squints
          nervously at himself in the mirror.

          ADELE (CONT'D)
          (to Olive)
          Honey, don't look.
          Olive turns around.

          ADELE (CONT'D)
          Put pressure. Press. Press!

          CADEN
          Do I press above or below it?

          ADELE
          I don't know! Just... both!
          Caden sits on the toilet, presses a towel to his head. Adele
          squats, goes into a spasmodic coughing fit, finishes, opens
          the cabinet under the sink, pushes her arm through bottles of
          cleaning products, old sponges, old toothbrushes, toilet
          paper rolls and other junk to the shut-off valves.

          ADELE (CONT'D)
          I can't turn it! It's gonna flood!
          Olive hugs the owl tightly and it speaks.

          Whooo. Whooo. Whooo areI can't -- Oh wait, got it!

          Adele turns off the water. Olive looks back into the room.

          Mommy, Daddy has blood.

          Caden sits on a metal table. The room has some meager
          Christmas ornaments. A doctor stitches Caden's forehead.

          Caden squints into the bright light the doctor uses to see
          his work. In the background we hear another patient.

          PATIENT (O.S.)

          (CRYING)
          Please, please, please...
          Caden sees a nurse shoving a tube far up into a man's nose.
          Another nurse wipes away the blood leaking out his nostril.

          CADEN
          Will there be a scar?

          DOCTOR
          Probably. It looks like a mudflap.

          CADEN
          I prefer there not be a scar.

          DOCTOR
          That fellow is annoying. He's in
          here every week. Like clockwork.
          The off-screen patient continues to whimper. The doctor
          finishes his work on Caden.

          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          There. I think that should --
          He looks at Caden's eyes, turns off the bright lamp and looks
          again. He turns the lamp back on and looks once more.

          CADEN
          What?
          The doctor feels Caden's pulse, then listens to his heart.
          He presses hard against the glands in Caden's neck.

          DOCTOR
          Changes in bowel movements?

          CADEN
          A little more yellow than usual.
          What?

          I'd like you to see an

          The doctor stares blankly at Caden for a long moment, then
          looks suspiciously in Caden's ears.

          Adele drives and coughs spasmodically. The car swerves a bit.
          Caden has a bandaged head and a prescription in his hand.
          Olive, in her car seat, sings. Caden sees revelers in winter
          coats and party hats outside a house. They blow noisemakers
          and yell "happy new year!"

          You don't have to worry, baby. You
          don't have blood.

          CADEN
          Well, I don't think you should tell
          her she doesn't have blood.

          Olive cries. Adele coughs. Caden stares out the window. It's
          dark, but his pupils are pinpricks.

          11INT. OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE - WINTER 2006 - DAY 11

          An ophthalmologist examines Caden's eyes. An eyeglass
          calendar on the wall is open to March 2006.

          CADEN
          Thanks for getting me in right
          away.
          The doctor touches Caden's eye repeatedly with a small probe.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          Is it the bump to the head?

          No.
          (writes in chart, then:)
          Could be. But I think we need to
          get you to a neurologist. Nothing
          urgent.

          CADEN
          A neurologist?

          OPHTHALMOLOGIST
          Yes, a brain expert.

          CADEN OPHTHALMOLOGIST
          I know what a neurologist is. Fine. I just thought from
          the way you asked --

          CADEN
          I thought maybe you said urologist.
          Why do I need to see a neurologist?

          OPHTHALMOLOGIST
          For a look-see. The eyes are part
          of the brain, after all.

          CADEN
          That's not true, is it?

          OPHTHALMOLOGIST
          Why would I say it if it weren't
          true?

          CADEN
          It just doesn't seem right.

          OPHTHALMOLOGIST
          Like morally correct? Or right as
          in accurate?

          CADEN
          I'm not sure. Accurate, I guess.

          OPHTHALMOLOGIST
          Hmm. Interesting.
          The doctor writes in Caden's chart.

          12INT. SCHENECTADY THEATER - 2006 - DAY 12

          Caden sits in the almost empty theater. A few people with
          note-pads are scattered around. Centerstage, a 1948 Dodge
          Business Coupe. The car is surrounded by various rooms from
          that period: a kitchen, bedrooms, etc.

          Tom, the actor playing Willy Loman, stands center stage.
          Claire, the actress playing Linda Loman, sits in the set's
          bedroom. Davis, the actor playing Biff, lies on the top bunk
          of a bunk bed upstage. A fourth actor, playing Happy, lies on
          the bottom bunk.

          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)

          Willy? Answer me!...Willy!
          Tom starts the car and guns the engine. A brick wall off
          stage speeds into the car, accompanied by crashing and
          screeching sound effects.

          CLAIRE (AS LINDA) (CONTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢D)
          No!!!

          DAVIS (AS BIFF)
          Pop!!
          The wall continues to be pulled past the car crashing into
          the rest of the set, knocking walls over, creating havoc. A
          lamp post falls and hits Claire, knocking her over.

          David runs on stage to deal with the mess.

          CADEN
          It's too late in the game to be
          having these problems, David.

          (to Tom)
          That was good, Tom.

          TOM
          Yeah? I was trying something
          different. I was crashing
          differently. Ambivalently.

          CADEN
          I saw that. I like it.
          Caden meets Tom at the foot of the stage. Behind them a
          group of technicians are lifting the wall and trying to re-
          set it. Claire primps in the bureau mirror.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          Try to keep in mind that a young
          person playing Willy Loman thinks
          he's only pretending to be at the
          end of a life full of despair. But
          the tragedy is that we know that
          you, the young actor, will end up
          in this very place of desolation.

          Tom exits. Caden rubs his temples, then heads to the back of
          the house, pulling out his cell phone. He exits the theater.

          13 INT. SCHENECTADY THEATER LOBBY - 2006 - DAY 13

          Caden passes the box office. Hazel, 35, sits inside, reading
          a novel. She looks up, smiles warmly, and waves.

          HAZEL
          I just heard the death of the

          Caden has the phone to his ear. He's squinting in the bright
          sunlight, pupils dilated. The gaunt man watches him unseen.

          CADEN
          Dr. Heshborg said I should see Dr.
          Scariano. My pupils don't work.

          looks up and sees Caden standing outside the box office
          window watching her.

          HAZEL
          I keep reading the first line.
          It's a good line, I think. But I
          don't know much about literature.

          Maybe you should read the first
          line of another series of books.

          Recommend me something. You're a

          The studio is a mess, the floor covered with paint. Adele,
          in her paint-spattered clothing, works on a tiny canvas, an
          inch square. She paints with a single-hair brush while
          looking through a magnifying glass. Caden pokes his head in.

          Um, yeah, I guess.
          Caden pisses in the sink in the corner of the studio. His
          urine is amber. He finishes and peeks over Adele's shoulder,
          through the magnifying glass at the painting. It's an
          amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in
          a state of profound despair, screaming to the heavens, while
          standing in a field of flames.

          stage and walks into the kitchen.

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          Oh boy, oh boy.

          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
          Willy!

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          It's all right, I came back.

          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
          Why? What happened?

          (PAUSE)
          Did something happen, Willy?

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          No, nothing happened.

          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
          You didn't smash the car, did you?

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          I said nothing happened. Didn't you
          hear me?

          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
          Don't you feel well?

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          I'm tired to death. I couldn't make
          it. I just couldn't make it, Linda.

          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
          Where were you all day? You look
          terrible.

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          I got as far as a little above
          Yonkers. I stopped for a cup of
          coffee... maybe it was the coffee.

          The cast party is in full swing. The opening was a success.
          Lots of drinking. Caden chats with Claire. Hazel watches
          from across the room.

          CLAIRE
          (scrunching her nose)
          Ugh, I hated myself tonight. Plus

          CADEN
          Yeah. Absolutely.
          (squints suddenly)
          Sorry. I have a bit of a headache.

          CLAIRE
          (kisses his forehead)
          I just want to thank you for
          everything. You've been absolutely
          brilliant and it's going to be
          miserable going ahead without you.

          I'll be around. I'll check in.
          She gets teary, gives him a kiss on the cheek.

          CLAIRE
          God, I'm such a baby.
          She just looks at him and smiles and nods.

          She backs away and gets lost in the crowd. Caden massages

          I thought she was weak.

          HAZEL
          Oh, Caden, not you, too. What I
          want to know is why she started
          crying in her last monologue, right

          24INT. HAZEL'S CAR - 2006 - NIGHT24

          Hazel drives down a dark street, crying. People watch her
          passing car from various windows. There's a run-over dog,
          lit by a streetlight, glistening on the side of the road.

          25EXT. RESIDENTIAL SCHENECTADY STREET - 2006 - A FEW MOMENTS 25


          LATER
          Hazel studies the dog. It's a bloody, gutty mess, squashed
          flat. Against all odds, it's still alive. Its head is
          lolling. She bends down to pet it.

          HAZEL
          You're not going to make it, baby.

          26INT. HAZEL'S BATHROOM (APARTMENT) - 2006 - NIGHT 26

          Hazel takes off her make-up, hair back in a clip. She
          watches herself blankly in the mirror, somewhat erased
          without eye make-up. The run-over dog is sleeping in a box
          on the floor.

          27INT. QUINCY'S, BACK ROOM - 2006 - ABOUT DAWN 27

          The party has thinned out. The remaining people are sitting
          around a table, drinking. Claire, next to Caden, rests her
          head, sleepily drunk, against his shoulder. Caden studies a
          series of lumps under the skin of his arm.

          CLAIRE
          What are you going to do now?

          CADEN

          Hazel gets out of her car and walks up to a neat little house
          on a street of neat little houses. Faint swirls of smoke
          escape from the windows. She rings the doorbell. The button
          is hot; Hazel pulls her finger away.

          The rooms are hazy. The realtor coughs a little. Hazel

          Yes. It's a wonderful place.The truth is, I never really
          imagined I could afford it.

          REALTOR
          The sellers are very motivated now.

          HAZEL
          It's a scary decision. I never
          thought I'd buy a house alone.
          But, y'know, I'm 36, and I wonder
          what I'm really waiting for.

          psychosis, but it sounds the same.

          Adele sits at the kitchen table with Olive. She drinks
          coffee and talks on the phone. Olive eats cereal and watches
          a cartoon. Caden enters. Olive doesn't look away from her
          show. A cartoon jackal talks to a man who looks like Caden.

          Adele continues to talk on the phone.

          Caden picks up the newspaper. It's dated May 25th, 2006. He

          Cobwebs. The room is long abandoned. Caden slumps against a
          wall and stares into space. He starts to cry and can't stop.
          Later: Caden watches a paint-spattered TV. A commercial:
          diffused images of people flying kites, having picnics,
          watching sunsets. A shot of Caden among them.

          You tell me something. Oh. I've
          cut out wheat.

          HAZEL
          Um, I bought this really nifty
          sweater today. On sale. Fifty
          dollars reduced from three hundred!

          HAZEL
          I don't know. We fuck? We
          continue to sort of flirt? You
          divorce your wife and marry me and
          I make you happy for the very first
          time in your life and all your
          symptoms disappear?

          CADEN
          Do I have to choose at all?

          HAZEL
          No, I suppose not. Choosing is not
          your strong suit. You want to come
          over to my place, Cotard?

          beat-up suitcase at his feet. He reads a very old Vogue and
          opens to a spread about his wife. She seems glamorous.
          There are photos of her in Berlin, her work, her flat. She is
          the toast of the art world. Photos of her with two men, and
          also with Olive, who seems somewhat Nazi Youth-like now.

          He looks up, having forgotten where he was. He grabs his
          suitcase and follows the nurse down a dismal hallway: gurneys
          against dirty walls, empty wheelchairs. Skinny man takes a
          flash picture of Caden. Nurses drinking coffee out of paper
          cups eye him. Puddles of vomit on the floor. They arrive at
          the end of the hall. A doctor pokes his head out of a room.

          CADEN
          HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I think theater is:
          itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the beginning of thought. The
          truth not yet spoken. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a
          blackbird in winter. The moment
          before death. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what a man
          feels after heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been clocked in
          the jaw. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love... in all its
          messiness. And I want all of us,
          players and audience alike, to soak
          in the communal bath of it, the
          mikvah, as the Jews call it. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re
          all in the same water, after all,
          soaking in our very menstrual blood
          and nocturnal emissions. This is
          what I want to try to give people,
          Hazel. And I want your help.
          Hazel just stares. The food arrives. Caden looks at his
          plate and concentrates.

          CADEN
          So I was wondering if you'll help.

          HAZEL
          In your box office?

          CADEN
          No. Like as my assistant.

          HAZEL
          I'm not sure I can work with you,
          Caden. I'm kind of angry.

          CADEN
          I just want to normalize it, Hazel.
          I think we'd have fun together.
          He swallows some food then concentrates. She watches him.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          I miss you.
          He concentrates some more. She stares at him.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          I'm digesting.

          HAZEL
          It's really disturbing.

          66INT. TINY, CRAMPED REHEARSAL HALL - 2009 - DAY 66

          Caden, beads of sweat on his forehead, sits with a large
          group of actors, Tom, Claire, and Davis from Salesman among
          them. No one speaks. Finally, Caden clears his throat.

          CADEN
          We'll start by talking honestly.
          Out of that a piece of theater will
          evolve. I'll begin.

          (SILENCE)
          Yet here we are, for the moment,

          Caden waits in a booth, nursing a martini, watching people
          walk in, but not Claire. After a bit, Hazel enters with
          Derek from the burning house. She's laughing and doesn't see
          Caden. He slinks back into the booth. They sit at a table
          not far from Caden, who can hear their conversation.

          So I used my new power to kill all
          the townsfolk. Horrible,
          humiliating deaths. I was reunited

          CLAIRE
          She's 36. Works in a theater box
          office. She had acting aspirations
          but lacked the confidence to pursue
          them. Her life is passing by. She
          is alone. She's old and ugly --

          No. It's just. I don't feel like

          Claire thinks for a moment.

          CLAIRE
          I suppose not. She is limited.
          Okay. There's this single mother
          who lives downstairs. I find her

          Caden walks along, his leg shaking. He spots Hazel looking
          in a store window. He just watches her for a while. She
          sees him in the store window reflection. She turns.

          HAZEL
          Caden! I was wondering if I was
          going to bump into you!
          She gives him a hug, notices his shaking leg.

          Caden watches Hazel and her family, laughing and enjoying 
          each other on the terrace. The gaunt man sits with them.  
          When they head to the pool, Caden just continues, without 
          hesitation, to the edge of the roof, and begins to climb  
          over. A passing lifeguard sees Caden, grabs him and wrestles  
          him to the ground.  

          95INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S HOUSE - 2017 - NIGHT95

          Caden pulls Olive's journal from under his pillow and reads
          from somewhere in the middle.

          OLIVE'S VOICE
          (with German accent)
          How I love Maria! She is so much
          more of a father than Caden ever
          was, with his drinking and
          unfortunate body odor and rotting
          teeth. I could only loathe him and
          perhaps pity him. But Maria!
          Caden blots his sopping brow and gums, sniffs under his arms.

          Claire begins kissing her way down Caden's chest.

          CADEN
          They said he suffered horribly.
          That he called out for me right
          before he died. They said he said
          he regretted his life. They said
          he said a lot of things. Too many
          to recount. They said it was the
          longest and saddest deathbed speech
          any of them had ever heard.

          The actors are in their apartments living their lives. Caden
          is in the far corner of the space, at a little sectioned-off
          area. There are a half-dozen actors sitting on folding
          chairs outside the partition. They all resemble Caden,
          except one very tall one. Hazel steps around the partition.

          Sammy Barnathan stands. He is the gaunt man we've seen
          following Caden. Hazel leads him to Caden. Caden stands.

          This is Sammy Barnathan.I don't have a resume or
          picture. I've never worked

          Good. Tell me why you're here.

          SAMMY
          I've been following you for twenty
          years. So I knew about this
          audition. Because I follow you.
          Caden, hiding is nervousness, nods.

          SAMMY (CONT'D)
          I've learned everything about you
          by following you. Hire me and you
          will see who you truly are.
          Caden stares at Sammy. Sammy stares back. There's fear in
          Caden's eyes but he doesn't drop his gaze.

          Caden limps with his cane and a backpack toward the men's
          room door. His eyes are rheumy. He pushes open the door.

          The room is filthy. Flies buzz. The urinals are covered
          with slime. Caden enters a stall, pulls down his pants, and
          sits. He strains. When he is done, he looks at his stool.
          It's gray. He wipes and flushes, pulls up his pants and
          exits the stall. Sammy stands there.

          SAMMY

          need to hide from me.
          Caden opens his pack and pulls out a baggie full of pills.
          He takes them, one-by-one. Sammy watches and counts. When

          Dark, deserted part of town. The wind blows wet leaves. A
          kid walks by in a Hallowe'en costume, looking lost. Caden
          finds the address: an old, narrow, very tall, very dark
          building. There's a piece of looseleaf paper with the
          handwritten note "Death in family. God relieve our grief."
          taped to the front door. He approaches the tenant buzzers and
          buzzes 31Y. The name on the apartment is Capgras. The door
          buzzes.

          ascends, swaying and creaking. The doors open on 17; nobody
          gets on. As they begin to close:

          Caden reaches for the "door open" button but doesn't press

          ascent. The doors open on 31 and Caden exits.

          Sound of the elevator descending. Caden heads down the long
          hall, looking at apartment numbers. He gets to the end and
          is only at 31J. He turns and heads back. The elevator is
          ascending again. As he passes the elevator door, it opens
          and a very old, feeble-looking man or woman steps out.

           CADEN SAMMY
           Good, Jimmy!(to Claire)
          It's for the play. We're
          getting at something real
          here.

          CLAIRE (CONT'D)
          Ugh! I'm going to rehearsal.
          She grabs her coat, tosses the note into the trash, and
          storms out and down the stairs.

          CADEN
          That's great, you guys.
          Sammy sits at the table and starts to write on scraps of
          paper. Hazel hovers behind him, watching.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          Beautiful, Sammy.
          Caden leaves the set and steps onto his platform.

          SAMMY
          Caden, time out?

          CADENSAMMY
          What's up? I feel we need a Hazel in
          here. There's a whole side
          of Caden I'm not able to
          explore without a Hazel.
          Caden looks over at Hazel. Claire watches Caden from the
          street corner.

          CADEN
          I guess, yeah.
          Claire walks off in a huff.

          Caden looks at the unmade bed, an imprint of a female form in
          the sheets. He touches it. He gets a melancholy look on his
          face. He lies on his back in the form. He sees a note on
          the night table:

          ADELE'S VOICE
          Hi Ellen. Crackerjack job last
          night! Would you do sheets again?
          We had quite a fuck last night and
          it's musky and gross. Kisses, A.
          Caden smells the sheets, strips the bed.

          Hi Adele. Relined the cabinets.
          Just wanted to let you know I won a
          MacArthur Grant and I'm mounting a
          play, which I think is going to be
          pure and truthful. Best --
          Caden hesitates for a moment, then signs it "Ellen."

          Caden and Hazel watch as Claire waits in her bathrobe in the

          CLAIRE
          Caden, what are you doing at night?
          I have a right to fucking know.

          SAMMY
          I've been going to Adele's place.
          And cleaning it.
          Long pause. Caden rubs his eyes.

          There's a silence. Hazel watches Caden closely.

          Claire packs up her stuff.

          HAZEL
          Already put out a call for a Claire

          Caden, wearing a pair of magnifying glasses that flip up and
          down, enters a crowded gallery of people wearing similar
          glasses. The paintings are microscopic. Museum visitors use
          the special glasses to study the paintings. There's a wall
          inscribed "Small Miracles: The Paintings of Adele Lack."
          Biographical info is under. Caden squeezes his way to the
          wall to look at paintings. He sees one of an African female
          genital mutilation ceremony;

          a woman weeping over the grave of a child; a man raping a
          woman. He comes to a wall titled: "Women I Love." He sees
          a self-portrait of Adele, a portrait of Maria, a portrait of
          Olive, naked and covered in tattoos. Then he comes to a
          portrait entitled "Ellen Bascomb." He steps back for a
          second, unable to look. The people behind him are impatient.
          Finally he flips the glasses and studies the painting. Ellen
          appears to be a chubby, 40 year old white woman, her mousy
          brown hair tied back in a kerchief. She is naked and
          spreading her vulva for the viewer. She has a kind face and
          what appears to be an appendectomy scar.

          Caden moves boxes. Claire sits at the kitchen table with an
          actor. They are rehearsing lines from Needleman in a
          Haystack.  

          CLAIRE (AS REBA) 
          Oh, Needleman, you had such  
          potential. But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m afraid IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m  
          going to have to move on.  

          ACTOR (AS NEEDLEMAN) 
          Just like that? You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give a

          a fun-loving girl. Remember? 

          ACTOR (AS NEEDLEMAN) 
          I try to be fun-loving. See? 
          Needleman makes a funny face. Reba doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t react.

          My analyst says you have complexes.  

          ACTOR (AS NEEDLEMAN) 
          Once you enjoyed NeedlemanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 
          complexes. 

          CLAIRE (AS REBA) 
          ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s before my analyst taught me 
          that my enjoyment of them was a

          Caden sits with Hazel at a table facing the giant, open
          apartment building structure. An actress plays Claire. She
          sits at the kitchen table of her apartment with an actor
          playing the actor. They both hold scripts and read from
          Needleman in a Haystack. Sammy is in front of the building,
          looking up. Caden looks troubled. Tammy sits to the side of
          Hazel and studies her. Every once in a while, Hazel self-
          consciously glances over at Tammy, who does not avert her
          gaze.

          Caden, hooked up to pumps, tries to sleep on the floor,
          surrounded by boxes. He listens to Claire having sex next
          door. He detaches his pumps, gets dressed.

          Caden sits on the bed and reads a note from Adele:

          Good for you with your grant!

          Caden heads to the warehouse set. He hands paper scraps to
          shopkeepers, pedestrians, a guy sweeping the street.

          CADEN
          Good work, everyone.
          Nobody acknowledges him.

          Caden enters the warehouse set. Tammy sits alone at the card
          table. There's activity on the street and movement can be
          seen in various windows.

          CADEN
          Where're Sammy and Hazel?
          Tammy jerks her head to the left. Caden sees that Sammy has
          Hazel with her back against a wall. They are talking
          intimately. Caden approaches.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          Hey, Sammy, what are you doing?
          Sammy and Hazel look over casually.

          SAMMY
          Hi, Caden. I'm being you. You
          like Hazel; I like Hazel.

          CADEN
          This Hazel doesn't exist for you.
          If you want to like a Hazel, like
          that one.
          Caden points indicates Tammy. Sammy squints over.

          TAMMYHAZEL
          That's what I tried to tellAw, no harm, no foul, Caden.

          Ten minutes, everybody!
          The actors playing the people on the street immediately stop
          what they're doing. Actors pour from apartment buildings and
          shops, lighting cigarettes and talking on cell phones. Sammy
          goes off.

          CADENHAZEL
          Hazel. What?

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          You don't like him, do you?

          HAZEL
          Kind of. He reminds me of you.

          I'm me. You don't need someone to
          remind you of me.

          A funeral is in progress. Caden stands with Tammy and his
          father as his mother's coffin is lowered into the ground.
          The coffin is banged up and crumbling.

          I don't know what he looks like.

          CADEN
          He's dead. He looks dead, I guess.

           CADEN
          I asked Hazel but she was busy
          tonight and you're the next best
          thing. I mean, it isn't that
          you're the next best thing but
          because you play her, it feels
          comforting. Does that make sense?
          Although the thing is offstage
          you're nothing like her. You play
          her very well though. Did Hazel
          mention what she was doing tonight
          because I called her house before
          we left and her husband said she
          wasn't going to be back till late
          and I thought that was weird
          because she told me Philip was
          sick.

          She's going to dinner with Sammy.

          Sammy walks down the hall followed by Tammy. He stops at
          various doorways and listens to conversations or other noises
          within the apartments. They are followed by Caden and Hazel.

          SAMMY
          Jeremy is playing to us. Tell him
          he simply needs to talk to Donna.
          We'll hear what we hear.
          Tammy takes down the note.

          CADEN
          Sammy's explaining too much. Feels
          expository. Needs to be shorthand,
          like, "Jeremy big."
          Hazel writes that down. They all continue down the hall.

          Caden? Can we stop for a second?

          CADEN
          Sure.

          TAMMY
          If Hazel's in love with Sammy and
          Caden's in love with Hazel, there
          would be a dramatic confrontation,
          where Caden turns to me and says,
          "It's obvious he's a substitute for
          me." I think then Hazel could have
          a good moment where she cries or
          gets angry. I'm not sure which
          yet, but it feels dramatically
          sound.

          163EXT. CITY STREET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2032 - DAY 163

          Caden and Hazel sit at the director's table. The street life
          of the play is going on around them.

          CADEN
          Tammy was right. I don't
          understand why you're with Sammy.

          HAZEL
          He's nice. He's available. He
          fucks me without crying.

          CADEN
          That happened one time! You fucked
          him?

          HAZEL
          Yes! And you and I only fucked one
          time that's why you only cried one
          time! I give you endless
          opportunities.

          CADEN
          What do you mean, he's available?
          Since when are you available?

          HAZEL
          Derek left. Because of you!

          CADEN
          When? How come you never told me?

          HAZEL
          I don't know, Caden. How come a
          lot of things? It's not like we
          can start fresh, like Sammy and I
          can. There's all this pressure on
          us. We're finally both free and
          there's all this fucking pressure.

          That's such a romantic response.
          I'm touched.

          CADEN
          It's not my response. It just
          crossed my mind. We have enormous
          budgetary concerns here.

          Hello, darling. Hi.

          MARIA
          This is him.

          OLIVE CADEN
          Hello.Hi, Olive. I've missed you
          so much.

          OLIVE
          Maria, would you leave us?
          Maria kisses Olive again on the forehead.

          MARIA
          In heaven, my darling.
          Maria exits.

          CADEN OLIVE
          No. I'm sorry.I had hope you have learned.
          Weakly, Olive points to a headset on her night table. She
          pantomimes putting it on. Caden puts it on. Olive puts on
          her own. There follows a slightly delayed and staticky
          translation, in an accented male voice, of everything Olive
          says, with a delay between what Caden says and Olive's
          response, as she listens in translation.

          OLIVE (CONT'D)
          I'm dying, as I'm sure Maria told
          you. The flower tattoos have
          become infected and they're dying.
          So I am, as well. This is life.
          Olive pulls down her hospital gown a bit to show Caden the
          now sickly and decayed flower tattoos.

          CADEN
          It's Maria. She did this.

          OLIVE
          Maria gave me reason to live once
          you left. The flowers defined me.

          CADEN
          Your mother and Maria took you
          away. I tried for years to find
          you. I didn't leave you.

          OLIVE
          You did something.
          Caden is affected by this. It resonates.

          OLIVE (CONT'D)
          I want to talk to you about your
          homosexuality.

          CADEN
          What? I'm not a homosexual!

          OLIVE
          Maria said you would deny it.

          CADEN
          She's lying to you.

          OLIVE
          I had the same struggle when I
          first fell in love with Maria and
          we began to have dirty, aching sex.

          OLIVE
          Of course. She introduced me to
          myself. To my vagina and to hers.

          CADEN
          You have no idea how evil she is.

          OLIVE
          I need to forgive you before I die,
          but I can't forgive someone who has
          not asked for forgiveness.

          CADEN

          CADEN
          For abandoning you.

          OLIVE
          "For abandoning you to have anal
          sex with my homosexual lover Eric."

          CADEN
          For abandoning you to be have anal

          OLIVE

          No. No, I'm sorry, I cannot.
          Olive dies. Dead flower petals slip from her hospital gown.
          Caden sits there. Maria hurries rushes to Olive's side.

          MARIA
          I hope you're happy, faggot.
          Caden gets up and leaves.

          175 EXT. NYC STREET - SUMMER 2045 - DAY175

          It's sweltering. Caden sits on his stoop, holding some dead
          flower petals, watching the world pass by. People are sick,
          angry. Some people wear gas masks. Government vehicles with
          strange symbols and gun turrets drive by. A woman walks a
          naked man on a leash. He defecates on the sidewalk. A wild-
          eyed man in a white t-shirt and Santa hat attacks Caden. As
          he knocks Caden to the ground and wrestles with him, Caden
          sees the t-shirt has a little dot: a painting from Adele's
          show. It's a moment in time, a street scene very much like
          the one Caden's in. In the painting, a man in a white t-
          shirt and Santa hat beats up a man who looks like Caden. The
          flower petals blow away. Caden tries to limp after them.

          176 EXT. NYC STREET - 2045 - DAY 176

          Caden dials his cell phone.

          HAZEL'S ANSWERING MACHINE
          It's Hazel. Leave a message or
          don't. Your dime.

          CADEN
          My love. I know how to do the
          play. It'll take place over the
          course of one day. The day will be
          the day before you died, the
          happiest day of my life. I'll be
          able to relive it forever.

          177 EXT. CITY STREET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2048 - NIGHT 177

          Caden weeps inconsolably at the director's table, Michael the
          pre-Hazel assistant is back, neat and efficient-looking, but
          old now. Hazel's dog, Squishy, sleeps on the floor. The
          scene in the play is dull. People walk back and forth
          aimlessly. Various passersby on the street have hacking
          coughs. Tammy steps out of the bathroom, meanders over to
          the director's table. Hazel's sweater is on Michael's chair-
          back. She casually pulls it off and tries it on. Caden
          watches. She looks so much like Hazel now, it's unbearable.
          He looks away. Millicent walks by carrying a mop and bucket.

          CADEN
          I need a Caden for my Hazel.

          MILLICENT

          it. I think I understand Caden.

          CADEN
          I don't understand him.

          MILLICENT
          Caden Cotard is a man already dead,
          living in a half-world between
          stasis and antistasis. Time is
          concentrated and chronology
          confused for him. Up until
          recently he has strived valiantly
          to make sense of his situation, but
          now he has turned to stone.

          CADEN
          Okay. That sounds good.

          MICHAEL
          She's right? I didn't see that at
          all. I saw it all as more hopeful.

          Caden, in "Director Wig," and Michael watch Millicent,
          dressed Caden-esque, sitting at the director's table. Tammy,
          in Hazel's sweater, sits next to her. They watch the "Sammy
          Funeral" scene replayed with actors playing Tammy playing
          Hazel and an actor playing the stand-in for Sammy playing
          Caden. Tammy has her head in her hands. She looks over at
          Millicent, imploringly.

          TAMMY
          Come over tonight? Please?

          MILLICENT
          I'd like that.

          CADEN
          Ok, take off the sweater.
          Tammy takes off the sweater, puts it on the chair back.

          TAMMY
          I'm hot.

          MILLICENT
          Yes, you are.

          CADEN
          Smile shyly at each other.
          They do. It lingers. Millicent looks over at the funeral
          scene. It's dull and static.

          MILLICENT
          This is tedious. This is nothing.
          Millicent touches Tammy's hand, heads over to the funeral
          scene. She whispers things to some actors, has longer
          conversations with others.

          MICHAEL
          What's she doing?

          TAMMY

          MILLICENT
          Okay, folks, let's run it!
          The scene comes alive with specific activity: weeping Hazel, 
          a little boy in the back playing with dirt clods, a man and a  
          woman eyeing each other flirtatiously from a distance, an old  
          woman with Parkinson's fiddling with Rosary beads, a well- 
          dressed woman squatting and peeing near a gravesite. A 
          minister addresses the mourners. 

          MINISTER 
          Everything is more complicated than  
          you think. You only see a tenth of 
          what is true. There are a million  
          little strings attached to every 
          choice you make; you can destroy 
          your life every time you choose. 
          But maybe you won't know for twenty  
          years. And you'll never ever trace 
          it to its source. And you only get 
          one chance to play it out. Just try  
          and figure out your own divorce. 
          And they say there is no fate, but 
          there is: it's what you create.  
          Even though the world goes on for  
          eons and eons, you are here for a  
          fraction of a fraction of a second.  
          Most of your time is spent being 
          dead or not yet born. But while  
          alive, you wait in vain, wasting 
          years, for a phone call or a letter  
          or a look from someone or something  
          to make it all right. And it never 
          comes or it seems to but doesn't 
          really. And so you spend your time 
          in vague regret or vaguer hope for 
          something good to come along.  
          Something to make you feel 
          connected, to make you feel whole, 
          to make you feel loved.

          a job and place to stay. Adele is
          nice to me. And so smart and
          talented. I don't understand her
          artwork, but that's just me. I
          wish I'd gone to college. I feel
          stupid around educated people like
          Adele. Eric was too smart for me,
          too. We didn't talk at all near
          the end.

          I'd try to tell him about my day
          and he'd get this far away look in
          his eyes. I kind of felt sorry for
          him; he seemed so miserable with
          me. I guess --
          Caden drifts off to sleep.

          184INT. ELLEN'S KITCHEN - (2050) - MORNING 184

          A tenement apartment. Ellen, in a terrycloth robe, is at the
          stove making scrambled eggs. Toast pops from the toaster and
          Ellen crosses to get it. She passes a mirror, glances at
          herself, seems momentarily surprised, pushes a wisp of hair
          behind her ear and continues to the toaster. Eric enters.
          He's an unhealthily thin middle-aged man. He doesn't
          acknowledge her, nor she him. He pours himself coffee.

          ELLEN
          I'm making eggs.

          (BEAT)
          Is everything okay, Eric?

          ERIC
          Everything's everything.

          185INT. ELLEN'S BEDROOM - (2050) - MORNING 185

          Ellen sits on the bed with a cup of coffee and stares out the
          window. There's a city park across the street and she
          watches kids play basketball. She begins to weep.

          186EXT. FIELD - (2050) - DAY 186

          It's spring and a ten year old girl watches her mother as she
          lays out a picnic on a blanket on the ground.

          MOTHER
          Ellen, why do you look so serious?

          ELLEN
          I'm going to remember this moment
          for the rest of my life, mama. And
          in exactly twenty years, come here
          with my daughter and have exactly
          the same picnic.

          MOTHER
          Baby, that's the loveliest thing
          I've ever heard.

          Ellen lies in bed watching Eric sleep next to her.

          ELLEN
          There was supposed to be something
          else. I was to have something. A
          calm. A love. Children. A child,
          at least. Children. Meaning. I
          am always on the verge, never more
          than a tiny shove from tears. I
          can feel them in my chest now.
          That squeezing pressure. And it
          is so tempting to let go, but I am
          afraid, the next time maybe, I will
          never stop crying. I miss my
          husband even though he is lying
          here. He hates me. Oh God. I
          have disappointed him and he hates
          me. The one person who should be
          able to see me and he won't look.
          He will never look again.

          MORNING
          Caden lies on his back, and opens his eyes. His pumps drone.

          CADEN
          (quietly, mournfully)
          Eric.
          Caden looks over. No note from Adele. He gets out of bed,
          glances in the mirror, seems surprised by his reflection.

          189INT. 31Y BATHROOM (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2050 - MORNING 189

          Caden sits on the toilet and pees. He wipes himself.

          Caden vacuums the hall.

          MILLICENT'S VOICE
          My period is late this month. I
          wonder what's going on. I'm
          bloated. I wish it would come.

          turns off the light, and lies on his back with his eyes open.

          MILLICENT'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Maybe I can ask Adele for a raise.
          It's been three years. I do a good
          job. God, I'm so tired tonight.
          I'm getting old. I'm lonely here.

          Get up. Look at the night table

          Caden gets up and glances at the night table. A type-written

          NOTE:

          MALE VOICE
          Adele died of lung cancer last
          night. You may stay on if you
          like.

          MILLICENT'S VOICE
          Look shocked. Weep.
          Caden looks shocked, then weeps.

          MILLICENT'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Go into the kitchen and --
          The voice stops. Caden stops. He waits. Nothing. He takes
          out the earpiece and looks at it, shakes it, then slips it
          back in his ear. Nothing. He waits. In the distance he
          hears wailing and gun shots.

          194 INT. 31Y WALK-IN CLOSET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2053 - NIGHT 194

          The lights are out. Caden sits on the bed, still waiting.

          195 INT. 31Y WALK-IN CLOSET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2055 - DAY 195

          Caden sits on the bed, his head slumped against the
          headboard, sleeping. Distant explosions wake him. He opens
          his eyes and sits up straight, and waits. He taps his ear.

          196 INT. 31Y HALLWAY (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2055 - NIGHT196

          The hall is very dark. Caden exits apartment 31Y. Old
          person #2 (actor) stands in the hallway and faces away,
          unmoving. Caden walks past and nods. Old person #2 does not
          respond. Caden presses the elevator button.

          197INT. WAREHOUSE - 31Y BUILDING STAIRWELL - 2055 - CONTINUOUS 197

          Dark. The unfinished, back-of-a-facade of the set is
          apparent. Caden walks down endless plywood stairs. The
          bowels of the building: fake water pipes, electrical cords.

          198EXT. CITY STREET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2055 - MORNING198

          No lights. Vague daylight drifts in from high warehouse
          windows, from which cardboard has fallen. Deadly quiet,
          abandoned. Caden passes the occasional body on the street.
          Fires smolder in buildings. The streets are flooded with
          sewer water. Buildings are draped with massive tarps. Behind
          a fence are piles of bodies.

          A199 EXT. BURNING HOUSE (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2055 - MORNINGA199

           He passes the Hazel's House set, burnt to the ground.

          Caden panics. He pulls out his earpiece, shakes it, and puts
          it back. He walks.

          Caden reaches the beach set, and drives the cart on the sand.
          He sees footprints. He gets out and follows them, spots a
          woman ahead walking with a suitcase. He hurries as much as
          he can with his limp, his weakness, his ancient body, to
          catch up with her.

          CADEN
          Hello.
          The woman turns. She's middle-aged, face radiating kindness.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          Where is everybody?

          WOMAN
          Mostly dead. Some have left.

          CADEN
          Would you sit with me for a moment?
          I'm very tired. And lonely.
          The woman smiles at Caden. They sit on a log.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          I feel like I know you.

          WOMAN
          I was the mother in Ellen's dream.
          Perhaps from there.

          CADEN
          Yes! That's it. Yes. You seem a
          bit older than I remember.

          WOMAN

          (CHUCKLING)
          That dream was quite a while ago.
          He's silent. The woman touches his hand.

          Everyone's dreams in all those

          we'll never know. That's the truth
          of it -- all the thoughts nobody
          will ever know.

          WOMAN
          It's true.

          CADEN
          I'm sorry the experiment didn't
          work. I wanted it to with all my
          heart. I wanted to do that picnic
          with my daughter. I feel I've
          disappointed you terribly.

          WOMAN
          No. No. I am so proud of you.
          Caden starts to tear up.

          CADEN
          All I want is someone to see me,
          someone to look at me with
          kindness. For me to be the most
          special person in the world to just
          one person.

          WOMAN
          I know, baby. I know.
          He looks at her tentatively. She's looking into his eyes
          directly, clearly, kindly. She smiles.

          WOMAN (CONT'D)
          You're going to be fine.
          Caden starts to weep so hard he chokes. Strings of snot pour
          from his nose. The woman holds him, gently takes off his
          wig, and strokes his sparse hair. He looks out over her
          shoulder at the dark empty city at the far end of the
          warehouse. His rheumy eyes light up.

          CADEN
          I know what to do with this play
          now. I have an idea. I think --
          The screen goes black fast.
