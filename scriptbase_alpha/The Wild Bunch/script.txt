          FADE IN:

          OUTSKIRTS OF A SOUTH TEXAS RAILROAD YARD (SAN RAFAEL)

          A TRAIN ROARS PAST REVEALING IN THE DISTANCE FIVE MET RIDING
          TOWARD CAMERA along the tracks. In CLOSE F.G. is.the back
          part of a sign.

          NARRATOR
          To most of America in 1913, the Age
          of Innocence had arrived and the
          stories of the Indian Wars and the
          Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters
          had become either barroom ballyhoo
          or front-porch remiraiscences... .But
          on both sides of the $io Grande men
           still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's
          and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a
          changing land.
          THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY..
          The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are
          regulation.
          PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead
          of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain...
          Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early
          forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant
          for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes
          in himself and those around him.
          Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are
          not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a
          killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for
          trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside
          and against society because he believes in that way of life
          and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of
          regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man'
          according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad,
          and he wouldn't have it any other way.
          Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant.
          Dutch is bigâ€ž good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong
          loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and
          regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm,
          but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one.
          Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH,
          dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot
          tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and

          sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal,
          vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing
          for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go.
          They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each
          other and that is limited.
          A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL.
          Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle
          20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty
          under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with
          Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them
          all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent
          dignity of. man (some men at least). " He is faster than his
          companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't.
          laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride --
          Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,.
          he will have no regrets.
          REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin
          to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order.

          4 THE SIGN READS IN RAILROAD LETTERS: SAN RAFAEL, TEXAS
           And underneath, someone has printed:

          PIKE' AND ' DUTCH STARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE SIGN, slightly
          bemused. _

          DUTCH
          Make you feel welcome?

          PIKE

          (DRYLY)
          It helps..

          TEC TOR
          What's it say?

          ANGEL
          (baiting him)
          It invites us to stay with the community
          and grow. It is here, perhaps with time
          and small miracle -- that you could be
          taught to read.

          Tector looks at Angel for a long moment, then turns to Pike.

          TECTOR
          I never enlisted to serve with no
          smart-mouthed kid.

          ANGEL
          Nor I with dogs.

          DUTCH
          (grinning at Pike)
           ITd like to transfer to another unit --
           there seems to be dissension in the
          ranks.

           PIKE
          (t0 Teotor and Angel)
          Itll transfer both of you -- just one
          more word.
          They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs
          his horse and the group sta'ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM
          PAST. THE STATt.ON Aï¿½M BOXCARS into a side street.

          EXT.. MAIN SQUARE OF SAN RAFAEL DAY


          THE SQUARE. SHOWS THE MEXICAN/SPANISH INFLUENCE AND.IS CROWDED
          with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are. milling
          about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the
          look of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn
          heritage. The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.-
          Riding downethe street they pass:
          A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a
          W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass
          drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on
          inside.

          SPEAKER (OS)
          Leviticus. 10.9. Do not drink wine or
          strong drink thou,nor thy sons with
          thee least ye die. It shall be a
          statute forever. Look. not though. upon.
          the. wine when it. is red when it giveth
          his color in the cup when it moveth
          itself aright at the last it biteth
          like a serpent and stingeth like an
          adder.

          (THEN)
          That is in the good book.. but here in
          this town, it is five cents a glass.
          Five cents a glass, does anyone think
          that that is really the price of a
          ----drink? The price of a drink let him
          decide who has lost his courage and his
          pride and who lies a govelling heap
          of clay not far removed from a beast
          today.-

          CONGREGATION (OS)
          I hereby solemnly procaise, God helping
          me, to abstain from all di stilled, fer-

          beer and cider, and to employ all proper
          means to discourage the Ilse of and.

          AS THE GROUP RIDES AROUND THE SQUARE,. THREE. SOLDIERS,
          ABE,. PHIL AND BURT, at the hitching rail on one side of the
          street,. turn and keep pace with the group on horseback.

          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE THREE OTHER SOLDIERS,

          BUCK, FRANK AND CRAZY LEE, DO THE SAME.

          10 PIKE AND HIS GROUP RIDE PAST THE GENERAL STORE AND THE

          SALOON. AT Tï¿½- END OF THE STREET, THEY DISMOUNT ACROSS FROM
          THE YELLOW AND BROWN RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. As
          they swing out of the saddle the other ' soldiers' join them.
          1l.' PIKE AND HIS COMPANIONS REMOVE EMPTY SADDLE BAGS FROM their
          horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds
          the'square. Some passersby look curiously.

          PIKE
          (after a moment, a little

          AWKWARDLY)
          Fall in -- and follow me.
          The men,. with the 'exception of Tector, Phil and Abe, shuffle
          into a ragged column of twos.

           BUCK
           Real quiet, 'sir.'
           Pike looks at the horses, then at:

          13, THE SIGN OVER THE ENTRANCE OF A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
           It reads: PECOS AND SOUTH TEXAS R.R.
          14. PIKE PAUSES. FOR A MINUTE and behind him the men surreptitious-
          ly touch their holstered forty-five automatics. Pike leaves
          the boardwalk, crossing toward. the railroad office. Tector
          and Phil stay with the horses.

          PIKE AND DUTCH, LOOKING AROUND AS THEY LEAVE. THE BOARDWALK,

          ACCIDENTALLY BUMP INTO A LADY SHOPPER, WHO DROPS HER PACIKAGE.

          PIKE
          (removing his hat)
          Beg pardon, Ma'am.

          DUTCH
          (as she stops)
          Let. me, Ma'am.
          Dutch picks up the package, Pike offers the lady his arm.
          She hesitates, accepts. Pike and Dutch, followed by the
          others, lead her across the 'street.

          16. ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING OPPOSITE THE RAILROAD OFFICE ARE

          TEN. MEN STRETCHED OUT BEHIND THE FALSE FRONT T_DLY WATCHING
          THE CROWD BELOW, THEIR RIFLES AT THEIR SIDES Behind them.
          on the flat of the roof are open bedrolls, and the remains of
          at least three meals. It is hot., they have been there a -long
          time, and they are tired.

          17., PAT HARRIGAN, A DAPPER, SELF-IMPORTANT, BACK=SHOOTING RAIL-

          ROAD EXECUTIVE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEN -- ALL RAGGED
          HARDCASES -- frowns a little as he watches the soldiers in
          the street below. It is. hotter than hell on the tin roof and
          he is sweating heavily. He turns, edges forward, then nudges:
          18, DEKE THORNTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM, his back against the wall,
          Thornton is a hard-bodied, quiet-spoken man, with a lined
          face and the embittered manner of someone who has changed
          sides to stay alive and while part of his life has gone out
          of him with the change, the personal integrity by which he
          has lived is still. intact.

           Thornton straightens, turns slowly, looks -- stiffens a
          little.

           Pike?

          THORN TON
          (after a long moment)
          He's there.
          The bounty hunters react and prepare to fire. Over this shot
          is the sound of Pike calling to Thornton -- from the past.
          19 PIKE REACHES THE DOOR AND WITHOUT PAUSING, murmurs 'goodbye'
          to the lady and enters, followed by the others,
          20 ON THE ROOF, HARRIGAN WHIRLS ON HIS MEN as they begin aim-
          â€¢ing, ready to fire..

           Thornton turns toward him, his.face white, remembering-

          24 PIES AND THE OTHERS waiting, he steps to the ody window,
          smiling with the thought that their visit means. military
          business for the railroad. His mood. changes as the men draw
          their\guns and Pike steps towards him.

          PAYMASTER

          What is it?...What do you want?
          25 DUTCH., LYLE AND THE. OTHER MEN SWIFTLY MOVE behind the
          counter. Pike ignores the paymaster and turns to:
          26 CRAZY LEE STRINGFELLOW,. a young, compulsive killer with just
           enough sense to. pour piss out of a boot (if the instructions
           were printed on the heel: (the instructions are -- to pour,
          tip!)

           PIKE
           If they move, kill them.
           C.L. grins happily and squats on the floor, his 12 gauge
          pump shotgun angled up at:

          parade picks up kids and other scoffing supporters as it
          moves around the square. . People and their children are
          crowding through the trees to the boardwalk to watch the band.
          and group of believers following the_,. in a formation that is

          roof, ,causing him to.yelp with pain.. The others snap a look

          shoulders.

          INTO THE OFFICE. The sound of the band is drowned out by
          gunfire and screams. C.L. frowns a little.

          C.L.
          They was playing "Gather at the
          River." You know that one?

          PIKE, HAVING DIFFICULTY MOUNTING HIS HORSE, LOOKS UP,
          HESITATES, recognizes Deke, then snaps off a shot which

          89 THE WILD BUNCH RIDES DOWN A STEEP TRAIL INTO A DRY ARROYO
           They are weary, but determined. Buck, last in line, covered
           with blood, is swaying in the saddle. Although severely
           wounded, he still clutches the bags of silver.
          90 REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE ARROYO THE MEN SPUR their horses
           across the d r y stream bed and up the steep bank on. t he other
          side.

          91 DUTCH AND PIKE ARE IN THE LEAD. BEHIND THEM THE OTHERS LUNGE
           UP IN SINGLE FILE. Angel, second to last, reaches the top,
          turns as:

          92 BUCK, NOW COMPLETELY BLIND, FALLS BACKWARD OVER THE REAR OF

           HIS HORSE, HITS THE GROUND AND SOMERSAULTS BACKWARDS TO THE
           BOTTOM, still clutching the saddle bags.
          93 ANGEL PULLS UP and calls to Pike.

           ANGEL
          Fijate.
          94 BUCK, ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES, MOANS WITH PAIN as he attempts
          to crawl up the slope.

          looking down.

          Buck lurches forward, grabbing at Pike who steps back, Pike
          crosses to his horse, and painfully climbs into the saddle.

          BUCK
          (dying, almost incoherent
          with pain)
          I kin still -ride...I can't see, but I
          kin ride...
           - (then)
           No, I can't --

          99 BUCK, ON HIS KNEES, â€¢ IS CAUGHT SQUARE BY THE. SHO T AND HURLED
          OVER BACKWARDS. He slides several feet over the smooth,
          round pebbles of the wash, then is still.
          Pike turns his horse and spurs it . up the slope.
          100 THE MEN WATCH SILENTLY AS PIKE RIDES UP. and halts. They
          don't move, all looking down-at-Buck.

          PIKE

          The following scenes will be superimposed over 101 and 102.
          The suite consists of three adjoining rooms and is very
          plush indeed,
          TWO VERY BEAUTIFUL-YOUNG WOMEN in revealing night dress are
          hindering more than helping, a somewhat loaded Pike Bishop
          as he attempts to get into his clothes. The ladies are
          giggling. and there is a great deal of grab-ass between the
          three. -
          101-B THORNTON, fully dressed and looking very sharp in his big
          city clothes, enters from one of. the adjoining rooms.
          ELIZABETH, a tall, lovely near-naked,.dark-haired girl,
          follows him and takes his arm possessively. For a moment
          both watch:
          101-C PIKE'S girls'effectively stop his half-hearted attempts and
          begin disrobing him.

          The other men pursue.P.ike as the Deputy bends down and

          of gunfire is heard from the street outside, then two of

          AT A SMALL DESK IN FRONT OF THE OTHER BOUNTY HUNTERS,
          The interior of the room is tawdry, disorderly and smells
          bad. The bare walls are decorated with pin-ups from the
          Police Gazette.
          The men sit attentively on the bunks. and.foot lockers.,
          Harrigan is marking beside their names in a large ledger

          killed less my commi.sson amounts
          to. one hundred and fifty dollars.

          A young boy takes their horses while an old.man and his
          wounded son (the father of the boy) watch. Behind them,
          an ancient woman pays no attention as she slaps tortillas
          into shape. Two small children watch, big-eyed.
          ;113 THE MEN ARE QUIET WITH FATIGUE AS THEY DISMOUNT AND TIE. j

          111 PIKE TAKES THE BAGS OUT OF THE CORRAL TO THE FIRE that burns
          near an adobe wall and drops them on a poncho, watches as
          the others do the same.

          SYKES

          Pike looks at him silently. He has heard this kind of

          to death of it. Lyle finally looks awa- at his brother;

          143 SUDDENLY SYKES SLIPS AND LOSES HIS-FOOTING. He falls

          FORWARD:
          PULLING THE FIVE HORSES DOWN WITH HIM.. Unable to
          control his slide he collides with/Tector who is next in
          line. Tector's fall starts a p fain reaction in which
          all the men slide to the bottom of ttLe hill.
          145 PICKING UP SPEED THEY TUMBLE TO THE BOTTOM and land in
          a giant cloud of. dust. There. is a: profusion of coughing
          and swearing as the men and-animals struggle to their
          feet..
          146 TECTOR STANDS,. CURSES AT SYKES,. then picks up a. stone
          and throws it at.the old man who is hit and falls
          backward.

          147 PIKE GRABS TECTOR'AND SWINGS HIM AROU3D...

           (his anger growing)
          We don.'t get rid of nobody
          we stick together -- just like
          it used to be -- when you side
          aman you stay with him --
          (shaking him)
           If you can't do that you're worse
          than some animal -- you're finished --
          we're finished -- all of us!
          Tector looks at him silently.
          148 PIKE TURNS TO MOUNT THE HORSE. Placing his foot in
          the stirrup he stiffly starts to swing on. The leather
          breaks and. he falls under the animal. Landing on his
          back, he lets out a loud shriek.

           ready to mount his horse hesitates, but doesn't move to
          help.
          150 PIKE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET. None of them move forward
          to help him and he doesn't expect them to. He is
          visibly miserable as he recovers the reins of his
          animal and tears off the.broken leather.

          Riding with 'Brother Pike' and old

          ain't time to pick up his chips

          at Pike)
          How in hell are you going to side any-
          body if you can't get on a horse.
          152 PIKE LOOKS AT THEM, THEN STEPS onto the makeshift stirrup
          and mounts, concealing his pain, taking a few seconds to
          gather up the reins and position himself. In the b.g.,
          Dutch swings onto his horse.

          PIKE

          My people don't have guns so Mapache
          takes the food out of their mouths
          and clothes off their backs. With
          guns my village could fight, If I
          could take guns to my people I would
          go with you -- but not just for
          gold,
          232 THE MEN ARE MOMENTARILY SILENT. Angel lifts a bucket
          of water, spills part of it on his head, passes it to Sykes
          who drinks a little of the water, spits it out, puts the
          bucket down, pours two bottles of tequilla into it,
          drinks. again -- smiles, passes it to Angel, who drinks
          and passes it on.

          way of collecting from Mapache 'cept
          off a lot of dead bodies -- mostly
          ours, the way he thinks.
          Pike considers this -- looks at the old man, finally
          nods .

          ANGEL
          I would take guns ...if Mapache found
          out, you would say I stole them,

          almost. unbearable.

          You never told me how you got all

          236 PIKE REFLECTS FOR A MOMENT. His face is almost white.;
          Then he reaches in his saddle bag and pulls out a bottle.
          He drinks, passes the bottle to Dutch..

          PIKE

           Pike 'grins a little at what now seems an absurd thought.

          steps into the room, a_double barreled shot gun in his
          hands ready to fire.
          AURORA SCREAMS and throws herself in front of Pike. Luke
          fires, the charge killing her as Pike dives out of bed --
          jumping for his gun on a nearby table.
          LUKE FIRES AGAIN, the blast catching Pike across the thigh
          and knee. Pike goes down. Luke crosses to the bed and
          sits watching him writhing almost bleeding to death on the

          She had a husband and I should have had

          and I got careless. One night he.walked in

          315 THORNTON FORCES his terrified animal across the tottering
           structure, then whirls as a bullet whines past his head.
           The shot has come from behind. Above and through the trees
          he can see:

          are lounging underneath it. Pieces of brush are tied behind
          the rear wheels of the wagon to brush away the trail. Pike
          and Dutch stand and move back toward the wagon.

          the back.

          458 PIKE IS SPRAWLED OVER A NATIVE HAMMOCK, drunk.. He lifts a
          bottle of mescale and takes a drink.
          459 ON THE FLOOR OF THE HUT A SAD BUT NOT UNATTRACTIVE WOMAN is
          sitting looking at a handful of silver in her hand. In one
          corner a baby whines as the flies bother it.
          Through an open door leading to another room,.the drunken
          voices of the Gorch brothers can be heard as they bargain
          with DELORES, a very reluctant prostitute.

          LYLE (OS)

           TECTOR (O.S )

          460 PIKE WATCHES THE WOMAN AND THE BABY FOR A MOMENT LONGER THEN
           SUDDENLY SWINGS OUT OF THE HAMMOCK and steps into the ad-
          joining room.
          461. LYLE GORCH LOOKS UP AT HIM BLEARILY FROM A HAMMOCK. Tector is
          on the floor embracing the disheveled woman.
