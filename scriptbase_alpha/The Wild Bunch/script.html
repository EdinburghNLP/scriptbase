<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          1.
</b>
<b>          FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          OUTSKIRTS OF A SOUTH TEXAS RAILROAD YARD (SAN RAFAEL)
</b>
<b>          A TRAIN ROARS PAST REVEALING IN THE DISTANCE FIVE MET RIDING
</b>          TOWARD CAMERA along the tracks. In CLOSE F.G. is.the back
          part of a sign.

<b>          NARRATOR
</b>          To most of America in 1913, the Age
          of Innocence had arrived and the
          stories of the Indian Wars and the
          Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters
          had become either barroom ballyhoo
          or front-porch remiraiscences... .But
          on both sides of the $io Grande men
           still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's
          and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a
          changing land.
          THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY..
          The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are
          regulation.
          PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead
          of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain...
          Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early
          forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant
          for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes
          in himself and those around him.
          Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are
          not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a
          killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for
          trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside
          and against society because he believes in that way of life
          and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of
          regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man'
          according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad,
          and he wouldn't have it any other way.
          Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant.
          Dutch is bigâ€ž good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong
          loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and
          regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm,
          but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one.
          Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH,
          dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot
          tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and

</b>
<b>          2 CONTINUED
</b>          sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal,
          vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing
          for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go.
          They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each
          other and that is limited.
          A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL.
          Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle
          20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty
          under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with
          Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them
          all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent
          dignity of. man (some men at least). " He is faster than his
          companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't.
          laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride --
          Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,.
          he will have no regrets.
          REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin
          to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order.

<b>          4 THE SIGN READS IN RAILROAD LETTERS: SAN RAFAEL, TEXAS
</b>           And underneath, someone has printed:

<b>           Wï¿½LCO ME TO SAN RAFAEL

<b>           FOUNDED 1703, POPULATION 5

<b>          STAY ON AND GROW WITH OUR COMMUNITY
</b>          PIKE' AND ' DUTCH STARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE SIGN, slightly
          bemused. _

<b>          DUTCH
</b>          Make you feel welcome?

<b>          TEC TOR
</b>          What's it say?

<b>          ANGEL
</b>          (baiting him)
          It invites us to stay with the community
          and grow. It is here, perhaps with time
          and small miracle -- that you could be
          taught to read.

</b>          Tector looks at Angel for a long moment, then turns to Pike.

<b>          TECTOR
</b>          I never enlisted to serve with no
          smart-mouthed kid.

<b>          ANGEL
</b>          Nor I with dogs.

<b>          DUTCH
</b>          (grinning at Pike)
           ITd like to transfer to another unit --
           there seems to be dissension in the
          ranks.

<b>           PIKE
</b>          (t0 Teotor and Angel)
          Itll transfer both of you -- just one
          more word.
          They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs
          his horse and the group sta'ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM
          PAST. THE STATt.ON Aï¿½M BOXCARS into a side street.

<b>          EXT.. MAIN SQUARE OF SAN RAFAEL DAY

<b>          THE SQUARE. SHOWS THE MEXICAN/SPANISH INFLUENCE AND.IS CROWDED
</b>          with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are. milling
          about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the
          look of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn
          heritage. The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.-
          Riding downethe street they pass:
          A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a
          W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass
          drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on
          inside.

<b>          SPEAKER (OS)

          strong drink thou,nor thy sons with

<b>          (THEN)
</b>          That is in the good book.. but here in
          this town, it is five cents a glass.
          Five cents a glass, does anyone think
          that that is really the price of a
          ----drink? The price of a drink let him
          decide who has lost his courage and his
          pride and who lies a govelling heap

          they swing out of the saddle the other ' soldiers' join them.

          horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds

           Pike looks at the horses, then at:

</b>           It reads: PECOS AND SOUTH TEXAS R.R.
          14. PIKE PAUSES. FOR A MINUTE and behind him the men surreptitious-
          ly touch their holstered forty-five automatics. Pike leaves
          the boardwalk, crossing toward. the railroad office. Tector
          and Phil stay with the horses.

          again, a man dying each time he pulls the trigger..
          502. PIKE WATCHES AS HE TENSES, FINALLY JERKS THE BAYONET out of
          his body, runs firing at five of the soldiers. who are rushing
          the room -- kills two,. reaches the machine gun, pulls Mohr
          away from the gun, ,jerks back the bolt. and staggers as a
          soldier empties his pistol into him from behind, Pike him-
          self turns and dies,
          503 DUTCH SWINGS THE RIFLE, firing, crippling the soldier, then:
          504 ANOTHER SOLDIER, HIS UNIFORM STAINED WITH BLOOD, draws his
          knife and hardly able to move, falls on Dutch -- the weight
          of the.fall-burying the weapon deep into Dutch's back.
          Crumpled together, both.men die,

          then falls, firing blindly into the. dust. Somewhere outside

          506 IN THE COURTYARD A SMALL GROUP OF WOMEN wrapped in. black
          robosas are burning candles and moving. among the dead bodies.
          that spill out of the large room of the hacienda and into the
          yard. It is a scene of carnage, blood now black in.the sun,
          a million flies and the walls lined with waiting vultures.
          There is no sign of soldiers anywhere.. A few of the bodies
          have been dragged into the courtyard. Most, including Pike,
          Dutch and the others, including Mapache, lie where they fell.

<b>          507 THE BOUNTY HUNTERS, LED BY THORNTON, RIDE UP TO THE ARCHES
</b>          AND DISMOUNT, their horses snorting nervously at the smell of
          blood and the stench of death. At-the end of the courtyard
          where five corpses are heaped in a small Di13, a lone vulture
          stands. patiently near them.
          As the bounty hunters approach and the-.bird labors reluctantly
          into flight, the men dismount.
          Thornton, looking in through the broken wall, turns away.
          Coffer and T.C. enter, whistle softly..
