          1 INT. GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER - RIGHT (SEPTEMBER) 1

          Electric' doors zip open. ALEC NEWBERRY, a handsome
          possessor of The Right Stuff, his beautiful roommate
          LESLIE HUNTER, KEVIN DOLENZ, self-styled, chain-
          smoking, sardonic, and KIRBO KREAGER, short, hyper,
          dressed like a waiter -- dash worriedly into the busy
          emergency room. They are all twenty-two, or barely
          twenty-two. Only four months out of college, they are
          in their freshman year of life.
          Alec, Leslie, Kevin and Kirbo dash past a cubicle, where
          a totally naked, three-hundred-pound man paces in a daze.
          Past this, they find a black nurse talking with two COPS.

                         ALEC
          Wendy Beamish and Billy Hicks?
          They were in a car accident?

                         ELECTRIC DOORS
          zip open again, introducing JULIANNA VAN PATTER (JULES),
          another freshman in life, but her sleek style gives her
          a certain sexual sophistication. She is accompanied by
          her dark, interesting DATE as she joins her friends and
          the Cops.

                         JULES
          They're dead, aren't they?
          Everyone ignores her as Alec hands his card to the Cops.

                         ALEC
          Officers, I'm Alec Newberry with
          Congressman Langston's office.
          Leslie whispers to Jules, while Alec and the Cops talk.

                         LESLIE
          I think they're okay.

                         JULES
          Thank God.

                         (BEAT)
          Are you aware there's a three-
          hundred-pound man walking around
          naked?

          WENDY BEAMISH, a sweet-faced, insecure preppy, emerges
          from a first-aid room with a bandaged forehead.

                         HER FRIENDS
          Wendy. Oh, my God. Are you
          all right???

                         WENDY
          I'm fine. It's the car my father
          gave me for graduation that's
          totalled.

                         ALEC

                         (TO KEVIN)
          Find Billy. See if you can sober
          him up.
          Kevin always does what Alec tells him to. Meanwhile,
          Wendy pulls out her Visa card and speaks to the nurse.

                         WENDY
          How much do I owe you?

                         JULES
          He almost killed you. Destroyed
          your car, and you're paying...?

                         LESLIE
          Jules, please.
          As Leslie comforts her, Wendy is looking over Jules' Date
          who hovers in the distance.

                         WENDY
          Is that your date?
          The naked man wanders past them.

                         JULES
          No, that's my date!
          As usual, Jules has managed to make Wendy laugh, Just as
          the Cops approach her.

                         COP # 1
          You pressing charges?

                         WENDY
          No.

          You're a little late, Counselor.
          He's in the van giving blood right
          now.
          The Cops start toward the electric doors as Kirbo and
          Alec follow. Leslie helps Wendy with the bill. CAMERA
          FINDS Jules whispering dramatically to her Date.

                         JULES
          I'll have to be with her all night.
          They don't know if she's going to
          make it.

                         DATE
          She looks fine.

          Shock. She could black out at any
          second... I'll call you...
          Jules joins Leslie and Wendy.

                         LESLIE
          He's cute.

                         JULES
          Too young... and don't you both
          start on your father complex
          theory.

          2 EXT. MEDICAL CENTER 2

          Alec and Kirbo follow the Cops toward a mobile van.

                         KIRBO
          We're dealing with a first offender
          here, and since Ms. Beamish doesn't
          want to press charges, whaddya say
          we just let this one slide,
          Officers?
          They reach the back of the mobile van, where we see BILLY
          HICKS, a handsome daredevil, playing his saxophone,
          wearing handcuffs, for two good-looking nurses and Kevin,
          who is trying to give him black coffee.

                         COP $1
          Okay, you're under arrest.
          Alec looks to Kevin for information about Billy's
          condition.

          I wouldn't strike a match near his
          blood.

                         BILLY

                         (TO COPS)
          Hey, watch my sax...

                         (TO NURSES)
          . You girls believe in premarital
          sax?
          They laugh as Alec barks at him.

                         ALEC
          Billy -- four months after
          graduation and you're still
          acting like every night's a
          fraternity party. Aren't you
          even concerned about Wendy?

                         BILLY

                         (TRUE PANIC)
          Wendy? Jesus, how bad is it?

                         KEVIN
          Severe. She might have finally
          exceeded the limit on her father's
          Visa.
          Billy smiles with relief as the Cops lead him toward
          their car.

                         ALEC
          Will you both get serious. He's
          being arrested for drunk driving.

                         BILLY
          Drunk maybe. But I don't know if
          you could call that driving.
          Wendy, Leslie and Jules come from the hospital, just in
          time to see Billy being put into the cop car. Wendy
          rushes to Billy and they embrace.

                         BILLY
          Sorry, babe... sorry.

                         WEHDY
          We'll be right behind you!
          They all move toward Alec's car except Kirbo, who sud-
          denly notices'someone. He becomes mesmerized as he falls
          away from the group and starts back for the hospital.

          He enters and begins to pick up speed as he quickly
          catches up to a beautiful INTERN in a white lab coat.

                         KIRBO
          Dale?... Dale Biberman?
          She hesitates, somewhat puzzled.

                         KIRBO
          You don't remember me.

                         DALE
          I do, but I'm trying...

                         KIRBO
          Kirby Kreager. You were a senior
          when I started Georgetown.

                         DALE
          Kirby... It's been four years.
          How are you?

                         KI RBO
          I graduated!

                         DALE
          I always knew you would.

                         KIRBO
          And I'm a lawyer.
          (as she looks at
          his waiter's duds)
          I mean I'm a waiter, studying to
          be a lawyer... and you became a
          doctor... Just like you said you
          would.

                         DALE
          Almost. I'm finishing my clinical.

                         KIRBO
          Dale Biberman. I can't believe
          it. Do you still like Woody Allen
          movies?
          There is a big COMMOTION at the other and of the hail.

                         DALE
          I've got to go. Nice seeing you.
          She races down the hall, joining paramedics wheeling in
          a large black man on a gurney. His hysterical wife runs
          screaming behind them.

          Dale helps them maneuver the gurney down the hall, leaving
          a small black child, alone and frightened, in their wake.
          Dale comes running back and picks up the child. Kirbo
          watches, as the rest of the hospital moves in real time,
          but Dale, comforting the frightened child, moves in

          ROMANTIC SLOW MOTION. SONG BEGINS.

          and runs into the street toward Alec's old Oldsmobile.

           Alec drives while Leslie tends to Wendy between them.
           Billy, Kirbo and Kevin are in the back seat, with Jules

                         BILLY
          Alec, could you kinds burn a little
          rubber?
          Alec turns the corner as Billy continues.

          It's still sticky.

          Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin holds the door open,
          but no one thanks him.

          A young, burned-out UNDERGRAD (CLAYTON) follows.

          8 INT. ST. ELMO'S - HIGHT 8

          Young professionals, graduate students, and precocious
          undergrads populate the P.J. Clarke-like bar/restaurant.
          Kirbo quickly goes back to work waiting tables. Alec gets
          rid of a group of rowdy undergrads sitting at two tables
          pushed together. He admonishes WALLY, the burly owner.

                         ALEC
          Wally! You let undergrad punks
          at our tables???

          Relax, Alec... they've only been
          there ten minutes.

                         ALEC
          Yeah, well, we've been here for
          four years.
          Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin and Billy (still with
          sax around his neck) take their usual chairs as Kirbo
          drops off a large pitcher of beer.

                         BILLY
          Hey, I need a real drink.
          Kirbo is long gone. Kevin pours.

          Waiters are like cops. Never
          around when you need one.
          Kevin and Alec begin bouncing quarters from the edge of a
          table into their beers -- obviously some ritual.

          Thanks, Alec. You're still my
          Indiana Jones. Always coming to
          my rescue.

                         ALEC
          I just know better than to try and
          break the umbilical cord between
          two old roommates. Good night,
          Jules.
          Leslie kisses Jules and goes into the bedroom with Alec.

          17 INT. KEVIN AND KIRBO'S APARTMENT - MIGHT (LATER) 17

          Dirty laundry and Woody Allen posters. Kevin sits in the
          middle of the mess looking at photographs longingly. He
          wears camouflage shirts, a black beret and shades --
          drinks brandy and writhes in orgiastic ecstasy as he
          sings along with JANIS JOPLIN.

                         KEVIN

          TAKE IT... TAKE ANOTHER LITTLE

          PIECE OF MY HEART NOW, DARLIN'...
          Kirbo enters carrying his bike, and Kevin immediately
          hides the photographs in a straw basket and becomes his
          sophisticated self.

                         KEVIN
          Quick, what's the meaning of life?

                         KIRBO
          Dale Biberman.
          Kevin looks puzzled as Kirbo hangs up his bike.

                         KIRBO
          The girl I fell in love with when
          we were freshmen. Remember, I met
          her at that big fountain on main
          campus? The one that says
          'Knowledge, Art, Religion, Life'...
          she was sitting on the 'Life' side
          and she smiled at me.

                         KEVIN
          You took her to one movie! That's
          not love, it's infatuation!
          Kirbo searches madly through records strewn on the floor.

          Kevin, there are several
          quintessential moments in a man's
          life... losing his virginity...
          He yanks JANIS JOPLIN OFF abruptly.

                         KIRBO
          ... Getting married... becoming a
          father.

          Janis Joplin for the soundtrack
          from Manhattan???

                         KIRBO
          And having the right girl
          smile at you. She has the whitest
          teeth I've ever seen.
          "RHAPSODY IN BLUE" fills the room. Kevin begins gathering
          up his endless pieces of paper, notes, etc.

                         KEVIN
          If you think I'm going to live
          through another year of finding
          poorly written, unmailed love
          scratchings around this apartment.

                         KIRBO
          I found her again. It's fate.
          It's true love. I have her
          hospital schedule!

                         KEVIN
          Love is just an illusion created
          by lawyer-types like yourself to
          perpetuate another illusion called
          marriage to create the reality of
          divorce and the illusory need for
          divorce lawyers. Did you know
          there are more people in law school
          right now than there are lawyers on
          the planet?

                         KIRBO
          You're just bitter, 'cause you
          haven't had sex for a long time.

                         KEVIN
          No wonder. The sexual revolution?
          Who won?

          Nobody... It used to be that sex
          was the only free thing in the
          world. No longer. Palimony,
          alimony. All financial. Love's
          an illusion.
          Finally having gathered up all his notes, Kevin moves
          toward the bedroom.

                         KIRBO
          It's the only illusion that counts.

          Insurrection... Now, come on, Kevin,
          you must have been in love with
          somebody, sometime...

                         KEVIN
          Once, in junior high. I played
          guitar in a group and fellin love
          with our singer who did 'We've Only
          Just Begun' as sweet as Karen
          Carpenter. I got high on cheap
          champagne and pledged my love.
          Next day she ran off with the bass
          player named Rocky and I traded my
          guitar in for a battered Underwood
          typewriter.

                         LESLIE
          On which you will type your way
          to being one of the most important
          writers in America.

          On which I continue to turn out
          obituaries and very little else...
          Taking out shreds of papers and napkins.

                         KEVIN
          I can't seem to organize any of my
          thoughts into anything of any
          substance.

                         LESLIE
          Maybe you need to stop thinking so
          much and fall in love again.

                         KEVIN
          Love stinks.
          The door opens and Alec arrives home.

                         ALEC
          Hi, guys.
          He kisses Leslie.

                         KEVIN
          Rough day with the right wing,
          dear?
          Alec hands Leslie a red box. She opens it excitedly and
          finds a black lace nightgown. She screams as Alec heads
          for the kitchen.

                         ALEC
          Try it on...
          Leslie makes naughty eyes at Kevin and disappears into
          the bedroom.

                         ALEC
          Leslie has to marry me, soon.

                         KEVIN
          Why, you pregnant? Kidding.
          What's your 'marriage' hurry?

                         ALEC
          When you have a serious
          relationship, Kev, you'll find out
          the problem with living together:
          it's too easy.

                         KEVIN
          Maybe for you and Leslie. You have
          the perfect relationship.

                         I ALEC
           I mean, it's too easy to get out
           of. You either build to something
           bigger -- like marriage -- or one
          day you could make a mistake and
          the person you were living with is
          gone.
          Alec takes a bite of dinner and cringes.

                         ALEC
          I'm going to kill myself.

                         KEVIN
          They're only peppers, Alec.

                         ALEC
          I can't believe what I just did. I
          innocently go to buy the nightgown
          and this amazing blonde salesgirl
          starts coming on to me... we wind up
          doing it standing up in front of a
          three-way mirror in the dressing
          room.
          He lies down on the floor.

                         ALEC
          If Leslie would just marry me, I
          know I wouldn't do stuff like that
          -- it would be a legal violation.

                         KEVIN
          As opposed to tonight's standing
          violation. You think marriage is
          going to make you faithful?

                         ALEC
          Yes.

                         KEVIN
          The idea of two people spending
          their lives together was invented
          by people who were lucky to make
          it to thirty without being eaten
          by dinosaurs. Marriage is obsolete.

                         ALEC
          Dinosaurs are obsolete. Marriage

          Alec dashes into the bedroom. As he opens and then
          closes the door, Kevin sees a flash of Leslie looking

          Kevin passes quietly and she ignores him.

          Why don't you ever ask me if I
          want a date?

                         BLACK HOOKER
          'Cause I thought you were gay.

          Why would you think I'm gay?

                         BLACK HOOKER
          'Cause I never see you with a girl.
          And you always look real strange.

                         KEVIN
          Well, just for your information.
          I happen to be in love with someone
          but they don't know it. I guess
          you wouldn't understand loving
          someone from afar.
          He takes a swig from a bottle in a paper bag.

                         BLACK HOOKER
          Delaware's about as far as I've
          ever gone. Is this person a he
          or a she?
          She takes the bottle and takes a swig.

                         KEVIN
          It's a secret. But I guess you
          wouldn't understand about that,
          either.

                         BLACK HOOKER
          Oh honey, lots of people come to
          me for love and it's a secret.
          He takes his bottle back and goes home.

          smoking. She fakes surprise at Alec's entrance.

                         JULES
          Alec, what are you doing here?
          He quickly grabs her and they leave the suite. The Arabs
          hardly notice.

          They hardly impressed me as the

          You're just paranoid from the coke.
          You know sometimes I think you just
          make up these dramas to test me or
          something.

                         JULES
          That's very interesting, let's

          As Jules connects with her number, Alec starts to head
          out of the hotel in disgust. A beautiful older woman is
          getting her key from the desk and crosses in front of him
          toward the elevators. She and Alec check each other out.
          He smiles. She smiles. As her elevator, arrives, she
          changes her mind and, giving Alec an inviting smile,
          steps into the dimly-lit bar. Alec is torn between
          morality and temptation. Temptation wins as he follows
          the sexy lady.

          Kirbo, dressed in his best, enters the elegant, but empty
          dining room. Searching around quickly, he begins to try
          out various tables. He exchanges floral arrangements at
          one as the austere MAITRE D' approaches as Kirbo peruses
          a menu.

          MR. BEAMISH
          If you'd get married and run a
          franchise like your sisters, you
          wouldn't need to borrow money.

                         WENDY
          I have a job with the Department
          of Human Services, Dad.

          MR. BEAMISH
          That's not a job. It's killing
          time 'til you get married.

                         WENDY
          I'm very committed and I think I
          should get my own apart...
          Suddenly, one of Wendy's Nephews comes running into the
          room excitedly.

                         NEPHEW
          Billy's up on the roof.

          The entire family comes running out of the house. Billy
          is way on top of the three-story house, sitting above
          the cupola and widow's walk, his legs dangling.

          MR. BEAMISH
          Come down from there.

                         RACHEL'
          What, is he crazy?

          MRS. BEAMISH
          I knew it the minute he walked in
          the door...

          All the years we lived here and
          no one ever did this.

          I used to do this at the Prat
          house all the time. Climb out
          from Alec's room onto the roof
          and play my sax.

          Wendy and Billy ignore them as the family screams and
          runs back into the house.

          Not a day does by that I don't
          wish we were all back there.
          Everything made so much sense
          then. Our group being so
          ultimate, so number one.

                         WENDY
          Every group on campus thought
          they were number one.

          I was headed for New York with my
          sax... to become the new Clarence
          Clemmens. Then I met Felicia and
          she got pregnant, or said she was.
          Wendy looks shocked.

                         BILLY
          By the time I found out she had
          lied, she really was pregnant...

          No matter... I probably wouldn't

          You're very talented, Billy.

          School was so damned ultimate.
          Everyday life... there's no way

          Wendy takes a big gulp. They are both awkward and ap-
          prehensive. She turns out a lamp. So does he, but
          knocks it over.

                         WENDY
          Sssssh.
          She waits, and when she realizes no one has heard the
          crash, she sits down on the small loveseat. Billy joins
          her and going to kiss her, knocks her glasses askew.

          WENDY E BILLY
          Sorry...
          He goes to kiss her again and she responds. He pulls up
          her skirt and starts to stroke her legs.

          Blue-collar just smiles. Billy throws himself on top of
          him, slugging. Felicia screams. Alec tries to stop
          them. St. Elmo's watches as Billy and blue-collar beat
          the shit out of each other. Blood flows. Wally, the
          owner, arrives with a baseball bat.

                         WALLY
          Get him outta here.
          Alec, Kevin and Kirbo get Billy moving toward the door.

          Yeah, get outta here... you no-
          good shit.
          Felicia is hurling insults at Billy as she tends to blue-
          collar. Alec and the others drag Billy past Leslie and
          Jules, who look to Ron, who has been hiding behind them
          with a hand in front of his face.

          Wendy is dying, as she watches them take Billy out.

          There is pandemonium as Felicia and Billy pummel each

          Only the very
          young and the very drunk can get away with

          to call love, then you must ask her
          out on a proper date. Like a young

          Well, no sense beating around the
          bush. Wendy, we came to see you
          because we're both worried about
          you.

                         WENDY
          No, Jules, that was the scam that
          Leslie and I worked out because we
          were worried about you.

                         JULES
          Moi? Your were worried about moi?

                         LESLIE
          We were worried about you and this
          affair with your boss.

                         JULES
          Forrester is the greatest...

                         LESLIE
          Forrester is married...

                         JULES
          Leslie, this is the Eighties... I
          bop him for a few years -- get his
          job when he gets caught with his
          hand in the vault. I become a
          legend -- do a black mink ad, but
          get caught in a sex scandal.
          Retire in massive disgrace -- but
          write a huge bestseller and become
          the star of my own talk show.

                         WENDY
          Silly of us to be concerned.

                         JULES
          And besides, Forrester suggested
          some fabulous alternatives for my
          stepmonster...

                         WENDY
          That's another thing. You seem
          obsessed with this woman's dying.
          It's creepy.

                         JULES
          Well, it turned out that cremation
          is almost as expensive as the non-
          torch method -- so if I don't find
          a cheaper solution -- I'll probably
          end up...

          food.

          Who'd want to? I think this was a
          wonderful talk, don't you? Nice
          meeting you, Myra.

          The senior architect I've been

          That's so great.

          Yeah, it worked out really well.

                         WENDY
          That's great. So I guess that
          means marriage now, huh?

                         LESLIE
          It scares me. My sister lived with
          her husband for five years before
          they got married. And now it's over.
          They loved each other so much, but
          somehow it just disappeared.

          I was wondering how long it was
          going to take until you asked.

          It's like stopping smoking. I can
          go as long as I can and then I just
          have to have a hit.

                         LESLIE
          Alec's got him working for some
          Korean gangster, and I actually

          Dale Biberman, dodging the RAIN, leaves her building

          street, watching. He jumps on his bike and follows.

          A carpark helps Dale into the house with an umbrella.

          Dale continues talking with the men as the CAMERA MOVES
          THROUGH the party TOWARD her. The CAMERA is Kirbo.

          Judith disappears into the bedroom as Dale puts out the
          garbage. Kirbo sits for a moment alone, stunned. Dale
          returns.

                         DALE
          And here's the worst of all...
          When I first decided to be a
          doctor, I thought it was because
          I wanted to serve people. But
          now, well, I'm beginning to get
          this funny feeling that what
          medicine's really all about is
          money... You want some coffee?

          It's money, isn't it? That's what
          you're trying to tell me. It's

          the opposite side of the grounds, Billy looks to Troy.

          Billy realizes there is no place for him here either.
          He looks up to see Felicia and the baby. He gives the
          football to Troy and slowly walks across the field.

          I'm your man, Mr. Ho.

          KIM SUNG HO
          Your scholastic record is very
          impressive, why would you be
          willing to leave law school for
          essentially a gofer's position?

          in the world I want to go into.

          Which world is that?

                         KIRBO
          The 'real' world. Besides, did
          you know that there are more
          students in law school than there
          are practicing lawyers?

          Winter is on the way. Dale gets out of her car. As she

                         KIRBO
          I was hand-picked as special
          attache to Kim Sung Ho. You know,
          the famous Korean entrepreneur?
          He quickly holds up a newspaper with Kim on the cover.

                         DALE
          What about medical school?

                         KIRBO
          I have to grab my huge financial
          opportunities while-I can. It's
          all about money, isn't it, Dale?

                         DALE
          Well, good luck.

                         KIRBO
          I'm giving a little party Saturday
          night at Kim's house.
          (handing her card)
          I'd really like to see you there.

                         DALE
          Well, thank you, Kirby. I'll try...
          She smiles sweetly and runs off as Kirbo sits back and
          talks to the female Chauffeur.

                         KI RBO
          She'll be there. You see her
          face when she saw this car?

                         CHAUFFEUR
          Mr. Ho catches you having a party
          in his house Saturday night.
          You'll be out on the street.

                         KIRBO
          He won't be back until Sunday...
          remember, there's an extra hundred
          bucks for you and Kenny to shut up.

          Honey, I just got promoted. I'm
          going to have a lot more
          responsibility. I'm sure it's
          the right time.

                         ALEC
          Looking at my big picture agenda,
          I want to be playing softball
          with my firstborn in about four
          years.

                         LESLIE
          Do you realize that over half the
          marriages today end in divorce.

                         ALEC
          And the other half don't.

          today why everyone's father
          doesn't live in a separate house
          like her father does. I don't
          want us to become another divorce

          Your father sits around playing
          chess while your mother talks to
          him constantly. But he's not
          listening.

                         ALEC
          That's probably why they're happy.

          Wendy's brand new white Chrysler LeBaron. Alec and Leslie
          make a big deal about it as they get in.

                         LESLIE
          So, does this mean you're
          officially engaged?

                         HOWIE
          Yes.

                         WENDY
          No... It just means I'm officially
          thinking about it.

                         ALEC
          What is this? Howie, didn't you
          always think women were dying to
          get married?

          Does Alec know you're doing this?

                         KIRBO
          I told him I had Kim's permission.
          Should I go for the formal'tux, or
          the velvet smoking jacket, I-do-

          into debt, lied to Alec who got
          you this job in the first place --
          and all for a woman who doesn't
          seem to be interested in you.

          When she sees me in this setting
          and realizes my potential, which
          she has always secretly known

          arrive. Other guests arrive, including some regulars
          from St. Elmo's, undergrads and old schoolmates. Billy
          enters and seeing some old frat brothers goes nuts.
          Wendy watches him painfully.

                         KEVIN
          holds court for the undergrads.

                         KEVIN
          The best advice I can give you
          undergrads is to fail. Failure is
          a virtue in today's society. Human
          error is a badge of honor. If
          you're the alcoholic child of a
          celebrity, you can blame them and
          earn a year on the best-seller
          list. If you're a celebrity, your
          mistake will earn you a People
          magazine cover. It's post-
          Watergate morality. Take
          responsibility for your mistakes
          and make a quick buck while you're
          at it.

          Hey, Howie... how 'bout we make
          it a double wedding?
          They pass Kirbo who dashes out of the kitchen franti-
          cally. He finds Wendy.

                         KI RBO
          Can I use your car?

          important thing in my life...

           Nothing.

          He dashes back into the

          113 INT. LIVING ROOM 113

          where people are dancing and cavorting. Quickly finding
          Kevin, Alec punches him with all his might. Kevin goes
          flying. People shout as Kevin lands against the stereo,
          taking several thousands of dollars' worth of porcelain,
          jade and flowers with him. Leslie runs to Kevin's aid.

                         ALEC
          What'd you tell her?... Little
          buddy... little traitor. Huh,

          He told me nothing. It was just
          a hunch... until now.
          Alec filled with guilt and remorse becomes angrier. Alec
          realizes that everybody in the house is watching him. He 
          must save face.

                         ALEC
          Leslie, I want you out of the
          apartment tonight.

          Wendy's car still running. Kirbo buzzes Dale's bell and
          shouts up to her second-story window:

                         KI RBO
          You better get off the phone and
          open this door!
          Suddenly the window above him opens and Dale's roommate
          Judith appears angrily.

                         JUDITH
          Are you the maniac trying to cut

          are approaching his neighborhood Black Hooker. He
          proudly takes Leslie's arm. He'll show her who's gay.

          time.

                         KEVIN
          It's still the same. Small and
          ugly... but then again it's small
          and ugly. Are you sure we
          shouldn't find you some nice
          lady-like hotel?

                         (NOTICES SOMETHING)
          . What are you doing.with a
          coffin?
          We now see that a long coffee table which has always been
          covered with junk is indeed a black coffin.

                         KEVIN
          That's not how you're supposed
          to ask. You're supposed to be a
          young lady who is very impressed
          with. my mind. Having come from a
          deep Hungarian film and getting
          cozy over a brandy, she says...
          'Is that... a coffin...?' And,
          then I say, 'Yes, it's my coffin'
          . 'Your coffin,' she would gasp,
          her interest in me growing by leaps
          and bounds. Then'I would sit back
          stroking her arm and say 'Yes, I
          figured we're going to spend a long
          time in the ground together so I've
          made friends with it... I've gotten
          drunk on it... rolled joints on it
          . Even made love on it many times!'
          It's a prop for affect.

                         LESLIE
          Does it work?

                         KEVIN

          Well you better not let Jules see

          No, that's more effect.
          He opens a straw box, obviously filled with his most
          personal possessions and extricates a photograph of a
          very ordinary family.

                         KEVIN
          You remember my family.

                         LESLIE
          So I've wandered into a real
          woman trap here, haven't I?

                         KEVIN
          Except you're the first woman
          I've ever been able to get up
          here. And I've blown all my
          props already... So how about
          some brandy?
          Kevin searches for clean glasses in the debris that
          passes for a kitchen, Leslie finds photos and political
          cartoons in his straw box. Eventually, she finds a
          photo of herself, and then another -- followed by dozens
          more. Kevin has an entire homage to her in his secret
          stash. He comes back with the brandy to find her looking
          at the photos.

                         LESLIE
          Am I part of your props?

          Kevin, almost for the first time.

          Alec was the first. There were
          other guys, in high school, boys
          -- but he was the first love of my
          life. I always wondered if Alec
          and I hadn't ended up in the same
          dorm -- well, I guess I would have
          just found someone else. And so
          would he.

                         KEVIN
          Alec had the luck of geography.
          Whatever we say about Alec we'll

          Aaaaah. Ouch...
          (as she stops)
          No. I love it. I love it!!!
          Leslie grabs onto the large throw rug as they roll around
          the floor. Somehow as they roll and turn, the rug gets
          wrapped around them. Leslie tears at his shirt, as he
          yanks her sweater off. Kevin fights madly with the back
          of Leslie's bra. He is going berserk trying to find the
          clasp.

          No... it's in front.
          With a flick of her hand she undoes her bra and opens up
          the wonders of paradise to her old buddy. They kiss
          madly again as they roll in the rug.

                         Â€¢ BILLY
           Come on -- Gimme some of those
          beautiful lips.
          Jules needs some attention. The hot couple kiss. He
          immediately goes for the gold.

                         JULES
          Billy... enough!

                         BILLY
          Who says?

                         JULES
          I say.

                         BILLY
          Yeah, well, I bet you really won't
          have so much to say with me in
          your mouth.
          He kisses her wildly as she pushes him away aggressively.

                         JULES
          I'm serious, Billy. No!!!
          He grabs the keys from the ignition as the CAR DIES.

                         JULES
          Billy!
          Holding her off with one hand, he shoves the keys into
          his underwear and then sits back grinning.

                         BILLY
          Come and get 'em.

                         JULES
          You shit!!!
          She attacks him, biting his hands, his neck and his
          chest. Billy shrieks with laughter and pain.

          121 EXT. JEEP - NIGHT 121

          He tumbles out of the Jeep, onto the street, laughing and
          shouting. Jules tumbles right after him, belting, pinch-
          ing, biting. As she goes to kick him, Billy slides
          between her legs and looks up under her skirt.

                         BILLY
          Ultimate...

                         (ECHO)
          Ultimate!!

                         121 COHTIHUED: 121
          â€¢ She sits down an his chest, undoes his pants and gets her
          keys. Felt up with all, she heads back to the Jeep.

                         JULES
          I really needed you tonight.

                         BILLY
          Nell, just get back in the Jeep
          and assume the missionary
          position.

                         JULES
          You break my heart. You break
          everybody's heart.
          She drives off in the Jeep. Billy fumbles with his pants
          and then turns toward his house. Felicia, holding their
          baby, stands watching from the porch. Obviously having
          seen most of this, she silently goes back into the house,.
          locks the door and turns out the light. Alone, drunk and
          bewildered, Billy starts moving away from the house real-
          izing he has no place to go.

          122 INTO WEHDY'S CAR - HIGHT 122

                         40
          Kirbo is still driving frantically, but, without the
          windshield wipers, snow is building rapidly on the wind-
          shield.

          123 EXT. CAR - MIGHT 123

          Kirbo, with one hand on the wheel, hangs out of the car
          using his left hand to wipe off the snow. It's cold.

                         KIRBO
          Shit... Goddammitt...

          124 IHT. CAR - MIGHT 124
          He searches the dashboard frantically.

                         KIRBO
          Heater. Where's the defroster???
          He rams and jams every button and knob in sight as he
          weaves dangerously on the freeway. Eventually one of the
          levers comes off in his hand.

                         KIRBO
          Dear Mr. Iacoccoa... I recently
          had the misfortune of using one
          of your, so-called, new luxury
          cars in an emergency situation.
          So much for American enterprise!

          128 EXT. SEVEN SPRINGS SKI RESORT - HIGHT (LATER) 128

          â€¢ Kirbo tries to stop the car in front of a cabin, but
          it slides further than he had planned and almost hits
          it. Getting out and trudging through the snow, in his
          party clothes. he bangs on the door.

          MAX (V.O.)
          Who is it?

                          KI RBO
          Is Dale Biberman in there?

          MAX (V.0.)
          Who wants to know?

                         KIRBO
          Kirby Kreager! And who the hell
          are you?
          The door swings open and there stands GUY, a handsome
          thirty-year-old wrapped in a blanket. Dale comes from
          the bedroom, fastening a man's robe and staring at Kirbo
          in disbelief.

                         DALE
          Kirby? What are you doing here?
          His entire world has collapsed. He can't swear, shout
          or cry -- he can only dash toward the car frantically.
          Falling in the snow once or twice, he eventually jumps
          into the car and tries to peel out, but it just spins
          in the snow. Meanwhile Guy has put on heavy boots and
          comes running out to the car where Kirbo stands on the
          gas to no avail.

                         DALE
          Kirby, stop. Come inside.
          He ignores her maniacally as he keeps desperately trying
          to get out of there.

                         GUY
          You've got no skid chains or snow
          tires. You've got no traction.
          Kirbo ignores them.

                         DALE
          Kirby, please!

                         GUY
          You-'re not gonna get out of here
          tonight. You better come back
          inside.

                         GUY
          (yelling at Dale)
          He wants to stay in the car.

                         DALE
          He'll freeze!!!
          She begins pulling on her boots as Guy tries to reason
          with Kirby.

                         GUY
          People have died out here.

                         KIRBO
          Leave me alone. I'm not your
          responsibility!
          Dale has joined them.

                         DALE
          By driving up here, you've made
          us responsible for you. Now
          come inside.

          129 INT. CABIN - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER) 129

          Kirbo sits in front of the fire wrapped in a blanket.
          Guy goes back into the bedroom as Dale finishes making
          a bed for him on the sofa.

                         DALE
          Your clothes should be dry in a
          few hours.

                         KIRBO
          He's a doctor, isn't he?

                         DALE
          Here are some pajamas.

                         KIRBO
          You expect me to wear his pajamas?

                         DALE
          We'll talk in the morning.
          She joins Guy, in the bedroom and closes the door. Kirbo
          is left with the pajamas and his desperate anguish.

          130 INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NEAR DAWN 130

          The room is destroyed as Leslie and Kevin lie on the
          floor blissfully in each other's arms. They hear the
          front DOOR OPEN.

                         KEVIN
          Kirbo?

          ALEC (O.S.)
          No, it's Alec.
          Kevin and Leslie look at each other frantically.

                         KEVIN

                         (WHISPERING)
          I gave him a key.

          131 INT. LIVING ROOM 131

          Alec, miserable, hungover, having walked all night in the
          cold, shuffles around the living room.

                         ALEC
          I'm only gonna ask you this once.
          Did you tell Leslie about my
          screwing around?

          132 INT. BEDROOM 132

          Kevin looks to Leslie as they wonder how to handle this.

                         KEVIN
          No.

          133 INT. LIVING ROOM 133

          Alec has found a beer.

                         ALEC
          I believe you. I want you to
          know that I believe you and, Kev,
          I'm sorry I hit you. Shit, how'd
          she find out? How long has she
          known? I've been thinking all
          night about school... How sex
          was always a barometer,'especially,
          at the fraternity. The more women
          you got, the more of a man you
          were... or thought you were... I
          thought I was.

                         9 ALEC (CONT'D)
          Shit, my whole life at school
          revolved around sex... even after
          I fell in love with Leslie. I
          always had to be doing better than
          the next guy... I had my rep. Big
          Al... It all started as a game...
          Kevin gingerly comes from the bedroom in a robe.

                         KEVIN
          Ah... I kind of have company.

                         ALEC
          Oh Jesus... I'm sorry... I never
          thought. Who is it?

                         KEVIN

                         ALEC

          You and the fat chick...

                         KEVIN
          Alec, I'll call you later.
          Alec capitulates and leaves the apartment. Kevin relaxes
          just as Alec pops back in.

                         ALEC
          Just tell me if it's the fat
          chick...
          The bedroom door opens and Leslie appears wrapped in a
          sheet.

                         ALEC
          No. No. No... wait a minute...
          I don't believe it. This could
          not be real. There is no way
          this is happening.

                         LESLIE
          It happened, Alec.

                         ALEC
          Not Kevin. Little fuckin' Kevin.
          My little buddy. No way, Jose.

                         LESLIE

                          KEVIN
          I know that if we fight, you're
          going to win. But I'm warning
          you, I will use every bone in my
          body, every lamp in this room to
          make sure I inflict as much damage
          as possible on you before you
          bring me down.
          Kevin prepares for the fight.

                         ALEC
          You're both pathetic. I don't
          want to see either one of you
          again, ever. You understand me?
          You see me on the street, you see
          me at St. Elmo's, just pretend you
          don't know me.
          On his exit, Alec takes a lamp and throws it against a
          Woody Allen photograph on the wall. Kevin and Leslie
          look at each other, uncertain of what they have done.

          I'm sorry. I had no idea it had
          gone this far.

          I gave up school... and my job

          It's mutual and reciprocal.

          She kisses him gently on the cheek. He is about to sink
          into more pain when suddenly he grabs Dale and kisses her
          with all the passion he has for her. When he releases
          her she is dazed. Something has definitely happened.

          Dad, I have my own work, and I
          want to get my own apartment.

          MR. BEAMISH
          All right, keep your job 'til you
          get pregnant. Howie is a fine
          boy. You don't need your own
          apartment.

                         WEHDY
          I don't love Howie, Dad. I love
          Billy!

          MR. BEAMISH
          Billy on the roof? Let me tell
          you something, he's a drunk and
          a lowlife. How could you love
          such a person?

                         WEHDY
          He's talented and confused and
          he's not a lowlife. And I love
          him because he's alive! He's the
          most alive person I've ever known.

          MR. BEAMISH
          When he looks at you, all he sees
          is U money. He doesn't give a
          damn about you...
          Wendy has started to cry.

          MR. BEAMISH
          I'm warning you, young lady. You
          marry him -- no 'Card-A-Terias' !
          Wendy is overcome with grief.

          Wendy and her father sit at a counter FACING the CAMERA.
          They finish ordering as the waitress leaves them.

                         WENDY
          I got a personal letter from Lee

          for nothing.

          MR. BEAMISH
          Good... so you like the car?

                         WENDY
          It's a great car, Dad, but I can't
          keep it. I don't feel right about
          driving a car like that and
          working with people who can't
          afford to eat.
          She finds the keys and hands them to him.

          MR. BEAMISH

          going to need it.

                         WENDY

          wanted to marry your mother? I
          was pressured into it. She was
          pressured into it.

          Wendy keeps running. A BAG LADY from the soup kitchen,
          crosses her path.

          leg!
          Wendy continues running and crying as YOUNG STREET TOUGHS

          Don't worry, Wendy... we got the
          old pervert covered.
          Wendy keeps running, but then looks back. The Street
          Toughs are giving her father a hard time as he puffs,
          wheezes and deals with the pain in his chest and his
          leg. Wendy can't stand it. She shouts at them.

          That's my father. You leave him
          alone... that's my father!
          She runs over to them and shoos the Toughs away. Still
          crying, she guides her father toward a stoop.

                         WENDY
          Sit down, Daddy... sit down.
          They sit down, both still very emotional. After a
          moment, Mr. Beamish takes a torn greeting card from
          his pocket. It has a very sexy woman on it.

          MR. BEAMISH
          See this... A feminist came into
          the Pennsylvania Avenue store this
          morning -- called me a 'sexist'
          and a 'pig' and tore the card up.
          I said 'Listen, we got naked men

          that Leslie is watching, Jules starts back down the hall.

                         LESLIE
          Kevin has his first byline.
          Jules is so stoked she can't focus.

                         LESLIE
          Jules, I'd like to meet him.

                         JULES
          I'll have him wave up to you.
          She is out the door in a flash as Leslie moves toward
          - the window.

                         LESLIE
          Doesn't she seem out of control
          to you?

          Kevin, I've been thinking.

          Me, too, and I don't like to count

          I realized what a terrific person
          she was and how much fun it was

          to a psychiatrist and says, 'Doc,
          uh, my brother's crazy. He thinks
          he's a chicken,' and the doctor
          says, 'Well, why don't you turn
          14 him in?' And the guy says, 'I
          would, but I need the eggs.' Well,
          I guess that's pretty much how I
          feel about relationships.

          I don't think I need the eggs
          anymore. Dale Biberman gave me
          enough cholesterol for a lifetime.
          You were right all along... Love
          stinks.

                         KEVIN
          I've had second thoughts. Intimacy
          is dangerous and shattering... but
          ultimately necessary.

                         KIRBO
          But, Kevin, I used to wait outside
          her house,. ring the bell and then
          when she'd come to the window I'd
          run away. Just to get a glimpse
          of her.

          The night Leslie gave me the kiss-

          I'm sorry to bother you here.
          It's Jules. After she left for
          work this morning, the finance
          company came and took away all
          her furniture, her Jeep, everything
          they could get their hands on...
          I couldn't reach her so I finally
          went over to her office. Alec --
          she was fired three weeks ago!
          All this time, she's been
          pretending to go to work every day
          , and pretending to be still
          having this affair with her boss.
          And she's been doing a lot of coke
          .. Well, anyway, I confronted her
          at the apartment, and at first she
          denied everything, but then she
          went crazy -- and now she's locked
          herself in the apartment and she
          won't let me back in... I'm really
          worried about her.
          Alec hesitates angrily.

          Suddenly, Alec and Kevin become aware that they are
          alone.

                         ALEC
          I saw your article.

                         KEVIN
          Yeah, well, yesterday's editorial
          achievement is today's garbage
          wrapper, right...?
          Kevin tries to laugh charmingly. Alec tries to laugh
          along with him, but suddenly rage returns.

                         ALEC
          You little shit!!!
          He grabs Kevin. Kevin tries to fight back, but Alec is
          so overpowering he pushes Kevin up to the railing of the
          fire escape, and then pushes him over. Kevin hangs
          upside down as Alec holds him by his legs. Dozens of
          scraps of paper fall from his pocket.
          Leaning out the apartment hallway window, Leslie sees
          them.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, no!!!

          167 INT. JULES' HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 167

          Leslie runs screaming through the hall and down the
          stairs, passing Ron Dellassandro who is just coming home
          from work.

                         RON
          What's happening???

          168 EXT. JULES' FIRE ESCAPE - LATE AFTERNOON 168

           Kevin, still hanging upside down, tries to hang on to
           Alec. Papers continue to fly.

                          KEVIN
           My notes!

                          ALEC
          You won't need any more notes on
          the meaning of life.

                         KEVIN
          (upside-down,

                         STRAINING)
          I'm kinda betting on you not doing
          it, Al... think of your political
          career.
          Leslie runs into the alley underneath them.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, stop Iit!
          She frantically starts climbing the fire escape.

                         LESLIE
          Alec!!!

          BACK TO ALEC AND KEVIN

                         ALEC
          After all I've done for you.

                         KEVIN
          I feel I've done a lot for you,
          too, Al... so pull me up and we'll
          call it even.

                         ALEC
          What you did for me was take the
          woman I was going to marry.
          The woman he was going to marry arrives frantically onto
          their landing. She struggles with Alec.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, stop it right now!
          Below them, Billy and Kirbo pull up in a Chevron tow
          truck. Billy, wearing Chevron coveralls, jumps out with
          an acetylene torch in hand, shouting.

                         BILLY
          Looks pretty ultimate up there...

          dolly holding a large tank of oxygen and acetylene.

          LESLIE, ALEC AND KEVIN

                         KEVIN
          You think this is helping Jules?
          With Kevin's life still in his hands, he suddenly
          remembers Jules.

          Looking back inside, he sees her still in the same posi-
          tion, freezing.

          170 EXT. FIRE ESCAPE 170

          He slowly pulls Kevin onto the fire escape.

                         LESLIE
          Are you all right?
          Kirbo tries to get the dolly up the fire escape with
          Billy.

                         KIRBO
          Hey! Help.
          Kevin goes down the fire escape to help him, leaving Alec
          and Leslie alone. Leslie kneels by the window with her
          hands on the iron bars and speaks to Jules.

                         LESLIE
          Oh, my God. Jules, please, it's
          so cold.

                         ALEC
          Very noble how you ran up here to
          save your lover.

                         LESLIE
          He's not my lover. Jules, listen...

                         ALEC
          Bullshit.

                         LESLIE
          I have never lied to you once
          since the day I met you... you

          Alec knows it's the truth.

                         LESLIE
          Hang on, Jules. We all love you.
          She has been holding onto the bars with her bare-hands,
          but the bitter cold makes her wince as she removes her
          hands. Alec is overwhelmed with feelings as he takes her
          hands and holds them to his mouth, breathing warm breath
          onto them. Much emotion passes between them.

                         LESLIE
          Your breath, your breath is so
          sweet.

          ALEC.
          Leslie, I'm sorry. I'm so
          profoundly sorry.
          Kirbo and Kevin arrive. Billy races down the alley.

                         KIRBO
          Blowtorch, anyone?

                         ALEC
          Give it to me.

                         KEVIN
          Do not hand him a blowtorch!
          Kevin takes the torch and goes for the bars. SPARKS and
          fire fly. Suddenly there is a PHENOMENAL POUNDING from
          inside the apartment at Jules' front door. It stops
          everyone on the fire escape.

          171 INT. JULES' APARTMENT 171

          The POUNDING jolts Jules.

          Billy pounds on the door as Ron watches nervously.

                         (NO REPLY)
          Okay, Jules... Open up the goddamn
          door, or I'm coming right through
          it.
          No reply. Billy spots a large metal fire extinguisher at
          the end of the hall.

          Ron enters tentatively and joins them as JULES and BILLY
          start SHOUTING and LAUGHING LOUDER.

          This is great.

                         WENDY
          I'll tell you what's great. Last
          night I woke up in the middle of
          the night and made myself a peanut
          butter and jelly sandwich... and
          you know it was my kitchen, and
          my refrigerator and My apartment
          . and it was the best peanut
          butter and jelly sandwich I've
          ever had in my life.

          So you're goin', huh...?
          She picks up his sax and blows a few comic notes.

          A large bus pulls out as Leslie stands at a coffee
          vending machine. Alec approaches.

                         ALEC
          Need someone to blow on your hands?
          She smiles, but shows him her gloves. As she searches
          for change in her pockets, Alec stops her and puts his
          own coins in the machine. He presses buttons as he
          talks.

                         ALEC
          Did you know that I.always wanted
          to make you coffee? I tried once
          -- when you were in the shower --
          but it didn't turn out right, so I
          threw it out and cleaned everything
          up so you wouldn't know. I don't
          like doing things I'm not good at
          -- like making coffee and saying
          I'm sorry...
          He looks at her sincerely as he hands her the plastic cup
          from the machine.

                         ALEC
          Leslie, I'm sorry.
          They exchange a tender glance, and then Leslie takes a
          sip from the steaming cup.
