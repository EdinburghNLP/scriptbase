<title>Murderland</title>



<pre>
          EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

          Opening credit sequence plays against :

          The busy streets of Manhattan. Pizza guys tossing the
          dough.

          Cabs pick up passengers.

          Doormen wave greetings.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

          Central Park's trees blow in the wind.

          People walk in the park on the tracks.

          A gang hovers over a bridge, heckling people.


          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

          Commuters still linger in the subway waiting for a
          train.

          A tollbooth attendant reads a paperback.

          A train roars by, the sound of which mixes into.

          PAN DOWN TO:


          INT. MAIN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The roar of the train can be heard overhead.

          SIMPSON, an exec of about 45, balding on top wearing a
          three piece suit, is sitting on a 1890's style park
          bench. He is out cold. He starts to stir. He lifts his
          head, it appears as if it is day time. He looks around
          him.

          SIMPSON's P.O.V. - The overhead lights are so bright, it
          simulates a mid day noon sun. There are even Dusk sky
          colors and clouds painted on the ceiling.

          SIMPSON is very confused....

          He looks around him to see several multi colored
          buildings and he appears to be on a checkered red and
          white brick road between two rows of buildings. He sees
          a miniature castle at the end of the road that is about
          1/50th scale of another similar theme park.

          The whole room is about 600 yards long and it gets small
          as you go near the castle. There is a Merry Go Round
          just to the left of castle and there are only four doors
          on the entire street. One labeled "Movie Theater", the
          second labeled "The Old West", the third "Fantasy Land"
          and the last labeled "The Real World". The ceiling is as
          high as a high school gymnasium.

          From beside the miniature Castle comes a giant human
          sized SCRAPS THE DOG. A theme song starts to play over
          the intercom.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (cheesy, generic announcer
                              voice over the loud speakers)
                         Ladies and gentlemen, the official
                         mascot of Murderland.... Scraps the Dog
                         !

          Scraps is a human sized fluffy human in a dog suit.
          Scraps looks friendly as he waves and moves stiffly like
          he's animatronic. SIMPSON starts to laugh to himself.
          Then as the song is playing, Scraps pulls out a Tommy
          Gun and starts to shoot at Simpson.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                         Choose the doorway that starts you on
                         your magical journey into
                              (the voice turns from cheesy
                              to evil)
                         MURDERLAND !

          Simpson ducks, and glass breaks behind him from a store
          window.

          As he hides behind the bench, the Merry Go Round starts
          on and the horses begin to fire bullets as well.

          Simpson is forced to go toward the Movie Theater. He
          goes in, barely missing the bullets.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          We see the action on television monitors. This room is
          set up like a Newsroom with about twelve T.V. monitors
          and computer counsels and mixing boards. At the controls
          in this dark room is BRUCE, late thirties, unshaven and
          cold as ice.

          Behind him are JOHNNY, his assistant, mid twenties and
          semi Italian looking, and lurking in the shadows is
          ZACH, a corporate ass kiss who wears $600 shoes and
          wears GQ glasses with his Armani suit.

          The room is colored with blue light from the monitors
          and the electronic lights surrounding all the computer
          consoles. Behind the two seat console is the couch where
          Zach is sitting. This room is impeccably clean.

                                          JOHNNY
                         I didn't think he'd make it past
                         Scraps.

                                          BRUCE
                         Let's just see if he can make it into
                         round two....

          Johnny pulls out a bag of chips and starts to eat a
          handful. Bruce shoots him a look.

                                          BRUCE
                         Don't.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (chomping on the chips)
                         What ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Don't eat at the console.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (mouthful of chips)
                         What ? Are you my mother ?

                                          BRUCE
                         It's my control board and I don't want
                         it acting squirrelly because you
                         dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard,
                         no put the shit away.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Yes, sir Mom.
                              (puts the chips down)


          INT. MOVIE THEATER, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          SIMPSON is panting and stops to catch his breathe. A
          Black &amp; White silent film is playing on the big screen.
          The movie playing is showing the making of Murderland.
          There are only about four or five rows of seats.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (from the movie screen)
                         Have a seat Mr. Simpson ! Murderland
                         was created in 1987. Taking the
                         original 82nd street subway station
                         which was abandoned in 1913, our
                         engineers were able to construct all
                         thirty rides in less than......

          The doors all close and lock. Simpson looks panicked. He
          claws helplessly at the doors.

          He sits at one of the seats and gets an electrical shock
          that would kill a small animal. He falls to the floor,
          when he looks up he sees at one of the doors, the exit
          light flickers on and off.

          He goes to it. The door opens.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (from the movie screen)
                         ..... all thirty rides and attractions
                         ! Our engineers have built.....

          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          BRUCE is working the controls.

                                          BRUCE
                         Never underestimate a man who cheats on
                         his taxes. His file says he is an avid
                         jogger.

                                          JOHNNY
                         You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy
                         ass couldn't win the special Olympics.



          INT. HALL OF DOORS, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Simpson is limping his way down the hall. There are
          doors of varying sizes and shapes on either side of him.
          Some have light emanating from behind them, some don't.

          It's important to note that there is no other light
          other than the light coming from behind the doors. Other
          than that it is pitch black in here. Only the doors
          present themselves.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (over speakers)
                         Mr. Simpson, so many doors, so many
                         choices. Which do you prefer ?

          The floor and ceiling begin their hydraulic rise/fall
          toward Simpson. The closing makes a grating, mechanical
          noise.

                                          ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Chose wisely and with expediency !

          Simpson is panicking, there is no easy choice. His brow
          is covered in sweat and he starts to shake.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny rolls his chair back and slaps his hand to his
          head.

                                          JOHNNY
                         He'll never get it right. Try the Log
                         Ride !

                                          BRUCE
                         Not yet.

                                          JOHNNY
                         But, he's...

                                          BRUCE
                         I said NO.

          Johnny gets up and walks to the back of the room.

          Zach listens intently to the dissention.

          On the monitor we see Simpson grabbing at a door that's
          locked.


          INT. HALL OF DOORS, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Simpson moves on the the next door. It's locked

          He moves to the last door on the left side.

          He opens it. He gets knocked all the way against the
          other side of the hall by a spike. He is impaled by a
          four feet long, one foot wide metal spike.

          Blood drips from his corpse on the opposite wall.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND - NIGHT

                                          BRUCE
                         Stop the hydraulics.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (returns to his console,
                              pressing several buttons on
                              the keyboard)
                         Got it.

          On the monitor we see the floor stop rising.

                                          ZACH
                              (polishing his glasses)
                         Is that it ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Yeah, I'd say that's it.

                                          JOHNNY
                         He has a phone pole sticking in his
                         chest, I think we don't need an
                         autopsy.

                                          ZACH
                         I'm just looking for our best
                         interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce
                         ?

          BRUCE removes a VHS tape from the deck.

                                          BRUCE
                              (holds the tape as Zach tries
                              to take it)
                         Doesn't it bother you to see this kind
                         of brutal death ? I mean , I can
                         understand the old man's infatuation
                         with the stuff, but not you.

                                          ZACH
                         I'm an investment banker. I see blood
                         bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not
                         to question why, min is but to do or
                         die.

                                          BRUCE
                         No one has a gun to your head.

          Unamused, Bruce let's go of the tape.

                                          ZACH
                         Might I suggest going a little easier
                         on them ? It will prolong the end and
                         our benefactor will be more pleased if
                         we could elongate the inevitable.

          Bruce just stares at him in contempt.

                                          BRUCE
                         Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.

                                          JOHNNY
                         You've got it boss. One more mangled
                         body to the East River, coming up !

                                          ZACH
                         I must be going. Gentlemen....

          Zach leaves and Johnny escorts him out.


          EXT. FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

          We follow ZACH as he walks down a street and enters an
          office complex for ......

          Establishing Shot : FIRST BANK


          INT. FIRST BANK LOBBY - DAY

          TRACKING SHOT: Zach enters wearing the usual plush
          Armani and his GQ glasses. He nods to security as he
          goes into the elevator. This is a multi billion dollar
          bank he works at.

          The lobby has plush marble floors and the expensive
          furniture that goes with being in the 9th largest
          commercial bank worldwide. There are all dark, expensive
          suits, all almost oblivious of each other walking to and
          from.


          INT. 44TH FLOOR, FIRST BANK  - DAY

          Zach exits the elevator. He must go to the other end of
          the building to take the elevator to the penthouse.

          He sees SAUNDRA, a mid twenties brunette who is wearing
          a very mini skirt. She is all business, but definitely
          has sexuality oozing from her pores. She is standing at
          the water cooler with another exec named JUDY, 38 and a
          little heavy set.

                                          JUDY
                         So have you seen Simpson ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         No, why ?

                                          JUDY
                         He missed a meeting this morning.
                         Simpson hasn't missed a meeting in
                         three years.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Maybe he had a better offer.

                                          JUDY
                         It doesn't matter much. There's such an
                         incredible turnover here...
                              (sees Zach approaching from
                              elevator)
                         Be careful, major kiss ass approaching.

           Zach approaches and Judy exits.

                                          ZACH
                         Good morning.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Good morning.

                                          ZACH
                         Did you see what the First Bank stock
                         opened at ? Very impressive.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Actually it's down .2 from the last
                         quarters highest, but I think it will
                         pick up.

                                          ZACH
                         I am equally impressed with your
                         knowledge of the market. How long have
                         you been with the company now ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Four years. I came over from the
                         Capitol merger in Chicago six months
                         ago.

                                          ZACH
                         Were you involved in the incident where
                         that guy killed himself in his office ?
                              (her silence answers the
                              question)
                         I am sorry. Perhaps we should have
                         dinner tonight to.... discuss your
                         future.

          Saundra is not blind to the innuendo.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Perhaps not. I have to work on the PRD
                         merger tonight.

          Enter MATTHEW, a temp in his early twenties and an
          incredible smart ass.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Good golly miss molly you are looking
                         good today !

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Thank you.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I meant him.

          SAUNDRA is mildly amused with Matthew and this is a
          tension causer for Zach. Zach has no tolerance for
          anything not work related.

                                          MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                         Just look at this tie. You could fry an
                         egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever
                         considered the Jerry Garcia line of
                         ties ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Excuse me, gentlemen

          SAUNDRA leaves, giggling at the tie.


                                          ZACH
                         Might I remind you Mr. Parker, that you
                         are a temporary employee and I hope you
                         have no aspirations of becoming
                         permanent.

          Zach exits toward his office.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Thank you sir, have you ever considered
                         Mydol for that attitude. It takes the
                         edge off.


          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          This is a big money bank, so the furnishings are
          extravagant. The giant oak wood table is in the center
          of this room and a giant glass window facing the park
          can be seen.

          Saundra is at the table with about twenty other N.D.
          executives. They are watching the latest internal video
          from CEO JOHN C. McCAY.

          On the video we see a nice little creek and pasture
          setting and wearing jeans &amp; a sweater McCay sitting near
          a wooden fence.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Hi. I'm John C. McCay. I am proud to
                         have the new PRD team join the family.
                         We all know that we grow everyday.
                         Together we can make First Bank work
                         for you.

          The video ends with McCay giving the camera a thumbs up
          and the graphics saying "First Bank Works For You !".

          Fred Thomison, 45, stands up and turns the monitor off.
          He turns to the waiting executives

                                          FRED THOMISON
                          Well ?

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (over SPEAKER PHONE)
                         Fire the whole division.

                                          FRED THOMISON
                         Excuse me, sir ?

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (still over speaker phone)
                         Fire the whole division. We're moving
                         more of the operations division into
                         Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over
                         from the conversion is no longer
                         needed. We already have all the key
                         people here. Anyone else is expendable.

                                          FRED THOMISON
                         Sir, I came from the Chicago offices
                         myself, and if I may say, sir, there
                         are still some very good....

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (over the speaker phone &amp;
                              more than a little irritated)
                         If you want, I can fire you and have
                         someone else who has the balls
                         terminate these worthless people. Which
                         will it be ?

                                          FRED THOMISON
                         We will start work on it now sir.

          There is a rude, unacknowledged click from the speaker
          phone, then dial tone. Thomison turns the line off.

                                          FRED THOMISON
                         Anyone know where to start ?

                                          ZACH
                              (O.C.)
                         I do.

          All eyes turn to Zach in the door.

                                          ZACH
                         We start with the top and work our way
                         down. We start with the high salaries
                         and then just let the little people go.
                         No need to make the blue collars go
                         crazy.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I disagree. I think we should start
                         looking into the severance pay
                         schedules and make sure the people with
                         families can.....

                                          ZACH
                         Look, Miss. I know you're still upset
                         about that incident in Chicago, but
                         understand, this is a cut throat
                         business. We don't have time to play
                         nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and
                         Harry.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Maybe we should make the time.
                         Especially considering the sixteen
                         million dollars we have set aside
                         expressly to settle law suits from
                         these very events.

          The whole room sits still for a moment.

                                          FRED THOMISON
                              (democratically)
                         Let's put it to a vote. All those in
                         favor of cutting loose without the
                         proper relations to our old co workers
                         ? Put your hands up.

          Only Zach raises his hand.

                                          FRED THOMISON
                         That about covers it then. Now the next
                         order of business will be.....

          CUT TO:


          INT. CEO PENTHOUSE, FIRST BANK - DAY

          This goes way beyond posh here. There are exotic
          paintings (originals) and lots of open spaces. Elephant
          tusks and other hunter type trophies. This is definitely
          a man's office from a man who suffers from penis envy.
          He has all the high brow, multi millionaire furnishings
          in dark wood and an outside fountain and arboretum. This
          room is at least three thousand square feet.

          ZACH enters with his briefcase in hand.

          From outside enters, John C. McCay, president of First
          Bank. He's in his mid to late fifties and all gray hair
          and a little portly. He wears glasses and presents
          himself as having power.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage
                         down on 44 ?

                                          ZACH
                         Not that well sir. I believe we have a
                         few too many soft hearts in the
                         building. Did we aquire a bank from
                         Chicago or a charity ?

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Relax, son. They'll learn in time that
                         you don't fuck with First Bank. This is
                         the real deal and we aim to keep it
                         strong. My Daddy always told me that
                         Only The Strong Survive.

                                          ZACH
                         I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or
                         perhaps Nietzsche ?

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Perhaps it was. I was in boarding
                         school for so many years, it's hard to
                         remember. Do you have the tape of the
                         latest exploits from my favorite hobby
                         ?

                                          ZACH
                         Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from
                         the Park.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         I have to say, that I am glad you are
                         such an amazing kiss ass.

                                          ZACH
                         Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a
                         question ?

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Of course.

                                          ZACH
                         While I am not morally against these
                         little, shall we say "hobbies", as long
                         as I am on the payroll, but why not
                         something like a yacht club ?

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Zach, how old are you, son ?

                                          ZACH
                         I am thirty two.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         And how much do we pay you annually ?

                                          ZACH
                         I make roughly four hundred thousand a
                         year.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly
                         salary in a blink. I have had that kind
                         of money all of my life. If I wanted
                         to, I could fly to Paris for the
                         afternoon.
                              (starts to pace)
                         My father formed this company over
                         seventy years ago. When my brother
                         became mentally challenged, it was put
                         in my charge. Now running a bank of
                         this size is very stressful. I need to
                         relax on what little down time I have.
                         A yacht club will not quite make my
                         blood pressure decline. Understand ?

                                          ZACH
                         Yes sir.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         I have entrusted you with a great many
                         things. In your tenure with this
                         company you have seen and heard things
                         that could upset the very economic
                         world in which we live. I think this
                         kind of loyalty should be rewarded.

                                          ZACH
                         Thank you, sir.

          John C. McCay reaches into his desk and hands Zach a pen
          set.

                                          ZACH (CONT'D)
                         Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for
                         shares, or possibly cash... but this,
                         this is really personal.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Son, let's watch the tape.


          INT. JOHN C. MCCAY'S VIDEO LOUNGE, FIRST BANK - DAY

          John C. McCay and Zach sit on a couch in a soundproof
          room in the penthouse office suite. The big screen T.V.
          replays the demise of SIMPSON. Zach watches as stoically
          as he did the previous night. John C.
          McCay watches like a pervert watching a porno. He is
          excited. As the tape ends...

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         That was rather.... disappointing.

                                          ZACH
                         I had suggested that they tone down the
                         program so that the "guests" might take
                         longer to expire.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         I want more action. I want to see more
                         ingenuity than that. I want to see the
                         injured man out wit the machines !

                                          ZACH
                         But sir, most of the people we are
                         putting into the "Park" are accountants
                         that embezzle or investment bankers.
                         They are not known for their physical
                         or intellectual prowess.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as
                         much fun with this as he once did. He
                         still insists on the "guests" being of
                         the more nefarious type.

                                          ZACH
                         That's right, sir. He does a thorough
                         background check and if he finds them
                         to be criminal or guilty of
                         embezzlement, then he will put them in
                         the park. He has refused the last three
                         suggested "guests".

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         What about that time when the mail room
                         kid was accused of stealing and we put
                         him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a
                         computer glitch ?

                                          ZACH
                         Yes sir. It turns out we put an
                         innocent man into the "park" and he was
                         not the one who stole from the stamp
                         machine. That is also about the time
                         when Bruce began refusing.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         That mail room kid was the longest
                         lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can
                         alter the computer records and make
                         another "guest" from the more athletic
                         of our staff.

                                          ZACH
                         Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief
                         that he is becoming more belligerent.

          The CEO contemplates this for a while.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         I propose we consider a hostile take
                         over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a
                         new job opportunity.

                                          ZACH
                         What do you mean sir ?

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         What if we were to put Bruce into the
                         Park as a Guest ?

                                          ZACH
                         Sir ?

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         I'll bet that would be the Park run of
                         the century !

                                          ZACH
                         Sir, he created the Park. He would know
                         how to circumvent any of the traps.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         I'm willing to bet that even the
                         creator can't out wit his creation.

                                          ZACH
                         What then sir ? What would we do with
                         the park with out Bruce ?

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Do you think the assistant, what's his
                         name...

                                          ZACH
                         John, sir.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Yes, do you think he would like a raise
                         and a new position ?

                                          ZACH
                         Sir, this is not like firing any
                         employee. We can't predict what will
                         happen.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         That my boy, is the best part. Life on
                         top of the world is boring...
                         predictable. If I wanted life without
                         chances, I never would have paid for
                         Murderland. Now go. Make a formal
                         proposal and see about the assistant.
                         Find out if it's viable.

          Zach begins to go into the elevator.

          After he's gone. McCay opens up a video library named
          after former employees who have entered Murderland.


          INT. 44TH FLOOR, FIRST BANK - DAY

          Zach walks out of the elevator again. He sees MATTHEW
          flirting with Saundra. Although his face won't betray
          it, Zach is very jealous of this.


                                          MATTHEW
                         Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma.
                         She's this frail little thing, and
                         Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this
                         BIG guy. He has to be hung like a
                         horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up
                         with his B.S.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I've never heard the Flintstones
                         reduced to a sexual exploitation quite
                         like that. You're funny.

          Zach is right on the other side of the cubicles from
          them. He can hear clearly, but they don't know he's
          there.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would
                         you go, it's I think you're...

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Do you want to go out with me ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         It's sounds so much better when you say
                         it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's
                         important that I ask. Will you go out
                         with me ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Yes.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Really ? On a date ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Yes.

                                          MATTHEW
                         This is too easy, I mean I had a speech
                         prepared, then I even wore these pants
                         because I could get on my knees to
                         grovel.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         As appealing as that sounds...

                                          MATTHEW
                         Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven
                         o'clock ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Sure.

          Saundra leaves.

          From the next cube leans over JEFF,24 and a little
          unshaven and wearing a loud suit and tie. Jeff is
          equally free of any real responsibility.

                                          JEFF
                         I can't believe she said yes !

                                          MATTHEW
                         I know. Normally I'd have to spend
                         weeks laying down the leg work to land
                         a beautiful baby like that.

                                          JEFF
                         You are so lucky that Zach didn't get
                         there first.

                                          MATTHEW
                         You mean Mr. Bad Ties ? I wasn't
                         worried about him. He's one of those
                         guys who has a wardrobe but no
                         personality. Saundra doesn't want that.
                         She wants someone who can MAKE her
                         laugh. Not someone she can laugh AT.

          They both crack up at this and ZACH walks away.


          INT. MAIN STREET, MURDERLAND - DAY

          Bruce &amp; Johnny are repairing the Merry Go Round of
          horses that fire bullets. There are tools and parts
          lying about.

          Bruce is wearing only a tank top and is using a wrench
          on the large piece of the motor.

          Johnny looks very bored and is twirling a 9 millimeter
          pistol like a cowboy.



                                          BRUCE
                         Hand me the 3/8ths.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Here. Am I ever going to get to run the
                         controls for one these capers ?

                                          BRUCE
                         When I think you're ready.

                                          JOHNNY
                         When will that be ?

                                          BRUCE
                         When you are ready.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Look, you're going to have to start
                         trusting me sometime. I am a
                         trustworthy person.

                                          BRUCE
                         Trust is earned not given away.

                                          JOHNNY
                         RESPECT is earned not given away, trust
                         is given away to anybody.

                                          BRUCE
                         Not down here. I'll start trusting you
                         when I feel there the time is right.
                         It's not personal, it's just survival.

                                          JOHNNY
                         I've been working with you for four
                         years, don't you think that's worthy of
                         at least one turn at the controls ?

                                          BRUCE
                         No.

          Johnny gets up and walks around him.

                                          JOHNNY
                         I made my bones on the street, you
                         know. I did Riglioni in his own house.
                         I was made in the Family, okay.

                                          BRUCE
                         And who bailed you out when a hit was
                         put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who
                         put you up ? Who gave you a job ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         You did.

                                          BRUCE
                         That's right. Now who needs to trust
                         who ? Trust me, when you're ready to
                         work the controls, I'll put you in the
                         hot seat.

          Johnny stands for a long moment.


                                          JOHNNY
                         I just think that maybe I am.....

          Bruce just sighs out loud and then turns a switch and
          the Merry Go Round horses begin to fire right towards
          JOHHNY. They hit right at his feet. He dances a little
          jig around the bullets

                                          JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Jesus Christ ! Stop Stop Stop !

          They stop, and Bruce is laughing hysterically.

                                          JOHNNY
                         You asshole ! They could have missed !


          INT. NIGHTINGALE'S BAR - DAY

          This is a small bar in an alley in Manhattan. It looks
          as though no one has entered it in decades. It's run
          down and dusty. The lights are off.

          Zach enters through the front door. He sits at the bar.

          JOHNNY comes in from the back.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink
                         sailor ?

                                          ZACH
                         We have new "guests" for the park. I
                         have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         He's been expecting you.


          He points the way to the broom closet. They go in and
          the back of the closet opens up into an elevator.


          Both of them enter.


          INT. ELEVATOR, MURDERLAND - DAY

          This elevator is like the service elevators at the back
          of a hotel that only the janitors see, only smaller. It
          can barely fit these two.

          Zach curiously looks at Johnny.

                                          JOHNNY

                         You got a fucking problem ?

                                          ZACH
                         No. I was just curious if what I heard
                         about you is true ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         What did you hear ?

                                          ZACH
                         Only that you were one of the finest
                         hit men in the mob. That if you wanted
                         a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli
                         was the man for the job.

                                          JOHNNY
                         I was.

                                          ZACH
                         Might I ask why you no longer work for
                         the mob ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         There was a bit of confusion on one of
                         my last jobs.

                                          ZACH
                         I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong,
                         but weren't you trying to play both
                         sides ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         What are you looking for ? A blow job ?

                                          ZACH
                         No. I am not a homosexual.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Then what do you want ?

                                          ZACH
                         Have you ever considered running your
                         own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not
                         be returning to your former profession.

                                          JOHNNY
                         I didn't think even this company could
                         afford to write off enough to build a
                         new "Park".

                                          ZACH
                         We can't.

          Zach pauses, he hits the stop button on the elevator.

                                          ZACH
                         Are you happy with your salary and
                         position ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         No I am not.

                                          ZACH
                         I had hoped you would say that. I have
                         a proposal for you.....

                                          JOHNNY
                         I'm listening.


          INT. FIRING RANGE, MURDERLAND - DAY

          Bruce is firing away at the paper targets.  Zach and
          Johnny enter from the elevator. Johnny takes up a place
          next to him.

          This is a two man firing range about 100 yards long in a
          small rectangular room.

                                          BRUCE
                         Good morning. What do you have today ?

                                          ZACH
                         I have an embezzler and his accomplice.

          Zach opens his briefcase and hands over a file in a
          manilla folder. Bruce takes it and opens it up. We see
          MATTHEWS face on a B&amp;W photo, and the next picture is of
          SAUNDRA from he security badge.

                                          ZACH (CONT'D)
                         This young man is a temporary in our
                         accounting department and he has
                         managed to steal a large sum of money
                         through the wire transfer system. He is
                         sleeping with one of our account
                         executives to gain passwords. We
                         believe she is in on it.

          Bruce contemplates this. Johnny fires off several shots.
          He gets a lot better accuracy than Bruce does.

                                          BRUCE
                         I'll do the standard research and have
                         them in by midnight, pending any
                         unforseen problems.

                                          ZACH
                         Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.

          Zach exits.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND - DAY

          Bruce is concerned. He logs into the company computer
          and begins to check files.

                                          JOHNNY
                         What's wrong ?

                                          BRUCE
                         I just want to double check the facts.

          The computer blips up a screen of accounts and personnel
          files.

                                          BRUCE (CONT'D)
                         I see here that this guy has made
                         deposits into his own account for the
                         last four months. Each one in the
                         amount of $100,000. He then puts in
                         deposits into his girlfriends account.

                                          JOHNNY
                         So ?

                                          BRUCE
                         He already had a balance of $600,000.

                                          JOHNNY
                         He probably has a history of this shit.

                                          BRUCE
                         Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the
                         background checks. Let's see where they
                         live and what kind of security
                         systems....

                                          JOHNNY
                         Matthew lives on the Upper West Side,
                         kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Any priors ? Any police record ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load
                         of unpaid parking tickets...

                                          BRUCE
                         Parking tickets ? That's it ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         Yeah, but we're talking 43.

                                          BRUCE
                         A real criminal.... I still think
                         that's our in... What about her ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         Checking........


          INT. MATTHEW'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Matthew is running around his apartment, throwing
          clothes into a closet and hiding stuff under the couch.

          Matthew lives in a decent apartment with black leather
          sofa and matching chair, exactly what a bachelor would
          have.

          The Felix the Cat clock reads 6:59 PM

          The doorbell rings. Matthew runs to the door, and whacks
          his knee on the corner of the table. (very Peter Sellers
          style). He gets to the door, trying not to cringe in
          pain.

          He opens the door. It's Saundra, looking absolutely
          beautiful.

                                          MATTHEW
                         (trying very hard to be suave) Hello.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Hi. I brought some wine.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Thank you, won't you come in ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Thanks.

          As soon as she enters &amp; he's behind her, he winces in
          pain from his knee.

          She walks across the room toward the window.

                                          SAUNDRA (CONT'D)
                         What an incredible view !

                                          SAUNDRA

                                          MATTHEW
                         Thank you.

          He limps horribly &amp; painfully toward her. She spins
          around and he goes upright pretending to be smooth.


          INT. MATTHEW'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Matthew is prepping food in the kitchen while Saundra is
          at the table.

          He brings out the main course, it's chicken . He tries
          to be smooth and cut it, but jabs his finger instead. He
          winces, but tries (remember TRIES) to remain cool.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Are you okay ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         Yes, Excuse me for a second.

                                          SAUNDRA (CONT'D)
                         You have a real nice place... how can
                         you afford this working as a temp ?

          Matthew is jumping up &amp; down in pain while she looks
          around the room again.


          She turns toward him and he straightens up.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Well, I make good investments, I lead a
                         double life as a secret agent.. I....I
                         ... I have very rich parents. I have
                         always had a lot of money.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         If they're so rich, why are you working
                         at all ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         I just want to have something that's
                         mine, you know ? It's like living off
                         of their money is fun and all. There
                         are certain materialistic needs that I
                         have that can only be satisfied with
                         that extra little scratch.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         Would that impress you ? I mean you're
                         the kinda woman that probably has
                         Ferrari written all over your personal
                         ad.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Actually, I'm more interested in the
                         man behind the wheel more than the
                         manufacturer. So what is it that you
                         have that makes you a materialistic
                         fool ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         My own sit down Star Wars arcade game.
                         Wanna play it ?

          It sits in the corner of the room. We hear the familiar
          voice in the game say "The Force Will Be With You....
          Always".


          INT. HALLWAY, MATTHEWS APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          We see Bruce &amp; Johnny dressed as policemen, they knock
          on the door.


          INT. MATTHEW'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Saundra is playing the arcade game. Matthew is right
          beside her.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot
                         Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Yahoo !!!!!

          Matthew gets up and goes to the door.

          He is staring down Bruce &amp; Johnny in their police
          uniforms. This will play almost like an episode of COPS.

                                          BRUCE
                         Are you Matthew Parker ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or
                         something ?

                                          BRUCE
                         That's very funny, sir. You are under
                         arrest.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Hey , Hey !

          Johnny moves in behind him &amp; begins to cuff him.

                                          BRUCE
                         You have 43 unpaid parking tickets,
                         sir. You have the right to remain
                         silent, anything you say can &amp; will be
                         held.....

                                          SAUNDRA
                         What's going on ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.


                                          MATTHEW
                         Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid
                         parking tickets.

                                          BRUCE
                         43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         You don't have anything better to do ?
                         There a rapists &amp; murders out there and
                         you came out here to arrest him for
                         parking tickets ?

          Johnny steps behind her. He places chloroform over her
          mouth. She struggles. She manages to elbow Johnny in the
          gut &amp; he goes down.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Run !

          Bruce kicks Matthew in the gut &amp; he goes down. Saundra
          tries to get past Bruce, but he overpowers her. He puts
          his chloroform over her mouth and she tries to hit him,
          but to no avail.


          FADE TO BLACK


          INT. NIGHTINGALES BAR - NIGHT

          Bruce is carrying Saundra in over his shoulder.
          He places her on the floor next to where Johnny throws
          MATTHEW.

          Bruce is now wearing his normal black attire and a dark,
          thin trench coat.

                                          BRUCE
                         No matter how many times I wear one of
                         those fucking uniforms, I'll never get
                         used to it.

          Johnny looks at his boss in a devious way. Johnny preps
          a syringe behind his back without looking.

                                          BRUCE
                         That about does it. I'll take them
                         down.

          Bruce is leaning down over Saundra, checking her face.
          Johnny leans in and injects Bruce with a syringe in the
          back of his neck.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Nighty night, boss.


          FADE TO BLACK


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Johnny is turning on all the monitors and turning
          various knobs and controls.

          Zach is typing into his laptop.

          Johnny sits down in Bruce's chair.

                                          JOHNNY
                         So who are these people with the Boss ?

                                          ZACH
                         Just a temp who pissed me off and a
                         girl who turned me down for the night
                         of her life.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Aren't you the bitter one.


          INT. MAIN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The bright as day lights are fading in.

          Bruce starts to stir on the ground. He starts to get on
          his knee.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Johnny has his back turned to the monitors, checking on
          a few system checks. Zach is there, observing.

                                          ZACH
                              (seeing Bruce trying to
                              stand)
                         How long till the drug wears off ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         We should have another fifteen minutes
                         at least.

                                          ZACH
                         Bruce has just awaken.

                                          JOHNNY
                         What ?????

          Johnny turns around in a panic.


          INT. MAIN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce is struggling to stand. His hand is on his head.
          Beside him is Matthew and Saundra.

          Saundra begins to stir as the sound system booms a
          voice.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (very loud over the P.A.)
                         Welcome to Murderland ! Where death is
                         a fun experience for one and all !

                                          BRUCE
                              (to Saundra)
                         Get up. Get up !

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Where are we ?

                                          BRUCE
                         No time. Get him up.

          Bruce starts to move toward the Movie theater.



          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny is furiously pressing buttons.

                                          JOHNNY
                          Shit !


          INT. MAIN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Saundra leans over to Matthew and tries to shake him.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Not now, Mom.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Wake up, we're in trouble.

          Matthew is groggier than the other two were.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Hey... did we uhm, you know....

                                          SAUNDRA
                         No ! Just get up. This is serious.

          Matthew looks around. He is more than surprised at the
          similarities to a certain Theme park in Orlando, FL.


                                          MATTHEW
                         How did we get to Disn....

          Feedback permeates from the sound system.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (V.O. from P.A.)
                         Try not to fight too hard, boss !!!!

          From beside the miniature castle comes Scraps the Dog.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Well that's ....

          Scraps begins to fire his tommy gun.

          Matthew and Saundra get by the hail of bullets to the
          door near the Movie Theater. Then the Merry Go Round
          begins to fire. They get forced in.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          JOHNNY
                         I told you this would be easy. Just
                         like a maestro.


          INT. MOVIE THEATER, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce is already inside.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         What the hell kind of cop are you ?

          Bruce ignores them.

          The B&amp;W movie begins playing.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (from Movie Screen)
                         Murderland was created in 1987. Taking
                         the original 82nd street subway station
                         which was abandoned in 1913, our
                         engineers were able to construct all
                         thirty rides in less than......

          Bruce runs straight to a seat in the third row. He
          reaches underneath and pulls out a 9mm pistol. He checks
          the clip, then locks and loads.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny tries to speedily zoom in on Bruce to see what
          he's doing.

                                          ZACH
                         What is Bruce doing ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         I don't know.....


          INT. MOVIE THEATER, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce gets up and methodically shoots the two video
          camera's in the corners of the room.

          Matthew screams, Saundra just plugs her ears.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          The monitors for that room go dead.

                                          ZACH
                         What was that ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         He must have had a gun stashed. God
                         damn it !

                                          ZACH
                         We can't afford too many surprises.

                                          JOHNNY
                         He'll never make it out of the park
                         alive. I promise you that....


          INT. MOVIE THEATER, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew feels dizzy.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I gotta sit down, I have a headache.

          He tries to sit.

                                          BRUCE
                         NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell
                         if you touch that seat.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Who are you anyway ? What the hell is
                         this ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Just shut the fuck up.

          Bruce is trying to pry the door with the flickering exit
          light to open. It comes open a moment later. He runs
          into the Hall of Doors.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I think we should follow him...

                                          MATTHEW
                         I just need to sit and think for a
                         second.


          INT. HALL OF DOORS, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          As Bruce walks slowly and cautiously in, Saundra walks
          behind him several paces.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (from Off Camera)
                         OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!

                                          BRUCE
                              (whispers to himself)
                         I told him not to sit down in
                         there.....

          Matthew limps in

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Are you okay ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken
                         McNugget.

          The door locks shut and the lights dim.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (Voice Over from P.A.)
                         Well, boss you've already surprised me.
                         I'll try not to let it happen again.
                         Where to kids ?

          The ceiling begins to lower.

                                          MATTHEW
                         The roof is coming down.... hey,
                         you.... Which door gets us out of here
                         ??

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Which one, this door is locked !

                                          BRUCE
                         NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're
                         all wrong. Just wait.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you
                         but we'll be the special at the
                         International House of Pancakes in
                         about five minutes !

                                          BRUCE
                         Trust me, if you open any door, you'll
                         be dead a whole lot sooner.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Why should we trust you ?

                                          BRUCE
                         I made this place..... now listen to
                         me. I'll get out of this room, we have
                         bigger troubles than this....


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          ZACH
                         Will he make it out ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be
                         patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit
                         some of these traps.


          INT. HALL OF DOORS, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The distance is closing fast.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is
                         on the other side of the door ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Either you'll be shot with bullets,
                         impaled with a large spike, or nailed
                         like a super model. Basically you're
                         fucked any way you go.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (heavy on the sarcasm)
                         And that's different than this
                         because...... ?

          As the floor gets nearer to the ceiling, Bruce opens the
          air vent on the ceiling. He crawls in.

          Matthew stares in disbelief and Saundra moves right
          after Bruce into the tunnel.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Okay, maybe you know the answer to
                         this, but I'm still the trivia champion
                         at BW3's.

          Matthew jumps into the vent.


          INT. VENT, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          This is like an air conditioning vent, only a little
          large to accommodate human guests on their hands and
          knees or kneeling. The light comes from the floor vent
          ahead.

          Bruce crawls through and kicks in the vent to the next
          room. He jumps down.

          Saundra looks ahead of her and jumps down herself.

          Matthew, a little hurt from the Foosball thing pokes his
          head down into the next room. Then he falls through.


          INT. HUMAN SIZE FOOSBALL FIELD, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          What we have here is a human sized Foosball playing
          field.

          There is astro turf on the ground, bright soccer field
          lines and giant metal poles each one with either four,
          three or two "players".

          The "players" are giant six foot tall versions of their
          three inch counter parts. They are lightly padded, but
          with enough force, they could be lethal.

          A five foot tall, white inflatable ball is already in
          play on the field. The ball could knock the wind out of
          you, but not fatally.

          Bruce is waiting next to a hole that leads into the
          field. Saundra and Matthew drop down from the vent to
          see him waiting, gun in hand.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (V.O. from P.A.)
                         Come on boss man ! Don't you wanna play
                         ?  You've never beaten me on the table
                         up in the bar...

          The wall beside them starts to close in, forcing them
          into the playing field.

          Bruce waits for a moment.. then starts to run through
          the field. Saundra goes next, then Matthew follows.

          Once on the field, Matthew realizes what he's in.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (in comedic shock)
                         You've got to be kidding me !

          At that moment, Matthew is swiped by one of the
          cushioned, human sized Foosball players. He gets the
          wind knocked out of him.

          Further ahead, Bruce ducks and dodges the players with
          some ease, but gets hit unexpectedly by the five foot
          tall ball. He looses his balance and goes down.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          On the monitor, we get a bird's eye view of the whole
          field, as if it were a video game.

                                          JOHNNY
                         That's the way ! Look at her go !

          On the monitor, we see Saundra, bob and weave her way
          through to near the end without getting hit.


          INT. LIFE SIZE FOOSBALL FIELD, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Saundra makes it to the end and waits by the exit.

          Bruce gets up, only to get knocked over by a player.
          Bruce gets up again and sees the ball rolling right to
          him.
          He pulls out the pistol and shoots the ball and the air
          decompresses. He then makes his way to the exit.

          He starts to leave.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         What about Matt ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Leave him, he's dead.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         No !

          Saundra runs back out to the field. She makes her way to
          Matthew. He's trying to stand but gets knocked over
          every time by a player.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny is playing the game controls laughing.


          INT. HUMAN SIZED FOOSBALL FIELD, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Saundra gets to Matthew and helps him up. Together they
          run to the exit. They duck together and weave together.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny hits the controls

                                          JOHNNY
                         Fuck ! That's not fair ! She cheated !


          INT. HUMAN SIZED FOOSBALL FIELD, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Saundra makes it to the exit with Matthew in tow.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Hey buddy, thanks for the help back
                         there !

                                          BRUCE
                         I don't help criminals.

          Bruce goes through the door that now opens.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Criminals ?


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          ZACH
                         What's next ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         I have a turn for the worse for the
                         team !

                                          ZACH
                         I do believe Mr. McCray will be most
                         pleased with the tape of this one.


          INT. LINE POLES, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          This is a maze of poles, like the ones used for
          directing people to a ride at a real amusement park.

          There are warped pictures of the other rides &amp; Scraps
          the Dog painted on the walls. The ceiling is fairly low
          in this room.



                                          SAUNDRA
                         Hey Mr. Personality ! Stop for a
                         second.

          Bruce keeps on walking.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I'm talking to you asshole !

                                          MATTHEW
                         Maybe all that testosterone plugs his
                         ears.

          Matthew starts to giggle at his own joke, only to find
          BRUCE dead in his face.

                                          BRUCE
                         Give me one good reason why I don't
                         plug you right here, right now ?
                              (Bruce hold the gun to
                              Matthew's nose)

                                          MATTHEW
                         Because of my charming personality ?

          Bruce cocks the hammer back. Saundra pushes the gun up
          and gets in BRUCE's face.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Why don't you tell us what the fuck is
                         going on ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Why should I ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         You said we were criminals, what did
                         you mean ?

                                          BRUCE
                         You're both embezzling. I saw the
                         records.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !

                                          BRUCE
                         Maybe not, but he is and fucking him
                         makes you an accessory. He stole your
                         passwords.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I'm not fucking him..

                                          MATTHEW
                              (whining a little)
                         You don't have to sound so emphatic.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         We just having our first date when you
                         showed up.

                                          BRUCE
                         Yeah, right.

          Bruce keeps on walking through the lines.

                                          BRUCE
                         I'd hurry it up, love birds. You don't
                         want to see what happens when you don't
                         keep the lines moving.

          As he says this, spikes come out of the poles and the
          back of the line begins to close in. The whole room is
          closing in on them - there is no backtracking here.

          Saundra frustrated, moves ahead. Matthew sees the spikes
          closing in slowly and spares no time catching up.


          INT. DEMON WATER RIDE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The three of them come into the start of the ride. There
          is a log ride boat awaiting them in the small tunnel of
          water. It leads to the left and there is an obvious drop
          right away.

          The room has a Bayou motif complete with fake wooden
          sheds and boat houses. The light is green and simulates
          a Louisiana mystic evening.

          The sign reads "Keep your hands and feet in at all times
          or else the 'Gator's will bite them off ! Enjoy the
          Demon Water Ride !"

          Matthew stops for a second to ponder the sign.

                                          MATTHEW
                         You said you built this place ?

          No answer, just Bruce waiting for the boat.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I think you have WAY too much free time
                         on your hands. What about other hobbies
                         ? I mean what's wrong with building toy
                         trains or something.

          A Boat arrives. The walls start to push in, forcing
          everyone into the boat.

                                          BRUCE
                         Get in.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny speaks into a microphone.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Yes, get in.

          On the monitor we see them all get on board the little
          log shaped boat.


          INT. DEMON WATER RIDE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          In starts off slow. And there's the canned screams from
          rides from the 1920's.

          They immediately drop at a 40 degree angle and splash
          into a little water. The lighting gets dimmer as they
          go.

          Matthew gets most of the splashes and is drenched.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (wipes the water out of his
                              eyes)
                         Awk ! This sucks !

          The boat moves slowly to the left, then jerks slightly
          to the right. Up ahead, we see a small hill leading up.

          Bruce begins to tighten his grip on the bar. Saundra
          notices, and also grabs tightly.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         This isn't so bad.

          Just then the boat starts down a slop, while missing th
          up hill ahead.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (screaming)
                         Oh Shit !

          The ride begins several sharp turns and steep drops.
          Saundra is terrified, Matthew is feeling nauseous. Bruce
          is smiling slightly. He's proud of his work.

          After a about three minutes of turns and drops, and even
          sudden lifts. They reach the bottom. It's darker here
          than the rest of the ride.

          The boat stops.



                                          MATTHEW
                         Is it over ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Not quite....

          Everything is quiet and still for a moment.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (from P.A.)
                         That's it folks for the Demon Boat
                         Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your
                         hands and feet.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Where's the dock ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I think that's the point.

          The boat starts to sink in the black water.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Oh SHIT !

          Bruce is first out &amp; he's swimming away from the one
          light in this pool. It's emanating from the far wall,
          underwater.

                                          MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                         Hey, where are you going ? Hey !

          Matthew &amp; Saundra are following him as he swims to a
          rock in the middle of this seemingly black sea. Bruce
          gets on the rock and stands. Matthew stops and treads
          water, trying to catch his breath.

                                          MATTHEW
                         That's nice.
                              (spits water out)
                         I think I lost my wallet.

                                          BRUCE
                         I'd get out of the water if I were you.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Why ?

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (over P.A.)
                         And now ladies and gentlemen it's time
                         for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !

                                          MATTHEW
                         Great ! You couldn't be a fan of
                         Dolphins or some other less threatening
                         animal.

          Saundra gets on the rock with Bruce. Matthew is lagging.
          He gets to the rock just as the underwater.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Matt !

          Underwater lights come on. It illuminates the whole cave
          where they are. The bluish green pool is about 300
          square feet and branches off in four directions. It's
          like someone made their pool into a fake swamp.

          Matthew panics when he sees that there are about twelve
          crocks in the water with him. He gets up on the rock
          too. They are crowding this little rock.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Now what ?


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          JOHNNY
                              (into microphone)
                         Who can make it to the exit alive ?

          Johnny presses a button.


          INT. CAVE WITH CROCODILES, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The rock begins its descent into the water.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          JOHNNY
                         I've got five bucks that says someone
                         dies here and now.

                                          ZACH
                         I'll see that bet.

          Zach reaches into his wallet.


          INT. CAVE WITH CROCODILES, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The rock completely lowers into the water.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Now where do we go ?

                                          BRUCE
                         I don't know.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I thought you made this place ?

                                          BRUCE
                         I did, but this room has four exits and
                         only one opens, it's up to them in the
                         control room. There's one right over
                         there. The exit light is on, but he can
                         change it.

          He starts to swim for it. The light turns off and
          another light on the other side of the cave turns on.

                                          BRUCE (CONT'D)
                         Fuck ! He's toying with us.

          Bruce looks from side to side. Saundra tries to see a
          way out too.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Shit here comes a crock ! Here it
                         comes.


          Bruce sees this and moves closer to her.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny leans to the edge of his seat.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Get ready to hand over that fiver.


          INT. CAVE WITH CROCODILES, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The crock is moving in on Saundra. Bruce pulls out the
          pistol and fires it into the water and empties it into
          the crock. He sees the blood.

                                          BRUCE
                         The crocks will eat him up before they
                         come after us, let's go.

          They all three start to swim for the exit that's open.


          The crocodiles all go after the dead crock and start to
          feast. The blood keeps them from even noticing anything
          else in the water.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Zach reaches out his hand

                                          ZACH
                         You were saying ?

          Johnny hands over a dirty five dollar bill.

                                          ZACH
                         Aren't you going to switch exits on him
                         again ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         Why ? The crocks are all going for the
                         dead crock. There's no fun in it.
                         Besides we've got plenty more for them.
                         The night is young....


          INT. DRAGON'S CAVE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce is dripping and Saundra is shaking for the first
          time yet. Matthew has been shaken since he woke up and
          is finding new levels of scared.

          This tunnel is about four feet wide and simulates a real
          cave. The walls are brown and gray with moss in certain
          spots. There are pink and blue lights to give this a
          fairy tale look. Fake smoke comes from tiny spouts in
          the floor.

          We here faint growls from something ominous.

                                          MATTHEW
                         What's next Walt ?

                                          BRUCE
                         A dragon.

                                          MATTHEW
                         So what happened ? Did you have a real
                         bad theme park experience as a kid and
                         this is your revenge ?

          Bruce stops at a corner.

                                          BRUCE
                              (whispers)
                         Be very, very quiet...

                                          MATTHEW
                              (whispering)
                         Are you hunting wabbits ?

          Pan around the three and the camera peeks around the
          corner to reveal a .....

          Giant animatronic Dragon. It is about thirty feet long,
          green with scales all the way down it's long tail. It
          has wings in the back and it's head is down low like it
          is sleeping. Smoke comes out of it's nostrils as it
          groans. The eyes slowly open and close and the head
          barely lifts off the ground.

          The pink and blue lights shine on it's green skin to
          give it a surreal look.

                                          BRUCE
                              (whispering)
                         The room has sound sensors. If you wake
                         it up, it breathes fire.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (whispering)
                         You were one of those guys that played
                         Dungeons &amp; Dragons with real swords,
                         weren't you.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Shhhh !

          Bruce makes his way across the room silently. Matthew
          tries to go next.

          He stops and stares at the dragon. He then keeps moving.

          Saundra goes last. From the side of the wall, a trip
          wire extends out. She trips and falls.

          The dragons head rises. The roar is horrible. From the
          mouth starts to breath fire like a flamethrower.

          Bruce rushes back and pulls Saundra up forcefully. The
          heat is immense.

          They all three make it around the corner to a set of
          stairs. Bruce rushes them all up the stairs.

                                          BRUCE
                              (screaming over the burning
                              sounds)
                         Keep moving, keep moving.

          Fire fills the last three or four steps. It catches
          Bruce on the foot. He winces, but keeps moving.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Zach hands over the five dollar bill back to Johnny


          INT. SHORT HALL, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          This is a hallway that physically gets smaller, it's a
          perspective warp with black and white swirls painted.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         How do we get out of this room ?

                                          BRUCE
                         We wait. This is an elevator.

                                          MATTHEW
                         An elevator ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty
                         feet below the subway stations. We're
                         heading a little higher up now.

                                          SAUNDRA
                              (to Bruce)
                         How's your foot ?

                                          MATTHEW
                              (imitating her)
                         "How's your foot" ? This guy tried to
                         kill us and he put us in this place,
                         and you want to know how his foot is ?

                                          BRUCE
                         It's fine thanks.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Why don't you tell us a little about
                         yourself ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad
                         day here and we're just starting.

          The door the came in from opens up and they exit.


          INT. THE SEA OF PLASTIC BALLS, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The come into room that is about a hundred yards by a
          hundred yards and over a sixty feet tall. It's dimly
          lit, but there are millions of small red, blue, and
          yellow plastic balls covering the floor. At the far end
          of the room is a jungle gym maze of padded walls that
          lead up to an exit at the top of the room. Basically
          this is like an adult version of a McDonald's Playland.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Now what the hell are we supposed to do
                         ?

                                          BRUCE
                         We have to climb up that.

                                          MATTHEW
                         That's not to tough.

                                          BRUCE
                         Look...

          Bruce points to the sea of plastic balls. As he does,
          eight feet tall Nerf spikes fly out of the ground.

                                          BRUCE (CONT'D)
                         There's enough force to push you twenty
                         feet in the air. It won't kill you, but
                         it will hurt.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         You have issues. I mean you have some
                         serious issues that need to be ironed
                         out.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Issues ??? This guy has the damn
                         subscription to every psychotic issue
                         I've ever heard of.

                                          BRUCE
                         That's cute asshole.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                         Let's see if the lovely contestant can
                         make it to the top in three minutes !

          A soundtrack starts to play over the loud speaker a la
          American Gladiators. Bruce starts to run into the sea of
          plastic balls. The "running" ends pretty quick. The
          balls are about five feet deep.

          Matthew and Saundra dive in as well.  They struggle to
          move in the plastic ball mess.

          A few of the Nerf torpedoes launch around them.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         That was close.

          Bruce is moving along. Matthew starts to try a swimming
          motion. He starts to really move fast along.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Hey, try swimming. It works.

                                          BRUCE
                         What the fuck are you talking about.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Swimming, you know, like in water,
                         moron.

          Saundra starts to do a swimming motion and moves along.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Come on, it works.

                                          BRUCE
                         Give me a fucking.....

          Bruce is cut off by a Nerf projectile that launches him
          a few feet into the air. He lands just ahead of Matthew.

                                          MATTHEW
                         You okay ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Ow...

          The struggle through and get to the tower. Matthew gets
          to the deck first &amp; helps Saundra up. They both help
          pull Bruce out of the Plastic Ball Ocean.

                                          BRUCE (CONT'D)
                         We have to climb up these slides.

          They start up a slide and move forward. They get to
          another level up.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                         You have about sixty seconds !

          The sounds of a studio audience screams out in joy
          (prerecorded of course)

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Hurry ! Hurry !

          They find a rope with knots in it. They start to climb
          it. One at a time. Then more speedily they go into the
          nest level and find they have one more to go.

                                          MATTHEW
                         How do we get up to the top ?

          Bruce just stares for a moment.

                                          MATTHEW
                         What ? Don't you remember ? You know
                         everything else but this ?

          The Studio Audience track is counting down from TEN
          SECONDS.

                                          BRUCE
                         I remember ! Here, here !

          He climbs around the outside of the play set &amp; goes
          around to the top. Saundra follows, then Matthew. Just
          as the countdown gets to one, they get into the exit.


          INT. SMALL HALLWAY, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          They wait by the door to the next room, until it opens.


          INT. SUBWAY STATION X, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          This is a perfect mock up of a current day subway
          station in New York.

          Matthew is looking at the sign that says MEN'S ROOM
          rather longingly. Saundra is scoping the room out.
          BRUCE is staring forward.

                                          MATTHEW
                         This probably isn't the bet time, but I
                         really have to pee. Can I pee ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Knock yourself out.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Thanks...

          He starts for the Men's Room.

                                          BRUCE
                         NO !

          Just as Bruce yells for him, Matthew is shut into the
          Men's room and the subway train arrives. The smoke and
          air rushes in.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         What do we do now ?

                                          JOHNNY
                              (V.O. from P.A.)
                         Why don't you get in ?

          The floor starts to retract. Bruce gets in &amp; Saundra
          reluctantly follows.


          INT. SUBWAY MEN'S ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew is staring around. The urinals are putrid. The
          stalls emit an odor that keeps him from crossing the
          room. He hold his nose.

          On the speakers, a muzak version of Presidents of the
          United States song "Lump" starts to play.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (V.O. from P.A.)
                         Welcome to the Men's Room !

                                          MATTHEW
                         I'm a little self conscious here. I
                         can't urinate if you're gonna be
                         watching from the video camera.

          The toilets begin to flush automatically. The brown
          colored water starts to fill the floor. The room tips
          slightly toward them. Matthew starts to slide a little.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (V.O. from P.A.)
                         Maybe you should get over fears.

                                          ZACH
                              (V.O. from P.A.)
                         Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is
                         not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm
                         quite confident that my tie is looking
                         better than yours.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (beat, realizing who's voice
                              it is)
                         You son of a bitch ! I knew this wasn't
                         about my parking tickets.

                                          ZACH
                              (V.O. from P.A.)
                         That water there is piped in from the
                         great toilets of the upper class. I
                         hope you brought a snorkel.

          The ceiling begins to lower. Matthew stares longingly at
          the door. It's locked.


          INT. SUBWAY CAR, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce holds on to the rail as this thing corners
          harshly. Saundra keeps losing her grip on the rail.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         So where does this lead ?

                                          BRUCE
                         No where. We've got about seven minutes
                         before this thing slams into a concrete
                         wall.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         So what do we do ?

                                          BRUCE
                         I'm working on it.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Who the hell are you anyway ? What is
                         this place ?

                                          BRUCE
                         It's called Murderland. It's paid for
                         by First Bank.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         First Bank ? But how ?

                                          BRUCE
                         It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         McCay knows ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on
                         tape. This whole place is here for his
                         sick amusement. And no so are we.

          The lights flicker out as they round another corner.


          INT. SUBWAY MEN'S ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The ceiling is closing, and so is the nasty brown water
          from the toilets.

          Matthew is staring in the mirror of the broken, dirty
          mirror. He has given up.




                                          MATTHEW
                         I got it ! get over your fear.

          He stands next to a urinal. He unzips his fly.

                                          MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                         Oh god, this is bad.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          JOHNNY
                         Look he figured it out !

                                          ZACH
                              (into microphone)
                         I can see your small business ! Look at
                         it it's so small.


          INT. SUBWAY MEN'S ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew is trying to pee. His eyes are closed.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I know that this might seem like the
                         right time to come out of the closet,
                         but believe me, it's not.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny is laughing and pointing at Zach who is fuming
          and turning red.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (on monitor)
                         Unless of course the guy your with is
                         your lover. By all means let it out.
                         Start sharing the gay love.

          Johnny stops laughing. He slams down on a switch.


          INT. SUBWAY MEN'S ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The room tilts even more with a sudden jolt.

          Matthew looks up surprised ! He's Peeing !

                                          MATTHEW
                         Ha ! yes Yes Yes !

          As soon as he's finished, a door opens up on the wall.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Cardinal rule, lovebirds, once you
                         start peeing you can't stop.

          Matthew flushes and runs out the open door that opened
          in the wall.


          INT. SUBWAY, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce has his eyes closed. Saundra jumps up. She goes to
          the door and breaks the glass with her elbow.

                                          BRUCE
                         What are you doing ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I'm leaving.

          She jumps out. Bruce smiles at this. He follows suit.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny looks at his monitors. He was so busy with
          Matthew he didn't notice them jump.

          On the moniter, we see the empty subway hit the concrete
          wall at full speed, smashing itself to pieces.

                                          ZACH
                         Look ! Look !

                                          JOHNNY
                         Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I
                         guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I
                         thought.

                                          ZACH
                         I don't know. Maybe we should watch the
                         tape to be sure.

                                          JOHNNY
                         You're paying the bills.


          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Saundra is walking (limping may be more accurate) back
          towards the station (fake station anyway). Bruce is
          trailing behind.

                                          BRUCE
                         Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !

                                          SAUNDRA
                         What ?

                                          BRUCE
                         You took an awful big risk back there.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Look I don't even wanna know how I got
                         in this mess. I just want out. It has
                         nothing to do with me.

                                          BRUCE
                         If you hadn't started boffing that
                         weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't
                         be here.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !

                                          BRUCE
                         Then you didn't give him any passwords
                         of any kind ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         NO ! I wouldn't do that.

                                          BRUCE
                         Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Why would he ? His parents are rich.

          She starts walking again. Bruce contemplates this. He
          vaguely remember the bank statements, but they did show
          that he had a lot of money before the wire transfers
          began, long before he started work at the bank. Bruce
          runs back over to her.


          INT. ROOM OF TUBES, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew walks into a room that has several tubes of
          varying shapes, colors, &amp; sizes, yet all are big enough
          for a person to climb into and crawl through.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (over the speakers)
                         So many tubes to get in, only one is
                         the way out.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Great.. great. Is there any kind of
                         hint or anything ?

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (beat, and over speakers)
                         Pick with expediency !

          The walls close in on him.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Don't rush me or anything.

          Matthew frantically sizes up the ten or twelve tubes.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Blue IS my color.

          Matthew climbs into the blue tube and crawls through it.
          As he crawls through it, the tube begins to shake a
          little, then spins.

                                          MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                         Well isn't this fun.

          He starts to move a lot faster. Then it begins to tip
          downward.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Ohhhhhh SHHHHHHITTT !


          INT. LANDING ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew slides right into a fluffy pillow about ten feet
          long.

          Matthew looks around the small room. He puts his arm on
          the back of his neck and starts to rub.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I am definitely going to see a
                         chiropractor.

          A door slides like Star Trek open before him. A giant
          spotlight shines on Matthew.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                         (from the new room)
                         Okay drivers ! Start your engines !

          Matthew slowly rises and looks into the race track room.  

                                          ANNOUNCER
                         Remember not to touch the floor or
                         else...
                              (a giant buzzer sound)
                         You'll get the shock of your life !

          Matthew gets into a smaller size race car.


          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Saundra is still walking ahead of Bruce. He is still
          limping &amp; trying to catch up.

                                          BRUCE
                         So you're telling me you were set up ?
                         I knew something was wrong.

                                          SAUNDRA
                              (very sarcastic)
                         I'm not listening.

                                          BRUCE
                         Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get
                         out of here alive.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         You've been doing a bang up job so far.
                         Right now Matt is probably dead and
                         it's your fault.

          Bruce stops in his tracks.



          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny &amp; Zach are reviewing the tapes.

                                          ZACH
                         What's Mr. Parker doing ?

          On the live feed monitor we see Matthew driving a
          miniature bumper car around a maze.

                                          JOHNNY

          He's driving. He can't step off or he'll be electrocuted
          and I haven't open the maze up yet. He can't get out.

          A cell phone rings. Johnny turns and looks around.

          Zach removes the phone from his jacket pocket.

                                          ZACH
                              (into cell phone)
                         Zachary.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (V.O. from phone)
                         Zach, my boy ! How is tonights
                         adventure going ?

                                          ZACH
                         Good, sir.

          CUT TO:


          INT. JOHN C. MCAY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          John C. McCay is in a robe and drinking wine from a nice
          glass. There is a beautiful woman in a MAID's outfit in
          the room.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (into phone)
                          Is it as good as I hope it is ?

                                          ZACH
                              (V.O. from phone)
                         Better, sir.

          The Maid approaches Mr. McCay and starts to kiss his
          neck.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (to Maid)
                         One moment dear...
                              (she goes down O.C.)

                                          ZACH
                              (V.O. from phone)
                         Sir ?

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (into phone)
                         Not you Zach.
                              (to Maid)
                         Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs,
                         dear.
                              (back into phone)
                         Zach, am I gonna like what I see on
                         this tape ? Is it the grandest of all
                         the Park's tapes ?


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Zach is loosening his tie.

          Johnny is yawning.

                                          ZACH
                              (into phone)
                         Yes sir. It will be the best of your
                         collection, I assure you.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (V.O. from phone)
                         Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.

                                          ZACH
                         Sir ? We're moving them right along as
                         fast as we can.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (V.O. from phone)
                         Have that tape on my desk tomorrow
                         morning.
                              (sounds of a groan)
                         First.... thing...

                                          ZACH

          Yes sir. Try a little aspirin for that.

          The phone clicks off. Zach starts to fold up his phone.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Was that the Old Man ?

                                          ZACH
                         Yes. I think he's feeling sick or
                         something.

          Johnny starts to use the controls to zoom on Matthew in
          the race car. On the moniter we see Matthew looking very
          serious.


          INT. BUMPER CAR MAZE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew is driving like a race car driver. he's even
          making th engine noises himself. The car is made for a
          twelve year old, so Matthew's knees are up against his
          chest.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          On the moniter we see Saundra break out the door window
          and jump out.

                                          ZACH
                         There ! There ! Did you see ! They're
                         still alive !

                                          JOHNNY
                         I can see that but where ?


          INT. TUNNEL, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Saundra is still defiantly walking ahead of Bruce.

                                          BRUCE
                         It won't take them that long to figure
                         out we weren't on the train when it
                         wrecked.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Not listening !

                                          BRUCE
                         Look, there's another train. They'll
                         send it through here. You're fucked if
                         you don't STOP and listen to me.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I'm listening.

                                          BRUCE
                         At the subway station, we can get into
                         a power duct that my little shit head
                         of an assistant doesn't know about.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny is working the board.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Okay, I've got the other train coming
                         around now.


          INT. TUNNEL, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce stops. He hears the other train coming.

                                          BRUCE
                         Shit, it's too late. The other train's
                         coming.

          You can hear the horn of the train from here.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Any ideas ?

          A door opens up before them in the wall.

                                          BRUCE
                         He found us already. Let's go.

          Bruce casually walks into the room. Saundra walks in,
          frustrated.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          JOHNNY
                              (into microphone)
                         Thought you had me there didn't you
                         Bruce ! Just goes to show that the tail
                         can wag the dog.


          INT. WATER TANK ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          In what looks like just a storeroom, Bruce tries for the
          door. It's locked. Then the water starts to pour in from
          ceiling.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         What's the trick here ?

                                          BRUCE
                         We drown.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Obviously, but what's the way out ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we
                         have about 30 seconds, then a door
                         opens on the bottom over there. Then we
                         swim out.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         How long till the room fills ?

                                          BRUCE
                         I'd say about thirty to forty minutes.
                         Give or take a few.

          Bruce goes over to the camera and pulls it off by hand.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          The moniter goes black.

                                          ZACH
                         He's got a real complex about being on
                         camera, doesn't he ?


          INT. WATER TANK ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce is just looking around. They're both bored.
          There's nothing to do but wait.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         So why this ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Excuse me ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Why did you build this whole place ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Is this really the time ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Do you have something better to talk
                         about ?

                                          BRUCE
                              (takes a long moment)
                         I just graduated from M.I.T. in
                         engineering. That's when John McCay
                         hired me.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         He hired you to build this place ?

                                          BRUCE
                         I was hired in and started to do the
                         boring old work routine. I was
                         originally brought in as a technical
                         advisor. First Bank had sponsored my
                         scholarships.


          INT. BRUCE'S OFFICE - DAY

          Flashback scene. Bruce is younger, clean shaven and in a
          suit. He has his own office &amp; on his desk is the old
          game MOUSETRAP, modified and works by itself.

          John C. McCay enters.

          McCay talks to Bruce with a smile on his face &amp; motions
          for them to leave together.

                                          BRUCE
                              (V.O.)
                         I was asked to design something for Mr.
                         McCay. I had no idea what it was. I
                         though it was going to be a real
                         amusement park.


          INT. CLOSED SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY

          Through a door that has remained shut for many decades,
          Bruce &amp; John C McCay enter the dark room with a late
          1800's or early 1900's feel to it.

                                          BRUCE
                              (V.O.)
                         When I first saw the abandoned subway
                         tunnel, I still had no idea what it was
                         he wanted done. I started work on the
                         park.


          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

          Bruce is toiling away with the unfinished Main Street
          Merry Go Round. There are a lot of construction workers
          hammering and putting up walls.

          The walls are starting to go up on all of the buildings
          and it is a preliminary version of Main Street. There is
          even an unfinished, unpainted castle.

                                          BRUCE
                              (V.O.)
                         This is when I found out the truth....

          John McCay arrives with Zach. Bruce shakes hands with
          Zach.

                                          BRUCE (CONT'D)
                         They wanted a few changes in the
                         design.

          The Merry Go Round begins to emit gunfire.

                                          BRUCE
                              (V.O.)
                         This is when they told what it was
                         really for. They said that the people
                         that would be sent down here would only
                         be criminals, the scum of the world.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The younger Bruce is at the controls.

                                          BRUCE
                              (V.O.)
                         I remember the first guest. He was an
                         accountant that had raped his daughter.
                         He went to trial with the best lawyers
                         and got off. McCay used this as an
                         opportunity. We nabbed him and put him
                         in Murderland.

          On the moniter we see a middle aged exec wake up and get
          gunned down.

                                          BRUCE
                              (V.O.)
                         This is how I got started.


          INT. WATER TANK ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce has his head down.

                                          BRUCE
                         I was lured by all the money and I
                         truly did convince myself that what I
                         did was for justice. Since then, McCay
                         has wanted to put anyone he can down
                         here.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         But how do you know if the people are
                         guilty ?

                                          BRUCE
                         I do a very thorough background check.
                         I go through police files, personel
                         files, anything.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Then how come Matt and I showed up as
                         guilty ?

                                          BRUCE
                         It was there, clear as day. I saw the
                         computer records. Matthew has been fed
                         wiring money to his personal account.
                              (beat)
                         I just knew something was wrong.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         So you may have been duped this whole
                         time. Killing innocent people, that
                         must make you feel ..., how does it
                         feel ?

                                          BRUCE
                         There are other things too. They had
                         everyone start taking those psych
                         tests. Did they make you take one ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Yeah, everyone has to when they get
                         hired.

                                          BRUCE
                         There's more to it than trying to see
                         if you'd steal from the company or if
                         you'd lie or cheat.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         What do you mean ?

                                          BRUCE
                         McCay had a lot money done into
                         researching psychological reactions to
                         questions that are seemingly unrelated,
                         but reveal everything. Like criminal
                         impulses, homicidal impulses.....

          The water is at the knees and rising.


                                          SAUNDRA
                         And you believe that ?

                                          BRUCE
                         I've since changed my mind. I designed
                         this place, based on my belief that I
                         was doing what the legal system
                         couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the
                         company buy the property and they pay
                         the bills. It's a tax write off. On the
                         books everything looks kosher. I have
                         an office on 5th that I haven't seen in
                         ten years.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Doesn't anyone notice all the people
                         missing ?

                                          BRUCE
                         This is New York. No one notices
                         anyone. Not even when someone
                         disappears. At first it was the guy who
                         was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag.
                         Then it was dirty accountants that
                         tried to walk away with millions. The
                         Old Man got such a rush from it, I
                         thought that he would start trying to
                         send me people who used the copier
                         after hours.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         How can you just take a life ? I mean
                         it's a life, life is so precious.  How
                         does it feel ?

                                          BRUCE
                         What do you do with the company, if I
                         might ask ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I'm in charge of the conversions.
                              (beat)
                         When First Bank buys another smaller
                         bank, I'm in charge of converting them
                         to our systems and way of doing things.


                                          BRUCE
                         So when you took those jobs away last
                         October from the Mid West Central, and
                         that guy killed himself, how did it
                         make you feel ?



          Bruce starts to circle her.

          The water is to their waists now.



                                          SAUNDRA
                              (very surprised that he
                              knows)
                         I... I .....

                                          BRUCE
                         You didn't think about it did you ? I
                         read your file. It said you had a
                         nervous breakdown.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I wanted to let his family know....

                                          BRUCE
                         Know what ? That it was your fault ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         It wasn't my fault. I was just part of
                         a team. I was doing my job...

                                          BRUCE
                         So was I. So don't give me any shit.
                         Your business is just as bad. At least
                         I'm up front about it. You kill people
                         slowly. Your corporate take overs can
                         decimate a families livelihood over a
                         year sometimes two. Now you know how it
                         feels.

          Saundra just turns away and faces the wall.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Johnny is finishing off a bag of chips, pouring them
          straight into his mouth from the bag.

                                          ZACH
                         That is repugnant. You have the habits
                         of a goat.

                                          JOHNNY
                         &lt;<belch>&gt;

                                          ZACH
                         Ach ! How will you know if they've made
                         it ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         The room will fill to the top, then if
                         they wind up in the next room, they
                         lived, if not, they're dead.


          INT. WATER TANK ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          The water is up to their neck.

                                          BRUCE
                         Just remember, hold your breath as long
                         as you can. Then go right over to that
                         corner. The door will open and go in
                         and up.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Okay.

          The water is going over their heads now.

          Bruce takes a deep breath and goes under. Saundra holds
          out till the last possible second.

          These thirty seconds are the longest of their lives. The
          pressure on their lungs is enormous. Just when the panic
          begins to set in, the door opens. Bruce pushes Saundra
          through then follows through.


          INT. EXIT ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Saundra rises to the surface and gasps for air. Bruce
          comes up and does the same.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         You okay ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Fine...


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          JOHNNY
                         Shit they made it.

          He hands over another five dollar bill to Zach.

                                          ZACH
                         Thank you very much.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (into microphone)
                         Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about
                         thirty dollars so far.


          INT. EXIT ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce looks up at the video camera. It's too high up to
          hit. He scorns.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (over the P/A)
                         Why don't you just stop fucking around
                         and just die !

                                          BRUCE
                         I'm sick of playing. I've got a better
                         idea.

          Bruce walks under the camera. He motions for Saundra to
          follow. He opens a panel off of the wall. In there is a
          small service tunnel. Inside is a shotgun and two
          pistols. He hands her a pistol.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          On the moniter we see Bruce re-enter the frame.

                                          JOHNNY
                         I thought I lost you there for a second
                         boss man.

          On the moniter we see Bruce raise the shotgun and aim it
          directly at the camera.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Uh, oh.

          Johnny drops the bag of chips.

          On the moniter we see the screen go blank.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Uh oh.


          INT. EXIT ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

                                          BRUCE
                         If we can get to through the next room,
                         we'll be at a junction for a power
                         grid.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Let's go.

          They go through the door.


          INT. MINIATURE MANHATTAN, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          This is the room that has a 1/100th scale of Manhattan
          Island. It's night and storming. There are little
          robotic cars that honk horns and even little voices of
          cab drivers cursing at them.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         This is cute.

                                          BRUCE
                         Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but
                         the lightening is real.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?

                                          BRUCE
                         You don't. It's random, there no trick.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Great...

          They start to move through the city.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          ZACH
                         Okay, I have five that says THIS is it
                         for them.

                                          JOHNNY
                         I think I'll see hat action.


          INT. MINIATURE MANHATTAN, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce move fast in between the buildings. Saundra
          follows behind. Lightening is striking at 7 or 8 second
          bursts throughout. The voices of the cabs and cars is
          heard.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Where are we going ?

                                          BRUCE
                         The Brooklyn Bridge.

          They run in between the buildings. A Bolt hits right
          between them. There is even fake thunder sounds. The
          keep trucking forward. Bruce trips on a car and hits the
          ground. Saundra tugs at his hand.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Get Up ! Keep coming. Come On !

          Bruce gets up and goes. They are holding hands as they
          push onward.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          JOHNNY
                         Isn't that touching.

          He presses a button.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (into microphone)
                         Isn't that cute !

          On the moniter we see a bolt hit right on Bruce. Saundra
          loses her grip on his hand. He goes down.


          INT. MINIATURE MANHATTAN, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Saundra goes back for Bruce.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Come on, get up ! You can make it.

          Bruce starts to stir. It wasn't a direct hit, but more
          than a small shock. His arm is steaming from the singe.

                                          BRUCE
                         Okay, just stop yelling.

          He groggily gets up.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

                                          ZACH
                         Give me my five back.


          INT. MINIATURE MANHATTAN, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce and Saundra make it to the Brooklyn Bridge. They
          go into the half height exit door that's there.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Zach is holding onto his five dollar bill.

                                          ZACH
                         So what's next ? No one's ever made it
                         this far before.

                                          JOHNNY
                         He's got two chices.either it's the
                         Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in
                         Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows
                         that no one can make it out of here in
                         one piece.

          He fingers a moniter. There is a map that has the entire
          maze listed on the screen next to it.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Being the fair guy that he is, Bruce
                         designed this place so that there is
                         one solution to every room. If you can
                         make it through all thirty rooms, you
                         live. No one's made it past seven till
                         now.


          INT. RACETRACK, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew is still driving like a madman. He looks very
          sleepy.

          Another automated car bumps into him from behind, giving
          him a jolt.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (over P.A.)
                         You must come in first place to move on
                         !

                                          MATTHEW
                         Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never
                         be able to win this shit.

          More of the other miniature cars race past him.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I should have played more Nintendo
                         racing games.

          He floors it and gets into the race again.



          INT. ALICE IN MURDERLAND, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          This is a room with astro turf for grass and three giant
          fake trees. There's a long dining table set up with
          plates and desert.

          This room looks like movie set and the paper machete
          decorations on the wall add to it.

          Bruce &amp; Saundra enter. There is a murmuring of deep
          voices. The lights brighten on the trees. They begin to
          come to life &amp; speak. The Trees have faces &amp; the speak
          like the Trees from the Wizard of Oz.

                                          TREE #1
                         Hey buddy, you got a light ?

                                          TREE#2
                         You can't smoke asshole, you'll catch
                         fire !

                                          TREE #3
                         Awe, let him smoke, what I need is a
                         little piece of ass !

          Saundra laughs at the arguement that the trees are
          having. Bruce starts to walk toward the table.

                                          TREE#2
                         What are you going to do ? Leaf fuck
                         him ? You've got no genitalia ! You Are
                         A Tree ! Get it ?

                                          TREE #1
                         You just stop that or I'll......

          At this point a gas is emitted from the tree.

                                          TREE#2
                         Oh God ! That smells downright rank !

                                          TREE #3
                         Yikes, I shouldn't have had that taco !

          The other tree let's loose a yellow gas from the leaves.

          Saundra begins to cough and gasp. Bruce does to, then he
          runs over to the dinner table.



                                          BRUCE
                         Quick, drink this !

          He hands her a cup of tea from the table.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I don't get it.

                                          BRUCE
                         It's poison gas, this is the antidote.
                         Drink it.

                                          TREE#2
                         You guys disgust me !

                                          TREE #1
                         He hee hee hee hee.

                                          TREE #3
                         Hey, pull my branch !

                                          TREE #1
                         Hee hee hee hee heeh hee/

          Saundra drinks the tea &amp; then Bruce takes a swig.

                                          BRUCE
                         Come on let's get out of here.


          INT. HALLWAY, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce stops Saundra.

                                          BRUCE
                         Here. Help me get the panel off.

          They tear at the wall piece and it comes off. Bruce sees
          the power box.

                                          BRUCE (CONT'D)
                         Get back !

          Bruce pulls out the Shotgun and fires it.

          All the lights go out.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND

          Over half the monitors go out. The grid of the entire
          Murderland has over half go out.

                                          JOHNNY
                         What the ... ?

                                          ZACH
                         What happened ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         The power went out in half the park.

                                          ZACH
                         How can this happen ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         I don't know. I think that a power grid
                         just needs reset. Don't get your
                         panties in a bunch. I'll go down and
                         reset it.

                                          ZACH
                         Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?

                                          JOHNNY
                         Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way
                         over here

          Johnny points on the map of the park on a monitor.

                                          JOHNNY
                         He'll never make it to the main power
                         grid. Those two are way over here...
                              (points to another area)
                         I'll be over here trying to get the
                         power back up. It'll only take a few
                         minutes.

          Johnny gets a flashlight and a pistol.


          INT. MINI CAR RACE TRACK, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew is sitting in his miniature bumper car in the
          dark. None of the other cars are moving and only the
          emergency lights are on.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Hey ! Hey ! What happened ?

          He throws his helmut on the floor. Nothing happens.

                                          MATTHEW
                         No guts no glory. Of course without any
                         guts, I'd have a hard time keeping my
                         food down.

          He reaches out and touches the floor real fast. He
          flinches. Nothing happens.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Electrocuted my ass !

          He starts to walk around the race track.


          INT. HALLWAY, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce and Saundra are running through the now powerless
          hall in the dark.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Do you know where you're going ?

                                          BRUCE
                         Yes.

          We hear a thud.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         What was that ?

                                          BRUCE
                              (painfully)
                         Girder, watch your head.

          We hear a door open. Then a flashlight illuminates the
          hall.

                                          BRUCE (CONT'D)
                         Here, we can take this service tunnel
                         straight to the end. No one knows about
                         this but me. It'll lead you out to
                         Central Park, and I'll take care of my
                         #2.

          They go into the long service tunnel. It's about 100
          feet ahead and looks like just a brick tunnel where
          workmen would walk.


          INT. RACETRACK, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew gets over to the wall where a barely visible
          door is. With the partition, he never would have been
          able to make it to this part if the floor was still
          electrifying.

          Matthew boldly opens the door and peeks in. The door
          slams right back at him. He jumps in a panic.

          There is a hallway with emergency lights on.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Well now Mr. Helper, I like the look of
                         this.

          He goes in. There are two tunnels. He takes the one on
          the right.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN SHERIFF'S OFFICE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          From the ceiling, a hatch opens, Johnny looks around.
          The power is barely on. Only the emergency lights are
          on. He climbs down.


          This is an all wooden simulated Sheriff's office circa
          1865.

          Johnny sees something out the window (he's on the second
          floor).


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew walks into the enormous room that appears to be
          a small section of an Old West Town. There is a Saloon,
          a General Store, a Stable, and at the far end to his
          right is the Sheriff's Station.

          The lights are coming from the light fixtures in the
          ceiling. This area still has full power. The ceiling is
          about sixty feet up and simulates high noon. There is
          even a wind machine blowing dust and tumble weeds back
          and forth across the street.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell will he think of next ?

          Matthew stands at the center of the town and sees the
          stable at he end of the right side.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STABLE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew walks in cautiously and sees an animatronic
          horse.

          Matthew sees a water fountain and takes a sip.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN ALLEY, MURDERLAND - NIGHT


          From the wall of a building opens the secret passage.
          Out comes Bruce and Saundra. They are quiet as can be.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN SHERIFFS OFFICE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Johnny checks the clip in his pistol.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (to the gun)
                         Let's kill us some weasel.

          Johnny exits through the front door.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STABLE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew starts to stare at the fake, unmoving horse.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (in a mock cowboy voice)
                         Steady ! Steady !

          He laughs to himself.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Johnny turns around when he hears the voice. He cocks
          his pistol and starts to move quickly and silently to
          the stable.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN ALLEY, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          First Saundra &amp; Bruce turn at the voice, then Johnny
          walks right by them.

          Bruce takes out his shotgun and follows.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Johnny gets to the door to the stable. He very slowly
          raises his pistol.

          From JOHNNY's POV we see, He takes his time aiming at
          Matthew.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (mock Mister Ed voice)
                         Wilbur, I have an itch on my ass, can
                         you scratch it ? Wi wi wi wi Wilbur !

          More laughing.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce sees Johnny about to shoot.

                                          BRUCE
                              (O.C.)
                         It's not polite to stare.

          C.U. of Johnny's eyes going wide.

          SUPER DUPER FAST - Johnny swings and goes low, shooting
          off the pistol at Bruce.

          Bruce fires off a round from the shot gun.

          They both miss each other.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STABLE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew drops to the ground.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (petting the leg of the
                              horse)
                         I'm sorry Mr. Ed ! I'm sorry Mr. Ed !


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          A showdown is in progress. Johnny is behind a water
          trough firing his pistol at Bruce. Bruce is behind a
          beam post of a building.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Where's you get the gun Boss man ?

          Bruce is silent. He starts to reload.

                                          JOHNNY
                         I thought that you said we were at the
                         START of trust.

          Johnny fires off several rounds at Bruce.

          Johnny then ducks into the saloon.

          Bruce follows, firing at him as he goes. The shotgun is
          empty. He drops it in the road and enters the saloon.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STABLE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew pops his head out into the street. No one there.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN SALOON, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce enters. No one there.

          This place has a piano, a bar, and the chandeliers and
          about twelve tables and matching chairs, all following
          the 1965 motif.

          From behind the bar, Johnny pops up and starts to fire -
          two handed John Woo style with a nine millimeter and a
          .45.


          Bruce goes to the ground and rolls over, firing from a
          pistol.

          Glass bottles and the mirror behind Johnny shatter, He
          goes back down behind the bar.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew walks wearily by. Saundra gets behind him from
          the alley. She taps him on the shoulder.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for
                         Christ sakes !

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Shut up ! It's me.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I think I'm very quickly getting over
                         my phobia of public urination.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         What ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         Nothing.

          The shots can easily be heard going off int he Saloon.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN SALOON, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          It's a stalemate so far.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Give it up Bruce. You can work the park
                         better, but I'm the better shot. You
                         know it.

          Bruce thinks for a second. He knows it's true. Then he
          gets an idea. he starts to crawl away.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Why don't you take some of this ?

          Johnny gets up and starts firing away at the floor where
          Bruce WAS. He's so busy firing he doesn't notice. He
          finishes up and sees an empty floor.

                                          BRUCE
                         Ahem....

          Bruce is standing next to him with a gun to Johnny's
          temple.

          Johnny just closes his eyes in disappointment.

                                          BRUCE (CONT'D)
                         Turn your head a little more to the
                         left.

          Johnny turns away from Bruce. Then Johnny slaps the gun
          from him, and kicks him in the crotch. Johnny then bolts
          out the front door.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Johnny runs past Matthew and Saundra in terror. He goes
          around the building into the alley and through one of
          the passages.

          Bruce comes out.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Is it over ?

                                          BRUCE
                              (scrunchy with pain)
                         Almost. Look, you two get out of here.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Where ?

                                          BRUCE
                         In the jail cell is a spiral staircase.
                         It leads to the surface. Take it all
                         the way up.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         What about you ?

                                          BRUCE
                         There's one more person here for me to
                         visit.

                                          MATTHEW
                         It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Zach from work ?

                                          BRUCE
                         He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go.
                         Go now.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Don't have to tell me twice.

          Matthew starts running to the Sheriff's office.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Just stop it. End it here.

                                          BRUCE
                         It'll end. It'll end with him and
                         McCay. Then the park shuts down.
                         Permanently.

          The both go to the Sheriff's office. Bruce follows
          Johnny's trail.


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Zach sees nothing going on and decides to investigate.

          Zach climbs down the ladder into...


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN STREET, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          As he climbs down the ladder .....

          Matthew and Saundra see Zach first. They stop
          completely.

          Zach gets all the way to the bottom before he sees them.

                                          SAUNDRA
                              (clears her throat)
                         AHEM.

          Zach turns and sees them.

          Saundra picks up a piece of wood from the wreckage of
          the Saloon.

                                          ZACH
                         Might I suggest we...

                                          MATTHEW
                              Kick your ass ? Don't mind if
                              I do
                              (gets ready to punch him)

                                          ZACH
                         No !

          Saundra belts him with the wood and Matthew punches him
          fiercely.

          Zach manages to get up and run into one of the halls.


          INT. VIETNAM JUNGLE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Johnny is cowering next to a tree.

          It is very, very dark in here. It's not at all clear
          where we are.

          Suddenly, the lights flicker back to life. Like a tape
          being slowly turned back on, the sound effects of the
          room are that of a jungle and helicopters.

          The lights come back full on to reveal a fake Jungle
          set. There is a constant loop of Robert Duvall from
          "Apocolypse Now" screaming "I just love the smell of
          Napalm in the morning !"

          Explosions begin to be set off randomly in every
          direction.

          Johnny starts to run and Bruce appears before him in the
          fake creek in the center of the room.

          Johnny stops dead still. After a moment of sizing each
          other up, Johnny pulls out a knife menacingly.

          Bruce reveals a knife from his boot. Then he calmly and
          slowly approaches Johnny.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Time to bitch slap the boss.
                              (attempts a stab)
                         Come on, bitch.

          Bruce just steps up and slices into Johnny's arm.

                                          JOHNNY
                         Muther fucker !


          INT. CUBICLES OF THE DAMNED, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Zach limps into what appears to be an office in
          disarray. He sees the lights flickering on and off. It's
          hard to say that this intentional or not.

          As he passes a fax machine, it shoots out little white
          tubes (just like the old cylinders that fax paper used
          to be wrapped on). He trips and falls. His glasses fly
          off of his head.

          Matthew comes in behind him. So does Saundra.

                                          MATTHEW
                         This is fitting. The Offices of the
                         Damned. This is as good as any place
                         for you to die, you pond sucking piece
                         of shit.

          Zach backs away from the ratty looking pair.

                                          ANNOUNCER
                              (V.O. from P.A.)
                         Uh, Oh ! It's the Boss !

          As the voice is heard, Saundra pushes Matthew to the
          floor.

          From the big dark office behind Zach comes an
          animatronic John C. McCay (very realistic looking Ala
          Hall of Presidents) on wheels, holding a machine gun.

          Zach turns in time to see it as it sprays him full of
          bullet holes.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (animatronic pre recorded
                              voice, with no lips moving)
                         You're fired ! You're fired ! You're
                         fired !

          The animatronic John C. McCay recedes back into the
          office on it's rollers.

          Saundra remains on the floor looking at Matthew, who
          checks his own body for holes.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside
                         from the one's that nature gave you ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         I'm fine.

          They both get up and look at the bloody lifeless corpse
          of Zach on the floor.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Another bad tie...

          They both walk out of the room back to the Old West.


          INT. VIETNAM JUNGLE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Bruce has Johnny in a head lock and is choking him to
          death.

          Johnny gets a hand loose and slams it backwards into
          Bruce's gut. Johnny is now loose and hits Bruce in the
          head.

                                          JOHNNY
                              (still a little raspy voiced
                              from the choke)
                         You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?

                                          BRUCE
                              (casually)
                         For once in your life, shut the fuck
                         up.

          Bruce lands a punch in Johnny's face, disorienting him.
          It's all he needs. A series of deadly blows to the head
          and stomach. Johnny goes down face first into the creek.
          Bruce then takes out his knife and slams it into the
          back of Johnny's neck.

                                          BRUCE
                         If I had known this is what it took to
                         shut you up, I'd have done it a year
                         ago.


          INT. OLD WEST TOWN SHERIFF'S OFFICE, MURDERLAND - NIGHT

          Matthew is in the jail cell. He finds the spiral
          staircase and starts up. Bruce goes to the open access
          tunnel that Johnny left open. Saundra starts up the
          spiral stairs.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Hey Matty, don't wait for me or
                         anything.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I was thinking maybe we should try this
                         dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot
                         version will be open by then....


          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

          A manhole opens and put comes Matthew &amp; Saundra.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad
                         to see Central Park at night.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         We made it !

          Long beat

                                          SAUNDRA
                              (looking in every direction)
                         What now ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         I want to go to sleep for about a
                         month.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         No, idiot. Where do we go now ?

                                          MATTHEW
                              (looks around too)
                         Where are we ?

          As they both turn to see where they are, a group of
          about six gang members all surround Matthew &amp; Saundra.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I don't suppose any of you know how to
                         get to Park West from here ?

          The gang leader, because of his Afro, let's call him
          KAREEM, 22 and very mean looking African American.

                                          KAREEM
                              (calm and serene)
                         Wallets. Now.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         We don't have anything.

                                          KAREEM
                         Wrong answer.
                              (brandishes a gun)
                         I think you better become less fiscally
                         challenged.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (whispering)
                         It never rains, but it pours.

                                          KAREEM
                              (yelling)
                         What the fuck did you just say, whitey
                         !?! Are you commenting on my Afro,
                         muther fucker ? I am sick and tired of
                         lining the Man's wallet.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Stick it to the Man is what I always
                         say.
                              (everyone stops and stares at
                              Matthew)
                         No, I was just saying what a shitty
                         night we're having. It was nothing to
                         do with your hair style or your
                              (Kareem puts the gun in
                              MMatthewsmouth)
                         mmmmmm hmmmm

                                          KAREEM
                         That's much better. Now wallets. Ya'll
                         white folks think you can talk shit to
                         me and I gotsta take it.

                                          BRUCE
                              (O.C.)
                         Now I should have done that hours ago.

          Everyone turns to see Bruce holding a shotgun in his
          right hand and a pistol in the left.

                                          KAREEM
                         This ain't none of your bidness, man.
                         You're distracting us from a financial
                         transaction

                                          BRUCE
                         I'm sorry, is this distracting ?
                              (moves in closer to two of
                              the thugs)
                         What about this ?

          Bruce whacks two of the guys in a blink, then fires off
          at the remainder as they go running back into the trees.

                                          BRUCE
                         That's much better. Just us.

          Kareem keeps the gun on Matthew. He is disturbed and
          panicking on the inside.

                                          BRUCE

          What do you say you take the gun out of his mouth and
          then put it on the ground ? Then I'll let you limp away
          from this experience.

          Kareem sizes this up.

                                          KAREEM
                         Okay.

                                          BRUCE
                         SLOWLY !

           Kareem VERY slowly puts the gun on the ground.

                                          BRUCE
                         Now turn around. Hands on your head.

          Kareem complies. Bruce then slams the but of the shotgun
          into the back of his head.



                                          MATTHEW
                         Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know
                         what it was like to see my life flash
                         before my eyes for the one hundredth
                         time tonight.

                                          SAUNDRA
                              (to Bruce)
                         Come to the rescue again I see.

                                          BRUCE
                         Let's roll. We have about three quarter
                         of a mile to the edge of the park.
                         They'll be coming back full force and
                         one shotgun is not gonna scare off all
                         of them. It'll be daylight soon too.

          They start to trot to the path.


          EXT. EDGE OF CENTRAL PARK - DAWN

          Matthew and Saundra get to the street and both stop in
          exhaustion. They almost fall to the ground.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I got the real man's workout tonight
                         didn't I ?
                              (looks around)
                         Where did he go ?

          Saundra spins around too.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         He was right behind me !

                                          MATTHEW
                         Who was that guy anyway ?


          EXT. FIRST BANK, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

          Business as usual. People come and go. Corporate America
          at it's finest.


          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE, FIRST BANK - DAY

          John C McCay enters from the private elevator. He goes
          by the video viewing room. The T.V. is on.

          He walks by, then backs up.

          He goes in.


          INT. VIDEO VIEWING ROOM, FIRST BANK - DAY

          He sees the tape of last nights adventures in the park.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Zach, my boy ?

          He sees the images from the prior night. He sees Bruce
          and the others running through the Foosball Field.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Oh my this is better than we thought it
                         would be. I told you Ol' Bruce would be
                         the man if we put him in there !

                                          BRUCE
                         That's what I thought.

          Bruce is there in the Police uniform. He punches John C.
          McCay in the back of the head and then injects him with
          a syringe.


          FADE TO BLACK


          INT. MAIN STREET MURDERLAND

          Fade in.

          John C McCay hears the sound of the theme music over the
          PA

                                          ANNOUNCER
                         Welcome to Murderland ! And Here's
                         Scraps the official mascot for
                         Murderland.

          Scraps takes his shots from the tommy gun.


          John C. McCay runs his old fat ass toward the entrance
          that says "FANTASY LAND". He barely dodges the bullets
          as he makes it into the room.


          INT. FANTASY LAND, MURDERLAND - DAY

          The room is like a cartoon, a cartoon living room where
          all the objects are ten times bigger than they should
          be.

          The walls are about 100 feet straight up and there is
          blue/white wall paper up, also of enormous size. The
          floor is like giant carpet with a blue shag and even an
          Afghan on the blue, 30 foot tall couch. In front of the
          couch is a twenty foot tall coffee table.

          McCay runs forward towards the other side of the room,
          the mouse hole is the exit. A Giant vacuum cleaner
          begins to chase him. He ducks around a leg of the table.
          The vacuum continues on past him.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Is this the best you can do, Bruce ?


          INT. CONTROL ROOM,  MURDERLAND - DAY

          We see Bruce's silhouette in front of the moniter. His
          hand works the controls silently. We can see McCay on
          the monitors and a diagram of the room on another.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                              (from the moniter)
                         Did you think I didn't learn anything
                         from watching ALL those tapes ?


          INT. FANTASY LAND, MURDERLAND - DAY

          John C McCay is laughing a little and his breath is
          labored. He sees the vacuum at the other side of the
          enormous room turning back around.

                                          JOHN C. MCCAY
                         Even I can out run this thing. He
                         starts to walk a little away from under
                         the table.

          A giant IRON falls from on top of the huge table. As
          McCay takes another step he gets crushed by the giant
          clothing utensil.

          The vacuum circles the table legs.




          FADE TO BLACK


          INSERT : TWO WEEKS LATER


          INT. FIRST BANK, 44TH FLOOR - DAY

          Saundra is at the water cooler, getting a drink. Matthew
          walks up to her.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin'
                         ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Hey buddy. You okay ?

                                          MATTHEW
                         Of course I am. I feel the testosterone
                         coursing through my veins.
                              (pause)
                         Now that I've gotten the stitches
                         removed from my arm and the
                         chiropractor fixed my back.

          He presses down on the water button and nothing happens.
          He hits it and hurts his hand.

                                          MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                         Ow. Son of a .....
                              (does a "I'm in pain dance")
                         Did I ever tell you my theory on Star
                         Wars as Porn ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         No.

                                          MATTHEW
                         Well, I think if you take several lines
                         out of context, Star Wars becomes a
                         very sexual movie. I mean listen to
                         this.
                              (mocks ther characters)
                         "Luke, at that speed will you be able
                         to pull out in time ?" or "You came in
                         that thing ? You're braver than I
                         thought".


          An executive in a $1,000 three piece suit walks up and
          smoothly gets the cup full of water. He then turns to
          face Saundra, and has his back to Matthew.

                                          BRUCE
                         Excuse me, son. You're not discussing a
                         sexual topic on company time here are
                         you ?

          Matthew does not recognize or see him at all. As far as
          he's concerned, he thinks it's another exec.

          Saundra doesn't notice who it is at first, but does a
          double take and her jaw goes to the floor as she sees
          that it is Bruce.

                                          MATTHEW
                              (very nervous and not
                              recognizing Bruce)
                         No sir. I was just getting , well you
                         know. Water. We weren't talking about
                         sex or anything else except Star Wars.
                         Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go
                         now.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Why don't you shut up now.

                                          MATTHEW
                         I'm going to go ahead and go now.

          Matthew backs away and starts to go back to his cube.
          Matthew trips over a trash can.

          After a beat, Matthew straightens up and attempts to
          salvage the microbe of dignity he has. Another beat and
          he walks away.



                                          SAUNDRA
                         What are you DOING here ?

                                          BRUCE
                         I work here, remember ?

                                          SAUNDRA
                         That was eleven years ago.

                                          BRUCE
                         Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on
                         the payroll for several years now. I
                         still have an office and secretary. No
                         one even batted an eyelash. Do you
                         realize what the high turnover is in a
                         multi corporation bank in New York ?

                         Apparently pretty high, we just got a
                         new CEO last week.

                                          BRUCE
                         That's a shame.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Yeah a real shame.

                                          BRUCE
                         Well, I'll see you at the next staff
                         party.

                                          SAUNDRA
                         Bye....

          Bruce walks into a crowd of people wishing a happy
          birthday to a co worker. Bruce shakes her hand then
          moves around the corner.

          Saundra watches him go and just stares. Then she turns
          and goes back to work herself.
