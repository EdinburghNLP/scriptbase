Set in the 1950s, Inventing the Abbotts is a dramatic look at the life of two boys from the wrong side of the tracks and their interaction with the three daughters of local aristocrat Lloyd Abbott.
The boys, Jacey and Doug Holt have only three things in common: their family, table tennis and chasing the beautiful Abbott sisters.
