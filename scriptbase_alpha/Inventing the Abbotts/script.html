</b>

<b>       FADE IN:
</b>

<b>1EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET (HALEY, ILLINOIS) - DAY                 1
</b><b>       (LATE SPRING, 1957)
</b>
       OPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED
       ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large
       striped "big-top" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long
       steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn,
       practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall
       center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up
       sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and
       ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the
       tent assumes its full and finished form.


<b>NEW ANGLE - TENT
</b>
       -- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The
       residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the
       commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching
       trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand
       promenade.


<b>2EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY                                   2
</b>
       JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their
       way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and
       seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is
       rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular
       culture chameleon who takes on the colors and
       affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment
       (which presently happens to be Elvis Presley).

       Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent
       on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent
       indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the
       many parties they throw every year).

<b>                                 DOUG
</b>                   Didn't get invited, huh?

<b>                                 JACEY
</b>                   Go to hell.

<b>                                DOUG
</b>                   Who cares? I'm not going and I
                   got invited.

<b>                                 JACEY
</b>                   Who invited you?

</b>
<b>                               DOUG
</b>                 Pam, I guess. I don't know.
                 Didn't open the envelope. I mean,
                 come on, every time an Abbott girl
                 gets her period they have some
                 party.

<b>                                 JACEY
</b>                 Oh, shut up.

<b>                               DOUG
</b>                 Kotex parties, Kotex party hats,
                 pin the Kotex on the...

<b>                                 JACEY
</b>                 Shut up!

       Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm --
       Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely
       interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as
       LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway
       and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed-
       and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he
       exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent
       pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by
       Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper
       humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns
       and walks down the block.

<b>4INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)                      4
</b>
       ELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker.
       Eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very
       popular. She is the middle of the three Abbott
       daughters. Eleanor closes her locker, turns and
       discovers Jacey standing behind her. He follows her down
       the busy hall.

<b>                               JACEY
</b>                 I tried to call you last night but
                 the line was busy.

<b>                                 ELEANOR
</b>                 No it wasn't.

</b>                 I did.

<b>                               JACEY
</b>                 I just wanted to talk to you last
                 night.

<b>                               ELEANOR
</b>                 We can talk tonight at the party.

<b>                               JACEY
</b>                 I wasn't invited.

<b>                                  ELEANOR
</b>                 Yes, you were.

<b>                                  JACEY
</b>                 No, I wasn't.

<b>                               ELEANOR
</b>                 Well, now you are. But if you're
                 mad at me you don't have to come.

       She gives him a sultry smile, turns and glides into a
       classroom as the BELL RINGS. The corridor is quickly
       vacated by all but Jacey -- he savors the aftertaste of
       Eleanor's smile.


<b>5      EXT. HOLT HOME - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)                          5
</b>
       ESTABLISHING ANGLE of the modest two-story clapboard
       house in a working class neighborhood. A home-made ping-
       pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage
       that it forced the eviction of the family car, a 1950
       Plymouth coupe, which is parked nearby on the driveway.
       The garage doors are open and the garage light is on.

       We hear (V.O.) DOUG SINGING bits and pieces of
       "Heartbreak Hotel" in his best Elvis fashion.
<b>
</b>      INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                  3A/4.

<b>6   INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)             6
</b>
    Doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a
    coat and tie) still singing "Heartbreak Hotel" while he
    carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide-nib pen
    and a bottle of India ink. Jacey's reflection appears in
    the mirror behind Doug -- he's wearing a coat and tie too.
    Jacey does a pained take on Doug's handiwork:

<b>                            JACEY
</b>              Oh, Christ!

<b>7   INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOURMINUTES LATER)         7
</b>
    HELEN HOLT is seated at the dining table. She was
    grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when
    Jacey and Doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the
    matter at hand. She is an attractive but unostentatious
    woman without interest in appearing to be anything other
    than what she is: a forty-one-year-old widow raising two
    teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (She teaches
    second grade at Haley Elementary School.)

<b>                            JACEY
</b>              He has to wash it off, Mother.
              You cannot let him go to the party
              unless he washes it off.

<b>                            DOUG
</b>              It'll look worse if I wash it.
              It's India ink, it'll turn gray,
              it'll look like dirt.

<b>                            JACEY
</b>              He looks like such a clown and he
              doesn't even know it! He doesn't
              get how things work in this town.
              I thought you weren't even going
              to the party?

<b>                            DOUG
</b>              Changed my mind.

<b>                            HELEN
</b>              Doug, you do understand that you
              may be the only person at this
              party with artificial sideburns?

<b>                            DOUG
</b>              Yeah.

       The curb is lined with parked cars. We hear a dance band
       playing "QUE SERA" and the sounds of the party as Doug
       lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns
       and smoking a cigarette. He flicks the cigarette into
       the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks
       up the long driveway towards the glowing "big-top" tent.
       Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbott's Cadillac,
       caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by.

       Doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering -- a
       tuxedoed ten-piece band plays on the bandstand.

       Despite his mother's advice, a nauseated grimace falls
       over Jacey's face when he sees that his younger brother
       has arrived. He is dancing with Eleanor.

       They dance past a group of young men on the sidelines
       (Jacey's senior classmates), they are all edgy with envy,
       waiting like predators for their chance to dance with
       Eleanor.

       STEVE (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and
       cuts in on Jacey and dances away with Eleanor. Jacey
       handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being
       separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as
       he observes Eleanor flirting with her new dance partner.

     The band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his
     wife, JOAN ABBOTT, step up onto the bandstand. Joan has
     the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her
     smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). She has a
     tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and
     sleep a bit too little.

               Alice, to Mister Peter
               Vanlaningham.

     He gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER
     VANLANINGHAM. Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the
     prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three
     sisters. Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh
     family. He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the
     applause and AD-LIBBED toasts.

     The band strikes up "I Got the World on a String" and
     Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to
     Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto
     the dance floor.

      Doug steps out of the boathouse onto the   sagging dock and
      sees a fast speedboat cutting across the   lake towing a
      male water skier. (Another young man is    driving the boat
      with two young women in bathing suits as   passengers.)

     him a thumb's up gesture and Steve circles the boat
     around for the approach.

     Steve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open.

     slippery surface and his skis go out from under him. He
     takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow-rope, and goes
     tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water.

               She and my mother spend hours
               looking at wallpaper pattern

     Jacey (behind the wheel) and Doug drive into town in the

</b>               If Mom starts having problems with
               the car stalling just change the
               fuel filter. It gets clogged up

     The Plymouth is parked on a dirt lane separating two

     on a bottle of beer. Doug urinates between two rows of

     Doug retrieves his beer from the roof of the car. A
     semi-trailer drives past with "Midwest Steel Desk, Inc.

<b>                             JACEY

</b>               He owns the company 'cause he

<b>38     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY (SPRING, 1958)              38
</b>
     Doug steals lustful looks at Eleanor from behind his
     book. She is seated across the table from him. The
     library is filled with students poring over their
     assignments. Eleanor is seemingly oblivious to Doug's
     probing eyes.

     Doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table.
     He ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his
     ruse is revealed as he stares up Eleanor's skirt at the
     soft triangle that her white panties cover between her
     parted legs. Eleanor's hand lowers a piece of notebook
     paper beneath the table, on it she has written: "Hi
     Doug!"

     Doug starts with panic, rears back, cracks his head on
     the bottom of the table, and then, as his head rebounds
     from the blow, he accidentally impales himself in his
     chin with the sharp pencil. Doug scrambles up from under
     the table with the pencil dangling from his chin,
     knocking over his chair in the process. The tranquility
     of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted
     reactions of the students. Eleanor is momentarily
     concerned about his welfare, but she cannot help but
     laugh, too.

     Alice's BABY starts CRYING O.S. and Pamela grimaces.

     An episode of "Death Valley Days" with commercials for 29
     Mule Team Borax AIRS on the deluxe console TV. Doug sits
     on the sofa smoking a cigarette. Pamela sits at the

</b>               Both.

     Doug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette,
     then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela. She holds
     perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers
     and kisses her. Then he concludes the kiss to check her
     reaction; she timidly smiles. He kisses her again with
     greater fervor. Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and
     massages her breast. Pamela struggles to suppress her
     surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval.
     Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand
     under her bra. Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the
     sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion.

<b>                              PAMELA

     Doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a
     framed photograph of Eleanor amongst an assortment of
     family photos on the long table behind the sofa. It is
     Eleanor that he is thinking of -- in his mind's eye it is
     Eleanor's breast that he is fondling. Pamela pulls her
     lips from his:

         He kisses her with such ardor that she   interprets his
         answer to be yes, when in reality Doug   is only trying to
         silence her. He pulls his hand out of    her blouse and
         slips it under her skirt. Pam lurches    back into the
         sofa:

</b>                   Stop it... stop it!

         She shoves him away and jumps off the sofa. Doug looks
         at her with breathless confusion. She turns away from
         him and tries to button her blouse, but she can't see the
         buttons for her tears. She begins to sob and runs out of
         the room.

     hesitates as if he might say something to her, but loses
     his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway. Pam's
     disappointment is plain to see.

     Doug doesn't notice Eleanor and a few of her girl friends

     The marquee reads: TONY CURTIS -- JANET LEIGH -- "THE
<b>     PERFECT FURLOUGH" -- CINEMASCOPE -- AIR-CONDITIONED.
</b>
     It's Friday night -- a long queue has formed at the box
     office window, mostly teenagers, but some adults, too.
     Jacey cruises past the theater in the Plymouth, looking
     for... Eleanor. She chats with a group of friends
     standing in line. She sees Jacey, skips over, and gets
     into the car.

     Lloyd Abbott opens a bottle of Coke that he just
     purchased from the vending machine. His (1958) Cadillac
     is being fueled at the gas pumps. As he returns to his
     car he sees Eleanor and Jacey drive by the station in the
     Plymouth.

     Jacey and Eleanor are copulating on a blanket beneath a
     canopy of tall trees near the river. Jacey is on top,
     Eleanor has her legs clenched around his hips.

<b>                             ELEANOR
</b>               Come on, come on, come on...

     Her encouragement inspires their mutual orgasms.


<b>58     EXT. RIVER POINT PARK - ROAD - LATER THAT NIGHT               58
</b>
     Jacey and Eleanor approach the parked Plymouth. Jacey
     has the blanket rolled up under his arm. Suddenly they
     are captured by a pair of headlights. Lloyd Abbott
     climbs out of his parked (1958) Cadillac.

<b>                                ELEANOR
</b>               Hi, Daddy.

<b>                             LLOYD

<b>                                ELEANOR
</b>               Fucking Jacey.

     Lloyd absorbs this information without surrendering his
     composure -- but Jacey cannot conceal his shock.

</b>               Get in the car.

               'Night.

     Jacey doesn't respond to the kiss Eleanor gives him, but
     when she places her hand on his crotch, he yanks her hand
     off. Eleanor walks over and gets into the car. Lloyd
     gazes at Jacey for a beat, then gets in the car and
     drives away.

      doing most of the talking -- but Joan seems to require a

     Joan has the driver's door to her station wagon open now.
     Helen is on the sidewalk. Her demeanor is measured,
     purposefully matter-of-fact.

<b>                             HELEN
</b>               I don't think that's necessary.

               No, I'm sorry, Joan, I will not do
               that. If you have something to
               say to my son, then you'll have to
               say it to him yourself.

<b>                             JOAN

</b>               And why on earth should I believe
               anything you say, Joan?

     Joan is unable to find a quick retort, she gets into her
     station wagon and drives away.

     Helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter, she picks
     it up and cleans it off with her apron. As she turns to
     go back to the house, she finds Doug standing on the
     porch steps. Without warning, she expertly pitches the
     baseball across the yard to Doug -- it makes his hand
     sting when he catches it. Helen walks up to the porch.

<b>                             HELEN
</b>               I'm going to ask you one question,

               know, it sounds ridiculous...
               corrupted Eleanor Abbott? Led her
               astray?

     Doug's mind works in several directions at once as he
     tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her.

     Doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside.
     Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that
     Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a
     bone-weary sadness falls over her. Her "tranquility" is
     not borne of happiness, it is only a means of coping with
     the sadness that is at the core of her being.

<b>69     INT. ABBOTT HOME - TENT - NIGHT                              69
</b>
     The party is well underway, it's a younger crowd tonight.
     The band plays "Fly Me To The Moon." Doug stands apart
     from the others. He's ill-at-ease. His conversation
     with Jacey resonates within him. As he looks over the
     gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see
     things the way Jacey does: Lloyd holding court with a
     group of men in tuxedos... Joan Abbott propelling a
     reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alice's age
     (Alice and Peter have separated)... and, finally, Pamela
     dancing with a handsome young man (TED). She is the
     belle of the ball, radiant and suddenly mature in her
     beautiful gown. She smiles as she sees Doug, excuses
     herself, and comes over to him.

<b>                             PAMELA
</b>               How long have you been here?

<b>                               DOUG
</b>               A while.

<b>                               PAMELA
</b>               Are you okay?

<b>                               DOUG
</b>               I'm fine.    Having fun?

<b>                               PAMELA
</b>               Yes, I am.    Come on, dance with
               me.

     She pulls him towards the dance floor.

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               You didn't tell me I had to dance.

<b>                             PAMELA
</b>               Just one dance and we'll be even.
               I won't have to be mad at you
               anymore and you won't have to be
               so sorry.

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               What am I supposed to be so sorry
               about?

<b>                             PAMELA
</b>               Oh, you're not sorry?

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               All right, yeah, I'm sorry.

               Oh, shit, come on, Pam. Dammit.
               For crying out loud. Forget it.

<b>                             PAMELA
</b>               I accept your apology.   Let's
               dance.

     Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He
     feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and
     they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles:

<b>                             PAMELA
</b>               Hi.

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               Hi.

     Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were
     children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for
     her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble
     of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as
     Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval
     is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor
     to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott.
     Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses
     the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the
     cause.

<b>                             PAMELA
</b>               Is Jacey home for the summer or is
               he just here for a visit?

     The mention of his brother's name at this exact moment
     sends a chill down Doug's spine.

                      (slight beat)
               It's cheaper if he stays here for
               the summer. He can save more
               money for school, 'cause he
               doesn't have to pay rent. Money's
               tight, you know, we're sort of
               poor.

<b>                             PAMELA
</b>               You're not poor, are you?

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               Hell -- you kidding? Even with
               Jacey working summers, my mom had
               to borrow against the house so he
               could go to Penn. I don't know
               where the money'll come from for
               me to go to college.

     Doug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his
     dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells.

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               I hear Alice and Peter are getting
               a divorce.

               them.

               saying something different -- she
               got knocked up, she ran away, your
               old man kicked her out. So, which
               is it?

     Ted steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder.

<b>                              DOUG
</b>               Fuck off.

     Ted is taken aback.   Pamela's eyes fill with tears.

<b>                             PAMELA
</b>               Why do you hate me so much?

<b>                             TED
</b>               Excuse me, asshole, but...

     Doug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him
     reeling into the other dancers. Everyone pulls away from
     Doug and Pam. Doug massages his fist and looks
     helplessly at Pamela:

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               I don't hate you.


<b>70     INT. HOLT HOME - DOUG'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT            70
</b>
     The hall light is on but the bedroom is dark. Doug lies
     on his bed (still dressed). Jacey appears in the
     doorway.

<b>                              JACEY

     Doug and Jacey play another hard fought game of ping-pong
     in the garage. In the midst of a volley Doug says:

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               I'm gonna go to Penn like you.

     Jacey snorts with incredulous laughter.

</b>                 You're nuts. You'll never get
                 accepted to Penn. Besides, Mom
                 couldn't afford it anyway.

<b>                               DOUG

                 -- so, I say you got your head up
                 your ass.

       Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game
       with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter.
       Jacey smiles, puts his paddle down, and walks out of the
       garage. Doug quickly picks up a ping-pong ball and hits
       it into the back of Jacey's head. Jacey turns and shoots
       a perturbed look at Doug -- Doug smiles:

       It's snowing -- Doug paces to keep warm. He momentarily
       forgets the cold as he sees Pam and three of her girl
       friends come out of the drugstore across the street. The
       girls are in high spirits as they get into Pam's car.

       Two well-dressed townswomen (MURIEL and DORIS) encounter
       Helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out
       onto the sidewalk.

       seemingly unruffled by their distant responses. She
       observes Doug as he watches Pam and her friends drive
       off.

</b><b>(SUMMER, 1959)

       The commencement exercises are being held in the
       sweltering gym to accommodate the large crowd of proud
       parents and family members. Doug, hot and uncomfortable
       in his cap and gown, is seated among his fellow graduates
       behind the podium. The PRINCIPAL (at the podium)
       announces the names of the graduates as he calls them
       forward to receive their diplomas.

</b>               Pamela Louise Abbott...

     Pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma.

     Lloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter. Joan
     stands to take a snapshot. Alice is occupied with her
     restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan.

     Doug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes.

     Helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her.
     The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her
     and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym.

     Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom.
     He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes
     settle on... Alice Abbott.

     Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old
     daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to
     Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle.

     Jacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she
     passes by with Susan in her arms.


<b>77     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY                77
</b>
     Commencement is over -- the parking lot is a sea of cars
     slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating
     graduates, beaming parents, and rambunctious siblings.

     As Helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly
     ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers. She
     has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on.

     Helen finds herself face-to-face with Lloyd Abbott as
     they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between
     two parked vehicles. They are both caught off-guard --
     there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each
     other.

<b>                             LLOYD
</b>               Congratulations, Helen.

     They pass each other and head their separate ways.   Their
     chance meeting has not gone unobserved:

     Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of
     Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair
     her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips
     behind the wheel.

     And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door
     so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in
     the back seat). Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around
     the car and gets in behind the wheel.

     Lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jacey's glare)
     and pulls out of his parking spot.

     A waitress walks across the busy diner to Helen, Jacey,

     their desserts -- Jacey is content to brood over his
     cup of coffee. The waitress puts their bill on the
     table and steps away.

     picks up the bill.

     The Holt family drives home from the restaurant -- Jacey
     driving, Helen in front, and Doug in the back seat.

<b>                             HELEN
</b>               What a wonderful night. What a
               wonderful day. My two Ivy League
               boys.

     This is torture for Jacey. Doug looks out the window at
     the striped tent in the Abbott's front yard as they pass
     by. A party for the "Class of 1959" is underway (as a
     banner on the tent proclaims). The street is lined with
     parked cars and busy with late-coming guests.

     Doug checks the rearview mirror for Jacey's reaction, but
     his brother keeps his eyes on the road.

<b>                             HELEN
</b>               I never understood that tent. I
               wonder if they own it? I'm

               up all year long.

               Lloyd's mother was a tough old
               bird. She sold eggs. They had a
               place way out on Ditch Road near
               County Line. That was ages ago.
               Poor Lloyd had to walk all that
               way in to school and then back
               everyday. Charlie used to call
               Lloyd 'Egg-head' and he didn't

     Jacey and Doug sit on the porch steps eating bowls of ice

     empty bowl inside the house.

     Doug digests Jacey's insult, then scoops a ball of ice
     cream out of his bowl with his spoon and flings the gooey
     ice cream into the side of Jacey's face. Doug rises and
     goes to the front door.

     As Doug opens the screen door Jacey dives into him --
     they fall into the porch swing with such force that its
     chains rip out of the porch ceiling and Doug, Jacey, and
     the swing go overboard off the end of the porch into the

     Doug releases the load on the jack and strains to extract
     it from the molten pavement.

</b>               Pam, would you mind running Doug
               home? I'd like to get to the bank
               before they close.

     Jacey sits at the counter at the rear of the busy diner
     sipping an iced tea. He sees Alice Abbott enter -- she
     pulls a dollar bill out of her purse as she approaches
     the cash register near the front door. She calls out
     to a waitress who is fetching an order from the grill.

<b>                             ALICE
</b>               Excuse me -- could I get change
               for a dollar?

     The waitress is too distracted to take notice of Alice
     and Alice herself doesn't notice Jacey as he steps up
     behind her.

<b>                             JACEY

     Jacey opens his palm and reveals the correct change.
     Alice nervously exchanges the dollar bill for the
     coins.

     Jacey watches through the window as Alice returns to
     the Town &amp; Country station wagon and puts a few coins
     into the meter. Joan waits impatiently beside the car
     with Susan in hand. As the Abbott women walk down the
     sidewalk (away from the diner), Alice glances back and
     sees Jacey smiling at her from the diner window.

     Jacey holds open the driver's door as Alice climbs in
     behind the wheel (of her mother's Town &amp; Country station

     She points to a front tooth.      He leans over to look at
     it.

     Alice drives away.   Jacey smiles -- he's won.

     The Plymouth cruises back toward town. Jacey drinks a
     bottle of beer and happily contemplates the possibilities
     of a relationship with Alice. He approaches a billboard
     that reads: "MIDWEST STEEL DESK, INC. -- Welcomes You to
     Haley, Illinois."

     Jacey drains the last of the beer and hurls the empty
     bottle at the billboard as he drives past it.

     Pamela takes his hand, gently unfolds it, and with her
     index finger she writes on his palm, "I love you."
     Telling him took all the nerve she could muster, she
     hasn't the stamina for a disappointing response -- she
     places her fingers on his lips to silence him. Doug
     leans over and kisses her, sweetly and tenderly, and for
     a long time. They will always remember this kiss.

      It is almost two o'clock in the morning. Helen has dozed
      off in her chair with a book on her lap. She is startled
      awake by a loud BANGING at the front door. Helen hurries
      to the door and opens it. Pamela is on the porch. She
      is out of breath and very distraught. Her CAR is parked

         Pam's convertible barely comes to a halt at the curb

         Doug is occupied with the lawn mower; he doesn't notice
         Pam and Jacey at first. (Jacey and Pam have to speak

         the driveway and then up the street.

         Doug SHUTS OFF the LAWN MOWER and walks over to Pam.

</b>              Jacey was almost two and I was
              eight months pregnant with you
              and... well, some mornings I'd be
              crying before I even woke up.
              Then you were born. And Jacey
              just got lost in there. I didn't
              have anything for him. Mother
              took him over. He'd cry or call
              for me, and then I'd hear Mother
              answer him, and I'd go back to
              sleep.
                     (sighs bitterly)
              I should've taken us away from
              here, gone somewhere else.

<b>                            DOUG
</b>              Why?

<b>                            HELEN
</b>              After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott
              started dropping by on his way
              home from work. He felt so bad
              about that bet Charlie made with
              him at the lake. That foolish,
              idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd -- I felt
              sorry for him. He'd have a cup of
              coffee with Mother and me. If a
              doorknob had come off he'd fix it.
              He'd carry the garbage cans to the
              curb. Someone dies, people try to
              be helpful. But he was by here so
              often that people started to talk.
              It was fairly obvious that he
              wanted something more from me than
              just a cup of coffee. I suggested
              that he didn't need to stop by
              here so often, but... then one
              afternoon I was at Woolworth's,
              having lunch at the counter. All
              of sudden Joan Abbott was standing
              there -- screaming and yelling at
              me to stop sleeping with her
              husband, with Lloyd. I was
              speechless. She was gone before I
              could find my tongue.

                was always having affairs. He's
                that type of man.

</b>                Because she's Joan Abbott. If you
                cross Joan you don't get invited
                to her parties -- and the Abbotts
                have the best parties in town.

       A vintage, third-floor, railroad flat -- sparsely
       furnished and neat as a pin. Jacey is hosting a party.
       A TONY BENNETT record ("When Somebody Breaks Your Heart")
       plays on the hi-fi. The apartment is elbow-to-elbow with
       Penn men and attractive coeds from Radcliffe, Mt.
       Hollyoke, and Byrn Mawr. Doug sits in the middle of the
       sofa wedged between two coeds having separate, but
       equally animated conversations with two of Jacey's
       classmates (who are perched on the arms of the sofa).
       Doug wears a jacket and tie but his knack at looking out
       of place is intact.

       Jacey is apart from the others wooing a gorgeous CO-ED in
       a tight cashmere sweater.

      Pam keels over and vomits.

      Pam sits on the bed as Doug pulls her stained turtleneck
      sweater off over her head (she's wearing a bra).

                       (as she collapses on
                        the bed))
                No, you can't stand up. All
                right.

      He undoes the waist of her pants and tugs on her pant
      legs, but her panties start to slide off along with her
      pants.

<b>                              DOUG

                       (she's out)
                I'll hold on to your underpants.

      He holds her panties in place while he struggles to get
      her pants over her hips.

      Doug   stirs from his sleeping spot on the floor (he slept
      with   his clothes on). He notices that Pam's clothes have
      been   removed from the radiator. He sits up and finds
      that   the bed is empty. She's gone.

      Doug lounges on his bed reading a textbook. It is
      raining outside. He is startled by a TAPPING on the
      windowpane. Pamela is outside on the fire escape. He
      ignores her.

      He gets out of bed, unlatches the window, then returns to
      the bed and his book. Pamela opens the window (with
      difficulty) and climbs in. She drapes her wet coat over
      the radiator and sits in the desk chair.

                I was dying, so, I just... I was
                going to call you.

      Doug doesn't respond -- he turns the page of his book.

                And stupid. It happens, you know?

      Doug snaps his book shut.

      Pam is stung by his flippancy, she begins to cry.

      her center stage near the footlights.

<b>                              DOUG
</b>                Just stand right there.

      He takes the work light with him as he walks off stage.
      Then with a METALLIC CLANK everything goes dark.

                Stay put.

      There's the RUMBLE and SQUEAK of a piece of SCENERY being
      rolled onto stage -- then the SWOOSH of a backdrop being
      lowered from the fly loft.

      We hear Doug RUNNING somewhere backstage then a beautiful
      sunset slowly illuminates the stage -- creating the
      perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that
      Doug has put into place: It is the roof of a weathered
      farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney.
      Doug steps on stage, he's a bit winded from his quick-
      change routine.

                competition among all the theater
                design students to do the sets.

       Jacey sits in his favorite armchair reading the Sunday

       scrutinizes his brooding younger brother.

       goes into the kitchen to tend to it. There is a soft
       KNOCK on the front door. Doug goes to answer it. He
       opens the door and finds Pamela standing there with her
       coat in her hand. He is pleasantly surprised; Pam is
       distant, slightly off-balance.

       Pamela drops her coat on the floor. She pulls her
       sweater off over her head. Doug's anguish is as great
       as Pamela's humiliation. He cannot bear any more if
       this -- he walks out the door.

      lands brutally on the side of Jacey's face -- the impact
      knocks him down onto the steps. Jacey's eyebrow has
      split open, he is blinded by blood.

      Doug wants to avoid the topic of Jacey.    He opens the

</b>                Good heavens, I know you drink
                beer.

      Doug takes out two bottles of beer and opens them.

      Doug dissolves into tears. He lowers his head and
      shields his eyes with his hand. Helen leans over and
      strokes his hair. After a few moments, he rises and
      wipes away his tears with a dish towel.

      Doug drives home from the bus depot in the old Plymouth.
      He slows as he sees... the party tent in the Abbotts'
      front yard (with its canvas sides rolled up).

      Susan's third birthday party is underway, dozens of well-
      dressed children and their parents are in attendance.
      Alice (who is very pregnant) and Peter Vanlaningham and
      Lloyd and Joan Abbott watch Susan riding her new pony, a
      gift from her grandparents. A new generation of Abbott
      parties has begun.

      A "For Sale" sign has been placed on the front yard.
      Doug pulls up the driveway in the Plymouth. He turns OFF
      the ENGINE but doesn't get out of the car. Then he
      STARTS the CAR again and backs out of the driveway.

      Despite it being a birthday party for a three-year-old,
      this is very much a grown-up affair. The band is
      playing, the adults are dancing, Joan Abbott is flitting
      from guest-to-guest, Alice is dutifully silent while
      Peter dominates the talk at their table, Lloyd is with
      his cronies. Doug enters the tent -- one-by-one the
      guests take notice of him as he works his way across the
      tent -- and all are very aware of his uninvited presence
      by the time he reaches Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd scrutinizes
      Doug, then:

                someone like her. That just goes
                to show you how stupid this town
                is -- that they'd believe she
                slept with me. That'd make
                Charlie laugh. Your old man was
                my best friend. He used to call
                me 'Egg-head' -- hell, everybody
                did. And back then everybody knew
                that Egg-head Abbott didn't stand
                a snowball's chance in hell with
                Helen Riley. Of course, that was
                all before I became Lloyd Abbott
                -- Mr. Abbott. That was back when
                I still had chicken shit on my
                shoes and twelve cents in my
                pocket. Charlie Holt was the only
                one good enough for Helen. I used
                to spy on 'em -- yup, I did.
                       (fixes a drink)
                Used to watch them sit on the

      He hurls his GLASS at her and it SHATTERS on the door
      jamb. Joan recoils in dumb-founded shock and backs out
      of the doorway. Lloyd fumes over and slams the door shut
      in her face. He leans against the door and catches his
      breath.

                I could always tell by the way he
                looked at me -- even when he was a
                little boy -- like I owed him
                something. But, goddammit, he's
                wrong. That bet was your father's
                idea and I never meant your mother

      address on the scrap of paper in his hand.


<b>175   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING DOORWAY - ELEANOR'S APARTMENT - 175
</b><b>      NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)
</b>
      Doug knocks on the door. Eleanor opens it, she's dressed
      for work in her stewardess uniform. She's obviously
      surprised to find Doug on her doorstep, but she greets
      him with a warm smile.

<b>                                DOUG
</b>                Where is she?


<b>176     EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE DISPLAY WINDOW (CHICAGO) -               176
</b><b>      SIDEWALK - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
</b>
      Pamela dresses a mannequin in the display window. As she
      moves behind the mannequin to fasten a garment she sees
      Doug standing on the other side of the glass watching her
      from the sidewalk. Doug writes a message on the plate
      glass window with his index finger (printing the letters
      in reverse so that the message is legible from Pam's
      POV); his message reads: "I love you."

<b>177   EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE ENTRANCE - SIDEWALK - NIGHT             177
</b><b>      (MOMENTS LATER)
</b>
      Pamela comes out of the store via the revolving door and
      finds Doug waiting for her on the sidewalk.

<b>                              PAMELA
</b>                How can you...?

<b>                              DOUG
</b>                How can I what?

<b>                              PAMELA
</b>                Ever... forgive me?

<b>                              DOUG
</b>                You always loved me no matter what
                I did, right?

<b>                                 PAMELA
</b>                Yeah.

<b>                              DOUG
</b>                Maybe that's how I love you -- no
                matter what. That's the best kind
                of love, you know?

<b>                              PAMELA
</b>                But... oh, Jesus... how do we
                start all over again?

      Pam's eyes fill with tears. Doug steps over to her and
      embraces her tenderly, holding her close.

<b>                               DOUG
</b>                There.   We're doing it.

<b>                              PAMELA
</b>                       (through her tears)
                Doing what?

<b>                                 DOUG
</b>                Starting over.     So, what are you
                doing tonight?     You want to go
                out?

<b>                                 PAMELA
</b>                You're crazy.

<b>                              DOUG
</b>                Some people never change.

      He wipes her tears from her cheeks with his fingers, then
      gives a short, but sweet, kiss. Then he smiles:
