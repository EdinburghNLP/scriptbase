     INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY

     We start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a
     splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
     garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
     hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
     topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing
     on marble floors.

                                             CUT TO:

     A Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,
     dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is
     TREASURER SANCHEZ.

     A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We
     can now here a subdued conversation.

     TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:

     The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.
     A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN
     ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.

     He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large
     table.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and
     three dignitaries of Church and State.

     All sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document
     and starts to read aloud.

     On screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500

                         SANCHEZ
               Your Majesty would wish to know the
               true facts concerning the island of
               Hispanola, our first settlement in
               the New World, and the activities
               there of your servant, Christopher
               Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,
               Governor of that Island.  You will
               remember with what hopes and
               promises he beguiled us -- the truth
               is that he now presides over a state
               of chaos, degradation and madness
               beyond imagining.

     SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.

                         SANCHEZ
               From the beginning, Columbus proved
               himself incapable of managing the
               affairs of the island.  He appointed
               his brothers to important positions,
               at once injuring the pride and
               dignity of the nobles who had gone
               with him.  He promised to build a
               city, the City of Isabel, named
               after Your Majesty.  What he
               actually built was nothing but a
               collection of huts, and that in the
               wrong place, for all of it was
               easily swept away by rain and mud.
               Is that not so, Brother Buyl?

     The PRIEST nods.

                         BROTHER BUYL
               Yes, Your Honor.

                         SANCHEZ
               He promised gold.  Not finding the
               easy quantities he promised,
               Columbus commanded each Indian to
               pay an annual tribute.  Most being
               unable to, they were barbarously
               punished, against the express wish
               of Your Christian Majesties...

     ISABEL lowers her eyes.

                         SANCHEZ
               Since provocation and injustice
               never ceases, many of the Indians
               have fled to the forests, or have
               begun to slay the Christians.

     ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.

                         ISABEL
               Could it be so?

                         BROTHER BUYL
               Yes, Your Majesty.

                         SANCHEZ
               But there is worse.  From the
               beginning, he forced the nobles to
               undergo physical labor, treating
               them equally with the Indians, all
               of them reduced to slavery.  When
               the nobleman Adrian de Moxica
               protested against such treatment...
                    (he pauses)
               ... he was executed.
                    (pause)
               Is that not true also, Brother
               Buyl?

                         BROTHER BUYL
               Yes, Your Honor.  It is all true.
               All of it.  I saw it with my own
               eyes.

                         SANCHEZ
               He has lost control.  His great
               arrogance has led him into
               depravity.  He encourages our
               soldiers to marry the native women.
               He promised a paradise, but he has
               made a hell full of all its horrors.

     Silence.

                         ISABEL
               Is that the man I knew, Treasurer
               Sanchez?

                         SANCHEZ
               Yes, Your Majesty.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT.  HUT - ISLAND - DAY

     CLOSE ON the FACE:  COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed,
     sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.  Insects
     crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away.
     There is a dripping sound of water.

                         FERNANDO (V.O.)
               Of all the words my Father wrote and
               there were many, I remember these
               the most.  "Nothing that results
               from human progress is achieved with
               unanimous consent..."

     Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a
     table.  COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.  Some
     of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.  A
     lizard scuttles into the shadows.

                         FERNANDO (V.O.)
               "And those who are enlightened
               before the others are condemned to
               purse that light in spite of
               others..."

     COLUMBUS stares down at the documents, moving them away
     from the rain drips.  He stares out by the window, and we
     see:

     A devastated landscape.  Flooded roads, half-destroyed
     huts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.

                         FERNANDO (V.O.)
               There was a time when the New World
               didn't exist...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

     A vast stretch of ocean.  It fills the screen.  Unbroken,
     infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away,
     meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl
     and misty light.

                         FERNANDO (V.O.)
               ... The sun set in the west on an
               ocean where no man had dared to
               venture.  And beyond that,
               infinity...

     Pulling back, we discover:

     A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle
     thirties, are riding a mule.  The MAN'S weather-beaten
     face frames unusually bright eyes.

     On the screen these words:  ANDALUSIA, 1491

     COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at
     the top of the hill.  COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO
     looks up at him in adoration.

                         FERNANDO (V.O.)
               Once I asked my Father where he
               wanted to go.  And he replied:  "I
               want to travel all over the seas.  I
               want to get behind the weather..."

     FERNANDO laughs.  He then starts to hum along with his
     FATHER.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY

     A rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone
     walls and thousands of sheep.

     FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing
     the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him.  High-
     spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.

     COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching
     his SON'S antics with amusement.  In the distance, the
     solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.

     COLUMBUS calls out to his son:

                         COLUMBUS
               Fernando!

     FERNANDO runs over.  COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.

     As they move along the track we now see, perched on a
     distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La
     Rabida, their destination.


     EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

     As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,
     FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under
     the ROMAN arches.

                         FERNANDO
               Diego!

     He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an
     adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,
     delicate face.  DIEGO'S response is constrained.

                         COLUMBUS
               Diego!  Aren't you going to kiss
               your brother?

     DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is
     immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,
     hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.

     The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-
     haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.
     MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his
     arms to greet COLUMBUS.  He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns
     to DIEGO.

                         MARCHENA
               Diego, take Fernando to the dining
               hall.  He must be hungry.

                         DIEGO
               Yes, Father.

     Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof.  COLUMBUS and
     MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.

                         MARCHENA
               Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure
               to teach -- but so serious...
               Brothers should be raised together,
               Colon.  Even brothers from different
               mothers...

                         COLUMBUS
               Father, I am doing what I think is
               the best for him.  And he has the
               teacher I would have chosen for
               myself.

     MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.

                         MARCHENA
               Just be careful you don't lose him.

     They have crossed the cloister.  MARCHENA pushes open a
     door.


     INT.  A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY

     Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the
     miracle of printing, a recent German discovery.  Several
     MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily
     "ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately
     painting around the letters in bright colors and gold
     leaf.

     Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings,
     projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor.  As
     MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is
     punctuated by light and shadow.

                         MARCHENA
                    (fumbles in a pocket
                    under his robe)
               I have something for you.

     Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.

                         MARCHENA
               You will be heard at the University
               of Salamanca...

     COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.  Almost frantically he
     tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.

                         COLUMBUS
               God... That's in a week!

                         MARCHENA
               That's what it says.

                         COLUMBUS
               How did you manage it?

                         MARCHENA
                    (smiling)
               With some difficulty.  I had to
               promise them you were not a total
               fool.

     MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden
     panel.


     INT.  STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY

     MARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the
     floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,
     instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an
     inquiring mind.

     With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a
     hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits
     behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA
     lights a candle and considers the mess.  Then
     methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him
     with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.

     When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his
     expression.  He turns over an hourglass.

                         MARCHENA
               Why do you wish to sail west?

                         COLUMBUS
               To open a new route to Asia.  At the
               moment there are only two ways of
               reaching it...

     He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the
     desk.

                         COLUMBUS
               By sea, sailing around the African
               Continent -- the journey takes a
               year...

     His finger traces the journey, from west to east.

                         COLUMBUS
               Or by land...

     We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger
     tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.

                         COLUMBUS (O.S.)
               ... But the Turks have closed this
               route to all Christians.  Trading
               with the Orient has become arduous,
               if not dangerous.
                    (he pauses)
               There is a third way...

     We notice that the outline of the European continent is
     familiar.  But we also notice that, in that great expanse
     of ocean, the whole American continent is missing.

                         COLUMBUS
               By sailing West across the Ocean
               Sea.

     CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.

                         MARCHENA
               How can you be so certain?  The
               Ocean is said to be infinite.

                         COLUMBUS
               Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are
               no more than 750 leagues west of the
               Canary Islands.

                         MARCHENA
               How can you be so certain?

                         COLUMBUS
               The calculations of Toscanelli Marin
               de Tyr, Esdras...

                         MARCHENA
                    (interrupting)
               Esdras is a Jew.

                         COLUMBUS
               So was Christ!

     MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.  He
     glances at the hourglass:

                         MARCHENA
               Two minutes... and already you're a
               dead man.  Don't let passion
               overwhelm you, Colon.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (mockingly)
               I'll try to remember that,
               Marchena...

                         MARCHENA
               Father Marchena!

                         COLUMBUS
                    (ignoring this)
               Passion is something one cannot
               control!

                         MARCHENA
                    (heatedly)
               You get so carried away when you are
               being contradicted!

                         COLUMBUS
               I've been contradicted all my
               life... Eternity!

                         MARCHENA
                    (amused)
               Only God knows the meaning of such
               words, my son.


     EXT.  COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING

     DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS
     appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to
     go.

                         COLUMBUS
               Diego.

     COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes
     meet.  He looks at his SON for a moment.

                         COLUMBUS
               Would you like to come and stay with
               us?

     Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an
     answer.

                         COLUMBUS
               I'll do whatever makes you happy.

                         DIEGO
               I am happy, Father.

     COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.

     He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his
     BROTHER as they ride off.


     EXT.  CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT

     COLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,
     through narrow streets.  There's a clamorous noise in the
     air.  Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with
     excitement, run up the street and brush past them.  Then
     more people.  FERNANDO sits up straight.  The noise grows,
     rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.

     Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside
     the cathedral.  Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS
     tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens
     in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the
     center of the square stand three pyres, already alit.
     HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.

                         FERNANDO
               Look, Father!

     Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the
     mule and into the crowd.   

                         COLUMBUS
               Fernando!

     But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.
     COLUMBUS tries to follow him.  Flames leap into the night
     sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with
     a lurid glow.  Prayers are being chanted somewhere.

     FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.

     A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a
     MAN bound to a post.  The heretic wears the "sambenito", a
     robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been
     crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,
     indicating that the man is Jewish.

     THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.  But he refuses to kiss
     the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.

     FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't
     realize what is happening.  He is too close to the
     platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.

                         COLUMBUS
               Fernando!

     He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him
     away from the scene.  But FERNANDO looks back.  The
     distance now allows him to see inside the flames.

     A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a
     silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the
     head falls on one shoulder.  Then the whole body collapses
     into the fire.


     INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT

     COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,
     stone-floored hallway of the modest house.  FERNANDO is
     mute, shocked by what he just witnessed.  COLUMBUS takes
     the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,
     BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.  She is a
     beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic
     personality.  COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.  FERNANDO
     glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say
     anything.


     INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is
     cooking.  He explains Fernando's subdued manner.

                         COLUMBUS
               Executions.  In the square.

     BEATRIX nods.  He goes to the stone butt and pours water
     on his hands.

                         COLUMBUS
               They've agreed to see me in a week.

     BEATRIX puts the candle on the table.  Her face lights up
     with a smile.  He walks to her, and kisses her.

                         COLUMBUS
               I could be gone for years.

                         BEATRIX
               I know.

                         COLUMBUS
               I haven't given you much of a life.

                         BEATRIX
                    (amused)
               Well... that's true.  I have a child
               by a man who won't marry me!  Who's
               always leaving...

                         COLUMBUS
               Are we going to argue?

                         BEATRIX
               I'd love to argue with you
               sometimes.  But you're never here!

     They laugh and kiss.

                         COLUMBUS
               Perhaps I was never meant to live
               with a woman...

                         BEATRIX
                    (still kissing him)
               I find that hard to believe.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is
     unusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little
     wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO
     looks up at him, surprised.  COLUMBUS smiles, then looks
     over at BEATRIX.

                         COLUMBUS
               Fernando, don't you think we are
               lucky to live with such a beautiful
               woman?

     He winks at FERNANDO.  BEATRIX smiles.


     INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The room is dark.  As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a
     candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX.  BEATRIX
     looks up at him intently.  A drop of wax falls on her
     skin.  She flinches, murmurs...

     They make love.


     EXT.  SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY

     A medieval "campus".  Students-novices are playing
     "pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.  They run
     with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing
     white legs.  Others are studying, reading, hurrying to
     their class.

     We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above
     the court.  Others are waiting with him.  A MONK comes
     from a door, and looks around the group.

                         MONK
                    (hesitant)
               Christopher Columbus?


     INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

     An El Greco painting.  A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on
     dark, sculpted seats.  Candles throw a gloomy light on
     their faces.  Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in
     bourgeois outfits.

     Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish
     fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of
     Aragon.  A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory
     claw at the top.  Languidly, he scratches his back -- his
     off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his
     peers.

                         AROJAZ
               You say Asia can be found by sailing
               west?

                         COLUMBUS
               Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage
               should not take more than six or
               seven weeks.

                         AROJAZ
               Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is
               precisely where our opinions
               differ...
                    (pause)
               Are you familiar with the work of
               Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?

                         COLUMBUS
               I am, Your Eminence

                         AROJAZ
               Then you cannot ignore that
               according to their calculations, the
               circumference of the Earth is
               approximately...
                    (he leans forward)
               22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes
               the ocean... uncrossable.

     He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.

                         AROJAZ
               But you may have found new evidence
               proving that these men of knowledge
               are totally mistaken!

     A ripple of mirthless laughter.

                         COLUMBUS
               Your Excellencies are aware of the
               statements of Marin de Tyr?

                         HERNANDO DE TALAVERA
               We are.

                         COLUMBUS
               Then you are also aware that his
               theories contradict Ptolemeus... De
               Tyr believes the Ocean to be only
               750 leagues...

     A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the
     Commission.  But Columbus is determined to press his
     theories.

                         COLUMBUS
               The Florentine Toscanelli and the
               French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both
               think that Marin de Tyr is accurate
               in his calculations.  And therefore,
               that the ocean can be crossed.

     Indignant and amused murmurs.  DIEGO DE DEZA raises his
     voice to quiet the assembly.

                         DIEGO DE DEZA
               Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de
               Tyr is right...
                    (the laughter
                    subsides)
               Are we here to examine this proposal
               or not?

     Silence.

                         DIEGO DE DEZA
                    (to Columbus)
               In your opinion, how long would the
               voyage be?

                         COLUMBUS
               Seven weeks.  Six, during the summer
               months.

     The murmur increases.

                         AROJAZ
               Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has
               been corrected many times over the
               centuries by the finest geographers.
               Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a
               year!

     A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as
     being a seaman, interrupts.

                         VICUNA
               How would the crew survive without
               being able to land for fresh water?
               Water is undrinkable after six
               weeks!  You'd never be able to turn
               back!

                         COLUMBUS
               We wouldn't have to turn back!  We
               would find land at this point!

                         AROJAZ
               Senor Colon, an experienced captain
               such as yourself will understand our
               concern with the crew.  I am not
               willing to have on my conscience the
               loss of men who would have relied
               upon our judgment.

                         COLUMBUS
               Excellency, you are right.

     Instantly, the protests stop.

                         COLUMBUS
               I am a seaman, not a scholar... But
               as a simple man craving for
               knowledge, I have read all the work
               of these renowned geographers and
               discovered that none of them could
               agree on the exact width of this
               ocean...

     He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as
     a lawyer before a grand jury.

                         COLUMBUS
               Therefore, as a modest man, I
               wonder:  who is right?

     The experts listen.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by
     the boldness.

                         COLUMBUS
               Who is right?  This question remains
               unanswered.

     He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look
     of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.

                         COLUMBUS
               Your Eminence, there is only one way
               to settle the matter.  And that is
               to make the journey.
                    (to the assembly,
                    with passion)
               I am ready to risk my life to prove
               it possible.

                         AROJAZ
               Your life, and that of others!

                         COLUMBUS
               If they agree to follow me, yes.

                         SANCHEZ (O.S.)
               Suppose you cross this ocean.
               Suppose you reach Asia.  What would
               Spain do there?

     Conscious of a friendlier voice, COLUMBUS sees the
     Treasurer SANCHEZ, an imposing man in his fifties.

                         COLUMBUS
               Trade, Your Excellency.  According
               to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China
               is one of the richest of the world.
               Even the meanest buildings are
               roofed with gold.

                         AROJAZ
                    (interrupting)
               Is that all that interests you?
               Gold?

                         COLUMBUS
               No.  The Portuguese have already
               discovered black-skinned people.  I,
               too, will find other populations --
               and bring them to the word of God.

     THE MONK smiles thinly.

                         AROJAZ
               Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the
               Bearer of the Cross!

                         MONK
                    (ironic)
               And Colon -- the one who populates!

     Another small rill of laughter.

                         AROJAZ
               If God intended our proximity to
               Asia, do you believe he would have
               waited for you to show it to the
               world?

                         COLUMBUS
               Did He not choose a carpenter's son
               to reveal Himself to the world?

     A hum of interest.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS
     intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.

                         AROJAZ
               So you consider yourself the chosen
               one?

     A pause.

                         AROJAZ
               Don't you realize your words could
               be considered heretical?

                         COLUMBUS
                    (calmly)
               Blind faith is what I consider
               heresy!

     The murmur turns to an audible gasp.  AROJAZ gets to his
     feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a
     candle only inches from his face.

     There is absolute silence.  COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze
     unflinchingly.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (quietly)
               Asia can be found to the west -- and
               I will prove it.

                         AROJAZ
               IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!


     EXT.  TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY

     The JURY is alone to deliberate.  Food and wine has been
     laid out on tables.  In the distance, students' cries
     carry over the conversation.

     SANCHEZ approaches.

                         AROJAZ
               The Treasurer of Spain honors us
               with his presence.

     SANCHEZ bows slightly.

                         SANCHEZ
               The State has some reason to be
               interested in this man's
               proposition, Your Eminence...

                         AROJAZ
               The Judgment is ours!

                         SANCHEZ
               Naturally.  But I would really
               deplore the loss of such a potential
               opportunity for Spain for a...
               dispute over a point of geography.

     SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the
     other members of the committee, who pretend not to be
     listening.

                         AROJAZ
                    (interrupting)
               He is a mercenary!  Did he not
               already try to convince the King of
               Portugal of his absurd notions?

                         SANCHEZ
               Indeed.  The world is full of
               mercenaries -- and states often make
               use of them, when it benefits them.
                    (casually)
               My only concern is the welfare and
               prosperity of Spain.

     AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.

                         AROJAZ
               You would use your influence to
               assist this... intriguer?

     SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.

                         SANCHEZ
               You know, Your Eminence, the
               fascinating thing about power, is
               that what can be given so
               effortlessly...

     He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts
     his glass.  But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter,
     pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table,
     leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.

                         SANCHEZ
               ... can so easily be taken away.

     And he drinks with a smile.


     INT.  LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING

     MARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter.

                         MARCHENA
               ... and therefore nothing could
               justify the participation of Your
               Highnesses in the venture that
               relies upon such feeble assumptions,
               and which any man of knowledge
               would take to be impractical... if
               not impossible.

     He shakes his head, puts the letter down.  COLUMBUS looks
     appalled; devastated.

                         COLUMBUS
               They didn't listen.  They didn't
               want to listen!

     He paces about the book-lined room.

                         MARCHENA
               You mustn't give way to despair.
               You must wait.

                         COLUMBUS
               Wait!  I've waited seven years
               already!  How much longer do you
               want me to wait?

                         MARCHENA
               If God intends you to go, then you
               will go.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (angrily)
               Damn God!

     MARCHENA is shocked.

                         MARCHENA
               Colon!

                         COLUMBUS
               Damn all of you!  You all set up
               theories based on what?  You never
               leave the safety of your studies!
               Go out!  Find out what the world is
               about and then tell me something I
               can listen to!

     He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.

                         COLUMBUS
               These don't mean anything!  They're
               full of assumptions!  Out of the
               heads of old men who've never been
               past the end of their gardens!

     He hurls the book across the room.  MARCHENA is horrified.

                         MARCHENA
               No...!  My books...!

     COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping
     them to the floor.

                         COLUMBUS
               All of them!  Just lies!

                         MARCHENA
               Colon!  Don't!

     MARCHENA tries to stop him.  In his fury, COLUMBUS
     accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground.  His
     cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room.

     As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books
     everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this
     big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect.  Finally, a
     short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends
     COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.


     INT.  CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING

     COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.  He is dressed
     in a homespun robe.  His arms are stretched out in
     penance.  FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him.

                         FERNANDO
               Father?

                         DIEGO
               Sssshhhh...!  One can't speak to a
               man doing penance.

                         FERNANDO
               What can you do?

                         DIEGO
               Nothing.  That's the point,
               Fernando.

     A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor
     beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same
     way.  DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to
     join them.


     EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

     Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry
     in the light breeze.  COLUMBUS pins up a new addition.
     Another MONK works nearby, in silence.

                         PINZON (O.S.)
               Senor Colon?

     COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching:  a
     middle-class gentleman.  He nods.

                         PINZON
               Ah, thank God!  I've been looking
               all over Seville for you!  Never
               expected to find a sailor in a
               monastery, eh?

     He laughs.  COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything.
     PINZON is clearly a little surprised.

                         PINZON
               Name's Pinzon, by the way.  Martin
               Alonzo Pinzon.  I'm a ship owner
               from Palos...

     COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way
     down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for
     PINZON to follow him.  PINZON is yet more surprised by
     this strange behavior.

                         PINZON
                    (indicating the
                    monk)
               Is he a spy?

     COLUMBUS shakes his head.  PINZON stares at him,
     perplexed.

                         PINZON
               What is it?  Are you a Trappist?

     COLUMBUS shakes his head again.

                         PINZON
               Vow of silence...?  Penance?

     COLUMBUS nods vigorously.

                         PINZON
               Jesus!  Just my luck!

     He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk
     cloth.

                         PINZON
               Listen.  I'll do the talking for
               both of us.  You just nod.  Agreed?
               Just as I do with the wife.

     COLUMBUS nods.

                         PINZON
               I know that the Commission turned
               you down, right?  What do you
               expect?  You're a foreigner... But I
               want to help you.

     COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in
     the air.

                         PINZON
               You wonder why I believe in you?
               Hey, I am a seaman.  And we don't
               like to be told where to go, and
               where not to go.

     COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing.  The other
     MONK looks round severely.  COLUMBUS ducks behind a map,
     PINZON following him.  PINZON lowers his voice.

                         PINZON
               I don't look like it, but I have
               friends at the Court.  The Treasurer
               of Aragon, for example.  He finances
               me.  His name's Santangel.  Ever
               heard of him?

     COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly
     interested by what he's hearing.

                         PINZON
               He can get you an audience with the
               Queen!  You know why...?  She owes
               him money.  That's how it is.  You
               -- me -- the Queen -- the world and
               his mistress -- agreed?

     COLUMBUS nods.

                         PINZON
               So.  What do you say?

     COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of
     the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:

                         COLUMBUS
               Where can I meet this man?

                         PINZON
                    (indicating with a
                    nod)
               Immediately.

     COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties,
     examining the maps.


     EXT.  STREETS OF GRANADA - DAY

     A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret
     of a mosque.  SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the
     foot of the tower.  To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a
     Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses,
     COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the
     scene.

     They push through an extraordinary scene.  The city of
     Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after
     several years of siege.  All around them, SPANISH SOLDIERS
     are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS,
     bearing only a few possessions.  Ragged, half-starved men,
     women and children.

                         SANTANGEL
               These people built Granada...
               Centuries ago!  It is a great
               victory over the Moors, Don Colon --
               and yet what a tragedy it is!

     The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful
     PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting
     psalms and flagellating themselves.  At the head of the
     procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin
     Mary swathed in silk and lace.

     The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.

                         COLUMBUS
               Is this a good time to meet her?

                         SANTANGEL
               It couldn't be better.  Victors
               can't say no.

     Bells are pealing triumphantly.  The noise is tumultuous.
     They ride towards the magnificent palace.


     EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

     Fabulous Moorish gardens:  ponds filled with golden carp;
     exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant
     sounds of victory.

     SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted
     by HALBERDIERS.  SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or
     piles of documents.

     As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are
     fewer people.  They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where
     several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience.

     SANCHEZ appears.  They bow.  SANTANGEL approaches to
     murmur a compliment.

                         SANTANGEL
               Your Excellency... truly grateful...
               your help... as ever...

     SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a
     half-smile forming on his lips.  Then a DUENA appears, and
     motions for COLUMBUS to follow.


     INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

     An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand.
     We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades,
     mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of
     Granada's rooftops.

     Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of
     QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN.  The light in her blonde hair
     creates a halo around her head as she turns.  COLUMBUS
     falls to his knees.

                         ISABEL
               Rise...!  Come forward!

     He approaches the window, stopping close to her.  ISABEL
     scrutinizes him quickly.

                         ISABEL
               I should not even be listening to
               you, since my council said no.  But
               Santangel tells me you are a man of
               honor and sincerity... And Sanchez,
               that you are not a fool.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (bold)
               No more than the woman who said she
               would take Granada from the Moors.

     ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.

                         ISABEL
               The ocean is uncrossable?

                         COLUMBUS
               What did they say about Granada
               before today?

                         ISABEL
                    (a beat)
               That she was impregnable.

     ISABEL smiles again.

                         ISABEL
               I cannot ignore the verdict of my
               council.

                         COLUMBUS
               Surely you can do anything you want.

     A direct challenge.  She doesn't know what to make of this
     man.

                         ISABEL
               How little you know.

     This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their
     positions for a moment.  Now we sense COLUMBUS
     scrutinizing her.

                         COLUMBUS
               May I speak freely?

                         ISABEL
                    (with a smile)
               You show no inclination to speak
               otherwise!

                         COLUMBUS
               I know what I see.  I see someone
               who doesn't accept the world as it
               is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a
               women who thinks... "What if?"...

                         ISABEL
                    (amused at his
                    familiarity)
               A woman?

     A slight pause.

                         COLUMBUS
               Forgive me... but you're the only
               Queen I know.

     She bursts out laughing.

                         ISABEL
               Then we are equal... since you are
               the only sailor I know!

     A beat.

                         ISABEL
               How old are you, Senor Colon?

                         COLUMBUS
               Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And
               you?

     Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away
     slightly to hide it.

                         ISABEL
               Thirty eight...

     A pause.

                         ISABEL
               You will be informed of our
               decision.

     COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave.  As the DUENA opens the
     door for him, he turns back.

                         COLUMBUS
               Actually, I thought you were younger
               than me!

     And he goes out, leaving her stunned.


     EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY

     A chalk white road, lined with trees.  Two liveried
     SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large
     silver tray, the other a smaller tray.

     They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along
     the road, with documents under his arm.


     EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY

     The CLERK enters an imposing stable block.

     In the paddock, SANCHEZ is training a magnificent young
     horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will.
     The ADMINISTRATOR watches him, unable to interrupt.

     Behind him the two SERVANTS can be seen bringing in the
     silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of
     wine.  They begin to lay them out on a table.


     EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - LATER

     SANCHEZ pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food,
     while the ADMINISTRATOR, clearly working himself up into a
     frenzy, reads from a document.

                         ADMINISTRATOR
               ... and he demands... he DEMANDS to
               be made a Knight, with the right to
               bear the Golden Spurs!  He will
               receive the title of Don Cristobal
               Colon -- which will be extended to
               his descendants for ever more...

     The ADMINISTRATOR looks up.  He is reading the contract
     that COLUMBUS has proposed.  SANCHEZ, his mouth full,
     gestures for him to continue.

                         SANCHEZ
               Go on!

                         ADMINISTRATOR
               He will be named Great Admiral of
               the Ocean Sea.  Viceroy of the West
               Indies... Governor of all islands or
               lands discovered or as will be
               discovered with his help...

     The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again.

                         ADMINISTRATOR
               The highest titles of nobility, Your
               Excellency!  To an immigrant
               sheltered by monks!

     SANCHEZ gestures for the document.  Wipes his mouth.
     Continues reading, calmly:

                         SANCHEZ
               Furthermore he will receive one
               eight of all wealth or monies,
               precious gems, pearls, metals,
               spices and other lucrative sources
               conquered within the boundaries of
               his admiralty...

     He smiles, hands the document back.

                         SANCHEZ
               It's very underdone.

                         ADMINISTRATOR
                    (exploding)
               Underdone!  It's monstrous,
               Excellency!

                         SANCHEZ
               No, the pheasant.  It's almost raw.

     And he carries on eating.

                         SANCHEZ
               You worry too much, Carvajal... The
               man will have to lower his demands.
               Believe me, he WILL!


     INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

     Close up on COLUMBUS.

                         COLUMBUS
               I WON'T!

     A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy
     hole in the wall.  Two beautiful eyes peer through a
     grille, into the next room.

     What they see:

     SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together.  COLUMBUS is visibly upset.

                         SANCHEZ
                    (calmly)
               We have considered your -- demands
               very carefully, Senor Colon... Your
               expectations are... excessive, in
               every way.

     COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.

                         COLUMBUS
               If I am right, my requests are fair!

     SANCHEZ holds up a document.

                         SANCHEZ
               We have prepared our own contract...

     He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it
     quickly, shakes his head.

                         COLUMBUS
               No...

                         SANCHEZ
               No?

                         COLUMBUS
               NO...!  I have waited too long,
               fought too hard.  Now you expect me
               to take all the risks while you take
               the profit!  No... I will not be
               your servant!

     The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth, forming a little
     smile.

                         SANCHEZ
               I remind you, Senor Colon, that you
               are in no position to bargain with
               me.

                         COLUMBUS
               I'm not bargaining!

                         SANCHEZ
                    (steely)
               Then you are too ambitious.

     COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.

                         COLUMBUS
               And were you never ambitious,
               Excellency?  Or is ambition only a
               virtue among the nobles, a fault for
               the rest of us?

                         SANCHEZ
                    (abrupt)
               If you won't accept our proposal,
               we'll simply find someone who will.

     COLUMBUS smiles.

                         COLUMBUS
               If you can do that, Excellency --
               I'll become a monk!

     He turns, strides towards the door.  We hear a WOMAN'S
     muffled laughter.

     As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret
     door.  SANCHEZ bows.

     ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out.

                         ISABEL
               You were right, Don Sanchez... His
               demands could never be granted.

                         SANCHEZ
               Never, Your Majesty.  Although...

     She turns, questioningly, towards him.

                         SANCHEZ
               ... Although one may always
               renegotiate a contract.  Especially
               signed by Royal Hands.


     EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY

     SANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window.  They see COLUMBUS
     striding out and away.


     INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

     BACK TO SANCHEZ

                         SANCHEZ
                    (quietly)
               ... Into a monk...

                         ISABEL
                    (with a smile)
               Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't
               it?
                    (turning to Sanchez)
               Call him back!


     EXT.  STREET - EVENING   

     Teeming life.  COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds.
     He is expressionless and distracted.

     He looks around him, stops walking.  And then,
     unexpectedly, shouts.

                         COLUMBUS
               YEEEEEEES!

     All heads turn as if he were totally insane.  He walks on
     as if nothing happened.


     INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with
     a glass of wine.  There is a movement behind him.  BEATRIX
     is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt.

     COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad.

                         COLUMBUS
               She said yes.

                         BEATRIX
                    (moved)
               Thank God...

     She smiles.  But he seems to be unable to share her
     happiness.

                         COLUMBUS
               If I ever come back, I swear I
               will...

     She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his
     mouth.

                         BEATRIX
                    (softly)
               I'm not asking you to swear to
               anything.

                         COLUMBUS
               I don't want you to wait for me.

                         BEATRIX
                    (smiling)
               That's something you can't decide.

     COLUMBUS kisses her.


     INT.  CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark
     tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks
     slowly down the dark corridor.

     Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.


     INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and
     Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic
     Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's
     imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons;
     creatures half-human, half-animal.

     Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.

                         FERNANDO (O.S.)
               You can't go there!

     Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.

                         COLUMBUS
               Why not?

     FERNANDO points at the monsters.  He pulls the boy to him.

                         COLUMBUS
               There aren't any monsters, Fernando.
               The only monsters are in here...
                    (he taps his own
                    forehead)
               Watch!

     He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible
     monsters, transforming it at once.  FERNANDO laughs
     immediately.

                         FERNANDO
               I want to go with you!

                         COLUMBUS
               There'll be a time.

                         FERNANDO
               You promise?
                    (Columbus nods his
                    head)
               Do you swear on St. Christopher...?

     FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal
     from under COLUMBUS' shirt.

                         FERNANDO
               Do you swear on all the Holy Saints
               in heaven?

                         COLUMBUS
                    (laughing)
               Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

     And he hugs his SON tightly.


     EXT.  HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWN

     A luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate,
     down to the harbor.  We see the faces of the SAILORS and
     their FAMILIES -- COLUMBUS, PINZON AMONGST THEM -- We
     sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure.  The
     procession is lead by MARCHENA and four young NOVICES
     carrying the Madonna.  All hold long, burning tapers,
     saying the rosary.  A SAILOR pushes through the crowd, and
     kisses the Madonna's feet.


     EXT.  PALOS HARBOR - DAWN

     Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by
     the FAMILIES and FRIENDS of the SAILORS.

     The SANTA MARIA the PINTA and the NINA nestle against the
     quayside.  Dwarfed by the hulls, a flotilla of smaller
     fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally
     witness this event.


     EXT.  MAKESHIFT CONFESSIONAL - DOCKSIDE - DAWN

     MARCHENA sits on a barrel and crosses himself.  Behind a
     curtain sits COLUMBUS.

                         MARCHENA
               In Nomine Patris et Filius, et
               Spiritus Sancti.

                         COLUMBUS
               Forgive me, Father.  For I have
               sinned.

     MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS' voice.

                         MARCHENA
               I am listening, my son.

                         COLUMBUS
               Father, I have betrayed my family.
               I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed
               you.

                         MARCHENA
               What are you saying?

                         COLUMBUS
               I lied.  The journey will be longer
               than I said.

                         MARCHENA
               How long?

                         COLUMBUS
               I am not sure... It could be twice
               the distance.

     A pause.

                         MARCHENA
               May God forgive you...!  You must
               tell them!  You must tell your men!

                         COLUMBUS
               If I tell them, they won't follow
               me.  You know that I am right,
               Father.  You trust me...

                         MARCHENA
               My son, my son...
                    (he shakes his head)
               Your certitudes are sometimes
               frightening...
                    (pause)
               Christopher, you must speak to them.
               And if you don't I will.

                         COLUMBUS
               You are bound by an oath, Father.

     A long silence.

                         MARCHENA
               I believed in you...

                         COLUMBUS
               Give me absolution.

     No response.

                         COLUMBUS
               Give me absolution, Father!

     Devastated, MARCHENA reluctantly makes the sign of the
     cross.


     EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - PALOS - DAWN

     COLUMBUS walks over to where BEATRIX and FERNANDO are
     waiting.  He kisses and hugs FERNANDO.

                         MARCHENA (O.S.)
               Ispo Te Absoluto.  May God forgive
               you and have mercy on your soul,
               Christopher Columbus.  Go in peace.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - DAWN - LATER

     The CROWDED QUAYSIDE.  COLUMBUS stands in front of
     FERNANDO.

                         COLUMBUS
               Be good to your mother, Fernando.
               Do you promise?

     FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes.  Then COLUMBUS embraces
     BEATRIX tightly.  She whispers into his ear.

                         BEATRIX
               Speak to Diego.

     But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and
     instead they clumsily hug.  Someone taps COLUMBUS'
     shoulder.  He turns around to see SANTANGEL.  Wordlessly,
     they hug.

                                             CUT TO:

     Activity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes
     fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now
     the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside.  The
     CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS.  WOMEN
     holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying...
     BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them.

     COLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and
     throws it at DIEGO.

                         COLUMBUS
               Diego!  Here!

     DIEGO catches it.  Opening his hand he looks at the
     medallion.  Then looks up at his FATHER, elated.

     THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY.
     SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.

                         SANTANGEL
                    (casually)
               Take care of my investment, wherever
               you're going!

                         COLUMBUS
                    (ambiguous)
               I have to tell you Santangel.  I
               don't know where on earth I am
               going!

     They both laugh.

     A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand
     slide gently along the gigantic hull.  He stares up at the
     SAILORS leaning on the rail.

                         SAILOR
               Vaya con Dios!  (Go with God!)

     They wave back.

                                             CUT TO:

     MARCHENA walking towards the Moorish gate.  He finally
     turns, sad and distraught.  He sees:

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY

     THREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN.

     The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath.
     A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable
     metamorphosis.  Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety
     of the crew, the fear of the unknown...

     ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging
     majestically through the waves.  Sinking back,
     disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music.


     EXT.  DECK - DAY

     A SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck.

     A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast.

     A COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of
     the evening meal.

     TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail,
     punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant.


     EXT.  SANTA MARIA - NIGHT

     The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an
     instrument.

     COLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the
     prow.  Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars.

     SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity.  One of them is
     ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque.

     Near COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts.  He
     makes an entry in the log.  Then goes back to his
     quadrant.  He senses MENDEZ standing next to him.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (softly)
               Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may
               God be with us...

                         MENDEZ
               God be with us admiral.

     MENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS.

                         COLUMBUS
               What is it Mendez?  Speak!

     MENDEZ is hesitant.  He nervously clears his throat.

                         MENDEZ
               Well... It's the men, Sir.  They
               wonder how you know our position.
               We've lost sight from land days
               ago...

                         COLUMBUS
                    (still taking
                    readings)
               And what do you think Mendez?

                         MENDEZ
               Well, I surely know what a quadrant
               is!  But I've never seen it used at
               night before.

                         COLUMBUS
               Come over here.

     MENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS.  The SAILORS
     are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.

                         COLUMBUS
               Now, find the North Star.  Do you
               have it?

                                             CUT TO:

     The picture swims across the heavens, until we see the
     north star.

                         COLUMBUS (O.S.)
               Steady yourself...!  Keep the plumb
               line vertical...

     The picture steadies.

                                             CUT TO:

     MENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium.  The plumb line
     swings.

                         COLUMBUS
               Don't move!  A mistake of one degree
               and we'll be off 6,000 leagues!

     MENDEZ tries again.

                         COLUMBUS
               What do you read?

                         MENDEZ
               Twenty eight.

     MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS.

                         COLUMBUS
               That's it.  The twenty eighth
               parallel.  And we'll follow it until
               we reach land.

     ALONSO does not seem convinced.

                         ALONSO
               How do you know land is on the
               twenty eighth parallel?


     EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

     A blazing sun.  The ship is like a furnace, its brass
     fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the
     air shimmer over the decks.

     Desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the
     sagging prow sail.

     The SHIP'S BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope
     over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with
     water.  As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair
     lip.  He drenches himself... From the shade, ALONSO
     watches him.

                         ALONSO
               Chicken-ass face!

     The others laugh.  The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them.
     ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he
     reacts like he was burnt.

                         ALONSO
               Shit!

     He sucks his blistered fingers.

                         ALONSO
               I never seen heat like this!  Not
               even in Las Minas!

                         SAILOR
               The water's going putrid in the
               barrels.

                         ALONSO
               You'll be drinking your own piss...
               For the glory of Spain... and
               Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!

     The SHIP'S BOY glances round at them.

                         ALONSO
               What are you listening to, chicken
               ass?

                         SAILOR
               Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no
               harm.

                         ALONSO
               With a face like that?
                    (to boy)
               I don't want you looking at me.  You
               hear?

     The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.

                         ALONSO
               He's the devil's child...

                         SAILOR
               We'll all go crazy...

     The BOY throws more water over the deck.  A SAILOR takes
     his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song.

                         SAILOR
               Culo de galina es el hijo del
               demonio... (Chicken ass mouth is the
               devil's child... Born from the loins
               of a stinky old goat etc...)

     They all laugh.  The BOY, hearing this, climbs to the
     crow's-nest like a monkey.


     EXT.  SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROW'S-NEST - DAY

     We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the
     main mast, high above the rolling deck.

     The BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest,
     exhausted by the heat, and scared.  His eyes are turning
     white.  He begins to piss himself...

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

     Piss is dripping on the deck.  THE SAILORS do not seem to
     care.  THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage.  He breaks
     its neck, and starts plucking it.  The OTHERS continue
     their bitter conversation.

                         ALONSO
               We should have seen land.

                         SAILOR
               We left three weeks ago, Alonso.
               Can't be that near.

                         ALONSO
               Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I
               don't like the smell of the sea
               around here.  Smells like a cunt.
               Bad sign...

     The COOK starts laughing.  They turn to him.

                         COOK
                    (shaking his head)
               Of course it smells like it!  That's
               why sailors take to the sea!

     They all laugh.  Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on
     the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the
     land to appear.

                         ALONSO
               And why does this one take to the
               sea?  Nobody knows.  Never says a
               word...

     MENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect.  He
     approaches them.

                         MENDEZ
               To your post!  At once!

     They split in silence.


     EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

     The SHIP is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS
     sleep on deck.

     The SHIP'S BOY is singing to himself.  Despite his hair
     lip he has a pure, melancholy voice...

     COLUMBUS, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears
     it carry over the darkness.


     EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

     CLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time.

     The SHIP'S BOY throws an "ampoulette" over board.  We
     follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full
     length of the hull.  As it reaches the poop deck, another
     SAILOR shouts "MARK".  A very primitive system of
     calculation for distance and speed.

     Sitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in
     a log-book, watching the hourglass.

                         SHIP'S BOY
               Mark.  Twenty nine, Sir!

     THE HOUR-GLASS runs out.  COLUMBUS converts the mark into
     a daily average for distance and speed.

                         COLUMBUS
               Six hundred and twenty nine.

     THE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout.

     EXT.  PINTA - DAY

     PINZON, his OFFICERS beside him, looks across at the SANTA
     MARIA.

                         SHIP'S BOY
               Six hundred and twenty nine!

     AN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message.

                         OFFICER
               Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir!

     PINZON does not seem too pleased.

                         PINZON
               I heard.

     THE OFFICER examines his own calculations.

                         OFFICER
               Captain, I don't understand.

                         PINZON
               I think I do.

     He goes back to his cabin.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  SHIPS - SARGASSO SEA - DAY

     ABSOLUTE STILLNESS.  A FURNACE.  The three ships like
     dots, on what seems to be a prairie of weed.

     The caravels are being towed by three rowing boats.

     CLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat.

     FROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon.

     ALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant
     figure with hate and resentment.

     ALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat
     into disarray.  Chaos.

     Total silence.  MENDEZ and ALONSO stare at each other.

                         MENDEZ
               Continue rowing!

                         ALONSO
               To where?

     ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ.  He then starts to beat
     a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the
     others.  In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow
     suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls.

     MENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic.

     ON BOARD PINZON'S SHIP, an OFFICER cups his hands to his
     mouth.

                         OFFICER
               Captain Pinzon requests permission
               to board.

               Granted.


     INT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - DAY

     PINZON enters.  He looks furious.

                         PINZON
               You lied!  You cheated!  We're way
               past 750 leagues!

                         COLUMBUS
                    (calmly)
               Six days ago, yes.

                         PINZON
               You must be mad...!

                         COLUMBUS
               We have to keep the hopes of these
               men alive!

                         PINZON
               We're on the verge of a mutiny,
               Colon!

                         COLUMBUS
               You think I don't know that?

                         PINZON
               We're lost!

                         COLUMBUS
               The land is there.  I know it!

                         PINZON
               You don't know anything!  Listen
               Colon, these are my ships, right?
               So I'm telling you we're turning
               back!

                         COLUMBUS
               And then what?  Half of the water
               has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!
               You know that!

                         PINZON
                    (apoplectic)
               Jesus Maria!  I should have never
               listened to you!

                         COLUMBUS
               You never did.  You did all the
               talking for both of us, remember?

                         PINZON
               You bloody...

                         COLUMBUS
               Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now
               is go forward!  Think about that!

                         PINZON
               You tell that to them!

                         COLUMBUS
               You're right.  Let the men decide.

     COLUMBUS moves to the door.  As an afterthought, he takes
     his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook.


     EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

     Most of the men are now back on board.

     They go silent as COLUMBUS appears.  He walks slowly over
     to them.  All, including ALONSO, are surly, threatening...

                         COLUMBUS
               Who gave you the order to come on
               board?

     He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO.  They
     stare at one another.

                         ALONSO
               God doesn't want us to cross the
               ocean...!  This voyage is cursed!

     Some of the MEN murmur their agreement.

                         COLUMBUS
               Cursed?

                         ALONSO
               We set sail for greed.  God has
               abandoned us.  The voyage is cursed.
               There are signs...

     ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip.
     The BOY lowers his eyes.  COLUMBUS moves towards him,
     pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.

                         COLUMBUS
               This boy has the voice of an angel.
               What comes out of his mouth is
               blessed, Alonso.  What comes out of
               your is evil.

     Some of the men laugh at this statement.  ALONSO is ill at
     ease.  COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.

                         COLUMBUS
               Listen to me!  Every man is afraid
               who does something for the first
               time.  But those who overcome their
               fears, will find their rewards.  I
               do not know if it is God's will that
               we cross this ocean -- but I am
               certain it is the devil who puts
               fears into our hearts...

     The MEN are listening.  We sense a subtle change of
     mood...

                         COLUMBUS
               This jacket to the first man who
               sights land!  I want a man up that
               mast day and night.

     COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.

                         COLUMBUS
               You start first.

     The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast.  As he climbs, the
     mainsail starts to fill with wind.  The deck begins to
     move under their feet.

     This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly
     erase the fears and the angers.

                         MENDEZ
               Alonso!  Jaime!  Don't let this wind
               escape us.

     CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut,
     filling with wind.  MEN rush to their posts.  PINZON
     stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief.

                         PINZON
                    (murmuring)
               You lucky bastard...

     COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to
     PINZON.

                         COLUMBUS
               Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier
               I get.

     Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.


     EXT.  SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT

     COLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his
     cape, struggling against the sleep.  MENDEZ approaches him
     with a bowl of soup.

                         MENDEZ
               Shall I take my turn?

     COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the
     bowl.

                                             CUT TO:

     COLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest.  He is
     asleep.  We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound.  It
     becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face.

     A mosquito lands on his temple.  COLUMBUS reflexively
     slaps it.  He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot
     of blood, a crushed mosquito.  He stares at it for a
     moment.  Then slowly gets to his feet.


     EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

     In the luminous moonlight, COLUMBUS is standing, staring
     up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast
     lantern.  We hear the flutter of their wings and see the
     bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy.

     COLUMBUS turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see
     the land that must be close.

     He kneels by MENDEZ, wrapped in a blanket.  He touches his
     shoulder.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (murmuring)
               Mendez!  Mendez!

     MENDEZ grimaces, and opens one eye.

                         COLUMBUS
               Land...

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  SHIP - DAWN   

     An opaque dawn.  COLUMBUS, riveted, staring forward as if
     to pierce the mist.  The entire crew are clinging to the
     rail, and standing on the shrouds.

     Suddenly, the SHIP BOY'S voice cracking with emotion.

                         SHIP'S BOY
               TIERRA...!  TIERRA!

     COLUMBUS strains his eyes; he still can not see anything.

     The entire CREW stand and stare, silent, holding their
     breath.

     As the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates -- slowly,
     exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems
     almost as though they could touch it.  Then a white slash
     of beach.

     Near COLUMBUS, a SAILOR falls to his knees and burst into
     tears.  Others laugh with joy.  COLUMBUS watches this
     vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were
     difficult for him to breathe.  Tears come to his eyes.  He
     closes them.  Then opens them again.  The land is there --
     a green paradise.

     On screen the words:  OCTOBER 12, 1942.  GUANAHAN ISLAND


     EXT.  BOATS - DAY

     Three row boats plunging through the surf towards the
     beach.  COLUMBUS stands in the prow of the first boat.
     MENDEZ is in the second.  PINZON the third.  They stare
     entranced at the lushness of the foliage, and the blue
     clarity of the water...

     As the first boat beaches, COLUMBUS leaps out and wades
     ashore.  Behind him the rest of the landing party splash
     through the sun-dazzled water, carrying the banner of
     Castille and Aragon.


     EXT.  BEACH - DAY

     They stand on the beach, almost in a dream.  There is
     silence.  The ROYAL NOTARY, ludicrously overdressed, now
     wet through, stumbles over to COLUMBUS and holds out his
     contract and a pen.  COLUMBUS scrawls his name.

     The MEN stare at him, filled not only with new respect,
     but with something amounting to awe.

     COLUMBUS turns to them, tries to speak.

                         COLUMBUS
               By the... by the Grace of... God...

     He swallows.  Tears have sprung to his eyes.  He is so
     moved he cannot continue.  Coming to his rescue -- THE
     SHIP'S BOY starts to roll the drum.  He then stops.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (pulling himself
                    together)
               In the name of their Gracious
               Majesties of Castille and Aragon,
               and by all the powers vested in me,
               I claim this island and name it San
               Salvador.

     The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand,
     flapping in the wind.

     COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence
     the rest follow.


     EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

     Immediately they are met by an incredible wall of SOUND!
     The jungle is filled with NOISE.  The impossibly-loud
     CRIES of EXOTIC BIRDS, the CHATTERING of MONKEYS.  The
     SPANIARDS are overwhelmed.

     They move forward.  Rays of sunlight pierce through the
     high canopy of leaves, like the roof of a magnificent
     cathedral.  The sounds and smells intoxicate their senses.
     They are filled with wonder.

     Then PINZON stops.  He has seen something.  Another stops,
     then a third, staring ahead of them...

                         MENDEZ
                    (whispering
                    urgently)
               Arquebuses!

     Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders,
     pointing them into the jungle.

     From COLUMBUS' POV we slowly scan the face of the thick
     jungle ahead.  For a moment we don't see anything -- and
     then, with a shock, we see the first INDIAN.  Naked,
     painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance.

     As if they had materialized from nowhere:  the rest of the
     HUNTING PARTY, with their bows and spears.  Silent.
     Watchful.  They stare back at us.

     The SPANIARDS nervously finger their weapons.

     COLUMBUS slowly lifts his hand into the air:  a clear
     signal not to fire.  Then, removing his sword, he drops it
     on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze
     upon the first INDIAN he saw.

                         PINZON
                    (warningly)
               Colon!

     COLUMBUS ignores him, even though some of the INDIANS have
     raised their weapons.  He stops in the no-man's land
     between them.  The INDIANS don't move -- but something
     excites them.

     The SHIP'S BOY, wearing COLUMBUS' embroidered jacket and
     the drum, has followed COLUMBUS and now stands close to
     him.  He is the cause of their interest.  COLUMBUS puts
     his arm around the BOY, and this gesture of affection
     seems to put the INDIANS at their ease.  They start
     talking and pointing.  They come forward slowly, start to
     tentatively touch the BOY'S jacket.  Then, now laughing,
     they touch COLUMBUS, pulling at his beard.  COLUMBUS
     laughs too.

     Sensing their innocence, the rest of the MEN lower their
     weapons.  Some of them laugh.

     An apparition:  a beautiful young INDIAN GIRL, totally
     naked, walks out of the jungle.

     She is pregnant and holds a child.  We begin to hear
     Indian music, played on a flute.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

     A large post is lifted from the ground by two SPANIARDS
     pulling on ropes.  The post is fixed into position -- and
     then we see that it is a large wooden cross... The INDIAN
     VILLAGERS watch the ceremony with some interest and
     amusement.

     COLUMBUS looks over at the men and gestures at the
     INDIANS.

                         COLUMBUS
               We have come here in peace, and we
               will behave with honor.  They are
               not savages and neither will you be.
               Treat these people as you would your
               own wives and your own children.
               Neither are you free to take what
               you will; for a seashell you give a
               bandana.  You will respect their
               beliefs.  Pillage will be punished
               by the whip.  Rape by the sword.


     EXT.  VILLAGE - SUNSET

     The smoke from fires.  Laughter.  Music playing.  The
     INDIANS have prepared food for the SPANIARDS, who are
     drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world.

     COLUMBUS sits with MENDEZ, PINZON, the INDIAN CHIEF,
     ELDERS OF THE VILLAGE.  Other INDIANS stand around,
     smiling, curious.

     The INDIANS talk among themselves.  The ELDERS smoke
     primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to
     their guests.  The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first...
     and laugh.  In return, they offer the INDIANS wine...

     Dogs roam around the campfires.  The WOMEN openly suckle
     their babies.  The MEN are entranced.

     PINZON draws out attention, for the first time, to a small
     gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS.  He
     points to it, indicates his interest in it.

                         PINZON
               Gold...!  Gold!

     The INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing.
     We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold
     ornaments.

     PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold.  The INDIAN
     removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON,
     who indicates that he wants to have it.  The INDIAN nods
     -- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants
     it in return.  PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN
     from taking it.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (to Pinzon)
               Give it to him!

     PINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS
     insists.  PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the
     INDIAN.

                         PINZON
                    (irritated)
               By God!  That's the worst trade of
               my life!

     His friends laugh.  Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by
     the blade.  He yelps, looks down at the blood welling
     up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his
     clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN
     laughs.

     Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw,
     squatting on his haunches, watching.  This is UTAPAN.


     INT.  TENT - DAWN

     The first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds
     of the jungle all around.  COLUMBUS writes in his journal.

                         COLUMBUS (V.O.)
               October 21st, 1492.  I think we have
               returned to Eden.  Surely this is
               how the world once was, before the
               beginning of time.  I believe no man
               will ever see this land again as we
               do, for the first time...

     He looks up.  UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the
     hut.  He's been there all night.  COLUMBUS takes more ink
     on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the
     margin of his log-book.  He draws well.

     He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the
     drawing.  It's an electrifying moment.  UTAPAN is shocked
     and amazed.  At first he is rather frightened of his own
     image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS
     laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a
     gesture of friendship.

     UTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he
     wishes to offer.


     EXT.  JUNGLE - MORNING

     UTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle.  COLUMBUS
     follows him.

     UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit.  COLUMBUS obeys.  UTAPAN
     looks up at the tops of the trees.  The sun is rising, and
     filters through the foliage.  As if the time had come,
     UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same.

     A gap in the dense vegetation.  Something is glittering.
     Gold.  A mass of gold.  As they approach, COLUMBUS
     discovers --

     A large pool of fresh water.  The morning sunlight has
     turned the water into liquid gold.  The surface ripples
     with the breeze.  UTAPAN smiles.  It the stranger
     satisfied?  Isn't this what he came for?

     COLUMBUS plunges into the pool.  As he emerges, he fills
     his palms with liquid gold.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  RIVER - DAY

     Wide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream.

     INDIANS AND SPANIARDS are traveling together in the
     canoes.  UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS' craft.
     THE SHIP BOY'S cranium is shaved like UTAPAN'S, and we
     notice that some other crew members are beardless, some
     even wearing tribal patterns.


     EXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY

     INDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS, UTAPAN talks
     to an ELDER MAN, watched by COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and PINZON.

     UTAPAN repeats several times the word for GOLD, showing
     some artifacts.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head no,
     indicating another distant place.

                         OLD INDIAN
               Cuba!  Cuba!

     THE OLD MAN nods, points into the distance, chatters away
     to UTAPAN.

                         UTAPAN
               Say not here!  Cuba!

                         COLUMBUS
               What is it?  A tribe?  An island?

                         UTAPAN
               Island.  Far.


     EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

     Standing at the prow of the ship, his long dark hair
     floating in the wind, UTAPAN rejoicing at the speed.


     EXT.  THICK JUNGLE - CUBA - DAY

     Led by UTAPAN, the SPANIARDS hack their way through thick
     jungle.  It's hard work.  The MEN sweat.  This is
     inhospitable terrain.  Even the noises of the jungle seem
     somehow more sinister...

                                             CUT TO:

     RESTING PLACE - ALONSO is seated under a tree.  He takes
     off his boot, and grabs his foot, examining the blisters
     on his toes.  As he puts his foot back into the boot, he
     jumps screaming in pain.

     ALONSO yelps, grasping his ankle.

     CLOSE ON a snake sliding out of the empty boot.

     While his COMPANIONS rush to him, a SAILOR spots the
     snake, and decapitates it with his sword.  UTAPAN glances
     at the dead snake.  He then goes and kneels -- he sees the
     bite on ALONSO'S ankle.

                         COLUMBUS
               Help him!

     ALONSO is quiet and silent.  His eyes are looking around
     at his companions.  UTAPAN shakes his head.  There is
     nothing he can do.

     ALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his
     friends.  He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR.  His
     look is already far away.  His companion shouts at UTAPAN.

                         SAILOR
               Do something!  Help him!

                         UTAPAN
               He dead.

     ALONSO starts convulsing.  HIS FRIENDS hold him, desperate
     in their helplessness.  Others simply move away,
     horrified.  One of them cries.


     EXT.  RIVER - DAY

     Standing in the stream up to his thighs, A SPANIARD (a
     gold expert) examines some stones.  He then looks up at
     COLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into
     the water without a word.

     The group of SPANIARDS are resting, exhausted by the
     humidity.  Some are drinking from the river, others soak
     bandanas, and tie them around their necks...

     One after another, they stand up slowly -- they look
     discouraged, tired, and beaten.


     EXT.  MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAY

     UTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills.  Fully
     armed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and
     the vicious insect bites.

     COLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN, who tirelessly
     trots forward.

     Finally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody.  He
     calls out to UTAPAN.

                         COLUMBUS
               Utapan!  Wait!

     UTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with
     comical energy.

     On their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning
     against a tree.  He has removed his helmet.  His hair
     sticking to his forehead.

     As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another
     SAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around
     PINZON.  Ashen, he burns with fever.  He attempts a smile.

                         PINZON
               Well... You'll have to continue
               without me...

     COLUMBUS looks around him -- what he sees:  exhausted men
     and jungle, as far as one can see.

                         COLUMBUS
               No.  It's enough.  What would you
               say to a drop of Jerez, Pinzon?

     PINZON grins.

                         PINZON
               And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb!
               I'd sell my soul for it.
                    (to his officer)
               Help me up.  I've got to piss, gold.

     They all laugh as the OFFICER helps PINZON to his feet.

     PINZON walks a few yards into the jungle -- starts to
     urinate.  It is red.  Suddenly dizzy, he reels and
     collapses.


     EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

     A line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a
     mountainside.  PINZON is being carried on a makeshift
     stretcher.  His eyes are closed, his face thick with
     sweat.

     They enter a village, to the surprise of the INDIANS.
     UTAPAN once again at the front as the ambassador.


     INT.  HUT - NIGHT

     A INDIAN SHAMAN is forcing a milky fluid into PINZON'S
     mouth.  COLUMBUS attempts a gesture to prevent him.  But
     UTAPAN stops him.

                         UTAPAN
               He cures.

     COLUMBUS nods -- he obviously trusts UTAPAN.


     INT.  CHIEF GUARIONEX'S HUT - NIGHT

     In the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS,
     MENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a
     Spanish helmet on his head.  The helmet is too big, almost
     covering his eyes.  The ELDERS appraise the gift with
     solemn wonder.

     In return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of
     leaves.  COLUMBUS unwraps them.  Inside:  a GOLD grimacing
     mask.  The first real piece of gold.  COLUMBUS is unable
     to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of
     the metal.

     He waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks
     at him.  On the ground, we see other presents offered by
     the SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...

                         UTAPAN
                    (to Columbus)
               You come!  You speak first!

                         COLUMBUS
               Tell the Chief we thank him.

                         UTAPAN
               Chief knows.

                         COLUMBUS
               Tell him his country is very
               beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving
               men here -- to build a fort.

     UTAPAN translates.

                         COLUMBUS
               Tell him we will return very soon.
               Many of us.

     UTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple
     question.

                         UTAPAN
               Chief says -- how many?

                         COLUMBUS
               Thousands.

                         UTAPAN
               Why?

     COLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question.  For the
     first time he seems to be caught short.

                         COLUMBUS
               To bring the word of God.

                         UTAPAN
               Chief says -- he has a God.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (pursuing)
               ... and also to bring medicine.

                         UTAPAN
               Chief says...

                         COLUMBUS
                    (interrupting)
               He has medicine.
                    (pause)
               Tell him we admire his people.

     UTAPAN translates.

                         UTAPAN
               Chief says he knows you like his...
                    (searches for the
                    word)
               Women...

     And the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and
     walks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving
     COLUMBUS alone.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (with a little
                    smile)
               That's a beginning...


     EXT.  SHORE - DAY

     Watched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty
     of the SPANIARDS, who are staying behind, the boats pull
     out towards the two remaining ships.

     PINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat.  COLUMBUS,
     UTAPAN, and four other INDIANS are in the same boat.

                         COLUMBUS (V.O.)
               March 1493... Thirty nine of my men
               volunteered to stay behind.  God
               willing we will be back in less than
               a year...

     The boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore
     growing smaller.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON:  a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings
     violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if
     the mask was alive... COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty
     in his log-book.

                         COLUMBUS (V.O.)
               ... Several men are ill.  We did not
               find signs of civilization.  No
               cities, no temples... Nothing that
               resembles Marco Polo's descriptions.
               My ships are not filled with the
               spices and the gold that Spain was
               hoping for.  But this land
               intoxicates the senses like the
               strongest of perfumes... And all I
               can think of, is to return to these
               untamed lands...

     Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over.  Things fall from
     the table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls.


     EXT.  SEA - NIGHT

     We are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying
     proportions.  The thunder is deafening.  Light irradiates
     the darkness.  We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the
     massive seas.


     EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

     Five MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller.  The deck
     jumps and rolls.  It rises five meters into the air then
     falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack.
     Waves sweep over the decks.  We hear desperate cries for
     mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard
     above the storm.

     COLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a
     lifeline.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (screaming to the
                    sailors)
               Get below!  All of you!  Go!

     The MEN start to scramble below decks.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (to Mendez)
               Stay with me!

     The ship rolls again.  COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards
     the mast.  Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons
     of water falling like cement.  They reach the mast.  The
     wood groans.

                         COLUMBUS
               We may have to cut it!

     MENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope.  The ship rises
     into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing
     beneath them for a moment.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (screaming out)
               I'll stay here -- to decide if we
               cut it.  Help me!

     With MENDEZ'S help, COLUMBUS is tied to the mast:  one
     rope under his arms, the other around his waist.  MENDEZ
     hands him a horn.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (screaming)
               Now go!

     MENDEZ seems to hesitate.  COLUMBUS screams at him again.

                         COLUMBUS
               I said -- below deck, Mendez!

     MENDEZ crawls away.

     Another huge wave washes over COLUMBUS.  He emerges,
     almost suffocated.  The storm rages, its eerie light
     making it seem at times like bright daylight.  But as the
     lightning flashes, COLUMBUS begins to count:

                         COLUMBUS
               One... two... three... four...

     There's an enormous thunderclap on "four" -- it indicates
     how close they are to the eye of the storm.

     The ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming
     never to rise... COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens,
     screams out:

                         COLUMBUS
               Damn you!

     As if in answer, another flash of lightning that
     illuminates the sky and the sea.  COLUMBUS starts counting
     again.

                         COLUMBUS
               One... two... three... four...
               five...

     Another terrible clap of thunder on "five" -- COLUMBUS
     starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on.

     Then, in the strange light, something seems to move
     through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of
     projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor.

     COLUMBUS stares up at it... amazed.  We start to hear the
     "Te Deum", majestic and heavenly.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT.  CATHEDRAL OF CORDOBA - SPAIN - DAY

     COLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense
     burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling,
     trailing a think vapor of incense.

     A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of
     COLUMBUS' achievements and return.  The whole cathedral is
     packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous
     robes.

     BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at
     COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur of
     this occasion.  COLUMBUS passes by, walking proudly down
     the long central alley, beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN
     ISABEL and other GRANDEES.  He turns to his family,
     keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his
     vision.

     The procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS in
     tribal regalia...

     As they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon
     COLUMBUS.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT.  ROOM - SEVILLE (PINZON'S DEATH) - DAY

     In a simple room, a PRIEST finishes giving the Last Rites
     and a sheet is pulled over the head of MARTIN PINZON.  His
     WIFE and CHILDREN weep at the bedside.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT.  CATHEDRAL - DAY

     A stool passes from hands to hands.  It is placed at the
     Queen and King's side.  COLUMBUS sits on it -- a supreme
     privilege.

     To one side sit AROJAZ and SANCHEZ.  AROJAZ leans over to
     whisper to him.

                         AROJAZ
               It won't be easy to get rid of your
               prophet now, Don Sanchez.

                         SANCHEZ
                    (whispering)
               On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It
               seems to me the man is preparing his
               own cross.


     INT.  ALCAZAR'S PALACE IN SEVILLE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON:  the face of a young, SPANISH NOBLEMAN, ADRIAN
     DE MOXICA.  Hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his
     lips -- then pauses.

     We discover other people around the magnificent candle-lit
     table.  NOBLE MEN and NOBLE WOMEN.  SANCHEZ.  COLUMBUS.
     QUEEN ISABEL.

     COLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA.  The rest watch him
     with rapt curiosity.  COLUMBUS inhales deeply then, to
     their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.

                         COLUMBUS
               You must not inhale, but simply
               allow the palate to enjoy the flavor
               of the Tobacco...

     He hands the cigar back to MOXICA.  With a casual air,
     MOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death.
     He gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of
     the others.

                         MOXICA
                    (deeply embarrassed)
               And you say this is an Indian vice?
               By God!  I don't see any kind of
               pleasure that would make this a sin.

                         COLUMBUS
               The Indians have no such word, Don
               Moxica.

                         ISABEL
               Do they have such thoughts?

                         COLUMBUS
               They come and go as naked as the day
               God created them...

     ISABEL blushes slightly.

                         COLUMBUS
               They don't see sin in their
               nakedness.  They live according to
               nature, in a never ending summer.
               The islands are covered with trees,
               filled with blossoms and fruits.
               And...

                         SANCHEZ
                    (interrupting)
               Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what
               about gold?

     COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT
     standing just behind his chair.  The SERVANT goes to open
     the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman,
     carrying a casket.  The WOMEN around the table fan
     themselves furiously at the sight.  UTAPAN puts the casket
     down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.

                         COLUMBUS
               These are gifts for Your Majesty.

     ISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold
     inside.  She takes out some of the little golden
     ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask.

     She holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty.

     ISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at
     COLUMBUS.

     The image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the
     ARISTOCRATS to silence.  She speaks from behind the mask.

                         ISABEL
               We are more than gratified.

     The guests laugh obsequiously.  COLUMBUS bows a little --
     looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at
     him, coldly.


     INT.  ROTUNDA - DAY

     A SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination, his
     sword flashing.  He is fighting an adversary we do not
     see, and comments his movements.

                         MASTER
               Si!  Si!  Muy bien!  Excellente!
               (Yes!  Yes!  Good!  Excellent!)

     We discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS.  A
     dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda,
     surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade.

     Out of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes
     his protective canvas padding.  He bows at his teacher,
     who salutes him in return.

     COLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages.
     SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass
     of wine.  Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a
     glass.

                         SANCHEZ
               You defend yourself admirably...

                         COLUMBUS
               ... for a commoner?

     SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass.

                         SANCHEZ
               To your second expedition.

     They drink.  A short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of
     imposing energy, approach them.

                         SANCHEZ
               Don Colon -- Don Alonso de
               Bobadilla.  A man who knows our
               laws.

     BOBADILLA bows.

                         BOBADILLA
               I understand that you will soon be
               appointing Governors for the
               islands?  Is it not so?

                         COLUMBUS
               Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those
               positions have already been taken.

                         BOBADILLA
                    (disappointed)
               May I ask by whom?

                         COLUMBUS
               Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.

     SANCHEZ looks at him in surprise.  BOBADILLA reddens.

                         BOBADILLA
               I trust they are men of quality.

     BOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ.

                         COLUMBUS
               But we do have a lack of notaries.
               You should contact my
               administration.

                         SANCHEZ
                    (amused)
               Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my
               Dear Don Cristobal.

                         COLUMBUS
               Good!  We are also in need of
               judges.  Except there are no
               thieves!

     A grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA.

                         BOBADILLA
                    (to Sanchez)
               I see I was mistaken.  Don Colon
               has no need for my services...

     And he walks off.  SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of
     ham.

                         SANCHEZ
                    (amused)
               You seem to have a special talent
               for making friends.

                         COLUMBUS
               What...?  Do I have so many already?

                         SANCHEZ
                    (seriously)
               To rise so high, in so short a time,
               is a dangerous occupation.
                    (kindly)
               A little hypocrisy goes a long way.


     INT.  ROOM - ADMINISTRATION - DAY

     COLUMBUS with two MEN:  the oldest, around thirty, is a
     strong-looking man.  The youngest, no more than twenty
     five, is thin and fit.  There is obvious tension in the
     room.  These are BARTOLOME and GIACOMO COLON, COLUMBUS'
     brothers.  BARTOLOME is angry, and GIACOMO thoughtful.

                         BARTOLOME
               You might have given us a choice!

                         GIACOMO
               Bartolome is stronger, more capable
               than I will ever be...

                         COLUMBUS
               I need both of you.  What are you
               afraid of?  We are living what we
               always dreamt of.

                         GIACOMO
               You know I never shared those dreams
               with you.

                         COLUMBUS
               Are you saying you refuse to help?

     COLUMBUS looks at them with such pained surprise...

                         BARTOLOME
                    (amused)
               You bastard... you always had your
               own way...

                         COLUMBUS
               Let me show you something.

     He opens the door to a terrace.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  GALLERY - DAY

     The large gallery courtyard is crowded with PEOPLE --
     applicants for the voyage.  As COLUMBUS appears, they all
     press forward, calling out his name, trying to get his
     attention, touching his sleeves as if he were a saint.
     They crowd around COLUMBUS and his BROTHERS.  COLUMBUS
     nods, murmurs vaguely, here and there...

                         COLUMBUS
               Of course... Of course... We'll see
               to it... Yes... Thank you... Soon...
               Soon...

     Fighting their way through, the BOTHERS press their way,
     reaching the other side of the gallery.  We get glimpses
     of the incredible activity down below.  ADMINISTRATORS,
     MILITARIES, MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered
     with documents, plans, maps... preparing the second
     expedition.

     COLUMBUS puts his arms around them.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (indicating the
                    applicants)
               Now -- you tell me.  Who can I
               trust?
                    (almost amused)
               We're brothers!  We must be a House.
               A bloodline!  In this country one
               can't exist alone!  I need you...!
               Both of you!

     He walks then to the balustrade.  The cries from the
     courtyard down below subside... some of the applicants
     begin to look up, aware of his presence.

                         SOLDIER
               Where is the Admiral?  Has anyone
               seen the Admiral?

     Everybody laughs.

                         COLUMBUS
               He is here!  What is it?

     He leans over the balcony.  In the middle of the
     overcrowded courtyard, the SOLDIER who was shouting is
     brandishing a document.

                         MAN
               Admiral!  The horses have arrived.

                         COLUMBUS
               I know.  I saw them!  Who did we
               hire today?

     ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes.

                         ASSISTANT
               Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight
               halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a
               hundred farmers, twenty miners...
               and Doctor Chanca, the royal
               surgeon.

                         COLUMBUS
               The royal surgeon?  Then we can
               count on royal health!

     The whole courtyard bursts out laughing.


     EXT.  ORANGERY - VICEROY'S HOUSE - DAY

     UTAPAN is lying in his hammock.  FERNANDO turns him over.
     UTAPAN falls to the ground.

     COLUMBUS walks beside BEATRIX.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (looking at his son)
               He's growing up!

     BEATRIX smiles, nods.  They walk on.

                         COLUMBUS
               Beatrix, I want to ask you
               something.

                         BEATRIX
                    (with a smile)
               You don't usually ask.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (after a pause)
               I can arrange for the Queen to take
               Fernando and Diego into her service.

     BEATRIX stops in her tracks, looks at him.

                         COLUMBUS
               It is a great honor.  We could not
               hope for anything better.

     BEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at
     FERNANDO.

                         BEATRIX
               For once I wish you weren't right.

     COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her
     closer, they move away.


     EXT.  FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAY

     FERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock.  UTAPAN
     is pushing him gently.  He slowly straightens up to watch
     COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is a
     dilemma.  FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to
     his parents.  The arbor is empty.  FERNANDO becomes
     pensive.

     We become aware of the rustling of the jungle.

                                              SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAY

     FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking
     towards the jungle.  COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS,
     and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN.

     MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back
     and forth across the sand.  All are waiting.

     A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships.  Birds
     scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence,
     complete and ominous.  COLUMBUS stares into the jungle.
     Nothing.  No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from
     the MEN they left behind.

     COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ.

     MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer.

     MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the
     trees.  The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning
     out as they do so, weapons at the ready.


     EXT.  CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAY

     Ruins.  The camp has been burned to ashes.  A strange
     sight:  arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each
     with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the
     flight.

     In silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the
     devastation.

     The ground is littered with coconuts.  Kicking one over
     with his shoe, a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is
     actually a human skull.  The gaping mouth has been filled
     to the brim with gold.

     But of the living, there is no sign.

                         MOXICA
               Is this your new world, Don Colon?

     COLUMBUS looks around in dismay.  A YOUNG NOBLEMAN,
     HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword.

                         GUEVARA
               These animals should be shown what
               savagery can be!

     Other SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word.

                         NOBLEMAN
               Three heads for every life taken.
               No mercy before God!

                         GUEVARA
               No mercy!  Let's find them.

                         COLUMBUS
               No Guevara.  There will be no
               revenge.

     Silence.  Everyone looks at COLUMBUS.

                         MOXICA
               We lost cousins, friends.  We will
               wash this in blood.

                         COLUMBUS
               If you want to keep your head on
               your shoulders, you'll do as I say.

     They are all listening.

                         COLUMBUS
               Moxica, I lost friends too... Thirty
               nine brave men who trusted me.

     He walks among them.

                         COLUMBUS
               You want a war?  Fine.  We are a
               thousand.  They outnumber us by ten!
               Who will you kill?  Which tribe?

                         MOXICA
               We don't need to know.

                         COLUMBUS
               We came here to stay!  To build!
               Not to start a crusade.  In this
               forest, there is enough danger to
               sweep us away in days!  So we will
               be brave and swallow our grief.  And
               in the name of those who died, we
               will accomplish what we came for.


     EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

     MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters
     to the edge of the deserted village and enters the
     village.  UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything
     living.

     All we can hear is the breathing of the horse.  The
     animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously.

     UTAPAN calls out in dialect.

                         UTAPAN
               They here.

     Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other --
     materializing from the jungle.  Shy and scared.

     They stare at this "Centaur" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN
     seem to be one -- a God).

     To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move
     sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing
     the air.  THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one,
     who stands his ground, brandishing his lance.

     UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the
     centaur.  He places his hand onto the shoulder of the
     animal.  The muscles shudder.  THE INDIAN jumps back
     comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe.

     Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle.  More
     INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment.  Now
     more have ventured from the jungle.  The bravest of them
     approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse,
     retreating then touching until they fill the compound.

     At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all
     around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows.
     A moment of tension.

     COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we
     meet before.

                         COLUMBUS
               Ask the Chief what happened to my
               men?

     The CHIEF answers.

                         UTAPAN
               Another tribe made war on them...
               came by sea... took them away...

                         BROTHER BUYL
               God have mercy on their souls...

                         MOXICA
               The monkey is lying.

     A pause.  The SPANIARDS shifting, eager for blood.

                         MOXICA
               We should kill them, Don Colon.

     UTAPAN looks anxiously at COLUMBUS.

                         COLUMBUS
               No...!  you'll do it my way.
                    (to Utapan)
               Tell the Chief we will not harm his
               people, even though we have the
               power to do it.

     UTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF listens in silence.

                         COLUMBUS
               We will work with his people.  We
               want peace.  Ask the Chief if he
               understands?

                         UTAPAN
               He understands.

                         COLUMBUS
               Ask him if he will help.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

     It is raining hard.  COLUMBUS is floundering in the mud,
     supervising a mixed work-force of SPANISH and INDIANS.
     They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a
     watermill.

     Despite COLUMBUS' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the
     wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep.

     Close by, on horseback, MOXICA watches the scene.
     COLUMBUS, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit
     and approaches him.

                         COLUMBUS
               Don Moxica -- we need your horse.

     MOXICA looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.

                         COLUMBUS
               We can't raise the wheel without it.

                         MOXICA
               My horse doesn't work.

     A beat.  COLUMBUS wipes some mud from his eyes.

                         COLUMBUS
               Don Moxica -- we all have to work.

                         MOXICA
               You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not
               my horse.

     He starts to turn away; COLUMBUS grabs hold of the reins.

                         COLUMBUS
               Forgive me, Don Moxica.  But it was
               your horse I was talking about.

     A beat.  MOXICA stares down at an equally determined
     COLUMBUS.  Then, in front of everyone, MOXICA has to
     dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.

                         COLUMBUS
               Thank you, Don Moxica.

     COLUMBUS leads the horse away.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

     Harnessed, the horse pulls, with COLUMBUS and the MEN.
     The wheel is raised into position.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM - DAY

     Water thundering into the new canal.  The huge wheel
     begins to turn.  The MEN cheer and congratulate each
     other.  MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming
     horse, his eyes full of hatred.


     EXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHT

     A wide, high shot of the new "City", dominated by a huge
     wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered
     by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles
     burning in the doorways.  A main square with the
     Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church.

     In the twilight, COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning,
     dirty and tired.


     EXT.  VERANDA OF MOXICA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

     MOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the "veranda", watching the
     MEN return.  MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute.

                         MOXICA
               To the Governor of the Mosquitoes!

     They laugh.  We see the smoke and flames from a fire.
     Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby,
     cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language.

     MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked
     YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more
     wine.  GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously.  MOXICA,
     letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles
     at him.

                         MOXICA
               Do you want her?

     He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her
     properly.  GUEVARA nods.  MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a
     peremptory order, and she disappears back inside.

     GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping
     his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically:

                         GUEVARA
               To the new world, my friend!  To the
               new world!


     INT.  DINING ROOM - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

     In an already Spanish-colonel dining room, COLUMBUS is
     having dinner with his brothers, BARTOLOME and GIACOMO,
     served by an INDIAN WOMAN -- NIMA.  GIACOMO eats with
     gusto.

                         GIACOMO
                    (as Nima pours the
                    wine)
               Nima's a good cook!

                         BARTOLOME
               She's more than that!

     Seeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA
     smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh.

     To cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic
     of the food.

                         GIACOMO
               What is it?

                         COLUMBUS
               Eat!  I'll tell you later.

     As he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh, GIACOMO pauses.

                         GIACOMO
               I'd like to know what I'm eating.

     COLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME.

                         COLUMBUS
               Iguana.

     A look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches
     slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine.
     The BROTHERS laugh again.

                         COLUMBUS
               What wrong with it?  The Indians eat
               it!

                         GIACOMO
               I'm not an Indian.

                         BARTOLOME
               He wishes he were back in the
               seminary.  Priests always eat well.
                    (tasting his wine,
                    grimacing)
               And they have very good cellars.

                         GIACOMO
               Nothing grows here!  Everything rots
               in the ground.  The wheat and vines
               wither before we can harvest them.

                         COLUMBUS
               We've got to learn to live like the
               Indians.
                    (pause)
               Eat your Iguana!

     Reluctantly this time, GIACOMO goes back to his dinner.


     EXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

     They are drinking and smoking cigars.  From the balcony
     they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away.
     GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair.  BARTOLOME sees
     it, and elbows COLUMBUS.  They both smile at their younger
     brother's exhaustion.  Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on
     the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle
     beyond.

                         COLUMBUS
               How much gold have we found?

                         BARTOLOME
               Not enough to justify a single
               shipment.

                         COLUMBUS
               Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere
               but in my imagination.

                         BARTOLOME
               Then let's hope not...
                    (pause)
               What will happen if we can't find
               enough gold?

     They begin to hear the sound of a flute -- a melancholy
     sound.  COLUMBUS looks out over the jungle, and kills a
     mosquito by slapping his arm.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (jokingly)
               Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT.  INFIRMARY - CITY OF ISABEL - NIGHT

     An INDIAN is playing the flute.

     In the gloomy interior of the long hut, in the most
     primitive conditions, DOZENS OF SPANIARDS lie sick.  On a
     segregated part of the room are the INDIANS, several
     coughing.

     They are attended by a doctor, DOCTOR CHANCA, BROTHER
     BUYL, and other NOVICES.

     A NOVICE attends to an INDIAN, gently lifting his head,
     helping him to drink -- there is so little they can do.

     BROTHER BUYL looks down at the body of a SPANIARD, covered
     in open sores.  The NOVICE joins him.

                         BROTHER BUYL
               What kind of disease is this?

                         DOCTOR CHANCA
               I don't know.  It seems almost as if
               we have exchanged diseases with the
               Indians.  They die of our most
               common cold, and we of their plague.

                         BROTHER BUYL
               God forgive us!

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  ROYAL HOSPITAL - COURTYARD - SPAIN - DAY

     A MAN covered with sores is screaming, thrashing in his
     agony.  He is held down, his voice muffled.  ISABEL turns
     away, shocked.

     She is in a ward full of patients, attended by a DOCTOR,
     SANCHEZ and other members of her court.

     The patients are emaciated, their faces and bodies covered
     with virulent sores.  NUNS move between the beds.

                         DOCTOR
               It seems to be caused by intimacy
               with the native women, Your Majesty.

                         ISABEL
               Will he survive?

                         DOCTOR
               No, Your Majesty.  They go mad --
               then they die.  There is nothing we
               can do.

     ISABEL looks around at SANCHEZ, appalled.

                         SANCHEZ
               Every ship returns with a cargo of
               sick and dying.  But with no gold!
               The new world proves expensive, Your
               Majesty.

                         ISABEL
               We weren't expecting immediate
               profits, were we?  We must have
               faith.  We must give time for time.

     SANCHEZ bows in acknowledgement.  But ISABEL, despite her
     words, looks distressed.


     EXT.  MINE - NEW WORLD - DAY

     Excavations carved into a hillside.

     It is a blisteringly hot day.  At the foot of the hill,
     GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning, with MOXICA and
     several CLERKS.  ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in
     line at the table.

     In turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold.  The
     CLERK weighs it on a scale, and notes down each
     contribution.

     MOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster
     with a thonged crop.  An INDIAN approaches the table.  He
     is nervous.  He doesn't produce anything.  The INDIAN
     shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly.

                         TRANSLATOR
               He says he has not found any!

                         MOXICA
               He's lying!

     Again the INDIAN pleads and gesticulates.  MOXICA hits him
     across the face with the thonged crop.  The INDIAN tries
     to run away -- but is held by a SPANISH SOLDIER.

                         MOXICA
               Bring him here!

     The frightened INDIAN is brought back to the table.  One
     of the CLERKS slips away.

                         MOXICA
               Tell him to put his hands on the
               table.  Like this!

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  OTHER SIDE OF THE SITE - DAY

     At the other end of the site, the CLERK sprinting to
     GIACOMO, who was talking to a FOREMASTER.

                         CLERK
               Don Giacomo, you'd better come at
               once!


     EXT.  MINE - DAY

     MOXICA turns, looks back at the long line of INDIANS,
     still passively waiting.

                         MOXICA
               Tell them I want them to watch this!

     The terrified TRANSLATOR speaks to the INDIANS.

                         CLERK
               Don't Moxica!  You can't...

                                             CUT TO:

     GIACOMO and the CLERK running to the scene.

                                             CUT TO:

                         MOXICA
                    (to the clerk)
               I can't?  I can't?

     With a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and
     cuts off the INDIAN'S hands.

     ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  The INDIANS flee, disappearing
     into the jungle.  GIACOMO arrives at this moment.  He
     stares at the dismembered hands in horror.


     INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING

     A tribunal.  Sitting behind a table with his brothers, and
     flanked by his council, COLUMBUS presides.  MOXICA stands
     before them.

                         COLUMBUS
               In one act of brutality, you have
               created chaos.  Tribes who were
               fighting each other are now joining
               forces against us!  All that because
               of your criminal savagery!

                         MOXICA
                    (casually)
               Savagery is what monkeys understand.

                         COLUMBUS
               You'll be held in detention,
               deprived of your privileges and
               possessions.  Until you are returned
               to Spain where you will be judged.
               Have you anything to say?

                         MOXICA
                    (with exquisite
                    insolence)
               You will regret this.

     He strolls to the GUARDS at the back of the room.


     EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

     Everything is quiet on the mine site.

     On the terrace, TWO SOLDIERS are drinking in turn, and
     cracking jokes.  One of them leans against the wooden
     wall.  He laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

     A THIRD SOLDIER is fucking an INDIAN WOMAN against the
     wall.

     EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

     On the terrace, his two COMPANIONS laugh and encourage
     his efforts.

     A whooshing sound.  An arrow embeds itself in the chest of
     the SOLDIER who was leaning against the wall.  He is
     nailed to the wood behind him.

     THE OTHER SOLDIER stares at him, transfixed, until an
     arrow pierces his throat.  He collapses, unable to cry
     out for help.


     INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

     FOUR INDIANS in full warrior outfit, their faces painted,
     burst into the room.  Still busy with the WOMAN, his eyes
     facing the wall, the SOLDIER believes the intruders to be
     his friends.

                         SOLDIER
                    (without stopping)
               You animals!  Can't you wait!

     Discovering the FOUR TERRIFYING FIGURES staring at her,
     the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the
     SOLDIER.  He turns around, jumps off the WOMAN, and starts
     to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his
     trousers.

     THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the
     ground.  THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror.
     TWO INDIANS force his mouth open.  A THIRD ONE kneels and
     starts stuffing it with gold dust.  THE SOLDIER chokes and
     suffocates.

     THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall,
     terrified.  AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings,
     slowly.  She starts sobbing and imploring in her language.
     THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in
     the lower part of her belly.


     EXT.  MINE - DAY

     PAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air.

     Pulling back, we discover:

     A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding
     of the excavations.  Some hands and noses have been
     removed.

     UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS.

     A SOLDIER removes a huge iron nail from a wrist.  One of
     the CRUCIFIED BODIES is gently laid on the ground.  He is
     still alive -- not for long.

     COLUMBUS and BARTOLOME are silent with rage.

                         BARTOLOME
                    (aggressively)
               Moxica is right.  Our ways don't
               work!

     BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN.

                         BARTOLOME
                    (aggressively)
               Can you find them?

     UTAPAN looks distraught -- this is the first time he is
     being asked to do something against his own people.  He
     looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion.

                         COLUMBUS
               You have to find them, Utapan.  Look
               what they did!

                         UTAPAN
               You did the same to your God!

     COLUMBUS is caught short.

                         COLUMBUS
               We have to stop this war.

     UTAPAN nods.  He walks and takes an arrow.  He examines
     it.

                         COLUMBUS
               Do you know them?

     UTAPAN nods, uncomfortable.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  HILL AND VALLEY - DAY

     Around a campfire, two dozen INDIANS are squatting.  They
     are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole
     from the mine.  CLICK!  CLICK!  The INDIANS raise their
     heads.  All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointed
     at them.  Two INDIANS try to run away.  They are shot.

     This sound triggers the SPANIARDS' response.  They start
     shooting at random.  UTAPAN is horrified.  COLUMBUS stands
     up shouting.

                         COLUMBUS
               Stop!  Stop this!

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

     MOXICA and a group of rebels (GUEVARA among them),
     silently approach the entrance of the mansion.

     A GUARD is stabbed and falls on his knees with a cry.


     INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

     MOXICA tears COLUMBUS' plans of the city from the wall.
     On the table, the model of the future city.

     Watched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the
     parchment he has rolled up.  He blows the flames from the
     torch onto the model.  Fire races up and down the streets
     of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel.

     A mad gleam in MOXICA'S eyes...


     EXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - NIGHT

     The half-burnt remains of the Mansion.  COLUMBUS stands in
     the square, looking up at it.  Behind him, his SOLDIERS,
     his BROTHERS and about thirty captured INDIANS.

     GIACOMO walks slowly across the square.  COLUMBUS looks at
     him in disbelief.

                         GIACOMO
                    (through cracked
                    lips)
               Moxica...


     EXT.  RIVER BANK - JUNGLE - DAWN

     COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle,
     looking for the MUTINEERS.

     They reach the river -- scan the far bank.  Nothing.
     COLUMBUS nods.  His MEN start to enter the river, led by a
     HALBERDIER.

     Others follow, wading across, their weapons held above
     their heads.

     A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER.  Without a cry he
     falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the
     current.

     Two more MEN are hit.  One cries out, thrashes around in
     the water, an arrow protruding from his side.  The river
     stained with blood.

     Still no sign of the enemy.  COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless
     start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield...
     others continue to wade across the river.  A MUTINEER is
     shot down from the branches of a tree...

     The first MEN come ashore.  Musket fire.  An exchange of
     arrows.  COLUMBUS is now wading across.  The MAN next to
     him is killed, and carried away by the current.

     Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves.
     There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other
     weapons.  MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own
     are outnumbered and outmatched.  Already, some are
     beginning to surrender.

     In the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls
     himself out of the river:  A MUTINEER lunges at him.
     COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks
     forward into the jungle.  He spots MOXICA at the foot of a
     cliff.


     EXT.  JUNGLE CLIMB TO CLIFF TOP - DAY

     MOXICA starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with
     COLUMBUS following.  The climb through the dense
     undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbing
     in slow motion.


     EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

     MOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth.  He is at the edge
     of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind.  He turns
     frantically, to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him.

     Knowing he is lost, MOXICA regains his natural arrogance.
     He steps backwards towards the edge.

                         MOXICA
               You know what they will say in Spain
               about my death -- don't you?

     He takes another step backwards, as COLUMBUS moves towards
     him.

                         MOXICA
               You are nothing!  You bastards will
               never inherit your titles.  We are
               everything.  We are immortal!

     He smiles, and steps back into space.


     EXT.  ROCKS BELOW CLIFF TOP - DAY

     His body falls, bounces off the rocks below, crashes into
     the water.


     EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

     COLUMBUS stares down as his body is swept away.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - DAY

     CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' expressionless face.

                                             CUT TO:

     A MUTINEER -- his face is white, he is crying and
     trembling.  His arms are tied behind his back.  He is held
     fast, a rope is put around his neck.

     COLUMBUS, sitting not far away beside his BROTHERS, gives
     a signal.

     Drums begin to beat.  BROTHER BUYL looks on impassive.

     A grimace suddenly transform THE YOUNG MAN'S face.  He is
     being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope.  The
     YOUNG MAN'S feet dance frenziedly.  We hear the choking.

     The drums cease.  BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs
     a prayer, deeply distraught.  GIACOMO has covered his
     eyes.

     A wider view shows the bodies of three other ARISTOCRATS
     from the rebellion, attached to chairs affixed to a pole,
     their heads straight, the rope still tight around their
     necks.

     Justice has been done.  The members of the COUNCIL rise in
     silence, COLUMBUS stands up.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  ISABEL - QUAYSIDE - DAY

     CLOSE ON several large wooden cages.  Inside we see the
     INDIANS that COLUMBUS captured.  They are packed together.
     They stare out with vacant eyes.  SOLDIERS guard them.  A
     ship against the pier.  BUYL at his side, COLUMBUS stares
     at the INDIANS.

                         BROTHER BUYL
               I wish to go back with them, Don
               Colon.  I have no desire to remain
               in this godless place.

                         COLUMBUS
               You may do as you please, Brother
               Buyl -- though your departure will
               not help me to make it more Godly.

     BROTHER BUYL looks at him, almost with astonishment.

                         BROTHER BUYL
               You treat Christians equally with
               heathen savages.  You execute
               members of the nobility.  And what
               do you offer in return?

                         COLUMBUS
                    (quietly)
               A new world, Brother Buyl.

                         BROTHER BUYL
               Nobody wants one...!  Only you!

     And he walks away.


     EXT.  ISLAND - EVENING

     Against the livid horizon, three black waterspouts join
     the sky to the sea.  A gust of wind disturbs the roof of
     the jungle.


     INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING

     The wind grows stronger.  Doors bang inside the
     building... a melancholy sound.

     COLUMBUS sits on the balcony with his BROTHERS.  They are
     silent.  After a few moments, COLUMBUS begins to speak
     quietly, almost as if he were speaking to himself.

                         COLUMBUS
               Perhaps hope only exists in the
               journey.  When it begins, everything
               is still possible -- every
               expectation; every dream...

     The BROTHERS do not answer.

                         COLUMBUS
               This is not how I imagined it to be.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  JUNGLE - NEAR ISABEL - NIGHT

     UTAPAN begins to shave his head...


     EXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAWN

     The sky is dark and threatening, the wind even stronger.
     We find COLUMBUS where we left him, but now alone.  He has
     sat here all night.

     Shutters bang violently.

     He looks up -- and sees a few yards from him:  the naked
     FIGURE OF AN INDIAN, his face and body painted, staring at
     him.  COLUMBUS realizes who it is...

                         COLUMBUS
               Utapan!

     UTAPAN is still and silent.  A strange and mysterious
     figure now.

                         COLUMBUS
               Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You
               used to know how to speak to me.

                         UTAPAN
                    (sadly, in his own
                    language)
               You never learned how to speak my
               language.

     UTAPAN is gone.


     EXT.  SQUARE - DAWN

     The wind is whipping the trees now, stronger and stronger.
     Groups of INDIANS look up at the sky.  Then, above the
     sound of the wind, they hear another noise.  Like a
     collective murmur, almost in one voice, the INDIANS
     repeat, over and over.

                         INDIANS
               Urracan... Urracan... Urracan...
               Urracan...
                    (the wrath of God)

     With a loud thunderclap, the storm suddenly breaks.  In a
     few seconds it has risen to violent proportions, and the
     landscape is drenched in torrential rain.  The wind
     doubles its strength... and all hell breaks loose...


     EXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - DAY

     The hurricane is full force.  Trees are being ripped up by
     their roots.  Rivers of mud are washed down from the
     hills, carrying everything away in their paths:  houses,
     carts, equipment, horses...


     EXT.  MINE - ISABEL - DAY

     The mine workings flooded with mud...


     EXT.  APPROACH TO DAM AND WATERFALL - DAY

     COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME and MENDEZ struggle through the teeth
     of the hurricane towards the dam.


     EXT.  DAM - DAY

     Timbers creak and strain.  COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME, MENDEZ and
     a DOZEN other MEN are trying to save the dam.

     Suddenly, frighteningly, the dam begins to crash.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (screaming)
               Let it go!  Let it go!

     The MEN scramble away as the dam wall buckles, and burst
     open.  Water floods over them; a roaring torrent.  From
     the bank, MENDEZ, BARTOLOME and COLUMBUS survey the ruins
     of their dreams.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT.  GOVERNOR'S PALACE - BEDROOM - DAY

     COLUMBUS is stretched out on his bed, in his devastated
     bedroom.  A column of ants is threading its way across the
     floor, each ant carrying a piece of leaf.  Rain falls over
     a table covered with documents.

     COLUMBUS' face is covered in dried mud.

                         SANCHEZ (V.O.)
               He promised us gold but has failed
               to find it.  He subjects the natives
               to violence, provocation and
               injustice.  He sent them to Spain
               against the express wishes of Your
               Majesty...


     INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY

     We are back to the first scene.  In the vast, opulent,
     glittering room, ISABEL listens impassively to the voice
     of SANCHEZ.  Also present, other GRANDEES, representatives
     of the church and state.

                         SANCHEZ
               ... But there is worse.  He ordered
               the execution of five members of the
               nobility...

                         ISABEL
               Is this true, Brother Buyl?

                         BROTHER BUYL
               Yes, Your Majesty.  It is all true.
               I saw it with my own eyes.

     A pause.  ISABEL seems to struggle inwardly with her
     emotions.  SANCHEZ waits, expressionless, but on the point
     of victory.

                         ISABEL
               Then, what do you suggest, Don
               Sanchez?

                         SANCHEZ
               He must be replaced.

                         ISABEL
               And who would you think of, for such
               a task?

     EXT.  QUAYSIDE - ISABEL - DAY

     We see a buckled shoe -- as it rises, it slips into a
     stirrup.  The horse is mounted.  The shoe digs into its
     flank.  The sound of hoofbeats...

                         SANCHEZ (V.O.)
               I am thinking of a man.  A devotee
               to Your Majesties.  A man extremely
               motivated...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  STREETS OF ISABEL - DAY

     FIVE MEN on HORSEBACK, dressed in fashionable clothes,
     canter down what used to be the main street of Isabel.
     Through some has been rebuilt, the effects of the
     hurricane are still visible...

     People look at them curiously.  We see them stop near the
     Governor's mansion.  The MEN dismount and walk into the
     Palace.


     INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY

     One of the MEN in black clothes removes his hat and steps
     forward.  We recognize him as ALONSO DE BOBADILLA, the man
     COLUMBUS humiliated at the rotunda.

     COLUMBUS is sitting at his desk, studying plans with
     GIACOMO.  Some other MEMBERS of the COUNCIL are with them.

                         BOBADILLA
               Don Alonso de Bobadilla.

                         COLUMBUS
               Yes... I remember...

     BOBADILLA turns, gestures to one of the other MEN, who
     comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment, bearing
     the royal seal.

                         BOBADILLA
               My letters of appointment.

                         COLUMBUS
               Appointment to what?

                         BOBADILLA
               Viceroy of the West Indies.

                         COLUMBUS
               Congratulations.  Then I am free to
               search for the mainland.

     BOBADILLA smiles wickedly, happy to give COLUMBUS a low
     blow.

                         BOBADILLA
               Didn't you learn?  The mainland was
               discovered.  Weeks ago.  By another
               Italian.  I forgot his name.

                         A MAN IN BLACK
               Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.

     COLUMBUS pales.  Then...

                         COLUMBUS
               How far from here?

                         BOBADILLA
               I am not a seaman.  But I heard it
               is no more than a week at sea.  I
               hope you are not too disappointed.

                         COLUMBUS
               How could I be?  The mainland has
               been found.  Exactly as I said it
               would.

                         BOBADILLA
               I am afraid this is not the worst
               news.

     INT.  CELL - SEVILLE PRISON - DAY

     All is dark.  We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he
     lies on the hard bed.  He is sweating heavily; his beard
     is filthy and matted, like his hair.  He looks feverish.

     A key turns in the lock.

     The JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN.
     COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare
     at them.  His eyes are reddened with infection at the
     corners.  The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light.

                         FERNANDO
                    (quietly)
               Father?

     Unable to believe it, COLUMBUS slowly sits up.

                         COLUMBUS
               Fernando...!  My God...!

     He laughs, overcome with joy.  Embraces DIEGO.

                         COLUMBUS
               A man!  Diego, how did this happen?

                         DIEGO
               Santangel is going to see the Queen.
               We are going to get you out of here.

                         COLUMBUS
               Good!  I have to go back!

     DIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at
     COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his
     eyes rimmed with dried mucus.

                         DIEGO
               Go back?

     There's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice.  He walks
     over to the table.  The candlelight illuminates maps,
     charts, drawings, figures...

                         COLUMBUS
               I have to explore the mainland.

                         FERNANDO
               This time with me!

     COLUMBUS laughs and DIEGO looks at them both in
     astonishment.

                         DIEGO
               In your present state it is madness,
               Father!

     FERNANDO glances at DIEGO.

                         FERNANDO
               Nobody is forcing you to come with
               us.

     DIEGO is hurt.

                         DIEGO
               I can't go anyway.

     A pause.

                         FERNANDO
               She's very beautiful!  The Queen has
               very good taste.  Diego is getting
               married.

     DIEGO seems saddened by his brother's attitude.  Once
     again DIEGO feels like the outsider.

     COLUMBUS hugs him.

                         COLUMBUS
               I am happy for you, Diego.


     INT.  ALHAMBRA - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY

     Like Lucifer and Gabriel, SANTANGEL and SANCHEZ sit on
     either side of ISABEL.

                         SANTANGEL
               Granted his faults.  Yes, a hundred
               times!  But the man is still
               remarkable.

     ISABEL looks at him, then at SANCHEZ, MOVED BUT CLEARLY
     UNDECIDED.  SANTANGEL presses his point.

                         SANTANGEL
               All he asks is a chance to explore
               this... mainland.

                         SANCHEZ
               It does not belong to him.

                         SANTANGEL
                    (quietly)
               In a way, it does, Don Sanchez.
                    (to the Queen)
               I beg Your Majesty to receive him.
               To hear him... He will make no more
               demands.  He has changed.  He is
               penitent.

                         SANCHEZ
               Penitent...?  He is suing us for
               breach of contract!

                         ISABEL
               Is he?

     She starts to laugh.

                         ISABEL
               Really?

     SANTANGEL tries to stop himself laughing.


     INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY

     COLUMBUS is shown into the room.  ISABEL is waiting for
     him.

     He drops to his knees before her.  This time she walks
     towards him, clearly moved by his white-hair, and other
     signs of physical deterioration.

     Her hand hovers over his head, as if it means to console
     him.  Her hand is dying to comfort.  But instead, she
     offers her hand for him to kiss.

                         ISABEL
               Rise... Please...

     COLUMBUS gets slowly to his feet -- but his eyes, as they
     meet hers, are as clear as before.  ISABEL smiles with
     relief to see it.  He looks back at her.

                         COLUMBUS
               Now I do look older than you.

     She smiles -- then again, tries to restrain it, and keeps
     her dignity.

                         ISABEL
               We have decided to allow you to
               undertake another voyage to the new
               world...

     COLUMBUS starts to interrupt; she stops him with a
     gesture.

                         ISABEL
               But without your brothers.  Nor are
               you to return to Santo Domingo or
               any of the other colonies.  You may
               explore the continent.

                         COLUMBUS
               Thank you.

                         ISABEL
               There is one thing I'd like to
               understand... Why do you want to go
               back, after all this?

                         COLUMBUS
               Your Majesty -- some men are content
               to read about things.  I must see
               them with my own eyes.  I cannot be
               other than I am.

     She almost bursts out laughing -- only pauses, turns
     slightly, then goes out.


     INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - ROOM NEXT TO THRONE ROOM - DAY

     SANCHEZ is standing alone in the next room; he has
     obviously been listening.  He looks at her.

                         ISABEL
               I know, I should not tolerate his
               impertinence.

                         SANCHEZ
               Then why?

                         ISABEL
               Because he is not afraid of me.


     INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY

     SANCHEZ, in another direction, along a corridor, towards
     his office.  As he reaches a corner with a wide window, a
     hand seizes him.  COLUMBUS.

                         SANCHEZ
               All I have to do is call the guards.

                         COLUMBUS
               Call them.

     SANCHEZ looks at him -- and doesn't call.  COLUMBUS lets
     go of him.

                         SANCHEZ
               I am not afraid of you.  You are
               nothing but a dreamer.

                         COLUMBUS
               Look out of that window.

     Surprised, SANCHEZ nevertheless turns, looks out.

                         COLUMBUS
               What do you see?

                         SANCHEZ
               Roofs... towers, palaces...
               spires...

                         COLUMBUS
               All of them created by people like
               me.

     SANCHEZ turns round again to face him.

                         COLUMBUS
               No matter how long you live,
               Sanchez, there's something that will
               never change between us.  I did it!
               You didn't!

     COLUMBUS turns abruptly and walks away, vanishing down the
     echoing corridor.


     EXT.  COLUMBUS' MANOR HOUSE - DAY

     COLUMBUS dismounts in the courtyard.  Everything seems
     deserted.  There's no one about, no sign of life...


     INT.  MANOR HOUSE - DAY

     COLUMBUS walks slowly through the great rooms.  There is
     nothing left:  no furniture, rugs, pictures... nothing.

     He turns, sees BEATRIX standing in a doorway, looking back
     at him.  They are both moved.

                         COLUMBUS
               God... you're so beautiful!  I can't
               believe no other man has ever taken
               you away from me...

                         BEATRIX
               They tried... but I didn't let them.

     She smiles.  They don't dare to touch.  BEATRIX looks
     round the empty room.

                         BEATRIX
               They took everything...

                         COLUMBUS
                    (looking at her)
               Not everything... Do you think I
               care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches
               don't make a man rich, they only
               make him busier...

     They laugh.  There's a pause.

                         COLUMBUS
               God, how much I've missed you!

     And they throw themselves into each other's arms.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT.  DINING ROOM - MANOR HOUSE - EVENING

     All that has been left is a simple table and one chair.
     They are having supper by candlelight in the vast, empty
     room, though the candles throw a warm, sensuous glow on
     the figs and hams and wine... and on their faces, as
     BEATRIX sits on his lap.

                         SANTANGEL (O.S.)
               One chair.  One table.  What more
               can a man expect, when he tries to
               sue the Crown?

     They laugh.  With only a little embarrassment, BEATRIX
     gets off COLUMBUS' knee.  SANTANGEL comes forward, and
     COLUMBUS embraces him like an old friend.  BEATRIX goes to
     the kitchen.

                         COLUMBUS
               I owe you everything, Santangel...
               but as you see, I can't repay you.

                         SANTANGEL
               On the contrary.  It is I who owe
               you everything.  Through you, I have
               been an adventurer, an explorer!
               It's true I shall never see the new
               world... but it's here...
                    (he points to his
                    head)
               And here...
                    (pointing to his
                    heart)

     COLUMBUS smiles.  BEATRIX returns with a plate and glass
     for SANTANGEL.

                         SANTANGEL
               What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a
               discoverer, a man of imagination...
               not a politician.  You weren't meant
               to govern -- You cannot be all
               things to all men.

     He takes the wine BEATRIX offers, and raises his glass.

                         SANTANGEL
               I wish you could have compromised.
               It would have made your life
               easier...

                         COLUMBUS
               But as least we haven't been bored,
               have we?

     They all laugh, and drink.


     EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - FERNANDO'S POV - NIGHT

     Night on the open sea -- the moon shines on the waves and
     we hear the creaking of ropes and timbers -- the
     loneliness and mystery of the night passage.

                         SAILOR'S VOICE
               West... southwest, Captain Mendez...

                         MENDEZ (O.S.)
               Steady as she goes...

     COLUMBUS walks over to FERNANDO, who is leaning against
     the rail.  He is smoking a cigar... as the smoke blows
     over FERNANDO'S face, FERNANDO wretches... It's clear he's
     feeling seasick, trying to control it.

     COLUMBUS leans against the rail next to him, staring out
     at the darkness.  Then looks at his SON again.  FERNANDO
     won't give in to the sickness, but COLUMBUS knows he'd
     feel better if he did.

                         COLUMBUS
               How are you feeling, Fernando?

                         FERNANDO
                    (in a strangled
                    voice)
               Not bad.

     COLUMBUS nods meditatively, puffs out some smoke.
     FERNANDO winces, gags slightly.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (almost casually)
               You know what I always used to do?

     FERNANDO shakes his head.

                         COLUMBUS
               Swallow a piece of pork fat on a
               string.  It always worked.

     At the thought of the pork fat, FERNANDO jerks his head
     over the side, and vomits copiously.  COLUMBUS smiles,
     pats him on the back.


     EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - DAY

     As it plows through heavy seas.  COLUMBUS, a coat wrapped
     around him, is sitting on a chair topside, directing
     operations despite an obvious fever.

     Suddenly a cry from the mast head:

                         SAILOR (O.S.)
               Tierra...!  Tierra!

     SAILORS and FERNANDO rush to the side of the ship, peering
     through the spray.  FERNANDO wipes his eyes, and then he
     sees it:  there in the distance, a speck of land.

     FERNANDO and his FATHER stand together, watching the low
     cloud formation sitting on the horizon.

                         COLUMBUS
               The mainland...

     FERNANDO looks excited.  Discreetly, COLUMBUS watches his
     SON, enjoying his happiness.


     EXT.  PANAMA (SURREAL IMAGES) - DAY

     A most wonderful and surreal image.  A heavy mist lies
     over the forest.  We move above it slowly.

     A FIGURE emerges from the mist.  At first only a
     silhouette -- then, slowly, a golden figure... an INDIAN,
     covered in gold... gold artifacts, golden paste on his
     body.

     The GOLDEN FIGURE turns, and points, into an unknown
     distance.


     EXT.  TREEHOUSE - DAY

     From the INDIAN treehouse, COLUMBUS, FERNANDO, MENDEZ and
     several INDIANS are gazing west over a necklace of
     magnificent lakes.

     The INDIANS point and talk gently.  FERNANDO has never
     seen anything so fresh, so beautiful.


     EXT.  CAMP - SUNSET

     A magnificent sunset.  A fire is burning, food cooking.
     COLUMBUS looks over his maps, trying to figure out where
     they are.  We see the outline of the continent of Asia.
     An OLD INDIAN squats beside him, silent, also looking at
     the map.  Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a
     piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the
     map.  Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the
     Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus.  MENDEZ and FERNANDO
     gather round.  COLUMBUS watches the OLD INDIAN with
     initial puzzlement, then growing excitement.

                         MENDEZ
               What's he doing?

                         COLUMBUS
               He's drawing an isthmus... He's
               saying we're on an isthmus.

                         MENDEZ
               We can't be.

     FERNANDO is still confused.  The OLD INDIAN continues to
     sketch, talking quietly all the time.  An INDIAN
     TRANSLATOR listens.

                         COLUMBUS
               Tell me what he's saying.

                         TRANSLATOR
               He says -- water on the other side.

                         COLUMBUS
               Ask him if he means a lake.  A big
               lake.

     The TRANSLATOR asks.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head,
     laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes,
     emphatically.

                         TRANSLATOR
               No.  Says those are lakes.  Water on
               other side big -- as wide as here.
               Above and below, much land.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (stunned)
               An ocean...?  He's says it's an
               ocean?

                         FERNANDO
               I don't understand.

     COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain.  The
     INDIANS laugh.

     Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on
     the map, for his son.

                         COLUMBUS
               Here is Europe... and over here, the
               continent of Asia.  But there's
               something in between!  Another
               continent!  We've found... another
               continent!

     FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER.  COLUMBUS
     looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.

                         FERNANDO
               Father...

                         COLUMBUS
               There must be a passage to that
               other ocean.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT.  SHIP - COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT

     COLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk.  He shivers
     violently.  FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes
     his eyes.

     Suddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters.

                         TRANSLATOR
               I help.

     A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER.
     The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of
     leaves from a pouch.  He chews the leaves himself for a
     moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens
     COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging
     COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands.

     COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep.


     EXT.  MOONLIT VISION OF VAST LAND MASS - NIGHT

     We see things from COLUMBUS' hallucination.  We are
     plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating,
     giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer
     and closer...

     COLUMBUS wakes up with a jolt.  Everything is silent.
     COLUMBUS walks outside.


     EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

     COLUMBUS' fever has subsided.  He raises his head and
     stares at the mainland passing in the night.  He smiles.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  JUNGLE AND BAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT - DAY

     The roof of the jungle, the bay beyond, the caravel at
     anchor.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  RIVER - DAY

     Two canoes going upstream, deeper and deeper into the
     jungle.


     EXT.  JUNGLE AND VILLAGE - DAY

     Smoke rises lazily above the trees.

                                             CUT TO:

     The boats reaching the bank.  THE FIRST HUTS of a village.
     THE SOLDIERS spread out into the empty village.

     FERNANDO, COLUMBUS and MENDEZ preceded by TWO ARMED
     SOLDIERS enter one of the huts.  The remains of a meal is
     still warm in bowls on the matted floor.

     A famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and
     devours its contents:  some kind of stew.  Stepping back
     accidentally, FERNANDO bumps into a large earthen jar
     behind him.  It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains
     of meat marinating in liquid.  There is something
     disturbing about the appearance of the content.

                         FERNANDO
               Oh my God...

     The remains of human beings.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (approaching)
               What is...?

     He stares at the remains, stunned.  THE SOLDIER stops
     chewing.  He drops the half-empty bowl he was still
     holding.  He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep
     in the back of his throat, and vomits.

                         SOLDIER
               Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de
               Dios...
               (Oh Virgin Mary... Oh Mother of
                God...)

     But as he vomits and cries, he notices:

     A HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass.
     Disturbed flies rise in clouds.

                         SOLDIER
               Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos...
               (Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints...)

                                             CUT TO:

     COLUMBUS and the SPANIARDS meet in the center of the
     village.  All have made the same horrific discovery.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (urgently)
               Out!  Get out!

     THE SPANIARDS back out of the village, crossbows pointed
     at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle.

     They are running through the dense forest for the river
     bank.

     The CANNIBALS materialize among the trees, running
     alongside.  Bounding, skipping, frightening FIGURES, their
     brutal faces painted in black.  They release arrows at the
     running SOLDIERS.  A SOLDIER stops, kneels to the ground,
     fires his crossbow and kills one of the CANNIBALS... but
     he is pierced by a spear.  TWO CANNIBALS drag him and cut
     his throat to finish him.

     ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE -- CRIES AND CONFUSION, SPANIARDS
     and CANNIBALS moving in hand to hand combat.

     A CANNIBAL comes sprinting at FERNANDO, brandishing his
     lance.

     COLUMBUS jumps on the man, and plants a knife in his
     abdomen.  Blinded in sweat, he stabs the CANNIBAL, who
     collapses.  Frenzied, COLUMBUS stabs over and over again.

     He stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood.
     Shocked by his own fury, he raises his hand and stares at
     it.

     A GIANT BLACK BUTTERFLY alights gently on his bloody
     fingers, COLUMBUS staring fascinated at its palpitating
     wings.  FERNANDO, screaming at his FATHER, drags him to
     his feet.  They run...

                                             CUT TO:

     THE SPANIARDS, COLUMBUS, MENDEZ, FERNANDO... all running
     hard to the boat.  ARROWS whistle around them as they leap
     into the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them
     into the current.

     SOME CANNIBALS still follow them along the riverbank.  But
     the canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind.


     EXT.  SHIP AT SEA - DAY

     Endless seascape, the caravel plowing.


     EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - DAY

     FERNANDO is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a
     blanket.  He seems in a state of shock:  he is pale and
     shaking.  As COLUMBUS goes and sits near his son, he hands
     him a flask of alcohol.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (kindly)
               Take it.  Come on.  Drink.

     As COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO
     notices that his hands are shaking too.  His FATHER'S
     forehead is dripping with sweat.

     FERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces.  He drinks again and
     hands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same.
     FERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers.
     COLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.

                         COLUMBUS
               I... I have to see Mendez.

     Then, with sudden anger.

                         COLUMBUS
               Your brother was right.  I should
               have never taken you with me.  I'll
               never forgive myself.  Never!

     He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the
     rail.  He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain,
     as if they were burning.  FERNANDO scrambles to his feet
     and rushes to him.  COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed
     somewhere -- fever is eating him up.

                         COLUMBUS
               Will you ever forgive me?

     FERNANDO turns around for help.

                         COLUMBUS
               Captain Mendez!


     INT.  SHIP'S CABIN - DAY

     COLUMBUS is lying on his couch.  FERNANDO is bathing his
     eyes, sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in
     them.  COLUMBUS is drenched in sweat.

                                             CUT TO:

     FERNANDO is writing under his FATHER'S dictation.

                         COLUMBUS
               I came to Your Highness with honest
               purpose and sincere zeal.  I did not
               undertake these voyages for honor or
               wealth -- that is certain.  After
               years of service to the Crown, I do
               not have a roof to put over my
               head... Your Majesty allowed me to
               explore the continent, believed to
               be Asia.  I now believe that it is
               an new Land, of unknown proportions
               and wealth... Life has more
               imagination than we carry in our
               dreams...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  ALCAZAR PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

     The DUENA, sitting beside ISABEL, quietly continues to
     read COLUMBUS' letter aloud.

                         DUENA
               "I should be judged as a Seaman who
               by Divine Will discovered a New
               World, and thereby placed it under
               the sovereignty of Your Majesties.
               I humbly beseech Your Majesties that
               if it pleases God to remove me
               hence, you will help the name of
               Columbus to be remembered with
               honor... Weep for me, whoever has
               charity, truth and justice."

     She stops reading.  ISABEL turns her face away.


     INT.  UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

     An ivory-sculptured hand -- the end of the back scratcher
     belonging to AROJAZ -- indicates a line across a large
     globe:  the route between Europe and America.

                         AROJAZ (O.S.)
               The sunset route to the new
               continent is now well-established...

     We see a large amphitheater, filled with PEOPLE attending
     a lecture of "Nova Geographica" -- the new geography.

     AROJAZ stands in front of the assembly.  Facing him,
     enthroned, is KING FERDINAND, surrounded by COURTIERS,
     including SANCHEZ.

     We slowly move across the arena, passing attentive faces.

                         AROJAZ
               ... West by south west for 750
               leagues to Santo Domingo.  From
               there, west north west, leaving San
               Juan to the north, reaching the
               island of Hispanola on the northern
               cape of San Raphael... Then onto the
               mainland, at the Cape called Gracias
               a Dios...

     We continue to rise up the tiers of seats...

                         AROJAZ
               Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace --
               has confirmed for all humanity the
               existence of an unknown continent...
               Tierra Incognita...

     On a highest tier, we stop on the face of CHRISTOPHER
     COLUMBUS, listening impassively.

                         AROJAZ
               ... This continent was first
               discovered by a sailor commissioned
               by your Majesty...

     CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' eyes.

                         AROJAZ
               His name... Amerigo Vespucci...

     On COLUMBUS.


     EXT.  UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

     Around the KING, on horseback, surrounded by the KNIGHTS,
     a CROWD is kept back by SOLDIERS.  AROJAZ is mounting his
     horse.  SANCHEZ is waiting for him.

     COLUMBUS stands among the students at the back of the
     CROWD.

                                             CUT TO:

     AROJAZ rides next to SANCHEZ.  AROJAZ suddenly spots
     COLUMBUS in the crowd, as they move off.

                         AROJAZ
               My God...!  I thought he was dead.

     They pass close enough to touch COLUMBUS.  But he does not
     see them.

                         SANCHEZ
               You can see for yourself.

                         AROJAZ
               What a tragedy... what a waste of a
               life...

                         SANCHEZ
               A waste...?  Let me tell you
               something, Arojaz.  If your name, or
               mine, is ever remembered -- it will
               only be because of his.

     AROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise -- then cranes his
     neck round, and looks back at COLUMBUS -- now a FACE IN
     THE CROWD.


     EXT.  LA RABIDA MONASTERY - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY

     ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a very old man now, is taking a
     siesta next to his grapes.  He is sitting in a simple
     armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers.

     The presence of someone wakes him.  After a moment, he
     recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles.  Both MEN are very moved.

                         MARCHENA
               I suppose we're both old men now.

                         COLUMBUS
               You'll always be older than me,
               Father.

     They laugh.  COLUMBUS sits down.  Bees drone lazily in the
     sunlight.

                         COLUMBUS
               Have you ever forgiven me?

     MARCHENA nods his head.

                         MARCHENA
               Yes.  I forgave you a long time ago.
               You see, I was proud of you.  You
               were like a willful child.  You
               wouldn't accept what others told
               you.  You had to find things out for
               yourself, hurting yourself -- and
               others -- in the process.

     MARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly.

                         MARCHENA
               Do you remember when you said that
               people talk about the world, but
               never leave their gardens.

     COLUMBUS nods.

                         MARCHENA
               More than ever I wonder what it is
               we do achieve by leaving our
               gardens... The world changes -- and
               yet it seems the same.  We find new
               worlds, but fill them with the same
               people...

     He pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently.
     MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up
     towards the sun.

                         COLUMBUS
               I have to disagree.

                         MARCHENA
               I knew you would.

                         COLUMBUS
               New worlds create new people.

                         MARCHENA
               Oh?  So you are a new man?

                         COLUMBUS
               I don't know... I have the
               impression that I didn't change that
               much.  I still can't accept the
               world as it is!

     MARCHENA starts laughing.

                         MARCHENA
               God bless you, and those like you!

     They both laugh.


     EXT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE BALCONY - EVENING

     FERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining
     documents and letters.  COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl
     around his legs.  He looks even older now, with his mass
     of pure white hair.

     BEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a
     decanter of water.  She places it on a small table near
     COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder.

     As she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her
     back.

                         COLUMBUS
               Can't you stay with us a little?

                         BEATRIX
               I am busy inside.

     He smiles.  She looks at him smiling, intrigued.

                         BEATRIX
               What is it, now?  Tell me...

                         COLUMBUS
               I can't keep my eyes off you.  I
               would like to catch up with all the
               moments I didn't spend with you.

     FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and
     slightly embarrassed.  COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake
     air of reproach.

                         COLUMBUS
               What are you listening to?

                         FERNANDO
               I am not listening, Father.  But I
               can't help hearing.

     FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.

                         FERNANDO
               It's Diego... He is at the Court,
               with Santangel... He says they hope
               to get your privileges restored...
               And maybe the house.

     COLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very
     little importance to him now.

                         COLUMBUS
               But how is he?  And Dona Maria?

     FERNANDO continues to read.

                         FERNANDO
               Fine, it seems.  Diego is thinking
               of starting a pearl trade, in Santo
               Domingo... He says he received many
               letters for you.  Some of your men,
               mostly.

     He opens one of them, glances at it.

                         FERNANDO
               This one is from Mendez!

     COLUMBUS' eyes brighten with joy.

                         COLUMBUS
               What does he say?

                         FERNANDO
               He asks when he can come to visit
               you.  He left his address.

                         COLUMBUS
                    (smiling)
               He never had one... except aboard my
               ships!

     FERNANDO laughs -- then, suddenly serious.

                         FERNANDO
               I want you to tell me everything you
               remember, Father.  From the
               beginning.  Everything.

                         COLUMBUS
               Really?
                    (pause)
               God... I wouldn't know where to
               start... and yet...

                         FERNANDO
               Tell me the first thing that comes
               to your mind.

     COLUMBUS sighs, and leans back on his chair.  His eyes are
     fixed somewhere, searching.  Then, almost in a murmur.

                         COLUMBUS
               I remember...

     We see the page.  FERNANDO writes: ... I REMEMBER...

     A drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the
     words.

     FERNANDO is waiting.

                                             CUT TO:

     COLUMBUS' eyes.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT.  BEACH AND JUNGLE - FIRST LANDING - DAY

     A MOVING IMAGE, as seen from the rolling deck of a ship.
     We see:

     A majestic forest, resting on a slash of white sand, and
     deep blue sea...

                                             MUSIC BEGINS:

     THE LONE SILHOUETTE of an INDIAN emerges from the dense
     foliage.  He runs down the beach towards the surf.  He
     stops and seems to be staring at us.

     These words appear on the screen:

               THE BIOGRAPHY FERNANDO WROTE ABOUT
               HIS FATHER WAS FOUND BY CHANCE IN
               VENICE.  ITS PUBLICATION IN 1571
               CONTRIBUTED TO RESTORING THE NAME OF
               CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, WHICH HAD BEEN
               FORGOTTEN.

               IN 1511 DIEGO COLUMBUS BECAME
               GOVERNOR OF SANTO DOMINGO.

               COLUMBUS RESTS IN THE CATHEDRAL OF
               SEVILLE, IN ANDALUSIA.

     END AND CREDITS.
