FADE IN:

INT. SHACK - DAY

Darkness. Quiet. The CAMERA MOVES through the gloom of the 
small, dirty, wooden hut, past a broken table, over a well-
worn saddle lying on the floor. Now, a pair of boots standing 
empty by the rotting remains of a rough-hewn bunk, up to a 
holstered gun hung on the corner of the bed. The still shape 
of a man, a bedroll his only protection from the splintery 
planks. This is EMMETT, fast asleep.

The door of the shack bursts inward as a Gunman crashes in. 
For a moment he is silhouetted against the blinding morning 
light, his two six-guns blasting even before the door has 
bounced shut behind him, returning the hut to darkness.

Emmett's holster, the gun gone.

The gun is here in Emmett's hand, erupting now with three 
quick explosions. The intruder flies against the far wall of 
the hut and lands on the floor dead. From outside, two bullets 
pierce the plank wall behind Emmett, light streaming through 
in .45 calibre shafts.

Emmett is out of the bunk and on the floor. He fires once 
over the bunk. In the moment of quiet that follows, we hear 
running FOOTSTEPS outside the hut. Emmett follows their 
progress with the point of his gun, but holds his fire. 
Suddenly a shotgun blasts a large hole in the roof of the 
shack, and the table disintegrates in a new column of light.

Emmett glances upward, but quickly returns his attention to 
the side walls, trying to follow that gunman. Now more fire 
comes from there and more footsteps. Another shotgun blast 
showers Emmett with debris, but he ignores it, concentrating 
on the walls.

WHAT HE SEES. The Man Outside moves quickly past a crack in 
the wall, momentarily revealing his spot by blocking the 
light. Emmett fires once ahead of him, stopping his progress 
and forcing him back to the crack. Emmett fires his last 
shot there, and the man outside goes down hard.

The shotgun rips another jagged hole in the ceiling and blows 
a crater in the dirt by Emmett's foot. The shape of a man 
flashes across the new hole. Emmett looks across the room at 
the top bunk, where the barrel of his Winchester protrudes a 
few inches from the bare planks. Emmett throws his empty six-
gun noisily into the far corner of the hut. Instantly the 
man on the roof blasts away in that direction.

Emmett dives for the bunk. With the tips of his fingers, he 
pulls hard on the muzzle. The Winchester flips full circle 
into the air as the bunk behind it is shredded from above.

With an odd kind of inevitability, as though seeking its 
rightful place, the Winchester arcs into a shaft of light, 
where it is met by Emmett's steady, waiting hands. Before it 
has even settled, he has cocked and fired twice through a 
hole in the roof. Emmett stops and lowers the carbine. The 
Man on the Roof falls spread-eagled through the weakened 
ceiling. Debris and sunlight shower his lifeless form.

Emmett listens, moves silently to the door, and opens it 
carefully. WE FOLLOW him outside, out into the bright 
sunlight, into the awesome promise of the American West.

EXT. SHACK - DAY

Emmett moves warily around the isolated shack. There are no 
more attackers. He looks off into the distance. Two riderless 
horses, galloping away, are the only moving things in the 
empty landscape. A third saddled horse, a pinto, stands 
nervously near Emmett's horse, which is tied to a stake.

Emmett walks to the body of the Man Outside and looks down 
at him. He doesn't know him. He moves to the pinto and calms 
it. He examines the distinctive brand on its flank, a circle 
with two wavy lines beneath it. Emmett is clearly mystified. 
He rests his arms on the saddle and stares after the 
retreating horses.

THE MAIN TITLE BEGINS.

EXT. EMMETT RIDES (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY/NIGHT

Emmett travels, the saddled pinto in tow. He moves from high 
mountain terrain down-country, through meadow and canyon. He 
makes night camp near a rushing stream. The land flattens as 
he approaches the desert. The sun beats at him as he dismounts 
at the edge of a white-hot plain. He takes a short pull from 
his canteen and squints off across the flat, empty space. 
All he can see ahead is blinding sand and blue sky.

THE MAIN TITLE ENDS.

EXT. DESERT (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY

Emmett is now surrounded by the white blankness, moving slowly 
under the broiling sun.

He stops his walking horses and squints out into the distance, 
seeing something. We see it too, but just barely: a distant, 
horizontal smudge on the glaring sand.

Emmett reaches the smudge. It is a man, barefoot and dressed 
only in longjohns, his head propped on a rock, eyes closed. 
The man's skin is burned red and beginning to blister, his 
lips parched. Yet there is a curious ease to his repose. If 
he has lain down here to die, he has done it in peace. This 
is PADEN.

Emmett lifts Paden's head and puts the canteen to his lips. 
Paden's eyes struggle to open in the glare. He takes a few 
sips of the water. His lips crack with a slight smile at the 
taste. He looks up at Emmett, takes another sip, and tries 
to speak. Emmett must lean down to hear his raspy whisper as 
he tries again.

			PADEN
	Pleased to meet you.

EXT. NIGHT CAMP - DESERT - NIGHT

The terrain here is more hospitable. Paden, wrapped snugly 
in a blanket, lies with his head against the saddle from the 
pinto. Emmett is preparing his bedroll across the fire.

			EMMETT
	Two of the horses ran off, but that 
	pinto you're riding hung around.

			PADEN
	You got no idea what they were after?

Emmett shakes his head "no".

			PADEN
	Offend anybody lately?

			EMMETT
	Not for five years.

Paden understands.

			PADEN
	Jefferson City?

			EMMETT
	No, Leavenworth.

			PADEN
	I've never been in there. They just 
	jumped you out of the blue?

			EMMETT
	I had to get up anyway.

			PADEN
		(smiles)
	Me, I'm riding along, minding my own 
	business. Four cowboys come by and 
	we decide to ride together for a 
	while, friendly as can be. I always 
	figure you might as well approach 
	life like everybody's your friend or 
	nobody is... don't make much 
	difference. We get out in the middle 
	of that frying pan and suddenly 
	everybody's pointing their gun but 
	me. I guess they admired my horse. 
	She's a great one, a sweet little 
	bay.

			EMMETT
	Looks like that's not all they 
	admired.

			PADEN
	Yup. The whole rig. I don't care 
	much about the rest, but I surely 
	will miss that bay. Least they didn't 
	kill me. That was right considerate, 
	I thought. They were laughing when 
	they left me. Thought it was real 
	funny. I walked for a little while 
	but there was no use, so I gave it 
	up. Figured it was just bad luck.

Emmett comes over and fills Paden's coffee cup.

			EMMETT
	Looks like those boys are headed 
	south, so they weren't the same ones 
	that jumped me. Which way you going?

			PADEN
	Where's the pinto going?

			EMMETT
	I gotta stop by Turley and meet a 
	guy.

			PADEN
	Where's Turley?

			EMMETT
	South of here, past Chimayo.

			PADEN
	Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. 
	Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.

			EMMETT
	Yeah, maybe a bath.

Emmett settles down at his saddle and pulls a blanket over 
himself. Paden glances at the rifle in its scabbard on the 
pinto's saddle by his head.

			PADEN
	Is this loaded?

Emmett nods and closes his eyes. Paden smiles at the implied 
trust and settles down himself.

EXT. APPROACHING CHIMAYO - DAY

Emmett and Paden, who is still clad only in longjohns, ride 
toward the low, adobe settlement of Chimayo.

EXT. ENTERING CHIMAYO - DAY

Emmett and Paden enter the town past a cluster of teepees. 
Three Cavalry troopers ride past them.

EXT. STREET - CHIMAYO - DAY

The little settlement is the center of civilization for miles 
around. The U. S. Cavalry maintains an outpost here, and 
there are many soldiers on the street. Emmett and Paden pull 
up to the general store. Paden dismounts and hands his reins 
to Emmett. Passersby look with curiosity at the undressed 
Paden.

			EMMETT
	I'll get these horses tended.

Paden nods and looks doubtfully at the store. He scratches 
himself. Emmett produces some money and flips Paden a coin. 
Paden nods.

			PADEN
	I'm good for it.

Emmett rides up the street, leading the pinto. Paden starts 
toward the store and nearly collides with a shocked woman, 
who covers the eyes of the little girl with her and crosses 
the street. Paden gives an apologetic tip to his non-existent 
hat as he watches them go. Before he can turn back to the 
store, his eye is caught by something up the street. He reacts 
big.

WHAT HE SEES. His horse, a good-looking bay. And, dawdling 
his way out of a saloon, a disreputable-looking Cowboy.

Paden's hand slaps his side, where his gun should be. He 
grimaces and looks around desperately, then hurries into the 
store.

INT. STORE - DAY

The lone CLERK is showing a woman customer a bolt of cloth 
at the back of the store. Paden hurries in and makes a bee-
line to the display case holding handguns and ammo. He spots 
something he likes and taps the glass impatiently. The Clerk 
reacts with distaste to Paden's appearance.

			PADEN
	Excuse me, there --

			CLERK
	I'll be with you in a moment, sir.

Paden looks out the front window, up the street. The Cowboy 
is untying the bay's reins.

Paden, more agitated now, glances back at the Clerk, then 
moves around and opens the back of the display case. He 
extracts a shiny, new Colt .45. The Clerk reacts with alarm 
and moves toward Paden.

			CLERK
	Just a minute there, fella. When I'm 
	done with this lady --

			PADEN
	I'll take this one.

He drops his coin on the case top.

			CLERK
		(looking at coin)
	That one's twenty dollars.

Paden is frustrated. He leans to peer out the window again.

			PADEN
	How much to borrow it?

			CLERK
	These guns are for sale.

			PADEN
		(indicates his coin)
	What can I get for that?

The Clerk gives up on putting him off and comes around the 
display case, disgruntled.

EXT. IN FRONT OF SALOON - DAY

The Cowboy mounts the bay.

INT. STORE - DAY

Paden holds a broken-down memory of a gun as though it were 
a cow chip.

			PADEN
		(resigned)
	What's it take?

The Clerk holds up a box of shells.

			CLERK
	This is extra.

Paden snatches it from his grasp and heads out of the store.

			PADEN
	I'll be back.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Paden hurries out into the middle of the street. Several 
passersby stop to look at him. A teenage girl lets out a 
delighted shriek.

IN FRONT OF THE SALOON. The Cowboy has turned the bay into 
the middle of the street and now looks to see what all the 
fuss is about. When he makes out Paden standing alone, his 
expression changes.

Paden is having trouble extracting a shell from the ammo 
box. He glances up the street at the Cowboy and sees that he 
has been spotted. He shakes one shell loose and drops the 
box, trying to insert the bullet in the gun.

The Cowboy pulls his six-gun, leans forward, and spurs the 
bay hard toward Paden. He raises his gun and fires at Paden. 
There is general alarm in the street as the bystanders dive 
for cover.

Paden gets the shell loaded as the Cowboy bears down on him, 
firing. The bullets kick up the dust in front and back of 
Paden, who now raises his pistol slowly. A bullet tears 
through the floppy material at his crotch. The Cowboy is 
almost upon him when Paden fires. The Cowboy is knocked off 
the horse and hits the street dead.

OMIT

EXT. STREET - DAY

A big, tough Cavalry SERGEANT has been summoned by a TROOPER 
and now walks briskly toward --

A small crowd gathered around Paden, who is affectionately 
stroking his reacquired horse. Two troopers flank him 
suspiciously. The Sergeant glances at the body of the Cowboy, 
then pushes through the crowd and confronts Paden.

			TROOPER
		(indicating Paden)
	This is the man, Sergeant. He claims 
	the animal was stolen.

			SERGEANT
	How do I know this is your horse?

The bay nuzzles Paden.

			PADEN
	Can't you see this horse loves me?

			SERGEANT
	I had a gal do that to me, but that 
	didn't make her my wife.

			PADEN
	I'll tell you what, on the underside 
	of this saddle I got my name 
	scratched. Take a look and you'll 
	see.

			SERGEANT
	Oh, yeah, and what would your name 
	be?

			SHERIFF COBB (O.S.)
	Paden.

The Sergeant and Paden both look to see COBB come through 
the crowd; he is an imposing man in a duster. Paden's reaction 
is deep and mixed, a whole chapter in his life coming back 
at him.

			PADEN
		(quietly)
	Hello, Cobb.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Hello, Paden. How ya doing?

			SERGEANT
	You know this man, Cobb?

			SHERIFF COBB
	I surely do.

			SERGEANT
		(to troopers)
	Let's see that saddle.

One of the troopers uncinches the saddle and flops it upside-
down in the dust. "Paden" is scratched on the underside.

			SERGEANT
		(satisfied)
	All right, move along, folks. Get 
	these children out of here.

The crowd begins to break up. Paden and Cobb are left facing 
one another. Cobb takes in Paden's longjohns.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I see you're prospering without me.

			PADEN
	It's been a while.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Where's the dog?

Paden's look pierces Cobb, but he bends to pick up his saddle 
and when he straightens, there is a smile on his face.

OMIT

EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

Cobb and Paden come out of the general store and start down 
the sidewalk. Paden is a little unsteady in a pair of cheap 
boots. A small pile of clothing is in his arms. On his head 
is a bad-looking new hat. He catches his reflection in a 
window and tries to give the hat a rakish tilt.

			PADEN
	Appreciate the loan. I'm good for 
	it.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Let's talk about that.
		(a beat)
	I'm looking for some men.

			PADEN
	I've given that up.

			SHERIFF COBB
	So have I. I've got a legitimate job 
	now. I can use a guy like you.

			PADEN
		(doubtful)
	You've got a legitimate job.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.

			PADEN
	You're right.

Cobb stops and faces Paden.

			SHERIFF COBB
	This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think 
	I finally found my place in the world.

			PADEN
	Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. 
	But I think I'll keep looking for 
	mine.

KYLE, a tough associate of Cobb's, hurries up to them.

			KYLE
		(to Cobb)
	He's getting out.

Kyle goes back up the street.

			SHERIFF COBB
		(smiling)
	C'mon, this'll interest you.

Cobb moves off after Kyle. Paden watches a moment 
thoughtfully, then follows.

EXT. STOCKADE - DAY

Kyle is digging into a saddlebag on one of three saddled 
horses at the gate of the stockade. Trooper guards flank the 
entrance. Cobb comes up and stares at the gate. Paden reaches 
the end of the sidewalk and leans against a post, watching.

The heavy gate is opened and a jailkeep steps out into the 
sunlight; he looks back into the gloom. TYREE comes out, 
wearing civilian clothes, shackled hand and foot. He's mean.

The jailkeep unlocks Tyree's irons and steps back, a little 
too quickly. Tyree nods at Cobb and a smile slits his face. 
Kyle comes up and hands Tyree his holster. Tyree buckles it 
on and bends to tie it to his thigh.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Look who's here, Tyree. It's our old 
	riding buddy.

Tyree looks up and straightens slowly at the sight of Paden. 
No love lost. Cobb, standing between them, grins and then 
laughs. He takes the reins of his horse from Kyle and swings 
up.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I invited Paden to join us, but he's 
	not having any.

Kyle and Tyree mount up. Tyree looks down at the longjohned 
Paden with a sneer.

			TYREE
		(like a knife)
	Where's the dog?

The three head out of the village, passing Paden.

			SHERIFF COBB
		(to Paden)
	You owe me thirteen bucks.

Cobb spurs his horse and the three gallop away in the dust.

			PADEN
		(to himself)
	Thirteen... bad luck.

EXT. RESTAURANT/SIDEWALK - DAY

Emmett and Paden come out of a restaurant. Paden is now bathed 
and fully dressed for the first time and he looks quite 
different, better. The old gun he purchased is stuck in his 
belt. Three horses -- Emmett's, the pinto, Paden's bay -- 
are tied to the post in the street.

Paden is fussing with his new, cheap hat. Emmett takes a 
close look at Paden's bay.

			EMMETT
	I see what you like, she's mighty 
	pretty.

			PADEN
	And bridle-wise, too. She's the only 
	thing I lost I really cared about.
		(he messes with his 
			hat, disgruntled)
	'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great 
	one. Got a pretty silver band on it. 
	My head spent three years training 
	it.
		(frowns at his new 
			hat)
	I surely do miss that hat.

Emmett gives him an amused look; this sounds kind of familiar. 
Emmett unties his two horses.

			EMMETT
	I gotta be going.

			PADEN
	Going to Turley, was it?

			EMMETT
		(nods)
	Gotta meet a guy and head out for 
	Silverado.

Paden takes the excess reins of the bay and begins idly 
slapping them around the post, distracted. Emmett swings up 
to his horse.

			PADEN
	What's Turley like?

			EMMETT
		(he doesn't make 
			distinctions)
	It's a town...

			PADEN
	They got a saloon there?

			EMMETT
	I expect.

			PADEN
	Women?

			EMMETT
	I expect.

Paden takes a long time looking around the village's main 
street. It doesn't look promising. Emmett regards him with 
growing bemusement. Finally --

			EMMETT
	Maybe you want to ride along with me 
	as far as Turley.

Paden lights up slightly at the suggestion. He looks up at 
Emmett. This is how Paden makes his decisions these days. He 
seems to be digesting it slowly.

			PADEN
	Maybe... I'll ride along... as far 
	as Turley.

Emmett nods and turns his horses into the street. Paden mounts 
up and follows him.

EXT. TRIP TO TURLEY (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY

The two men, leading the pinto, make their way through desert 
country to Turley.

EXT. EDGE OF TURLEY - DAY

Near the corrals at the end of the main street of the small 
town of Turley, a small WAGON TRAIN is loosely formed up, 
waiting. The settlers from the wagon train mill about. Several 
regard Emmett and Paden with unusual interest as they ride 
by on their way into town.

One of the Settlers is a lovely young woman. She glances at 
the two men, then returns her attention to her wagon. Both 
Emmett and Paden notice her. She is HANNAH.

EXT. MAIN STREET - TURLEY - DAY

A tall gallows is being constructed in the middle of an 
intersection. Emmett and Paden look it over as they ride 
past. Two workmen pause in their labors and look them over.

EXT. SALOON/HOTEL - TURLEY - DAY

This is the busy part of town. Amidst the street traffic and 
pedestrians sits a wagon with three Settler men, who watch 
Emmett and Paden's arrival with enormous interest. As the 
two travelers hitch their horses in front of the saloon, the 
oldest man, HOBART, approaches them with some agitation.

			HOBART
		(yelling)
	Baxter, Hawley, where the hell have 
	you been? You're late! And I'll tell 
	you, I don't like it. It's a bad 
	start, boys.

Emmett and Paden exchange looks.

			HOBART
	I've got my people sitting down 
	there...
		(indicates end of 
			street)
	...swatting flies and raring to go.

			EMMETT
	I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 
	'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he 
	ain't Hawley.

			HOBART
	You're not Baxter?

			EMMETT
	My name is Emmett.

			HOBART
		(to Paden)
	And you're not Baxter, either?

			PADEN
	No, I'm not Hawley.

			HOBART
	Well, god-dammit! God-dammit!

Hobart turns and looks across to the other Settler men. He 
yells.

			HOBART
	They ain't Baxter and Hawley! Where 
	the hell are Baxter and Hawley!

All this commotion has attracted some attention and amusement 
from passersby.

			BAXTER (O.S.)
	Quit your yelling, old man. We're 
	right here.

Hobart looks around to find two tough-looking men on horse-
back behind him -- BAXTER and HAWLEY.

			HOBART
	Who you calling an old man?

Baxter gets down from his horse and smiles, friendly for 
him.

Emmett and Paden watch with interest.

			BAXTER
		(offers his hand)
	Calm down, Mr. Hobart. I'm Nord 
	Baxter. That there is my partner, 
	Tom Hawley.

Hobart takes his hand grudgingly. He's glad they showed up.

			HOBART
		(gruff)
	You're late. It's a bad start, boys.

			BAXTER
		(grinning)
	Yes, sir. We'll just have to get you 
	people to Silverado that much quicker.

Emmett and Paden have continued to watch. Now Hawley looks 
over at them suspiciously.

			HOBART
	All right. Let's get going.

			BAXTER
	You remember my letter, don't you, 
	Mr. Hobart? Half now and half when 
	we get there.

			HOBART
		(remembering, impatient)
					I remember, I remember. C'mere.

Hobart, Baxter, and Hawley move to the wagon, where the two 
other Settlers wait. The younger of the two, CONRAD, eyes 
the guides suspiciously. Hobart speaks to the third man, a 
huge, bearded fellow called EB. Eb sits upon a strongbox in 
the bed of the wagon, an awesome blunderbuss in his arms.

			HOBART
	Open the box, Eb.

Eb stands, unlatches the strongbox, and opens it, revealing 
an impressive cache of coins and paper money. Hobart extracts 
a pouch of coins and hands it to Baxter, who pockets it.

			CONRAD
	Don't you want to count it?

			BAXTER
	Not at all, friend. We trust you. 
	Now let's get this train on its way 
	to Silverado.

Emmett and Paden watch the other five men head in the 
direction of the wagon train. Paden looks over at Emmett.

INT. SALOON/HOTEL - DAY

At the back of the big room is a registration desk for the 
hotel and stairs to the rooms. Emmett and Paden are eating 
near a table of three Tough Men. Emmett is questioning a 
WAITRESS, and his questions are making her nervous.

			EMMETT
	...He's about my size, energetic 
	young fella, wears two guns in a 
	fancy rig. He'd be a stranger here.

			WAITRESS
		(moving away quickly)
	I don't know him, I told you. I ain't 
	seen nobody.

Paden, munching on a biscuit, has noticed something out in 
the street; he gets up and walks to the entrance.

EXT. SALOON/HOTEL - DAY

WHAT PADEN SEES. The wagon train is moving by. Paden's 
attention is drawn to the seat of one of the wagons. Hannah, 
the lovely settler woman, is there; sitting beside her in a 
husbandly manner is Conrad. Paden is interested enough in 
the pretty girl that he barely registers a new arrival at 
the saloon's hitching post. The newcomer takes his saddle-
bags and a Henry .44 rifle from his horse and comes up into 
the saloon.

INT. SALOON/HOTEL - DAY

The newcomer is a lithe, strong, black man -- MAL. He has no 
other weapon besides the rifle. Mal looks around the room 
and walks wearily to the registration desk, although there 
is no one behind it. He RINGS a bell for service.

At the sound of the bell several of the patrons look up and 
spot Mal for the first time. The three Tough Men are instantly 
displeased at the sight of the black man. Paden, returning 
to his meal, notes their attitude and glances over at Mal.

Mal leaves his saddlebags at the registration desk, but takes 
the rifle as he walks across to the bar. The nervous Waitress 
is working there. The sight of Mal only adds to her agitation.

			WAITRESS
		(cold)
	What do you want?

			MAL
		(friendly, tired)
	I haven't had a drink of whiskey or 
	slept in a bed for ten days. Give me 
	a bottle.

The Waitress hesitates, uncertain. She places a shot glass 
and a bottle on the bar beyond an elaborate, brass, nude 
statuette whose upraised arms hold dishes full of hard-boiled 
eggs. Mal has leaned his rifle against the bar and must now 
move a few steps to stand before the whiskey.

The three Tough Men exchange looks as Mal uncorks the bottle 
and slowly, lovingly fills his shot glass. He puts the bottle 
down and regards the glass for a long moment of pleasant 
anticipation. Mal's hand has started for the glass when the 
saloon's PROPRIETOR appears from a back room.

			PROPRIETOR
		(sharply)
	Hey! What are you doing, buck?

Mal draws his hand back and straightens slightly. A different 
kind of weariness comes into his face.

			MAL
	Having a drink.

			PROPRIETOR
	No, you're not. Get out of here.

The Proprietor shoots the Waitress a withering look; she 
shrugs helplessly and hurries away. At the tables two of the 
three Tough Men quietly rise and separate, moving toward the 
two ends of the bar. Emmett and Paden watch.

			MAL
		(flat)
	I haven't had a drink of whiskey or 
	slept in a bed for ten days.

			PROPRIETOR
	You ain't getting them here.

			MAL
		(gravely)
	I'm real sorry to hear that.

At this, the First Man steps forward quickly, snatches Mal's 
rifle, and slides it down the bar. Mal looks across the 
distance at his only weapon.

			PADEN
		(quietly, to Emmett)
	Doesn't look quite fair.

			EMMETT
		(watching carefully)
	Which way do you mean?

The Second Man lurches up to the bar and pins Mal's arms 
behind him. The First Man moves quickly, cocking back his 
arm for a punch square in Mal's face. As the blow is 
unleashed, Mal bends forward with terrific speed and force, 
pulling the Second Man onto his back. The Second Man's face 
is suddenly where Mal's was an instant ago, and the First 
Man's punch lands hard on it. Mal slams the Second Man's 
back against the edge of the bar; he falls to the floor. Mal 
blocks a blow from the First Man and steps in with a flurry 
of body blows.

Back at the Tough Men's table, the Third Man pushes back his 
chair as if to rise. Emmett has just picked up a chicken 
leg; now he waves it ever so slightly at the Third Man: "Stay 
out of it". The Man looks at Emmett and Paden, then settles 
back into his seat.

Mal sends the First Man crashing down through a table with a 
final blow. He turns in time to see the Second Man, back on 
his feet, grab Mal's whiskey bottle and break it against the 
bar. Mal looks for a frustrated moment at the splashing 
whiskey -- what a waste. The Second Man lunges with the sharp 
glass. Mal lifts the heavy statuette easily with one hand 
and uses its upraised arms to catch the Man's wrist and twist 
the bottle painfully from his grasp. Mal's other hand hits 
the Man once in the throat, and he is down.

The Proprietor rises from behind the bar, a sawed-off shotgun 
in his hand. Mal spins, swinging the statuette brutally 
against the Proprietor's arm. The shotgun clatters to the 
floor as the Proprietor recoils in pain, crashing into a 
shelf of glasses. The fight is over.

Suddenly, standing in the doorway holding a leveled gun is 
an enormously tall figure -- SHERIFF LANGSTON. Dressed rather 
elegantly in suit and bowler, he dwarfs the man at his side, 
DEPUTY KERN. He surveys the scene as the three injured men 
stir back to life. When he speaks, it is, surprisingly, with 
a British accent --

			LANGSTON
	What's all this then?

			PROPRIETOR
	This nigger's breaking up my place, 
	Sheriff Langston.

			LANGSTON
	I don't like that word much, Carter.

			PROPRIETOR
	We don't serve them here and you 
	know it. I asked him to leave and he 
	went crazy on us. He owes me money 
	for this damage.

			LANGSTON
	Is that a fact?

			EMMETT
	'Fraid not, Sheriff. These other 
	fellas started the ruckus.

Langston's attention focuses on Emmett and Paden.

			LANGSTON
	There are three strangers in this 
	room, traveller, and these gents you 
	are accusing aren't them.
		(to Mal, indicating 
			Emmett and Paden)
	Are these your friends?

			MAL
		(shakes his head "no")
	I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess 
	I came to the wrong place.

			LANGSTON
		(taking in the mess)
	Came to the wrong town. I don't 
	tolerate this kind of thing. It's 
	hard on the peace, and it's hard on 
	the furniture. Now, knowing a bit 
	about Carter here, I'm going to let 
	you go without paying for the damages. 
	But go you will, and I mean now.

			MAL
	Is there a place in town that takes... 
	my kind?

			LANGSTON
	You misunderstand. I want you out of 
	town. In fact, I want you all the 
	way out of my jurisdiction.

			MAL
		(seething)
	That ain't right.

			LANGSTON
	I decide what's right in this 
	jurisdiction. Now move.

Mal glares at Langston and, finally, moves. He takes his 
rifle from the bar, then walks over, picks up his saddlebags, 
and slings them over his shoulder. He is almost to the door 
when he stops, turns, and walks slowly back to the bar. The 
shot glass full of whiskey has miraculously survived the 
fracas. Mal brings it to his lips and swallows with 
satisfaction. He turns and goes out the front door. Langston 
motions to Deputy Kern to follow and witness Mal's departure.

Langston turns and looks at Emmett and Paden as he slowly 
uncocks his revolver and holsters it.

			PROPRIETOR
	Who's going to pay for all this, 
	Sheriff?

			LANGSTON
	Don't press your luck, Carter.

Langston moves to Emmett and Paden's table and pulls up a 
chair. He lifts the last biscuit from a basket. He takes a 
fastidious bite.

			LANGSTON
	Now let's talk about you chaps.

			PADEN
	We'd rather stay.

			LANGSTON
	We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff 
	John Langston. As you may have 
	guessed, I am not from these parts.

			PADEN
	You're kidding.

			LANGSTON
		(ignoring that)
	But the good citizens of Turley have 
	taken me in their embrace, and for 
	one simple reason. I maintain the 
	peace. So when strangers come to 
	town, I always ask them their 
	business. Have you come for the 
	hanging?

			EMMETT
		("no")
	I'm just meeting a guy here and moving 
	on. So far I haven't been able to 
	find him.

			LANGSTON
	In my town, when you're looking for 
	someone, you ask me.

			EMMETT
	All right. I'm looking for a young 
	fella, full of juice. About my size, 
	wears a fancy two-gun rig.

Langston takes a long time reacting to this information. Now 
he slides his chair back a foot, giving his gun hand a little 
more room.

			LANGSTON
	I know where that gentleman is.

OMIT

INT. CELLBLOCK - EVENING

A lean, young man is bouncing around his cell, playing hacky 
sack, keeping a small, leather, bean bag from falling to the 
floor by kicking it with his bare feet. This is JAKE.

Langston opens the door to the cellblock and speaks over his 
shoulder to Emmett and Paden, who have removed their guns.

			LANGSTON
	Now I want everyone to behave himself.

At the sight of Emmett, Jake's face lights up. And then he 
does an extraordinary thing: with one long stride he is across 
the cell and into the air; he hits the bars halfway up and 
clings like a monkey. Paden reacts as if he is one.

			JAKE
	Emmett! Am I glad to see you!

			EMMETT
		(touching him)
	Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?

			JAKE
	You got me. This is a crazy town, 
	Emmett. I think we ought to get out 
	of here.

Jake lowers himself and darts about as he talks.

			JAKE
	All I did was kiss a girl.

			EMMETT
		(skeptical)
	That's why they got you in jail?

			JAKE
	Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy 
	didn't like it and we had some words, 
	so I decided to get out of there.

Jake looks at Emmett as though that should make it perfectly 
clear. Emmett waits.

			JAKE
	So I did, I got out of there, I don't 
	want no trouble. You know me.
		(indeed, Emmett does)
	So I walked out on the street and 
	the fella tried to shoot me in the 
	back.

			EMMETT
	...And you had to kill him?

			JAKE
	No, no, no! I winged him, and he 
	dropped his gun.

			EMMETT
	You're in here for winging a guy?

Paden watches, fascinated.

			JAKE
	Well, no, not exactly. See then his 
	friend opened up on me.

			EMMETT
	What friend is that?

			JAKE
	The one with the shotgun.

			LANGSTON
	The dead one.

There is a long moment of silence in the cellblock.

			EMMETT
	Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- 
	was it self-defense?

			JAKE
		(after a moment, 
			quieter now)
	Honest to God, Emmett, he would've 
	killed me.

			LANGSTON
	The jury saw it differently.

			PADEN
		(putting it all 
			together)
	So this is the guy you're going to 
	hang?

			LANGSTON
	Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.

			PADEN
		(nods)
	I was afraid of that.

Emmett steps back and leans against the opposite wall, looking 
down at his boots.

			JAKE
	Emmett, can't you help me?

Emmett looks up at the young man. He looks sad.

			EMMETT
	Jake, you know the law. You know 
	what they did to me.

Jake remembers. It makes him gloomy.

			EMMETT
	Blind Pete always said you'd hang.

Jake's eyes flick over Emmett, but his expression doesn't 
change.

			EMMETT
	I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be 
	proved right.

			LANGSTON
	Ten A.M.

			EMMETT
	Right... I thought they always did 
	it at dawn.
		(to Jake)
	So long, kid. I'm sorry.

Emmett walks out. Jake watches as the other two follow.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Emmett and Paden walk along the sparsely populated sidewalk. 
They are quiet for a few moments. Finally --

			PADEN
	Shame about the kid. Seems a lively 
	sort.

			EMMETT
		(morosely)
	He is that.

			PADEN
	I hate to see any man swing. Bad 
	luck.

			EMMETT
	Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust 
	him out of there.

Paden stops. Emmett has moved a couple more steps before he 
notices and turns back to Paden.

			PADEN
	You'll have to deal me out on that. 
	I've had some experience with that 
	sort of thing, and I don't want any 
	more.

			EMMETT
	I understand.

			PADEN
	It's not going to be easy.

			EMMETT
	It never is. But he's my brother.
		(Paden reacts)
	We're going to California together. 
	But first we're going to stop in 
	Silverado and see our sister. And I 
	can't show up there with a story 
	like this.

Paden nods. He is sympathetic.

			PADEN
	Then I guess this is where we part 
	ways. Sorry.

			EMMETT
	No hard feelings.

			PADEN
	C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.

			EMMETT
	You haven't got any money.

			PADEN
	All right, you buy me a drink.

They cross the street toward the crowded, noisy saloon.

			PADEN
	You know, a good smelly saloon is my 
	favorite place in the world.

INT. SALOON/HOTEL - NIGHT

This is the busiest place in town, really packed. Emmett 
heads for a spot at the bar, but Paden, who is taking in the 
scene with relish, stops in his tracks, staring across the 
room.

WHAT HE SEES. Through the moving jumble of bodies and the 
heavy smoke, Paden's hat with its silver band, floating atop 
an unseen head at a poker table.

Paden adjusts the old gun stuck in his belt and goes in that 
direction.

At the table a heavy game is in progress. An UGLY COWBOY is 
wearing Paden's hat. Paden plants himself across the table 
from the man. In seconds, Paden's posture brings things to a 
halt. Quiet ripples out across the room. The Ugly Cowboy 
looks up and recognizes Paden.

			PADEN
	You're wearing my hat. What else you 
	got that's mine?

			UGLY COWBOY
	I don't know what you're talking 
	about, mister.

He shifts a little in his chair. His right hand slides off 
the table. Bystanders back away. Emmett watches from the 
bar.

			PADEN
	I hope your hand isn't tickling my 
	bone-handled Colt. If you stand up 
	real slow and let me see, you might 
	live through this night.

The Ugly Cowboy hesitates, his eyes darting. He pushes his 
chair back slowly and begins to rise as if in compliance. 
But now a bone-handled Colt is in his hand, clearing his 
holster. Paden is quicker. He snatches his gun from his belt 
and fires.

Paden's eyes, squinting through a cloud of gunsmoke, as we 
hear the Ugly Cowboy's body CRASH to the floor in his chair. 
Paden's glance now darts down at an angle.

WHAT HE SEES. His hat lands on the saloon floor, spins once 
on its brim, and settles into stillness like a tossed coin.

Silence in the saloon. Then, in a far corner, the BANGING of 
chairs and a door SLAMMING. Paden's gun points that way, but 
there is no one there. Only an overturned chair, and an empty 
pair of boots -- Paden's.

Paden picks up his hat and walks toward his boots. Emmett 
moves to the dead man, unbuckles the gunbelt, and pulls it 
free of the body. He picks up the bone-handled Colt and puts 
it in the holster, then stops abruptly. We hear the steady 
advance of FOOTSTEPS across the saloon floor. Emmett's eyes 
follow the off-screen presence.

Paden, seated, is pulling on his newly-regained boots with a 
delighted air when a shadow surges up and engulfs him. He 
looks up.

Sheriff Langston towers over him.

INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

Paden is brusquely deposited in the cell next to a surprised 
Jake by Sheriff Langston and DEPUTY BLOCK.

			PADEN
	You're making a big mistake.

Langston is not interested. He and Block go out.

			JAKE
	That's what I told 'em.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Deputy Block eyes Emmett, who loiters by the door as Langston 
settles himself.

			LANGSTON
	Maybe I ought to throw you in jail 
	too. Then you could be with all your 
	friends.

			EMMETT
	I haven't done anything.

			LANGSTON
	I want you out of town before the 
	hanging.

			EMMETT
	I'll be long gone.

OMIT

INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

Paden forlornly regards a snoring drunk in another cell as 
Jake talks to him.

			JAKE
	You mean you ain't coming with Emmett 
	and me?

			PADEN
	I can't say I'm convinced you're 
	going anywhere.

			JAKE
	Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.

			PADEN
	I've got no reason to run. It was a 
	fair fight and there were plenty of 
	witnesses.

			JAKE
		(bubbly)
	Yeah, that's what happened with me 
	too.

			PADEN
	The other guy drew first.

			JAKE
		(same for him)
	Right!

Paden looks a little discouraged, but is still unconvinced.

EXT. GALLOWS - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Emmett sits up on the new gallows in the deserted 
intersection, his legs dangling through the dropped trap 
door. Now he begins idly collecting wood shavings into a 
little pile.

INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

Paden steps close to the bars that separate the cells and 
looks up at Jake, who is dangling at arm's length from one 
of the overhead bars in his cell.

			PADEN
		(whispering)
	Your brother seems pretty good, but 
	it isn't going to be easy getting in 
	here.

Jake drops down to the floor.

			JAKE
	He ain't coming in, we're going out.
		(motions)
	Gimme your belt.

Paden, trying to follow this, unbuckles his belt.

			JAKE
	Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?

			PADEN
		(handing him the belt)
	We didn't get that far.

			JAKE
	Blind Pete taught me a great trick.

Jake grasps Paden's belt by the buckle and snaps it at Paden 
with a CRACK, like a lion tamer.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

Deputy Block cheats at solitaire while Langston dozes at his 
desk. Now we hear FOOTSTEPS and BANGING outside.

			STABLE BOY (O.S.)
	Sheriff! Sheriff! Open up!

Block unlocks the door as Langston comes groggily to life. A 
STABLE BOY bounces at the door, pointing off.

			STABLE BOY
	Sheriff Langston, come quick!

He disappears. Langston goes out, calling back to Block --

			LANGSTON
	Lock this door and don't let anybody 
	in.

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

Langston hurries up the street after the Stable Boy.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

Deputy Block bolts the front door.

			PADEN (O.S.)
		(shouting)
	Hey! What are you doing, you crazy 
	kid? Don't do it!

Block draws his six-gun and edges suspiciously toward the 
door to the cellblock.

			PADEN (O.S.)
	Oh, Jesus! Somebody stop him!

Block turns the doorknob and pushes the door open with his 
foot, gun ready. He moves into the cellblock.

INT. CELLBLOCK - DAWN

Block moves cautiously to where he can see the cells. A 
strange look crosses his face.

Jake is hanging by the neck from the overhead bars, two belts 
forming the noose, his head at a disgusting angle from his 
body. One foot gives a final twitch and he is still.

			PADEN
	Cut him down! For God's sake, cut 
	him down!

Block is confused, uncertain. He doesn't want to go in there.

			PADEN
	Hurry up! You might be able to save 
	him!

			BLOCK
	What for? So we can hang him?

Paden, sincerely desperate now, looks up at Jake, whose face 
is turning blue.

			PADEN
	I think I'm going to be sick... when 
	I see what Langston does to you when 
	he gets here.

Block lets it sink in, then takes some keys from his belt.

			BLOCK
		(to Paden)
	You get way back there.

Paden moves back quickly, motioning for Block to hurry. Block 
holsters his six-gun, opens Jake's cell door, and goes inside. 
He gets up on the cot, pulling a knife from a sheath. He 
strains up against Jake's body, stretching to cut the belt.

Suddenly Jake can stand it no longer: he sputters to life, 
his long-held breath blasting in Block's face. Block, 
startled, stumbles backwards off the cot, raising the knife 
threateningly. Jake grabs the overhead bars, swings up, and 
kicks Block in the chest. The deputy careens across the cell 
and hits the bars. He throws the knife outside the cell and 
draws his gun, ready to shoot Jake.

As Block's finger pulls the trigger, Paden's thumb intrudes 
between the hammer and the firing pin. Paden has reached 
through the bars behind Block to grasp the gun with his right 
hand. Now with his left he grabs a handful of Block's hair 
and slams the deputy's head hard back against the bars. As 
Block slides unconscious to the floor, Paden keeps the gun, 
wincingly uncocking it.

			PADEN
	Got to be real quiet here.

Jake has unhooked himself and is freeing his makeshift noose. 
He rubs his reddened neck.

			JAKE
		(a hoarse whisper)
	Right.

EXT. GALLOWS - DAWN

Langston huffs to a stop next to the Stable Boy, his 
countenance a picture of outraged befuddlement. He, the Stable 
Boy, and just one other surprised citizen are the only 
witnesses: the gallows is aflame, burning like a pyre.

Langston considers this phenomenon, a suspicion slowly growing 
in his mind.

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

Paden and Jake come out warily. The street is deserted. Paden 
straps his holster on; he's glad to have it back at last. 
Not as glad, however, as Jake, who seems to have a nearly 
religious relationship with his rig, an elaborately tooled, 
double gunbelt with two pearl-handled Colts.

			JAKE
	That's the longest I ever did it. 
	'Bout bust a gut.

			PADEN
		(finger to lips: 
			"quiet")
	What now?

			JAKE
	We wait.

The two men move carefully off the porch and into the street.

A wood stair goes up the outside of the jail to a door. Now, 
high behind Jake, Deputy Kern comes out, nightshirt flapping, 
cocking the carbine in his hands. He has thumped down five 
steps before he focuses on Jake and Paden. He starts to raise 
the carbine.

Both men see the deputy, but Jake's reaction is so fast that 
Paden need only watch. Jake spins and, before he has stopped, 
both his Colts are erupting in his hands. The carbine flies 
out of Kern's grasp and clatters down the steps. Jake 
continues to fire -- the stair at Kern's foot splinters and 
he steps backwards and up. Jake continues to splinter the 
steps at Kern's feet, until he has made the deputy exactly 
retrace his steps and retreat back through the door. The 
firing stops.

Paden gives Jake an odd look. Paden may have seen someone 
this fast and good before, but he can't remember it. He puts 
his finger to his lips -- "shhh".

			PADEN
	Where's your brother?

			JAKE
		(reloading fast)
	He'll be here.

A bullet WHIZZES between the two men as we hear shots from 
the far end of the street. Langston is coming toward them 
firing. They move back to the cover of the jail porch.

ALLEY ACROSS THE STREET. Emmett roars into view, riding his 
horse and leading two others: Paden's bay and the pinto.

A window above the jail breaks open and Kern starts firing 
at Emmett.

DOWN THE STREET. Langston, behind a wagon, uses a British 
two-handed grip to fire off a few rounds.

Emmett brings the horses over, and Paden swings quickly up. 
Jake focuses his attention, unleashing a fusillade as Emmett 
leads the pinto along the front of the jail.

			EMMETT
	Jake, come on!

DOWN THE STREET. Langston lifts his head from behind the now 
bullet-pocked wagon. He's impressed.

Jake runs along the porch, hits the top of the hitching post 
on the fly, and takes off, landing lightly in the saddle of 
the pinto. The three men gallop out of town in a cloud of 
dust.

EXT. RIDE OUT OF TURLEY (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

The three men ride hell-for-leather away from town. At the 
first bend they leave the road and head off cross-country, 
their horses straining up craggy hillsides and sliding down 
dusty slopes. There is some good riding going on here.

OMIT

EXT. THE CHASE (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

INTERCUTTING the three men and the Posse Langston has raised, 
as the Posse closes ground over choppy terrain. Now the three 
fugitives come through some trees along the bank of a stream 
and splash across to the other side.

EXT. A SPLIT IN THE TRAIL - THE CHASE CONTINUES - DAY

The three men come thundering along a dusty trail to the 
place where it splits. The high road disappears up the side 
of a ridge; the low road is really the bed of an arroyo. The 
three men exchange looks. Paden plunges into the arroyo. 
Emmett shrugs to Jake, and the brothers follow Paden.

INTERCUTTING. The Posse splashes across the stream. The three 
fugitives twist their way through the crooked arroyo.

AT THE SPLIT IN THE TRAIL. Langston pulls his group to a 
halt. He looks at the tracks leading into the arroyo, and a 
smile splits his face. He leads the Posse up the high road 
fast.

EXT. ARROYO - DAY

IN THE ARROYO. Paden and Emmett pull up, looking back at 
Jake, who has stopped at the last bend in the gully, watching 
their rear. Now he rides up to the others.

			JAKE
	I think we lost 'em.

			EMMETT
	There's nobody coming?

Jake shakes his head "no". Paden and Emmett exchange long 
looks. Paden looks to the ground above them, even more 
worried.

			PADEN
	Oh-oh.

They spur their horses out of there.

EXT. MOUTH OF ARROYO/FLATLANDS - DAY

The three riders break out of the arroyo and exchange looks 
of glee on seeing the clear flatlands ahead. SHOTS ring out. 
They look over their shoulders to see Langston's Posse, 
practically on top of them, pouring over the lip of a rise 
and firing at will.

The three men whip their horses and head flat out across the 
open space toward a cluster of boulders three hundred yards 
away. They are vulnerable and exposed as shots PING around 
them. They are not going to make it.

WITH THE POSSE. Deputy Block jumps from his horse onto the 
top of a boulder and lies prone, bracing his Winchester for 
an accurate shot.

			BLOCK
		(to himself)
	Let's see you fake this one, kid.

He is about to fire when suddenly the rocky surface in front 
of his face explodes. He is so startled, he falls off the 
boulder.

Another Posse member is coming between two tall rocks when a 
bullet hits near his head and ricochets into the rock on the 
other side. His horse rears up, and the horse coming up behind 
him collides with it.

Langston and Deputy Kern have just started across the flats, 
but pull up next to a cactus at this new firing. An arm of 
the cactus is immediately severed by a .44 slug.

			KERN
	Is that them shooting?

			LANGSTON
		(pointing)
	No. It's coming from those rocks.

WHAT HE SEES. Paden, Emmett, and Jake are now halfway to the 
cover of the distant rocks. Another shot CRACKS, and a puff 
of smoke appears from ahead of them in the boulders.

			KERN
	Let's go. He ain't hitting anything.

			LANGSTON
	You idiot, he's hit everything he's 
	aimed at.

			KERN
	...But they won't be out of our 
	jurisdiction till they pass Flat 
	Top!

As Paden, Emmett, and Jake disappear among the boulders, 
Langston rises high in his stirrups to catch a final glimpse. 
His bowler is blown off his head. He lowers himself back to 
his saddle.

			LANGSTON
	Today my jurisdiction ends here.

He turns his horse back. The others do likewise.

			LANGSTON
		(over his shoulder, 
			to Kern)
					Pick up my hat.

EXT. BOULDERS - DAY

Emmett and Paden rein in their frothing horses in the natural 
bowl of rocks near a tied horse and the remains of a campfire. 
Jake has stopped short of them and taken his horse back to 
peer out toward the Posse. Grinning, he comes back to the 
others. The three riders bring their horses around and focus 
on a spot above them.

On the top of the highest boulder, Mal leaves a comfortable, 
prone shooting position and eases himself down to a lower 
rock. A bandolier of .44 bullets dangles from one hand. He 
rests his Henry rifle at an angle across one shoulder.

			JAKE
		(to the others)
	This a friend of yours?

			PADEN
	He is now.

			JAKE
	Who is he?

			PADEN
	Oh, a guy who got run out of town...

			EMMETT
	...just like us.

EXT. HIGH DESERT - DAY

An awesome rock spire soars into the perfect blue sky above 
the orange desert. The sight is spectacular. The slow surge 
of MUSIC exhilarating. It is the perfect setting in which to 
see the four horsemen who now appear on a ridge. Here they 
come --

Riding together, side by side, for the first time -- Emmett, 
Paden, Jake, and Mal.

EXT. HILL - DAY

The travellers crest a hill above a wide desert plain and 
pull up at the surprising sight below -- there in the 
distance, stopped dead in a disorderly line, is the wagon 
train we saw leave Turley. The horsemen exchange puzzled 
looks.

EXT. WAGON TRAIN - DESERT PLAIN - DAY

The Settlers are clustered near a wagon as the four horsemen 
ride down on them. There is a tense silence as they dismount 
and approach the group. Hobart, the leader, steps forward to 
meet them. After a long perusal --

			HOBART
		(calling)
	It's okay, Zeke.

From the cover of a nearby wagon, Zeke appears, lowering a 
shotgun that had been trained on the newcomers.

			EMMETT
	Hobart, what are you people doing 
	here?

			HOBART
	This is where Baxter and Hawley brung 
	us.

			EMMETT
	Well, they're wrong. This territory 
	is full of bad characters.

			HOBART
	And they were two of them. Look --

He gestures and the Settlers part to reveal the wagon which 
held the money box in Turley. The money box is gone, but the 
still form of its giant guardian, Eb, lies in the bed of the 
wagon, dead.

			HOBART
	Baxter and Hawley killed poor Eb 
	here and stole our money box.
		(gestures)
	They went north and we're going after 
	them.

The newcomers now see that a few of the Settler men and boys 
are preparing to ride in pursuit. Mal and Paden exchange 
looks, not terribly impressed.

			EMMETT
	Forget the money. You've got to get 
	these people out of here. This is no 
	place to be sitting with women and 
	kids.

			JAKE
	Your next water ain't for three days.

			HOBART
	We got no life in Silverado without 
	that money. Everybody put in, that's 
	our whole stake.

Paden looks around. His gaze falls on Hannah, somber now, 
but still lovely. Conrad, her husband, stands beside her.

Mal has been watching a little girl cling to the leg of one 
of the Settler men who is going out on the chase. Now the 
black man quietly mounts his horse, and speaks to an older, 
solid-looking man, MR. PARKER, standing by his wife.

			MAL
	How long have they been gone?

			MR. PARKER
	About an hour.

Emmett and Paden watch Mal with interest. Jake is excited by 
this development. He jumps up on his horse.

			JAKE
	I'll go with you, Mal!

Paden isn't so quick to commit, but then he notices Hannah 
gazing up at Mal and Jake with radiant admiration. He digests 
that and moves toward his horse.

			PADEN
	Deal me in.

He steals a look at Hannah as he mounts up. Emmett has watched 
all this with growing resignation. Now he speaks crisply, 
all business.

			EMMETT
	Jake, you know the way out of here. 
	I want you to get this train moving 
	toward Silverado, and fast. I'll go 
	with these guys.

Jake is disappointed, but nods agreement. Emmett turns to 
Hobart and the Settler posse.

			EMMETT
	You men stay with your wagons and 
	your families. Get rolling and keep 
	your eyes peeled.

Emmett moves toward his horse, as Conrad, rifle in hand, 
steps forward belligerently.

			CONRAD
	Wait a minute! If you do get the 
	money, how do we know you'll come 
	back?

			EMMETT
		(flashes him a look)
	If we don't, you can keep my brother.

			HOBART
		(to Emmett)
	I'm trusting you, mister.

			CONRAD
		(to Hobart)
	You trusted Baxter. I'm not letting 
	these men out of my sight.

As Conrad moves toward his horse, Paden looks at Hannah, now 
standing all alone. Paden thinks he acted too quickly.

			EMMETT
		(indicating Hannah)
	If I'd brought a pretty lady like 
	that into a place like this, I'd 
	stay close.

Paden reacts to Emmett's interest in Hannah.

			CONRAD
	That's none of your business, mister. 
	Let's get going.

			PADEN
		(quietly, to Emmett)
	I think you got a point, Emmett. 
	Maybe I better stay here with her.

Emmett smiles and snaps his reins, moving out with Mal. 
Reluctantly, Paden follows, twisting around for a last glimpse 
of Hannah.

WHAT HE SEES. Hannah moves toward Conrad's horse, as if to 
touch her husband. But Conrad, his face set in suspicion, 
barely nods farewell as he sweeps by her. She looks after 
him desolately.

Mal, Paden, Emmett, and Conrad ride off to the north, as 
Jake begins yelling orders to the Settlers to get things 
moving. What he lacks in expertise, he makes up for in 
enthusiasm.

EXT. HIGH DESERT (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY

The four men track the killers across the rugged terrain. 
Sometimes, Emmett gets down from his horse to examine the 
tracks.

On a flat, rocky expanse, the chase party is temporarily 
stalled. Emmett and Paden confer, balked. Mal, peering ahead, 
spots something and points it out to the two expert trackers: 
a steaming horse patty. They head off in that direction.

OMIT

EXT. RIM OF BOX CANYON - DAY

The four men crawl to the lip of the canyon and get a clear 
view of the activity below; the box canyon has been turned 
into a hideout for the Dawson Gang, a band of border raiders. 
There are about twenty-five outlaws moving about among the 
tents, caves, and wagons of the encampment. Their horses are 
penned in a natural alcove in the rock off the main floor of 
the canyon.

The strongbox from the wagon train sits on the tailgate of a 
wagon. Next to it is a large keg of whiskey from which the 
outlaws are drawing generous portions. Baxter and Hawley 
have brought the loot proudly back to their cohorts, and the 
celebration is centered around this wagon.

On the rim the pursuers exchange looks in reaction to this 
new situation.

			PADEN
		(to Emmett)
	You know, hanging around with you is 
	no picnic.

			EMMETT
	Anybody got any ideas?

EXT. OUTLAW CAMP - BOX CANYON - DAY

One of the outlaws spills some whiskey onto the money in the 
strongbox. DAWSON, the leader of the gang, angrily slams the 
strongbox closed and kicks the offending outlaw. Suddenly, 
there are cries of warning from the Sentinel at the entrance 
to the box canyon. HOOFBEATS echo into the canyon from that 
direction. The outlaws react en masse with a frightening 
display of armed readiness.

WHERE THE TRAIL ENTERS THE CANYON. From the shadows emerge 
two galloping horses: on the first is Emmett, who holds the 
reins of the second, across whose saddle is draped the 
seemingly lifeless body of Paden. The Sentinel watches them 
pass under the point of his carbine.

AT THE WAGON. Emmett dismounts quickly and ties both horses 
to a wheel. Dawson decides not to shoot this guy yet. He 
watches as Emmett runs back across the canyon to the cover 
of some crates and crouches down behind them, looking up at 
the rim above the entrance. The outlaws, guns pointed, stand 
around him.

			TALL OUTLAW
		(to Dawson)
	Should I kill him, Mr. Dawson?

			DAWSON
		(approaching Emmett)
	In a minute!

Emmett, still cowering, looks over his shoulder at Dawson. 
He speaks now, and throughout, very fast.

			EMMETT
	I wouldn't do that. You're going to 
	need every gun when that posse gets 
	here.

			DAWSON
	Posse? What the hell you talking 
	about?

			EMMETT
	My partner and me robbed the bank in 
	Turley and headed out with a posse 
	on our tails. My partner there caught 
	one a ways back, and I think he kicked 
	off while I was looking for this 
	damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't 
	you? I'm Tex LaRue.
		(offers his hand for 
			only a second)
	Used to ride with Ry Morris. You 
	know him. Well, Andy Sims told me 
	there was a hideout here, so I headed 
	for it. Hope you don't mind.

Paden, lying over the saddle, his face shielded by his hat, 
winces at this story.

			DAWSON
	You brought a posse to my best hideout 
	and you want to know if I mind. 
	Mister, I don't know any of those 
	names and you're about to die.

			EMMETT
	Wait a minute! If you don't believe 
	me, ask them...
		(indicates Baxter and 
			Hawley)
	...they saw me and my pal in Turley 
	before we did the job.

Baxter and Hawley peer at Emmett and nod to each other.

			BAXTER
	I saw 'em there, all right, but I 
	don't know about any bank job.

			DAWSON
	If you took the bank in Turley, 
	where's the money?

Emmett crouches lower, looking nervously at the rocks.

			EMMETT
	I'd get down if I were you. They may 
	be up there now.

			DAWSON
		(just as he suspected)
	No money, eh?

			EMMETT
	The money's in my saddlebags over 
	there, but I ain't stepping out to 
	get it.

The outlaws, all of whom are standing in the open, think 
he's crazy. Dawson motions Hawley toward Emmett's horse. 
Hawley is almost there when gunfire erupts from the rocks 
above and Hawley goes down dead. Now all the outlaws hit the 
dirt, some firing wildly. Paden unobtrusively frees his rope. 
Dawson comes down beside Emmett.

EXT. RIM OF BOX CANYON - DAY

Conrad and Mal fire into the canyon, then move to new 
positions.

EXT. OUTLAW CAMP - DAY

ABOVE THE ENTRANCE to the box canyon the Sentinel disappears 
into the rocks, moving upward.

AT THE CRATES. Down the line from Emmett, an outlaw gets 
hit. The outlaws can't see anything to shoot at.

			EMMETT
		(agitated)
	If we charge them, they won't have a 
	chance. But we gotta get to the 
	horses.

			DAWSON
	What do you mean, the horses?

Emmett jumps up. He yells to the other outlaws.

			EMMETT
	Cover me!

He runs in a mad zig-zag toward the gate of the horses' pen.

EXT. RIM OF BOX CANYON - DAY

Mal, firing rapidly, follows Emmett's route with precision.

EXT. OUTLAW CAMP - DAY

Mal's shots kick up dust inches from Emmett's flying feet. 
Once Emmett throws a glance upwards; Mal's cutting it pretty 
close. Baxter slides in next to Dawson, who is thinking hard.

			BAXTER
		(indicating Emmett)
	Brave man.

			DAWSON
	I think there's only a couple of 
	guys up there and this asshole's one 
	of them.

AT THE WAGON. An outlaw is cowering beneath the wagon, but 
doesn't notice as Paden reaches out and secures the latch on 
the money box.

AT THE HORSE PEN. Emmett throws open the make-shift gate and 
runs in among the horses, yelling and waving his arms. The 
horses begin to run out of the pen.

AT THE CRATES. Dawson jumps up and orders his men forward. A 
line of outlaws rushes toward the pen, all the while firing 
up at the rim. Paden appears at a gallop from behind, pulling 
Emmett's horse beside him. A rope stretches from his 
saddlehorn to the strongbox bouncing along in the dirt.

Paden comes through the line of outlaws firing and heads for 
the pen. A few of the outlaws make the mistake of closing 
the gap and aiming at Paden's back. The bouncing strongbox 
knocks them head over heels.

Emmett leaps from a rock onto his passing horse, firing behind 
him. He and Paden go down the trail in the midst of the 
outlaws' horses. The strongbox careens after them.

EXT. MOUTH OF CANYON TRAIL - DAY

Mal and Conrad, mounted; are waiting as Emmett and Paden 
ride out of the mouth of the canyon. Beyond them, the outlaws' 
horses scatter toward the horizon. Paden jumps off his horse 
and picks up the strongbox.

IN THE ROCKS ABOVE THEM the Sentinel from the outlaw camp 
positions himself to fire at the men below.

			EMMETT
		(to Mal)
	That was some idea of yours. Next 
	time you go in.

Paden is tying the strongbox to his saddlehorn when there is 
the loud CLICK of Conrad's rifle being cocked. He nervously 
points it at the others.

			CONRAD
	I knew it. Put that box on my horse.

			MAL
	Mister, you got a lot to learn about 
	people.

A SHOT rings out. Conrad takes it in the chest and flies off 
his horse. Now an amazing sight -- Emmett, Paden, and Mal 
all turn and fire at once. The Sentinel is really dead.

EXT. DESERT RISE - DAY

Below in the distance the wagon train moves across the desert, 
dwarfed by giant rock walls. Now, coming right PAST CAMERA, 
at a gallop ride Emmett, Paden, Mal, and Conrad's horse with 
his body slung over it.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Hannah sits alone on the high seat of her wagon. She is 
unaware that behind her the four horses approach. And that 
her husband is dead.

OMIT

EXT. WAGON TRAIN CAMP - NIGHT

Mal, Emmett, and Jake lounge about a campfire within the 
quiet circle of wagons. Emmett is whittling a whistle pipe 
out of a stick.

			MAL
	After the war my family worked a 
	little piece of land near Savannah 
	for a while. But the way it was down 
	there then... well, they made it 
	hard every way they could. Finally 
	my daddy figured the promised land 
	was out this direction. By that time 
	I was so sick of farming, I didn't 
	want to touch another hoe ever. I 
	wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy 
	took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and 
	my little sister headed out without 
	me. They've got a little place south 
	of Silverado. I guess they've done 
	okay. Good enough anyway so that 
	when my ma wrote me last time, she 
	said they needed my help to work the 
	place. That was almost nine months 
	ago she wrote. Letter took a while 
	to find me, but when it did, it was 
	just the right time.

			EMMETT
	Where were you?

			MAL
	Chicago. Working in the slaughter-
	houses.

			JAKE
	Chicago! You been to Chicago? Was it 
	wonderful?

			MAL
		(remembering)
					No.

Paden walks into the light of the fire and pours himself a 
cup of coffee.

			EMMETT
	Where you been?

			PADEN
		(caught, vamps)
	Oh, I was just checking the, ah...
		(gestures vaguely 
			over his shoulder)
	...you know, lookin' in.

He concentrates on his coffee and moves away from the light. 
Mal, Emmett, and Jake exchange amused, knowing looks.

			JAKE
	Jeez, Paden, her old man ain't even 
	cold yet!

Mal and Emmett laugh.

EXT. ROLLING DESERT - DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS as the wagon train rolls westward.

Paden is driving Hannah's wagon; she sits beside him on the 
seat.

			PADEN
	He acted bravely out there, Hannah. 
	Just bad luck his getting hit. Could 
	have been any one of us.

			HANNAH
	I don't believe in luck. I know what 
	Conrad was like. Don't tell me what 
	you think I want to hear.

			PADEN
	Never will again.

			HANNAH
	We got married just before this trip, 
	so we could come out here and try 
	the land. It's hard to find a man 
	willing to take on a life like that.

She pauses and takes the reins from him.

			HANNAH
	Love isn't the only important thing.

Emmett rides up on Hannah's side and keeps pace beside them, 
smiling at the sight of the couple.

			EMMETT
	How you doing, m'am? Getting enough 
	help?

Hannah, caught between the two men, smiles.

			HANNAH
	More than enough.

			EMMETT
	Have you thought at all about your 
	plans?

			HANNAH
	Some. I've been talking to the 
	Parkers. One thing I know I'm not 
	doing -- I'm not going back.

OMIT

EXT. RIVER CROSSING (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

The wagon train splashes noisily across the river, drivers 
yelling loudly to urge on their teams. Emmett, Paden, Mal, 
and Jake, on horseback, direct the crossing.

EXT. APPROACHING SILVERADO - DAY

The wagon train is moving through pretty, rolling country. 
Mal rides up to join Emmett and Paden on point ahead of the 
train. In his hand is a yellowed letter. He points off to 
the south where a dramatic half-dome of rock towers above 
the hills.

			MAL
	This is it, gents. My ma told me to 
	head south past that rock.

			PADEN
	Good luck, Mal.

			EMMETT
	Maybe we'll see you sometime.

			MAL
		(doesn't think so)
	Yeah... maybe. So long.

He rides away, and he doesn't look back.

EXT. FORK OF THE ROAD (OUTSIDE SILVERADO) - DAY

A buckboard with a man and a young girl in it is stopped at 
the fork, its two occupants standing up and waving excitedly.

As the wagon train pulls to a halt, Hobart climbs down from 
the lead wagon and is embraced by the homesteader from the 
buckboard, BRADLEY.

Bradley points off along the right fork of the road as he 
speaks to Hobart.

			BRADLEY
	It's right down this road aways. 
	I'll ride in with you myself.
		(to the girl in the 
			buckboard)
	Carol, go spread the word our people 
	are here.

The girl, CAROL, whips the buckboard into motion and 
disappears down the road. Bradley is looking down the line 
of wagons.

			BRADLEY
	I thought there'd be more of you. 
	But I thank the Lord for each and 
	every one. We'll have a solid strip 
	of bottomland under the plow when 
	you people stake your claims.
		(a grim look at Hobart)
	And we're going to need every hand 
	to hold it.

AT HANNAH'S WAGON. Emmett has brought his horse up to face 
Hannah and, on horseback beside her wagon, Paden.

			EMMETT
	Hope to see you again, m'am.

She nods demurely.

			PADEN
	I think I'll ride along with the 
	lady here. Just take a look at this 
	farmland before I come into Silverado. 
	See what makes a trip this hard worth 
	taking.
		(catches Emmett's 
			amused look)
	I'll see you around.

			EMMETT
	I'll be around.

AT THE LEAD WAGON. Hobart has what might be tears in his 
eyes as he picks up the reins and looks at the countryside.

			HOBART
	I feel like I've arrived in Canaan.

			BRADLEY
	When we got here, we thought it was 
	Eden. And it's pretty close -- right 
	down to the serpents.

The wagon train moves out along the right fork of the road 
as Emmett and Jake, waving goodbye, ride straight ahead toward 
town.

EXT. ENTERING SILVERADO - DAY

Silverado is a sprawling, active, handsome frontier town, a 
cattle center and supply station for the burgeoning silver 
mines to the west. Emmett and Jake ride into town.

OMIT

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Mal comes around the shoulder of a hill and reins to a halt. 
He takes the yellowed letter from his pocket and checks a 
detail. He smiles at the stand of cottonwoods that marks his 
route. After all these years, he's excited to be approaching 
some kind of home. He hurries on.

EXT. LAND OFFICE/HOLLIS HOME (SILVERADO) - DAY

The land office is in the front of the first floor of the 
Hollis home, a separate, two-story structure on a side street.

Now we're looking down the porch as KATE HOLLIS embraces her 
brothers, Emmett and Jake. Her big, bear-like, gentle husband, 
J.T., comes out to add his greetings. After the laying on of 
hands, the attention of all four is drawn to the doorway and 
a figure we cannot yet see.

Now he steps shyly into view: eleven-year-old AUGIE. Jake 
makes a show of shaking Augie's hand, man to man. Emmett 
kneels to greet him at eye level; the boy's grown a lot in 
five years.

EXT. HILL - DAY

Mal reaches the top of the hill, a look of high expectation 
on his face. But now he pulls up sharply, his expression 
changing. Not what he expected.

Down below in a pretty, little valley that recently embraced 
a farm are hundreds of cattle, roaming free across the last 
remnants of the fields. And the burnt-out remains of a small 
farmhouse.

EXT. FARMHOUSE RUINS - DAY

Mal dismounts near the blackened timbers and walks into the 
ruins. He looks around in a daze: he's home, but there's no 
home there.

EXT. KNOLL ABOVE BRADLEY'S PLACE (HOMESTEADER LAND) - DUSK

Paden and Hannah are just reaching the top of the knoll. In 
the distance below them is Bradley's farm, in the barnyard 
of which the wagon train has pulled up for this first night.

			HANNAH
	Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to 
	join their parcel to mine. We'll 
	work them together.
		(she points)
	Mine starts right over there. It's 
	all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, 
	isn't it?

			PADEN
		(nods, looking at her)
	And a pretty lady.

She turns to face him with a clear-eyed gaze that is almost 
scary.

			HANNAH
	A lot of men have told me that. Maybe 
	it's true. I guess some women are 
	slow to believe it.

			PADEN
	Believe it.

			HANNAH
	They're drawn to me by that. But it 
	never lasts.

			PADEN
	Why?

			HANNAH
	Because they don't like what I want.

			PADEN
	What's that?

			HANNAH
		(turns back toward 
			her view)
	I want to build something, make things 
	grow. That takes hard work -- a 
	lifetime of it. That's not why men 
	come to a pretty woman.

He shakes his head, agreeing, though she cannot see it.

			HANNAH
	After a while, I won't be so pretty. 
	But this land will be.

She turns to face him again. He understands now as well as 
she that romance is not in their future. But friendship could 
be.

			PADEN
	Hannah, don't tell me what you think 
	I want to hear.

Hannah laughs with him.

EXT. FARMHOUSE RUINS - NIGHT

Mal has made a fire in the remains of the fireplace and is 
cooking food. As he sits back, he senses he is being watched. 
He turns. There at the edge of the light stands an old black 
man holding a Henry .44 rifle like Mal's -- his father, EZRA 
JOHNSON. The two men look at each other a long time.

			MAL
	Daddy?

			EZRA
	I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae 
	had come back to see me. But I never 
	thought it'd be my boy. I never 
	thought that.

Mal goes to him and encloses him in his arms.

			MAL
	Ma?

Ezra looks up at him and shakes his head.

			EZRA
	She was sick for a long time. She 
	was sick when she wrote you, but she 
	didn't say it. I never thought you'd 
	come. But she did.

Mal takes it hard. They move back to the fire together.

			MAL
	Where is Rae?

			EZRA
	She's gone, gone to town. She hated 
	working on the farm...
		(a bitter glance)
	...just like you.

			MAL
		(gestures)
	What happened?

			EZRA
	They run me off. They burned me out. 
	They made it so I couldn't do. Just 
	like Georgia. If you won't sell, 
	they take it anyway.

			MAL
	Who?

			EZRA
		(as though it were 
			obvious)
	The cattle! This valley runs down to 
	a clear creek. That's why we picked 
	this spot, and that's why they don't 
	want us here.

			MAL
	You own this land.

			EZRA
	I paid the government for it, all 
	right. That don't mean much out here.
		(he motions behind 
			him)
	Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat 
	in a cave in those hills. Hiding 
	out, afraid to walk my own land.

			MAL
	What about the law?

			EZRA
	Whose law? The law here runs a man 
	down -- just like these cattle.

Mal thinks about that and grows very angry. Finally --

			MAL
	That ain't right and I've had enough 
	of what ain't right.

INT. HOLLIS HOME (SILVERADO) - NIGHT

The group is finishing dinner in the kitchen/sitting room at 
the back of the ground floor. Augie is tooting the carved 
whistle pipe that Emmett has given him. Kate and Emmett begin 
to clear the dishes as Jake and J.T. continue to sit.

			JAKE
	I thought running the land office 
	would be easy work, J.T., but it 
	sounds like what you got here ain't 
	much fun.

			J.T.
	We got a bad situation here, and 
	those homesteaders you brought in 
	with you are going to make it worse.
		(indicates front of 
			house)
	When they come into this office to 
	stake their claims, I think it's 
	going to be the start of real trouble. 
	They're going to cut McKendrick off 
	on the north.

			KATE
	J.T.'s done everything he can. I 
	married a brave man. Augie, take 
	that delightful gift your uncle gave 
	you out of here while we're talking.
		(back to others)
	McKendrick picked the new sheriff 
	himself, so J.T. can't even get the 
	law enforced.

			J.T.
	Half the gunslingers that drift into 
	town turn up on our police force.

			EMMETT
	A man could die of thirst before 
	anybody offered him a drink around 
	here.

J.T. pulls a bottle of whiskey from a cabinet and sets up 
three glasses, but Kate pantomimes for him to add one for 
her.

			EMMETT
	Maybe you all ought to come to 
	California with Jake and me.
		(across the room)
	How 'bout it, Augie, you want to go 
	with us?

			AUGIE
	Sure!

			JAKE
	You know, Augie, there are no schools 
	in California.

			AUGIE
		(aglow)
	Really?

			KATE
	Augie's going to grow up here. There's 
	nothing wrong with the land, it's 
	just some of the people.

			J.T.
	The problem is, Emmett, you killed 
	the wrong McKendrick.

			KATE
	Why, J.T., watch what you're saying 
	around Augie. Emmett didn't kill 
	anybody.

			EMMETT
	Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure 
	enough, but I think you'd have to 
	say I killed old Murdo. I think that's 
	definitely the word.

			JAKE
	It was my fault.

			KATE
	It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those 
	McKendricks don't know how to act 
	like human beings.

			J.T.
	His son is worse than he was. He's 
	smoother, so you don't always hear 
	him coming, but he'll do anything to 
	keep his range free.

			KATE
		(intensely)
	I'm worried what he's going to do 
	when he finds out you boys are back.

Emmett puts his arm around her.

			EMMETT
	I think Jake here can take care of 
	himself. I did five years I didn't 
	owe. McKendrick ought to be satisfied 
	with that and let it lie.

Kate looks between her brothers. She is not reassured.

EXT. FARMHOUSE RUINS - NIGHT

Having smothered the fire, Mal mounts up, then reaches down 
to pull his father onto the horse behind him. They begin 
picking their way through the cattle when two night-riding 
cowboys, RED and SCRUFFY, approach through the gloom.

			RED
	Is that you, Ezra?

			SCRUFFY
		(to his mate, jovially)
	You see pretty good, Red. Is there 
	one or two of them?
		(He laughs)
	What brings you out of your hole, 
	Johnson?

			RED
	We're going to find that place one 
	of these days. Who you got with you, 
	Ezra?

			EZRA
	This is my son. He's come home.

			SCRUFFY
	Ain't that sweet, Red? I'm afraid 
	you boys are trespassing on McKendrick 
	land.

			MAL
	You got it all wrong, mister. This 
	is our place.

			RED
	What? Mr. McKendrick bought this 
	place from your father.

			EZRA
	That's a lie.

			MAL
	Tomorrow we're going to town to 
	straighten that out once and for 
	all. The next day we'll be back 
	here... farming. And these cattle 
	better be gone.

The two cowboys are taken aback. They look to each other for 
guidance.

			MAL
	If I find any cattle on our land 
	after tomorrow, I'm going to start 
	carving them into steaks. And believe 
	me, that's one thing I know about.

			SCRUFFY
	Killing cattle is a hanging offense 
	in these parts. If we shot you down 
	right now, we'd be within our rights.

			MAL
	Mister, you ever seen what a Henry 
	rifle can do in the hands of someone 
	who knows how to use it?

The two cowboys tense, their gun hands flexing.

			SCRUFFY
	Who would that be? You?

Behind Mal, Ezra lowers the barrel of his own Henry toward 
the cowboys and cocks it. He looks like a man coming back to 
life. The two cowboys are dumbfounded. They turn and start 
to ride away. Scruffy shouts back at them --

			SCRUFFY
	This ain't the end of it!

			MAL
		(to Ezra)
	We're going to get your land back, 
	Daddy... our land.

			EZRA
		(marvelling at events)
	Maybe we will! Maybe we will! 
		(pause)
	After all, I never thought I'd get 
	my son back.

EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Paden rides along the dark street, drawn irresistibly toward 
the thinking MUSIC, lights, and hubbub of the big saloon -- 
The Midnight Star.

INT. MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Paden comes in and looks around with some pleasure. It's an 
expansive place, busy now with gamblers, drinkers, and 
brightly-dressed saloon girls. A piano player bangs away in 
the corner. Paden has to smile. This is the way a saloon 
ought to be. Now, even Paden is home.

Paden walks up to stand at the bar. The BARTENDER is busy at 
the far end of the bar. Paden is patiently waiting to get 
his attention when he hears a woman's voice behind him, on 
his side of the bar.

			STELLA (O.S.)
	What can I do you for, stranger?

Paden turns to face his interlocutor, but at first cannot 
find her. After a moment, though, he looks down to see a 
small woman in a velvet dress -- STELLA.

			PADEN
	You work here?

			STELLA
	I run the place. What can I get you?

She is already moving away toward the near end of the bar. 
He watches her disappear around the end, then sees the top 
of her head appear behind the bar down there. As she moves 
back toward him, she gets taller and taller, until she is 
facing him eye to eye across the bar.

			PADEN
	Bourbon.

As she reaches under the bar and produces bottle and glass, 
Paden leans over and peeks behind the bar. A foot-wide ramp 
runs the length of it.

			PADEN
	Nifty.

			STELLA
		(smiles)
	The world is what you make of it, 
	friend. If it doesn't fit, you make 
	alterations.

			PADEN
	I'll drink to that. Will you join 
	me, Miss --

			STELLA
	Stella.

			PADEN
	Paden.

Stella sets up a glass for herself, and they shake hands. 
Paden looks up at a carved ornamental star on the back wall, 
over the words "The Midnight Star".

			PADEN
	Stella... Are you the midnight star 
	herself?

			STELLA
	I am. I'm always there, but I only 
	shine at night.

A saloon girl -- a lovely, young, black woman -- RAE passes 
with some drinks. Paden watches her go, then looks around 
the room.

			PADEN
	My compliments to you, Miss Stella. 
	This is what I call a saloon.

			STELLA
	Thanks. That's what I call it too.

			PADEN
	And I know what I'm talking about.

			STELLA
	You like a good saloon?

			PADEN
	It's the only place I'm happy.

			STELLA
	Me too. What's wrong with us?

Their eyes meet for a moment, and a real connection is made.

			PADEN
	You wouldn't be needing any help 
	around here, would you? Maybe with 
	the gambling?

			STELLA
		(points)
	You see that fellow over there in 
	the gray coat?

Paden nods, and now we see him too: a big man in some gambler-
like finery -- KELLY. He is leaning over a poker game.

			STELLA
	That's Kelly, my so-called partner. 
	He runs that side.

			PADEN
	So-called?

			STELLA
	Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, 
	lying cheat, he's just the man I 
	would have picked.

			PADEN
	Why'd you go into business with him?

			STELLA
	I don't own this place. The man who 
	does stuck me with Kelly.

			PADEN
	Who's the owner?

			STELLA
	Here he comes right now.

Stella nods toward the door, and Paden turns to look. Cobb 
enters through the swinging doors. He looks around with a 
proprietary air as he walks to the bar. He is almost there 
before his gaze settles on Paden and Stella. He stops in his 
tracks, and a big grin splits his face.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Well, look at this! Two of my favorite 
	people in the world, talking to each 
	other.

Cobb moves up and puts an arm around Paden as he shakes his 
hand. Stella is interested in this connection, but she doesn't 
faze easily. Paden is the surprised one.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Stella, this is one of my oldest 
	surviving friends. Treat him right.

			STELLA
	That was my plan.

			SHERIFF COBB
		(laughs)
	Oh, yeah, you two are going to get 
	along fine. You got a lot in common.

Cobb looks across the room and yells.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Kelly, get over here.
		(to Paden)
	You didn't come all this way just to 
	pay me back that money, did you?
		(turns to Kelly)
	Kelly, meet my friend Paden.

			KELLY
		(cool)
	Howdy.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Give the man a line of credit. He 
	already owes the house thirteen bucks.

Kelly casts a wary, appraising glance over Paden, nods, and 
moves off.

			SHERIFF COBB
	You got a place to stay?

			PADEN
	I just got to town.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Stella, we still got an extra room 
	out back, don't we?

			STELLA
	It's not in use at the moment.

Cobb comes around the end of the bar to stand next to Stella.

			SHERIFF COBB
	What brings you into my saloon?

			PADEN
	Luck, I guess.

			SHERIFF COBB
		(cackles at this)
	Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd 
	changed your mind about the job.

			PADEN
	You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.

Cobb looks at Paden a long time and laughs.

			SHERIFF COBB
	That ain't the half of it, friend.

He turns away, taking off his coat, and hangs it on a peg 
back there. When he turns back, rolling up his sleeves, our 
eyes are drawn to the same thing as Paden's: a shiny, silver 
sheriff's star.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Welcome to heaven.

INT. CAVE - MORNING

Mal is asleep on some hay in the small cave his father has 
fixed up as a hideout and home. A shadow falls across him.

Ezra stands looking at his son with loving eyes. In his hands 
are a water bucket and his Henry rifle. Now he turns quietly 
away.

EXT. CAVE - MORNING

Ezra emerges. From here, it would be impossible to tell that 
the cave was inhabited. Except that, on this morning, Mal's 
horse is tied nearby. Ezra looks around cautiously and moves 
off into the rocks.

EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - MORNING

Ezra picks his way among the boulders warily.

EXT. MOUNTAIN SPRING - MORNING

Ezra comes out of the surrounding rocks and goes to the edge 
of the spring. A stream runs off downhill from the pool. He 
props the rifle against a rock and bends to drink from the 
spring. He hears something and turns quickly. What he sees 
makes him reach for the rifle, but the sound of several GUNS 
COCKING freezes him inches from it.

There are four Cowboys, McKendrick's men, emerging from their 
hiding places. Their eyes search the surrounding rocks. 
Scruffy and Red, the cowboys from the previous night, are 
there, but the leader is HOYT.

			HOYT
	Where's the other one, Johnson?

Ezra is silent.

			HOYT
	You couldn't leave well enough alone, 
	could you, old man?
		(resigned)
	Our orders are to run you two off. 
	If you tell us where your son is, we 
	won't have to do any shooting.

			EZRA
	You're lying, Hoyt... like always.

			HOYT
	Not this time. I got my orders.

Ezra thinks a moment, looks over at Scruffy, then back to 
Hoyt.

			EZRA
	My son's on his way to town.

			HOYT
	That's too bad. You'll have to go by 
	yourself.

INT. CAVE - MORNING

The distant ROAR OF GUNS echoes in the small space. Mal awakes 
with a start. Did he dream it? He looks around.

			MAL
	Daddy?

EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - MORNING

Mal, rifle in hand and frantic, is lost among the rocks. Now 
he stops, listening. He hears HOOFBEATS. He scrambles to the 
top of a boulder and looks down.

WHAT HE SEES. The four Cowboys far below are riding away 
from the base of the hill.

EXT. MOUNTAIN SPRING - MORNING

Mal comes out of the rocks. Ezra's rifle is no longer propped 
where he left it. Ezra is gone. Mal rushes to the edge of 
the spring, in agony. He looks around desperately, and then 
freezes.

Ezra's dead body is floating away down the mountain stream. 
Mal splashes into the water, tripping and sliding on the 
slippery rocks. Finally, he is able to reach Ezra. Mal sits 
in the water and hugs his father to him.

INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

Only a few customers. Early light streams in over gambling 
tables draped with dust covers. Stella is busy behind the 
bar. Paden and Emmett are nursing cups of coffee at a table.

			PADEN
	Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but 
	she's got a hard idea for living.

			EMMETT
		(doesn't follow)
	Yeah?

			PADEN
	All I'm saying is, you won't trip 
	over me if you look her up.

			EMMETT
		(understands, but --)
	I'm going to California with my 
	brother.

Cobb comes in the swinging doors, heading for the bar. Paden 
waves him over.

			PADEN
	Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. 
	He's a friend of mine.
		(to Emmett)
	This is Sheriff Cobb.

			EMMETT
		(shaking hands)
	Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

			SHERIFF COBB
		(interested)
	Pleasure is mine. Always happy to 
	meet a friend of Paden's.
		(yelling to Stella)
	Stella, bring Kelly out here, will 
	you?

Cobb turns back to Emmett with an odd smile on his face.

			SHERIFF COBB
	You're Kate Hollis' brother, aren't 
	you?
		(Emmett nods)
	You're the one who killed old Murdo 
	McKendrick.

Paden watches as the two men let that hang between them.

			EMMETT
	Didn't have much choice. He was about 
	to shoot my brother in the back.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Can't be having that now can we?

Stella appears with Kelly, who speaks to Cobb.

			KELLY
	You wanted to see me?

			SHERIFF COBB
	We're going to make some adjustments. 
	I wanted you to be here when I offered 
	Paden your job. I think he could do 
	it without getting greedy. Stella 
	and I are tired of you skimming our 
	profits.

Stella is surprised. The charge is true, but she didn't know 
this was coming.

			KELLY
	What are you talking about?

			SHERIFF COBB
	I'm done talking. Get out.

			KELLY
	You can't do this.

			SHERIFF COBB
		(smiling)
	Really?

Without warning Cobb hits Kelly viciously in the stomach. 
Stella jumps. Cobb grabs the doubled-over Kelly by the hair 
and the belt, and propels him out of the saloon, letting go 
before Kelly crashes through the swinging doors and into the 
street. Cobb comes back toward the table as though nothing 
had happened.

			SHERIFF COBB
	How about it, Paden? You want the 
	job?

Paden, considering, glances at the still swinging doors.

			PADEN
	I see you're an understanding boss.

Cobb chuckles, picks up Paden's coffee cup, and takes a sip.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Nothing like that will happen between 
	us.

			PADEN
	Maybe we ought to ask Stella.

He turns toward her. She likes the idea.

			STELLA
	You'd be welcome.

She is smiling at him warmly when suddenly her eyes shift, 
her expression changes, and she screams --

			STELLA
	No, Kelly! He'll kill you!

Cobb is already in motion. He spins, drawing his gun, and 
fires repeatedly at the swinging doors. Kelly has been aiming 
over them and is blasted back into the street as the slats 
splinter. Cobb holsters his gun. The coffee cup is still in 
his other hand. He takes a final sip, puts the cup down, and 
licks a spilled drop off his thumb.

Stella is repulsed. Cobb fixes her with a malevolent look, 
and his tone is icy --

			SHERIFF COBB
	Thanks for warning me.

Stella rushes out to the street, as Emmett and Paden get up. 
Emmett and Cobb are very close for one moment.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Didn't have much choice.

They go out through the gathering crowd.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Down the street a stagecoach is rolling into town. Cobb steps 
off the porch to kneel beside Kelly's body. He looks across 
at the already-kneeling Stella.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I never enjoy killing a man.

Stella stands, so for a moment she is taller than he. She 
stalks back into the saloon.

The stagecoach has pulled up across the street. A tall, lanky 
gambler has disembarked and now walks toward the saloon, 
carrying his heavy satchel. He moves through the assembled 
people until he is standing over Kelly's body. This is SLICK.

			SLICK
	Excuse me, Sheriff. I'm a gambler 
	who would like to run an honest game 
	in your town. To whom do I speak 
	about that?
		(glances down)
	I hope it's not this gentleman.

Cobb likes his style. He smiles and turns to indicate Paden.

			SHERIFF COBB
	That's him.

Paden and Cobb exchange looks for a second. Then Cobb is 
bustling off.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I gotta get somebody to clean up 
	this mess.

Emmett and Paden watch Cobb move down the street.

			EMMETT
	You used to ride with that guy?

Paden looks at Emmett, then down at Kelly.

EXT. REAR OF HOLLIS HOME - DAY

Jake unhitches the pinto and begins to lead it away. Suddenly, 
Augie appears from nowhere on the back porch, jumps up to 
the railing, and leaps out toward the pinto's back -- just 
as Jake did in the escape from Turley. But Augie misses and 
lands in the dirt. Jake, irritated, watches the child dust 
himself off.

			JAKE
	What're you doing? I told you to 
	practice with a horse that's not 
	moving.

Jake turns and starts away. Augie runs after him.

			AUGIE
	Where you going?

			JAKE
	I got things to do, kid. I'm a busy 
	man.

			AUGIE
	I'll go with you.

			JAKE
		(stops, looks at him)
	A grown man can't have a little boy 
	with him everywhere he goes.

Jake walks away. Augie watches, then yells --

			AUGIE
	Who's a grown man?

INT. SUPPLY ROOM - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Stella works at the spigots of some large kegs, filling empty 
bottles with a portion of whiskey, diluting them with water, 
and corking them. Paden comes in and watches her. She hands 
him a bottle to cork and starts the process again as he shakes 
it.

			PADEN
	Is this a fair mix?

			STELLA
	I'm saving lives here. The straight 
	stuff would raise a blood blister on 
	boot leather.

			PADEN
	I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.

They share a smile. Paden takes down a fancier bottle from a 
shelf, examining the label.

			PADEN
	What's this?

			STELLA
	That's the good stuff.

			PADEN
	Oh, yeah? How good?

She understands him and produces two glasses with a grin.

			PADEN
		(pouring the drinks)
	Here's to the good stuff.

Stella lifts her glass, sealing the bond.

			STELLA
	May it last a long time.

Before they can drink, the Bartender bursts in.

			BARTENDER
	You better get out here.

INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

The room is crowded but silent, frozen. Near the middle of 
the bar the sexy, young, saloon girl, PHOEBE, stands 
frightened between Jake and Tyree, the mean fellow we saw 
released at Chimayo -- now a deputy for Sheriff Cobb. The 
two men appear about to draw.

			PHOEBE
	Nothing happened, Tyree. This is my 
	job.

			TYREE
	Shut up.

			JAKE
	I don't believe a lady has to explain 
	anything to a man this ugly.

Slick watches from a card table nearby, with Rae standing 
beside him. Now his hand drops casually from the curve of 
her rear to the vicinity of his boot.

Paden and Stella come up on opposite sides of the bar, him 
in front. Paden sees everything in the room: Tyree's friends, 
Deputies Kyle and GARTH, are behind Jake and clearly poised 
to kill him if Tyree fails.

			PADEN
	What's the problem here?

			TYREE
		(with venom)
	Stay out of it, Paden.

			STELLA
	He can't do that, Tyree. Cobb's hired 
	him.

			TYREE
	That's Cobb's mistake.

			STELLA
	Come out of there, Phoebe. You've 
	done enough.

As Phoebe starts to move from between the men, Tyree grabs 
her viciously by the arm. In the instant of that movement, 
Paden's hand flashes out and draws Tyree's Colt out of its 
holster from behind. Garth and Kyle tense as Tyree whirls on 
Paden, eyes flaming. But his own gun is pointed at his chest.

			PADEN
	Get out of here, Jake.

			JAKE
	All I did was kiss the girl.

			PADEN
	That's what you said in Turley. You 
	remember how that ended.

			JAKE
	What's the matter, Paden? You afraid 
	I couldn't get those two behind me?

			PADEN
	I don't want you getting anyone in 
	my place.

Jake looks at Paden, who motions him out with the gun. Jake 
starts to move grudgingly, but first flashes Phoebe a big 
"see you later" look. He goes out.

			TYREE
		(to Paden)
	I should have killed you a long time 
	ago.

Paden flips the gun in his grasp and hands it to Tyree, butt 
first.

			PADEN
	Why not now?

The situation is now totally reversed, and no one can quite 
believe it. Tyree cocks the gun. At the poker table Slick 
lifts his pant leg, revealing the handle of a custom-made 
dagger secreted in his boot.

			STELLA
	Don't do it, Tyree. I just lost a 
	partner. If you kill him, I'll never 
	get anyone to work here.

Tyree considers for a moment, then holsters his gun. To Stella --

			TYREE
	Better start looking.

He goes out. Garth and Kyle follow. Phoebe hurries away from 
Stella's hard look. Slick relaxes. The piano kicks in. Paden 
leans against the bar toward Stella.

			STELLA
	You really are a gambler.

			PADEN
	Give me some of the good stuff.

EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - DAY

A door opens on the upstairs porch and Rae emerges, giggling 
and buttoning her dress. A hand reaches out and pulls her 
back inside for another squealing embrace. She pushes herself 
free and comes outside again, then starts down the exterior 
stairs. She is almost to the bottom when she stops suddenly.

Mal stands at the bottom of the stairs. They look at each 
other a long time. Conflicting emotions race across Rae's 
face, but the winner is cold anger.

			MAL
	Hello, Rae.

			RAE
	What are you doing here? I thought 
	you were done with our family.

			MAL
	Daddy's dead.

Rae seems to sway, then sits down on the stairs above Mal. 
For a moment she is somewhere else, but when she returns, 
her look is as hard as before.

			MAL
	He was murdered.

			RAE
	Who did it?

			MAL
	I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And 
	when I am sure, they're going to 
	pay.

			RAE
		(bitter)
	Oh that's just fine. Where were you 
	when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's 
	too late, Mal. Now you finally show 
	up and all you can think of is to 
	get yourself killed.

Now Slick comes down the stairs behind Rae, pulling on his 
jacket. Mal glares at him; this is who can buy his sister 
now.

			SLICK
	Are you all right, Rae?

			RAE
	Yeah, I'm okay.

Slick seems unperturbed by Mal's glare. To Rae --

			SLICK
	Will you introduce me to your friend?

			RAE
	He's not my friend. He used to be my 
	brother.

			SLICK
		(offers his hand to 
			Mal)
	Calvin Stanhope... but my mother 
	called me Slick.

Mal just looks at the proffered hand. Slick retracts it 
without offense.

			SLICK
	I know what you're thinking, mister, 
	but I think Rae's a special lady. 
	Excuse me.

Slick comes down past Mal and moves off. Mal watches him go, 
then turns to Rae.

			MAL
	What are you doing here, Rae? This 
	ain't for you.

			RAE
	It's none of your business.

			MAL
	Rae, all we got is each other.

			RAE
		(standing up)
	I don't have any family any more.

She brushes past him and is gone.

OMIT

EXT. BRADLEY'S PLACE - NIGHT

Carol, Bradley's daughter, and a Friend are playing on the 
roof of the farmhouse, above the noisy activity of the 
welcoming celebration. Now Bradley steps into the foreground.

			BRADLEY
	Don't fall off of there, you fools!

			HOBART
	Might do them some good, Daniel. I 
	wasn't worth a damn until I fell off 
	the barn on my head.

The two men turn to look at the dancing. It's a festive scene 
all around: tables are laden with food near a large bonfire, 
a few of the covered wagons are pulled up nearby, children 
dart about before the pick-up band of musicians.

Now we see, here among the sodbusters, whirling by with a 
comely lass, Jake, looking mighty slim without his double 
gunbelt. He and his partner glide by Emmett, who stands 
shouting over the din with Hannah and Mr. and MRS. PARKER.

			MRS. PARKER
	Hannah's the hardest-working gal I 
	ever saw.

			MR. PARKER
	It's going to be all right.

			EMMETT
	I wish you the best, Mrs. Parker.

Mr. Parker twirls his wife off into the dance. Emmett and 
Hannah, a slightly awkward couple, stroll away from the music. 
This is the first time Emmett has seemed less than certain.

			EMMETT
	The Parkers seem like nice folks.

			HANNAH
	They've been kind to me.

			EMMETT
		(after a few steps)
	Paden sends his best.

			HANNAH
		(smiles)
	I guess I put a good scare into him.

Emmett smiles in agreement.

			HANNAH
	I'm surprised to see you out here 
	tonight.

			EMMETT
	I just came out to say goodbye.

			HANNAH
		(stopped)
	Goodbye?

			EMMETT
	Yeah, me and Jake will be heading 
	out for California soon.

Hannah is silent for a moment. She sits down at one of the 
tables and looks at him. For the first time there is a 
softness in her voice.

			HANNAH
	You came all the way out here to 
	tell me you're going to California? 
	All you had to do was go, and we'd 
	never see each other again.

			EMMETT
	That's why I'm here.

She gives him an odd look, a soft challenge to his reticence.

			HANNAH
	Why?

He sits down beside her and looks at his boots.

			EMMETT
	You don't make it easy on a fellow.

			HANNAH
	Didn't Paden tell you that?

Emmett smiles at that and looks into her lovely eyes. After 
a long moment --

			HANNAH
	Maybe you thought you'd be back this 
	way someday.

			EMMETT
	Yeah... that must have been it.

UP ON THE ROOF of the farmhouse, Carol is yelling and 
gesturing to her oblivious father below, while her Friend 
stares frozen into the night.

Jake is wiping his brow as he stands at the edge of the 
dancers. He looks up at Carol quizzically.

Only now do we hear it, over the din of the music: the THUNDER 
of hooves. Out of the night, streaming around the farm 
buildings, comes a horde of masked Cowboys, McKendrick's 
men. They send up a horrible yell and begin firing their 
weapons in the air.

Their arrival is so sudden that the celebrants are frozen in 
their places, mothers hugging children to them, men far from 
their weapons. There are SCREAMS.

Emmett grabs a panicked child from the path of the horses 
and moves back, passing her to Hannah. He's trying to gauge 
his response in the midst of all these innocents.

Two Cowboys have roped opposite ends of a section of fence 
and now pull the deadly drag, already thick with ravaged 
corn, through the barnyard, knocking over everything in its 
path.

Jake slides through the chaos toward his gunbelt, hung on a 
peg on the barn wall.

A Cowboy pulls the gate from the pigsty, and the pigs squeal 
out. Another Cowboy begins shooting them with a Henry rifle. 
On the roof, Carol looks in horror at the death of her prize 
sow.

Emmett is herding as many Settlers as he can toward the cover 
of the barn.

Bradley edges toward the door of his farmhouse.

Hobart is urging some women between two wagons. A Cowboy 
rides by and kicks him viciously.

Hoyt pulls up, looks around, then gestures to some of his 
men. Two Cowboys with prepared torches in their hands ride 
up to the bonfire and swing low, lighting their firebrands. 
One moves ahead toward the farmhouse, reins his horse, and 
heaves the torch high in the air toward the roof on which 
the two children perch.

In the air, the tumbling flame suddenly explodes at the ROAR 
of a shotgun. Sparks shower harmlessly to the ground.

Bradley has shot it out of the air with one barrel of his 
shotgun. The blast has created a momentary, shocked lull in 
the attack. Bradley looks wild.

Emmett watches, fearful. His hand is on his gun.

Hoyt looks at Bradley. Bradley swings the shotgun around 
toward the other torch-bearer.

The Cowboy who tossed the first torch shoots Bradley dead. 
Carol screams.

Emmett looks across the yard at Jake, who steps out from the 
cowering homesteaders, a gun in each hand. Emmett draws and 
kills the man who shot Bradley. Now all the Settlers hit the 
dirt.

Jake fires from both hands repeatedly. One Cowboy dies and 
another takes it in the arm. The man who was shooting the 
pigs swings his rifle around toward Jake, and Emmett kills 
him with one shot.

Hoyt reacts big to the presence of deadly wolves in the midst 
of these sheep. He peers through the tumult, trying to see 
their faces. His Cowboys are shooting wildly into the crowd 
now, but he rides through them, signalling a retreat.

Emmett jumps from the top of a fence to the roof of the house, 
the Henry rifle in his hand. He scrambles to the peak of the 
roof, where the two children still cower. Bracing the rifle 
on the chimney, he takes careful aim. Once... twice... he 
fires. One Cowboy dead, one wounded and fleeing.

Hannah runs up to the riderless horse of a fallen Cowboy and 
pulls a rifle from its scabbard. She cocks it and fires off 
at the retreating Cowboys. Jake mounts a horse Pony Express-
style and rides out of the barnyard.

OMIT

EXT. BRADLEY'S PLACE - NIGHT

LATER. Emmett lowers a weeping Carol to the ground. The girl 
rushes toward her fallen father and her mother, who cradles 
the body. Hobart intercepts the girl, trying to shield her 
from the sight. Emmett's eyes meet Hobart's. Hobart lets 
Carol go.

Emmett walks through the devastation to where Hannah stands 
dazed, rifle still in hand. Emmett puts his arm around her. 
She jumps at his touch, then moves against him. Jake rides 
into the barnyard and up to Emmett. He is flushed.

			JAKE
	There's two more out there walking 
	home, if they can walk.

Emmett's gaze is caught by something across the barnyard. 
Hannah follows his gaze.

Mr. Parker stumbles out of the darkness at the side of the 
barn, sobbing. Hannah breaks from Emmett and rushes to Mr. 
Parker. When she is beside him, she freezes, staring into 
the shadows.

Emmett watches.

EXT. ALLEY/STREET - SILVERADO - DAY

Augie is standing circus-style on the saddle of the pinto as 
he rides down the alley. As he approaches the main street, 
his foot slips, and he bumps down hard into the saddle. The 
horse is barely in his control as he bounces out into the 
busier thoroughfare, and into the path of -- An imposing 
phalanx of four horsemen: Hoyt, Scruffy, SWANN, and their 
boss, ETHAN MCKENDRICK. The pinto shies as the horsemen pull 
up abruptly.

			AUGIE
	Sorry 'bout that.

Swann looks with interest at the pinto, then reaches out and 
grabs the reins from Augie's hand.

			AUGIE
	Hey!

			SWANN
	Where'd you get this horse, kid?

			AUGIE
	This is my uncle's horse.

			SWANN
	The hell it is.

			MCKENDRICK
		(irritable)
	What's the problem, Swann?

Emmett steps off the sidewalk on the other side of the street 
and approaches the group, his eyes on McKendrick.

			EMMETT
	Yeah, what's the problem?

McKendrick turns at the sound of Emmett's voice. Something 
powerful flicks through his eyes, but not too many people 
would see it.

			MCKENDRICK
	Emmett.

			EMMETT
	McKendrick.

Hoyt eyes Emmett, who seems familiar. Emmett looks at Swann 
in such a way that Swann releases the reins of the pinto.

			MCKENDRICK
	I didn't know you were out.

			EMMETT
	Did it seem short to you?

McKendrick reacts to Emmett's tone.

			MCKENDRICK
	That's all over as far as I'm 
	concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.

			EMMETT
	Sounds good.

			MCKENDRICK
	All right then.
		(to his men)
	Let's go.

			SWANN
	Mr. McKendrick, don't you recognize 
	that pinto?

			MCKENDRICK
		(doesn't)
	What?

			SWANN
	That's Lee's horse.

			HOYT
	Shut up, Swann.

Now McKendrick understands. He avoids Emmett's gaze and speaks 
to Swann.

			MCKENDRICK
	Forget it.

			EMMETT
	Wait a minute. Get down off of there, 
	Augie.

Augie hops down as Emmett takes the reins. Emmett gives Augie 
a look and a small nod, and the boy steps away.

Emmett looks once again at the distinctive brand on the 
pinto's flank, a circle with two wavy lines beneath it. Now 
he leads the pinto around beside McKendrick's horse so he 
can see the brand on that animal. McKendrick has to twist in 
his saddle to watch Emmett. The brands are the same. Emmett 
looks up at McKendrick. Things are clear between them.

			EMMETT
	The man who lost this horse must 
	have been working for you. I should 
	have known. But you changed your 
	brand, Ethan.

McKendrick's tone is different now --

			MCKENDRICK
	A lot of things changed when my father 
	died.

Emmett lays the reins of the pinto across the front of 
McKendrick's saddle, but they might just as well be a 
gauntlet. McKendrick picks them up. He and his men move down 
the street. Emmett walks over and takes Augie beneath his 
arm.

DOWN THE STREET. Hoyt rides close to McKendrick but looks 
back over his shoulder.

			HOYT
	Mr. McKendrick, he was one of them 
	last night at Bradley's.

McKendrick reacts: more bad news.

INT. LAND OFFICE - DAY

J.T. supervises the newly-arrived Settlers as they file their 
homestead claims. There is a battle-weary but resolved air 
to the group after the night attack. They are going to stick 
it out. The last step in the filing process is to sign in a 
large register. Mr. Parker signs and moves away. Hannah steps 
up for her turn. Her face is a little harder today, but her 
hand is steady.

EXT. LAND OFFICE/HOLLIS HOUSE - DAY

Several of the Settlers' wagons are here, guarded by vigilant, 
armed men. Their attitude has become more wary, siege-like. 
Parker climbs onto a wagon. Hannah is about to follow when 
Emmett approaches with Augie, who runs off around the house. 
Several of the Settlers greet Emmett warmly. Emmett looks 
closely at Hannah's face.

			EMMETT
	Are you all right?

			HANNAH
	This is a brutal land.

			EMMETT
	You must have known that before you 
	came.

			HANNAH
	It's one thing to know it...

She looks off, then bitterly --

			HANNAH
	We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.
		(with an edge)
	He said he'd... look into it.
		(Emmett understands)
	I can't believe he's the law out 
	here. Now I see why you all wear 
	guns.

			EMMETT
	How's Mr. Parker doing?

			HANNAH
	Just like you'd think. But he's not 
	going to run. We're sticking to our 
	plan. Now we both need help.

Emmett looks her over. He's not liking her any less.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - SILVERADO JAIL - DAY

Cobb sits with his boots up on his desk. McKendrick sits in 
the shadows across the room.

			SHERIFF COBB
	He must be pretty good.

			MCKENDRICK
	He's good, all right. Too good for 
	my men. That's why you've got to 
	take care of it.

			SHERIFF COBB
	What about his brother?

			MCKENDRICK
	We'll handle that. He's careless.

Cobb looks out the window.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Things are getting messy around here.
		(he looks at McKendrick)
	I hear Ezra Johnson got himself 
	killed.

			MCKENDRICK
	I heard that too.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Did you hear his son is still around?

McKendrick reacts to that, and Cobb can't suppress a smile. 
McKendrick sees it and stands up.

			MCKENDRICK
	Cobb, looks like you're finally going 
	to earn your money.

INT. OFFICE - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Stella and Cobb have been dividing the receipts between them. 
Cobb puts another sum in a leather pouch.

			SHERIFF COBB
	This'll be for Paden.

Stella is impressed by the amount. Cobb notes her reaction.

			SHERIFF COBB
	It's an advance. We want him to know 
	he's going to be happy here.

			STELLA
	I wouldn't worry about that.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I thought you two would get along.

Cobb opens the office door and holds it for Stella.

INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Cobb and Stella come out into the saloon, which is not yet 
crowded. Stella moves up her ramp behind the bar as Cobb 
walks along in front of it.

			STELLA
	From what I've seen, Paden doesn't 
	care much about money.

			SHERIFF COBB
	He says he doesn't care about 
	anything, but he does. There's just 
	no telling what it's going to be.

Slick is standing at the bar. Cobb settles in next to him. 
They nod at each other.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Howdy, Mr. Slick.

			SLICK
	Sheriff.

Cobb turns to Stella, who has put a bottle before him and is 
pouring Cobb and herself drinks. Cobb seems to be including 
Slick in the following story, though he addresses Stella.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Let me tell you about your friend 
	Paden. Me and him and Tyree and a 
	few other boys did a good bit of 
	riding together a few years back. 
	Business, you know, and business was 
	pretty good. We were moving around a 
	lot, the way you have to in that 
	work, and somewhere along the line 
	we picked up this dog. One of the 
	boys took to feeding it, so it 
	followed us everywhere. Anyway, this 
	one time we were leaving a little 
	Missouri town in quite a hurry, with 
	a bunch of the locals on our tails. 
	The dog somehow got tangled up with 
	Tyree's horse and Tyree went flying. 
	Tyree was pretty mad when he jumped 
	up, so he shot the dog. Didn't kill 
	him, though. Before you know it, 
	Paden's off his horse and holding 
	the dog. He'd gone all strange on 
	us. Said we should go on without 
	him. I thought he was kidding at 
	first. But he wasn't. Tyree was ready 
	to plug 'em both. And all this with 
	the posse coming down on us. Here I 
	thought we were pals after all that 
	riding. And suddenly he's more worried 
	about a mutt. So we did like he asked 
	and left him. He went to jail for a 
	dog.

Stella has been listening intently. Now her glance shifts: 
Paden has walked up beside Cobb. Cobb lifts his glass to 
Paden with a grin, but speaks to Stella.

			SHERIFF COBB
	And you want to hear the funny part? 
	Paden didn't even like the damn dog.

Paden gives Cobb an odd glance but smiles.

			PADEN
	It evened out in the end. They locked 
	me up, but the dog sprung me.

Cobb and Slick laugh, but Stella just watches Paden.

			STELLA
	Where's the dog now?

			PADEN
	He left me.

Cobb takes the bottle and a couple glasses.

			SHERIFF COBB
	C'mon, Paden, I'll buy you a drink.

Cobb leads Paden to a table in the corner. As Paden sits 
down, Cobb drops the pouch on the table. Paden glances at 
the contents as Cobb pours the drinks.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I took out thirteen dollars.

			PADEN
	This is a lot of money.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I told you this was a sweet set-up.

			PADEN
	It is that.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Maybe you could run it without Stella.

Paden looks sharply at Cobb. With some heat --

			PADEN
	This is her life. I'll go before she 
	does.

Cobb is amused but not surprised.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Easy, boy. Just an idea.

			PADEN
	Well, thanks, but forget it.

			SHERIFF COBB
	You know, Paden, what makes all this 
	work is me doing my job. The fellows 
	you came to town with are causing 
	some trouble. It's going to take a 
	little straightening out. I have my 
	responsibilities. I want you to 
	understand. It has nothing to do 
	with us.

Paden looks at Cobb a long time, then at his drink.

			PADEN
	What is it you want from me?

			SHERIFF COBB
	Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between 
	us.

			PADEN
	I'm a great believer in doing nothing.

			SHERIFF COBB
	So we understand each other?

			PADEN
	Don't worry about me. If you're taking 
	on Emmett, the last place I want to 
	be is between you.

EXT. ARROYO - OUTSIDE SILVERADO - DAY

We move along the burnished barrel of the old Henry .44 rifle 
to Emmett's eye, sighting along its length.

Now we see his target. In the distance is a small cactus 
plant. Emmett squeezes off a shot. The cactus does not move. 
He aims again and fires quickly. Again, nothing at the cactus.

AT THE CACTUS. Now we're right behind the target plant, Emmett 
in the distance. When he fires, a thin needle at the top 
edge of the plant is blown away, the bullet leaving a shallow 
trough in the green skin. He fires again, and the next needle 
disappears. Now there are four troughs. He's been hitting 
from the start.

Emmett lowers the rifle, walks back to his horse tied nearby, 
and leaves the rifle, then moves away from the horse again.

He stops, looking at a can in the dust fifty feet away. He 
shakes the fingers of his gun hand once, then very quickly: 
he draws his Colt and fires. The can jumps into the air. 
While it is still moving, Emmett holsters the gun, releasing 
it, then draws again and fires. As the can jumps once more, 
Emmett repeats the action. Six times he draws. The can doesn't 
stop moving until after the last shot.

The horrible NOISE echoes away as Emmett holds the empty gun 
before him. From behind a rock ahead of him, Deputy Garth 
appears.

			GARTH
	You're empty, mister.

Emmett immediately begins to bolt toward his horse. A lasso 
settles around his arms and whips him viciously backwards. 
In a second he is back on his feet and running like a bull 
toward Deputy Kyle, who has stepped from the brush to throw 
the rope. Immediately a second lasso catches Emmett from the 
other side and pulls taut. A deputy on horseback, CHARLIE, 
has roped him. Charlie and Kyle pull their ropes, yanking 
Emmett onto his back.

Now appearing around a bend in the arroyo is Tyree, a nasty 
glint in his eye. He rides hard directly toward Emmett. Emmett 
watches the pounding hooves approach. He struggles but can't 
move. Tyree's horse thunders over him, one hoof catching his 
side with a sickening THUD. Emmett writhes in agony.

Tyree turns his horse and heads back. Kyle pulls harder on 
his rope. Tyree rides over Emmett again, but we can't see 
the damage for the dust. Tyree walks his horse over and looks 
down, as Garth, Kyle, and Charlie converge.

Emmett's head is bleeding, his body crumpled. But he looks 
up at them through pain-squinted eyes.

			GARTH
	Ain't you dead yet, mister?

			TYREE
	Cobb said he'd be hard to kill.

They all laugh at this.

			TYREE
		(to Emmett)
	Guess you couldn't hear us coming.
		(to the others)
	He was practicing so hard for a fight, 
	he missed the whole thing.

The others cackle. Garth draws his gun.

			GARTH
	So long, stranger.

He starts to lower the muzzle toward Emmett. There is the 
echoing CRACK of a shot and the gun flies from Garth's 
shattered hand.

Mal stands on a rock above them, his rifle pointed.

			MAL
	I don't want to kill you, and you 
	don't want to be dead. Drop your 
	guns.

The other deputies exchange glances as Garth bends in pain.

			KYLE
	He can't be that good, Tyree.

			TYREE
	Do you want to find out?

			CHARLIE
		(dropping his rope)
	I think we should do like he says.

As the others start to unbuckle their holsters, Charlie, the 
compliant one, draws on Mal. Mal shoots him out of the saddle, 
dead. The others freeze.

EXT. TRAIL - BASE OF HILLS - DAY

Mal comes into view, leading a motley remuda. Emmett is tied 
onto his horse, unconscious. The four deputies' riderless 
horses are strung along behind. All their guns have been 
tied on Emmett's horse. Now Mal releases the extra horses 
and shoos them away. He leads Emmett's horse up the trail 
into the hills.

EXT. CAVE - DAY

Emmett and Mal's horses are tied near the entrance.

INT. CAVE - DAY

Mal has tended to Emmett's head wound and now binds a large, 
ugly bruise on his ribs. Emmett, half-conscious, writhes in 
pain, and now his eyes flicker open. Confused, he makes a 
futile attempt to rise.

			EMMETT
	...Gotta go...

			MAL
	Sure.

Emmett passes out again.

EXT. ROAD - OUTSIDE SILVERADO - DUSK

The three surviving deputies, gunless, trudge along the road. 
Garth holds his wounded hand close to his body.

INT. CAVE - DUSK

Emmett lies sleeping in the flickering light of the fire. 
Mal sits nearby, his Henry rifle lying at his feet. He is 
examining the Henry that Emmett had at the arroyo. Emmett 
wakes up, wincing.

			EMMETT
	Where are we?

			MAL
	Someplace safe. How you feeling?

Emmett's look makes it clear -- "bad".

			EMMETT
	I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.

			MAL
	I didn't just come along. I was 
	looking for you.
		(Emmett doesn't 
			understand)
	Jake said you were out there. I saw 
	him in town, and he told me about 
	that business the other night. Said 
	you boys took a Henry off one of 
	McKendrick's men. I wanted to see 
	it.

			EMMETT
	That's it.

Mal looks at the rifle in his arms sadly.

			MAL
	This was my father's. The men who 
	killed him took it.

			EMMETT
		(looks at him a moment)
	I'm sorry.

Emmett tries to move his pain-racked body.

			EMMETT
	I gotta get to my brother. If they 
	came after me, they'll want him too.

			MAL
	You'll never make it.

			EMMETT
		(still trying)
	Have to.

Mal reaches out with a strong hand and eases Emmett back 
down.

			MAL
	I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.

			EMMETT
		(after a long look)
	Be careful. You're in it now. And 
	it's gonna get mean.

			MAL
	So far that's all I seen in this 
	life.

EXT./INT. LIVERY STABLE - EDGE OF TOWN - DUSK

It's quiet here, nobody around. We move up to the hay-loading 
window at the loft level. Now Jake dives into view, leaping 
from the hayloft to a beam and flipping completely around 
it. We hear GIGGLES. Phoebe climbs the ladder onto the loft 
and looks in wonder at her manic companion, who now flies 
back onto the loft. They look at each other with hungry 
anticipation.

EXT. ALLEY/STREET NEAR HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

Mal, on foot, makes his way cautiously through the gloom to 
the end of the alley. He looks over at the Hollis home and 
land office, windows aglow. Now Mal spots a Cowboy down the 
street smoking a cigarette as he leans against a hitching 
post. Mal is peering at him uncertainly when the front door 
of the Hollis house opens, and Kate steps out onto the porch. 
The Cowboy steps quickly back into the shadows, and Mal notes 
it.

Kate vigorously shakes a tablecloth over the railing and 
turns back inside, talking as she goes.

			KATE
	Augie, I've had enough of this. Kiss 
	your father and get in bed.

She closes the door behind her. Mal sees the cowboy called 
Red coming down the street and hurries away in the direction 
he came from.

Red comes up to the WATCHING COWBOY.

			RED
	No sign of him yet?
		("no")
	He ain't at the saloon either.

			WATCHING COWBOY
	Where is that boy?

INT. RAE'S ROOM - MIDNIGHT STAR (SECOND FLOOR) - NIGHT

Rae is finishing her evening's makeup in the cracked mirror 
of her cramped, little room. Mal slides in the door behind 
her, closing it quickly. He carries his rifle. She sees his 
reflection and stiffens but continues making up.

			RAE
	Get out. We have nothing to talk 
	about.

			MAL
	Rae, I need help.

			RAE
	Why come to me?

			MAL
	Because you're my sister. There's 
	nobody else.
		(a beat)
	The men who killed Daddy are after 
	Jake. I gotta talk to him.

			RAE
	What's stopping you?

			MAL
	They're watching the Hollis place. I 
	can't get through.

			RAE
	What makes you think I could?

			MAL
	Why would they stop you?

			RAE
		(bitter irony)
	Because I'm your sister.

Mal sits down on her bed. She looks at him a moment.

			RAE
	Wait here.

INT. SALOON - NIGHT

Stella is working behind the bar. Slick is playing poker at 
a table nearby. Now Rae appears and whispers in his ear. He 
throws in his cards, gets up, and follows her toward the 
stairs. Stella watches.

INT. RAE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Mal looks up as the door opens, then stands up when he sees 
that Rae has brought Slick with her.

			MAL
	Why him?

			RAE
	Shut up. You need help, don't you?

EXT. CHURCH - SILVERADO - NIGHT

We are looking up at the church steeple from across the 
square. Now Slick steps into the foreground, looks around, 
and waves someone on from behind. Mal comes into the frame.

			SLICK
		(quietly)
	Jake said he'd meet you behind the 
	church. Be careful. They're all over 
	the place.

Mal's opinion of Slick has softened. He offers his hand.

			MAL
	Thanks.

			SLICK
		(shakes hands)
	Good luck.

Mal looks around, then slips away toward the church. Slick 
stands and watches.

EXT. BACK OF CHURCH - NIGHT

Mal comes around the corner of the building. Cobb is lounging 
comfortably on the back steps. Mal aims his rifle, but Cobb 
doesn't move.

			SHERIFF COBB
	You must be Ezra Johnson's boy.

Mal cocks the hammer.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Don't shoot the sheriff. It's against 
	the law.

Three deputies appear quietly out of the shadows behind Mal, 
their guns pointed. The door behind Cobb opens, revealing 
Garth, his hand bandaged. Mal lowers the rifle.

			SHERIFF COBB
	So's killing a deputy.

Tyree comes up behind Mal and takes the rifle from his hand. 
Suddenly he hits him in the kidney with the rifle butt. Mal 
goes down.

			SHERIFF COBB
	We're going to give you a fair 
	trial...

Garth has come down the steps and over to Mal. He holds his 
bandaged hand out in front of him, then kicks Mal viciously.

			SHERIFF COBB
	...followed by a first-class hanging.

Finally Cobb gets up and walks over to look down at Mal.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Or you can ride out of here before 
	dawn.

Mal turns his head so he can look up at Cobb.

			SHERIFF COBB
	All you gotta do is tell me where to 
	find your friend Emmett.

INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Rae is serving drinks at a table in the noisy saloon. She 
sees Slick come in. Their eyes meet, but he goes to the bar 
and orders a drink. She hurries over there. Slick throws 
back a shot and turns to her, upset.

			SLICK
	Did your brother tell you he killed 
	a deputy?

Rae is taken aback.

			SLICK
	Jake never showed up. Sheriff Cobb 
	arrested Mal. Took him off to jail.

Rae begins to crack. Slick takes her into his arms. Stella 
moves up behind the bar, looking closely at Rae.

			STELLA
	What's going on here, Rae?

INT. CELLBLOCK - SILVERADO JAIL - NIGHT

Close on Mal as he dabs at a split lip with the tail of his 
shirt. He's sitting on a cot in a cell. He has been beaten 
more. As the door to the outer office clangs open, he reacts 
with resignation; here comes more pain. But when he looks 
up, it is Paden standing outside the bars. Behind Paden, 
Garth throws a hostile look at Mal and goes out. Paden notes 
Mal's condition. Mal regards Paden coolly.

			PADEN
	Why are they doing this, Mal?

			MAL
	Because they enjoy it.

			PADEN
	I heard from Stella you were trying 
	to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?

			MAL
	You don't know?

Paden takes the rebuke and shakes his head "no".

			MAL
	Cobb's men just about killed him. 
	That's what happened.

Paden reacts.

			MAL
	I got there just short of too late.

			PADEN
		(pained)
	Lucky.

Mal snorts derisively at that and glances around.

			MAL
	Yeah, it's working out real good.

			PADEN
	Where's Emmett now?

Mal gives him a disbelieving look.

			MAL
	You're working for Cobb these days, 
	aren't you?

Paden grimly acknowledges that.

			MAL
	Your friends have been beating me to 
	find that out. You think I'm gonna 
	just tell you?

Mal gets up to face Paden, separated by only a few inches 
and the steel bars.

			MAL
	You waltzed in here pretty easy, and 
	you can go out the same way.
		(motions him away)
	Me they're figuring to carry out.

Paden knows that no explanation will suffice here. Sadly, he 
turns away from his former riding companion and leaves.

OMIT

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Rae waits nervously behind the noisy saloon, peering into 
the darkness. Now she sees what she's been waiting for: Paden 
comes out of the shadows. His mind elsewhere, it takes him a 
moment to focus on Rae.

			RAE
	Is he all right?

			PADEN
		(considers a moment)
	It looks bad, Rae. He's a hard man, 
	and he won't give them what they 
	want. It's gonna cost him.

			RAE
	Can't you stop them?

			PADEN
	I don't think so.

Rae begins to cry quietly and leans against a wall. Phoebe 
appears from the other direction and goes up to Rae.

			PHOEBE
	Rae? It's Phoebe.

EXT. REAR OF HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

Jake has put his horse in the little corral behind the Hollis 
house. He whistles as he goes up onto the back porch and in 
the door.

INT. KITCHEN/SITTING ROOM (HOLLIS HOUSE) - NIGHT

There is one, dim lamp burning in the room. Jake sails his 
hat across the room onto a hook, picks up a match, and lights 
a second lamp. He calls out softly.

			JAKE
	Kate?

He picks up the lamp and moves toward the dark office at the 
front of the house and the stairs which lead upstairs. He 
steps through the door and freezes. A cocked six-gun appears 
near his ear.

INT. LAND OFFICE (HOLLIS HOUSE) - NIGHT

In the light of Jake's lamp he sees: four masked men have 
Kate, J.T., and Augie gagged and held at gunpoint. The little 
boy is in his nightshirt. For one long moment Jake seems to 
be considering a play. McKendrick is the one with the gun to 
Jake's head.

			MCKENDRICK
	Don't.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Rae has been tearfully telling Phoebe her story as Paden 
stands nearby.

			PHOEBE
	Looking for Jake? Jake's been with 
	me all evening. I just left him.

			PADEN
		(suddenly alert)
	Where is he now?

			PHOEBE
	He went home.

Paden takes off running into the darkness. Phoebe looks after 
him, confused. Rae grabs her by the shoulders.

			RAE
	All evening? Even after Slick came?

			PHOEBE
	Slick?

Rae begins to understand an awful truth.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

A masked man (Hoyt) steadies Jake, hands bound behind his 
back, on one of the horses Red and the Watching Cowboy have 
brought up to the front of the house. Another of the men 
(Scruffy) is just coming out onto the porch.

INT. LAND OFFICE - NIGHT

Inside only two masked men remain, McKendrick and Swann. 
J.T. watches them with hostile eyes. Swann notices Kate 
peering out the window at Jake.

			SWANN
	Take a long look, lady. It's the 
	last you'll see of him.

			MCKENDRICK
	Shut up.

McKendrick has been looking thoughtfully at the ledgers and 
records shelved around the land office. Now he picks up the 
lamp Jake brought into the room. It lights his eyes above 
the bandana mask. They lock with J.T.'s . McKendrick heaves 
the lamp into the shelves. Kerosene flames engulf the ledgers. 
McKendrick starts to move toward the door.

J.T. snaps. He picks up a heavy register book and hurtles it 
with enormous force, hitting McKendrick in the back of the 
head and knocking him down. J.T. dives for McKendrick's gun.

Kate watches in terror, then sees Swann point his gun at the 
scrambling J.T. She grabs Swann's arm, and his gun fires 
into the floor.

J.T. comes up with McKendrick's gun and fires quickly at 
Swann, who has thrown off Kate. Swann, hit in the shoulder, 
crashes back through a window and out onto the porch.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Jake reacts in anguish and twists in his saddle. Hoyt points 
a cocked gun at him.

INT. LAND OFFICE - NIGHT

Scruffy, back at the door now, fires twice into J.T., slamming 
his big body backward against the base of a counter.

Kate's scream is muffled by her gag. Augie, eyes wide, darts 
to his father's body, but rather than embrace him, he pries 
the gun from J.T.'s fingers and raises it toward Scruffy. 
Kate sees what's happening and leaps at Scruffy. He viciously 
pistol-whips her. Her unconscious, falling body knocks the 
gun from Augie's hand.

McKendrick is straightening now, his head clearing. His 
bandana has fallen from his face. He looks in horror at the 
wounded Hollises. Augie stares at his revealed face.

Scruffy's gun is cocked and pointed at Augie.

			MCKENDRICK
	Stop it!

			SCRUFFY
	He saw you.

McKendrick hates the way it's gone.

			MCKENDRICK
	Bring him with us.

EXT. END OF STREET - NIGHT

Paden runs up. Down the street in front of the Hollis house 
a mass of men and horses, lit by the growing flames, thunders 
away into the night. Paden races toward the house, as 
neighbors rush about raising the alarm.

EXT. HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

Paden runs up to the open front door and is momentarily 
stopped by the heat.

INT. LAND OFFICE - NIGHT

In among the flames a bleeding Kate is desperately trying to 
drag J.T.'s inert bulk to the door. Paden reaches her, picks 
her up, and runs out. Two neighbors pass him on their way to 
J.T.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

A chaotic scene as the fire-fighting is organized. Several

Neighbor Women help Paden ease Kate down on a blanket.

			KATE
	Help J.T.!

			NEIGHBOR WOMAN
	Where's Augie?
		(to Paden)
	Her boy must be upstairs!

Paden rises as if to go back in, but stops at --

			KATE
	No, no... they took him. They took 
	my Augie.

Paden reacts to this, then turns as the two neighbors lay 
J.T.'s body nearby.

INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Word of the fire has not reached here, and normal, noisy 
activity reigns. Slick is dealing a three-man poker game.

Rae watches him from across the room, then takes a drink 
over to him. When she places it before him, he looks up 
appreciatively, then goes back to his game. She puts her 
arms around him from behind and kisses his neck, then slides 
sensuously into the empty seat beside him. He ignores her 
adoring look and roaming hands, but smiles as he plays.

BENEATH THE TABLE. Rae's left hand roves excitingly high on 
Slick's thigh. Now, so smooth and quick we barely see it, 
her right hand lifts his trouser leg and slips the custom-
made dagger from his boot.

Slick deals a hand. Rae watches him thoughtfully. The swinging 
doors behind them crash open, and a TOWNSMAN bursts in.

			TOWNSMAN
	Fire! The land office is on fire!

Most of the patrons rush out, including the players in Slick's 
game, who grab their chips first. Slick peeks at one of the 
thrown-down hands out of curiosity, then rises slowly.

			SLICK
	Shall we take a look?

Rae nods, and when she rises to take his arm, her hands are 
empty.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

The townspeople have formed a bucket brigade in a losing 
battle with the fire at the Hollis house. SHOUTS fill the 
air above the ROAR of the inferno.

Stella is among the new arrivals from the saloon. She is 
stopped by the sight of Kate, bloody and hysterical, being 
borne away. Horrified by the scene, Stella now snaps out of 
it and begins YELLING ORDERS to the saloon patrons to help 
fight the blaze.

Paden is only a few feet from the flames, at the head of the 
bucket line. He is in shirt sleeves, sweaty and sooty. The 
heat of the fire is driving the line back. The Townsman next 
to Paden yells to him --

			TOWNSMAN
	There's no way! It's a goner!

Cobb, Tyree, and Kyle appear from the shadows. Cobb takes in 
the scene and spots J.T. being carried across the street. He 
motions Tyree over to investigate, then moves toward the 
fire.

Slick and Rae arrive within the light of the blaze. Slick 
watches with detached interest, but Rae's gaze quickly locks 
on Cobb moving through the chaos. She sees him now with new 
eyes.

Phoebe, crying, watches as J.T.'s limp body is hurried off 
on a stretcher, DR. SKINNER in attendance. She turns and is 
face to face with Tyree, who grasps her arms. She regards 
him with revulsion and fear, then breaks from him and runs 
off.

Cobb moves up next to Paden.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Give it up.

Paden glances at him, then throws more water on. But now the 
bucket line slows to a halt. The townspeople fade back a 
little to watch the inevitable.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I hate to see this kind of thing in 
	my town.

Paden glares at Cobb, who is watching the fire.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I'm going to have to look into this.

			PADEN
	Yeah, maybe I will too.

			SHERIFF COBB
		(looks at him)
	I thought we talked about that.

			PADEN
	We didn't talk about this.
		(a beat, indignant)
	They took the little boy, Cobb.

Paden moves off toward a nearby hitching post, where he has 
left his gunbelt and hat. Cobb looks after him a moment, 
then follows. They are now a short distance from the 
onlookers. Paden straps on his gunbelt, but his eyes are on 
Cobb as he approaches, silhouetted against the flames.

			SHERIFF COBB
	You're still worried about the dog, 
	aren't you?

Paden ties his holster to his thigh.

			SHERIFF COBB
	You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything 
	will be put straight in a few days.

			PADEN
	I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson 
	straight.

Something flicks through Cobb's eyes. He turns slowly and 
looks at the scene behind him. At the edge of the crowd a 
tired Stella sits on an overturned bucket, watching the fire; 
she wipes her sweaty brow with the sleeve of her dress. Still 
looking that way --

			SHERIFF COBB
	I never could count on you to be 
	reasonable.
		(turns back to Paden)
	Don't force me to make an adjustment 
	around here.

			PADEN
	Cobb, you've got nothing I need.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I'm not thinking about your future, 
	Paden. I'm worried about Stella.

			PADEN
	What's she got to do with it?

			SHERIFF COBB
	Not a thing. She's just a mutual 
	friend.
		(a beat)
	But if you wind up on the wrong side 
	of this, she's going to get hurt.

Paden stares at Cobb, but now his eyes follow Cobb's right 
hand, which swings up to Paden's shoulder.

			SHERIFF COBB
	I'm just trying to save you from 
	yourself. Don't change your luck.

Cobb lets his hand drop and begins to move away.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Get some sleep, Paden. Things'll 
	look better tomorrow.

Paden watches as Cobb walks over to Stella. Cobb takes a 
handkerchief from his pocket and squats before Stella. He 
starts to wipe her forehead solicitously, but she takes the 
handkerchief from his hand. Cobb looks back at Paden as he 
rises and moves off.

Paden turns and looks into the leaping flames. Our eyes can 
barely discern the change as these flames dissolve into 
others, the fire now in --

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

The low fire illuminates Emmett, who is sitting on the hay. 
He is sweating badly and seems to be concentrating on some 
rigorous task. Now we see what it is -- to stand up. He 
struggles to his feet, wincing in pain, his hand steadying 
against the rock. When he is upright, he tries to clear his 
head and finally lets go of the wall. For a moment he seems 
all right. Then, suddenly, he drops heavily back to the floor. 
The fall sends more pain shooting through his ribs. He's 
going nowhere.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF SILVERADO JAIL - NIGHT

Middle of the night. All is quiet, no one on the street. Rae 
watches from the shadows across the street as DEPUTY FOX 
leaves the jail and moves away. Rae goes toward the jail.

INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

The place is nearly deserted. Paden sits alone at a table 
killing a bottle of the good stuff. Stella watches him pour 
another drink.

			STELLA
	Can't you drink any faster? We need 
	the bottles.

Paden throws her a look as she takes one of the empty chairs.

			STELLA
	What is it that I can't figure?

			PADEN
	What do you mean?

			STELLA
	Cobb's got something on you, and it 
	must be pretty good.

Paden is impressed, even at this late date, by her acuity.

			PADEN
	What makes you say that?

			STELLA
	If he didn't you'd never sit still 
	while this was happening.

			PADEN
	You sure? Maybe that's the kind of 
	friend I am.

			STELLA
		(laughs derisively)
	Nah!
		(moving on)
	What's he got? This is a nice saloon, 
	but there are other nice saloons. 
	It's not the money. Not for you. Why 
	can't I get ahold of it?
		(watches him take a 
			drink)
	Cobb says there's no telling what 
	you're going to care about.

			PADEN
		(bitterly amused)
	Is that what he said? Well, he figured 
	it okay this time.

She regards him as he looks at his glass. Then he looks up, 
and for one moment their eyes meet. Paden, uncomfortable, 
quickly looks away. In that second, she understands her own 
role in this. And she is deeply moved. They are silent 
together.

INT. CELLBLOCK - SILVERADO JAIL - NIGHT

Mal looks up as the door to the outer office clangs open. 
Deputy Garth comes in with Rae in tow. Mal comes to the front 
of his cell.

			GARTH
	Look who's here, Johnson, it's your 
	sweet little sister. You remember 
	her, works at The Midnight Star. 
	Everybody knows her.

Mal and Rae look at each other.

			GARTH
	She wanted to see you. Course I had 
	to search her. I'm not sure I did a 
	good job. Might have missed something.
		(holds up his bandaged 
			hand)
	Only got one good hand, you know.

Rae steps toward Mal, but Garth suddenly grabs her arm and 
flings her back against the wall opposite Mal's cell. He 
moves close to Rae and slips the big ring of keys over his 
bandaged right hand, freeing his left. He looks once at Mal, 
then down Rae's body. His left hand fondles her.

			GARTH
	Maybe I better check her a little 
	closer.

Mal's eyes flame as Garth takes Rae in a lascivious embrace. 
Suddenly Rae dips to one side within his arms. Her hand comes 
up from her boot with Slick's dagger and plunges it into 
Garth's back. The deputy jolts back a few steps in shock, 
already pulling a six-gun from his belt with his left hand. 
He fires once into Rae's body. She goes down.

Garth is cocking the gun again with weakening fingers when 
Mal's hand encircles his neck and pulls him violently back 
against the bars. Garth's gun clatters away down the hall.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF SILVERADO JAIL - NIGHT

Deputy Fox has heard the shot and is running toward the jail.

INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

Garth, his neck broken, lies crumpled outside Mal's cell. 
Rae is unconscious and bloodied against the far wall. The 
large key ring is on the floor under Garth's leg and out of 
Mal's reach. Mal's anguished gaze darts from Rae to the keys 
as he begins to drag the dead weight of Garth's leg toward 
the bars. The key ring is dragged a few inches, then slips 
free. Mal tries again, then hears the front door SLAM open 
in the outer office. Mal looks at the gun lying useless down 
the hall.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - SILVERADO JAIL - NIGHT

Fox draws his gun as he rushes across toward the cellblock 
door.

			FOX
	Garth! You in there, Garth?

INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

The keys still lie in the middle of the hall, the gun down 
at the end.

Fox comes through the door, gun raised, and takes in the 
sight of the two bodies. He looks up in surprise as Slick's 
dagger flies into his chest with a THUNK. Fox dies.

Down the line of bars, Mal's right arm is extended into the 
corridor, as it was when he released the knife.

INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Paden is leaning all the way over the bar to extract a glass 
from beneath it. He straightens and walks back to the table, 
where Stella still sits. Now, however, she has drawn her 
legs up before her on the chair and is hugging her knees, 
deep in thought. The saloon is now empty save for these two.

Paden pours them each a drink and hands Stella's to her. 
This brings her back. He clinks his glass with hers and toasts --

			PADEN
	To my midnight star.

They exchange a long look, then drink.

			STELLA
	Cobb's using me to stop you. So good 
	people are being hurt because of me.
		(a beat)
	That makes me mad.

Listening closely, he finds this last bit endearing.

			STELLA
	Some people think because they're 
	stronger -- or meaner -- they can 
	push you around. I've seen a lot of 
	that. But it's only true if you let 
	it be. The world is what you make of 
	it.

			PADEN
	I like your attitude. But it can be 
	risky.

			STELLA
	I'm ready for that.

There is a challenge in her eyes as she reaches out and slides 
the whiskey bottle away from him.

			STELLA
	How about you?

			PADEN
	I don't want you to get hurt.

			STELLA
	He can't hurt me if he's dead.

Paden looks at her with growing appreciation. A light is 
coming back into his face. A smile slowly grows on his lips, 
mirroring hers.

The door behind the bar bangs open, and Phoebe comes out, 
breathless.

			PHOEBE
	Stella, come quick!

INT. SUPPLY ROOM - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Phoebe leads them into the dimly-lit room and goes to her 
knees beside Rae, who lies wounded on the floor. Rae is semi-
conscious and moaning. Stella stoops to examine her wound.

			PHOEBE
		(crying)
	She sprung her brother... all by 
	herself! And this is what happened... 
	He brought her here.

			PADEN
	Where'd he go?

			PHOEBE
	I told him about Jake and the little 
	boy. He went off after Emmett.

			STELLA
		(to Phoebe)
	Stop your crying. Go get Doc Skinner 
	and bring him to the shed.
		(to Paden)
	Pick her up.

Phoebe hurries out. Paden kneels next to Stella.

			STELLA
	I've got a place I can hide her.

			PADEN
	You better get in there with her 
	until this thing is over.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Emmett works by the light of the fire, checking one of the 
guns taken from the deputies. He hears something we do not, 
but continues to work for a few moments more. Now we hear 
it: an approaching rider. Emmett stands up gingerly and moves 
painfully back into the shadows. He is much improved but 
still tentative.

Mal comes into the cave carrying his Henry rifle. Emmett 
reappears, lowering his gun.

			EMMETT
	I didn't think you were going to 
	make it back.

Mal steps into the light, revealing his bruised face.

			MAL
	I almost didn't.

			EMMETT
		(reacts to Mal's 
			condition)
	Where's Jake?

			MAL
	McKendrick's men got him.

			EMMETT
	Is he alive?

Mal indicates that he doesn't know. Emmett accepts that and 
picks up his gunbelt.

			MAL
	It's worse than that, Emmett.

Emmett looks up, waiting.

			MAL
	They took him at your sister's house. 
	Her husband was shot. I don't know 
	if he's going to make it.

Emmett feels real pain.

			EMMETT
	Kate?

			MAL
	She was hurt... pretty bad.
		(hates to tell him)
	Emmett, they took the little boy 
	with them.

Emmett lets this all sink in. And then his face and body 
begin to transform. All the pain is swept away in a surging 
current of vengeful energy. The MUSIC begins to build, as 
Emmett moves with eerie deliberateness to arm himself. He 
picks up one of the extra gunbelts and loops it over his 
shoulder.

Mal slides into his bandolier. Emmett indicates the gunbelts 
remaining on the floor.

			EMMETT
	Want one of these?

Mal turns. He now holds his father's Henry rifle in addition 
to his own, one awesome weapon in each hand.

			MAL
	This oughta do.

OMIT

EXT. HOTEL - SILVERADO - DAWN

Cobb, having just finished breakfast, steps out into the 
morning light and looks around at his domain. He works the 
toothpick in his mouth and watches Tyree come slowly up the 
street on horseback. They nod their greetings and head down 
the street.

EXT. JAIL - DAWN

Tyree ties his horse in front, and the two men go inside.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

Cobb is barely in the door when he stops, noticing something 
out of place. The gun cabinet has been forced open; its 
splintered door is ajar.

			TYREE
	Garth!
		(nothing)
	Yo, Fox!

Tyree draws his gun, but Cobb is already moving toward the 
cellblock door.

INT. CELLBLOCK - DAWN

Cobb and Tyree survey the scene: the empty cell, three pools 
of blood, two bodies -- Garth and Fox. Cobb watches as Tyree 
checks the two deputies and shakes his head.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Get Kyle and Dusty over here. And 
	keep your eyes open. I'm running out 
	of deputies.

He goes out.

INT. SALOON STAIRS - MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

The Bartender comes to the head of the stairs wearing a 
nightshirt.

			BARTENDER
	Stella ain't here, Sheriff. I checked 
	her room.

Now we see Cobb waiting at the bottom of the steps, 
thoughtful.

			SHERIFF COBB
	And you don't know where Paden is?

			BARTENDER
	Haven't seen him since last night.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Let me know if you do. And tell Stella 
	I want to see her.

Cobb turns and walks to the open, outer doors at the corner 
of the saloon. The swinging doors are still hooked back for 
the night. When Cobb stops in the doorway, he casts a long 
shadow across the room. He stares out into the town for 
several beats, then lifts his gun from its holster and checks 
the action.

EXT. BORDER OF MCKENDRICK RANCH - MORNING

The McKendrick brand is fashioned in wood at the peak of an 
arch over the road. Beyond it, in the distance, cattle are 
grazing on the rolling land.

EXT. MCKENDRICK GRAZING LAND - MORNING

Hundreds of cattle are grazing here in the morning light, a 
sea of speckled hides. Now a Cowboy pulls up in the 
foreground. He is heavily armed. His watchful gaze is not on 
the cattle, but outward toward the horizon.

EXT. BUNKHOUSE/CENTRAL AREA - MCKENDRICK RANCH - MORNING

More Cowboys here, armed and watchful. Red comes along a 
corral and climbs up onto a fence to peer into the distance.

EXT. CASA GRANDE - VERANDA - MORNING

Scruffy, scratching his belly, walks along the porch of the 
main ranch house, the casa grande. As he comes up to us at 
the corner and looks around, we see that he is wearing Jake's 
elaborately tooled, double gunbelt with the pearl-handled 
Colts.

As he moves down the other side of the house, we see 
McKendrick standing at a window, looking out.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

We're behind McKendrick now. On the wall next to the window 
there is a large, framed photograph of Murdo McKendrick, a 
big, ferocious man, sitting rather stiffly in a chair. On 
one side of him stands his wife, as thin and tough as a nail. 
On the other, beneath a large, paternal hand, a small boy -- 
young Ethan.

McKendrick turns away from the window and for an instant his 
eye is stopped by the photograph. McKendrick looks unsettled. 
He hasn't slept.

INT. BEDROOM (SECOND FLOOR) - MORNING

Augie is huddled on a bed in the corner of the dark room, 
frightened, still wearing the nightshirt he had on when 
abducted. Suddenly, sunlight blinds him.

The Watching Cowboy from the night before has thrown open 
the curtains. He looks out over the roof of the veranda, 
then turns back. He gives Augie an odd look and moves toward 
the door, first kicking a Guard Cowboy awake in his chair.

EXT. ROLLING RANGE - MORNING

Emmett and Mal ride side by side. Relentless. You wouldn't 
want to be the people they're going to visit.

Now a solitary rider appears on the ridge above them, moving 
the same way. Mal notices him first, then Emmett. It is Paden, 
and now he is sloping down to join them.

He moves in alongside them. They exchange looks. Then all 
three look ahead. Where they are going.

INT. STORAGE SHED - SILVERADO - DAY

Dr. Skinner has tended Rae on a cot in the dark recess of 
the shed and now moves with Stella to the door. Phoebe kneels 
beside Rae.

			DR. SKINNER
	If her skin gets cold, you better 
	come for me.

Stella nods, then cracks the door to peek outside.

EXT./INT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

WHAT SHE SEES. This shed is down the alley from the back of 
the Midnight Star. The alley is empty.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

Dr. Skinner comes out and begins to walk away. Slick appears 
from between two buildings. They nod to each other, and Dr. 
Skinner walks away. Slick watches him for a moment, then 
moves up the alley, looking around as he goes. He walks past 
the shed and on toward the street.

EXT. CORNER OF ALLEY AND STREET - DAY

Slick reaches the end of the alley and stops. Cobb comes 
down the sidewalk toward him. They talk confidentially. Slick 
shakes his head. They part, continuing their separate prowls.

EXT. CENTRAL AREA - MCKENDRICK RANCH - DAY

IN THE CORRAL. One of the horses drinking at the trough lifts 
its head, ears twitching. A wave of restlessness goes through 
the horses. On the top of the fence, Red notices and begins 
to listen intently.

ON THE VERANDA. Scruffy stands up from a step and looks off 
toward the rise beyond the corrals. Alarm creeps into his 
face.

AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Swann, his shoulder bandaged, comes out to 
join a Sentry Cowboy looking with concern at the rise. 
Suddenly, the Sentry Cowboy starts running toward a saddled 
horse nearby. Red has jumped from the fence now too and 
mounted up quickly. The two horsemen head off toward the 
rise at a gallop.

Swann looks in alarm at --

THE CREST OF THE RISE. Pouring into view with a ground-shaking 
RUMBLE is a huge herd of stampeding cattle.

AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Swann turns to the door of the bunkhouse 
and shouts inside.

			SWANN
	Stampede!

ON THE RISE. Red and the Sentry Cowboy tear toward the 
oncoming cattle. They fire their guns repeatedly in the air, 
trying to turn the herd.

AT THE CORRAL. Scruffy runs across from the casa grande and 
joins other Cowboys trying to saddle and mount panicked 
horses. Scruffy's horse rears and breaks away from him.

ON THE RISE. Red and the Sentry Cowboy are closing with the 
dust-enshrouded herd, still firing their guns. Suddenly, 
from the cloud, there are answering shots. The Sentry Cowboy 
is shot dead off his horse.

Emerging like a spirit from the dust at the edge of the herd, 
comes Emmett, six-gun in hand.

On the other side of the herd, Paden's form materializes. He 
aims his Winchester and fires. Red's horse rears. Red goes 
down and the herd pounds over him.

AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Hoyt comes out the door, buckling on his 
gunbelt. He looks at the on-rushing stampede, then toward 
the corral where several Cowboys are swinging up on their 
horses. Suddenly, there is gunfire from the roof of the 
bunkhouse above Hoyt. One of the Cowboys in the corral goes 
down. Another draws his gun and lifts it toward the bunkhouse, 
but is shot before he can fire. The other Cowboys head for 
cover. Hoyt stops some men who are coming out the door behind 
him, and edges out to try to locate the source of the fire.

ON THE VERANDA. McKendrick comes out of the casa grande and 
runs to the corner of the veranda nearest the rise. He takes 
in the stampede, which is almost upon them now, then hears 
gunfire to his right. He looks back there and sees Mal on 
the bunkhouse roof, above Hoyt and firing from the protection 
of the raised rim. Now Mal swings his rifle around toward 
McKendrick. McKendrick jumps around the corner of the house 
as the wall where he was standing takes a hit.

SERIES OF SHOTS. The stampede hits the ranch. The herd splits, 
the mass of cattle heading between the casa grande and the 
bunkhouse/corral area; the rest go around behind the casa 
grande. They take down everything in their way. Fences fall, 
holding pens are destroyed, horses run free, and Cowboys 
scramble away from the deadly current of rampaging cattle.

NEAR THE BARN. Paden pulls up on the edge of the flow and 
fires repeatedly at the Cowboys scrambling for safety. Swann 
is among those hit.

BEHIND THE CASA GRANDE. Emmett pulls his horse out of the 
flow, protected by the building, then dismounts, ties the 
horse, and runs up to the back door of the house. He throws 
away the empty, extra six-gun in his hand as he looks 
carefully inside. He draws his own gun and goes in.

NEAR THE BARN. Paden is coming under increasing fire from 
the bunkhouse as the cattle thin. He rides into the barn at 
the end of the corral.

AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Hoyt directs some of his men, including 
Scruffy, to work their way along under the eaves of the 
bunkhouse and go after Paden. Hoyt glances upward toward the 
sound of Mal's rifle.

INT. CASA GRANDE - DAY

Emmett works his way carefully down the central hall, gun 
ready. He looks up the main staircase, sees nothing, and 
edges forward. At the top of the stairs behind him, the 
Watching Cowboy jumps into view. Emmett spins and ducks as 
the Watching Cowboy fires. The finial splinters. Emmett's 
shot follows immediately. The Watching Cowboy is hit and 
tumbles the full length of the stairs, dead.

EXT. CENTRAL AREA - DAY

ON THE VERANDA. McKendrick reacts to the shots behind him in 
his house. He moves toward a window and opens it.

ON THE BUNKHOUSE ROOF. Mal switches to his father's Henry 
and shifts around to fire at some outriding Cowboys who are 
thundering in from the range.

AT THE BARN. Three cowboys dive through the main door in 
pursuit of Paden. Scruffy, one of Jake's pearl-handled Colts 
at the ready, sneaks along the side of the barn.

INT. CASA GRANDE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY

Emmett moves away from the stairwell and cautiously rounds a 
corner, focused on an open bedroom door up ahead. Suddenly, 
the Guard Cowboy steps boldly into view in that doorway, gun 
raised, using Augie as a shield. Emmett cannot fire. He dives 
back around the corner as the Guard Cowboy gets off a shot. 
Seeing his miss, the Guard Cowboy slams closed the bedroom 
door and locks it.

Instantly Emmett is running that way. He flies into the 
bedroom next door.

INT. HOSTAGE BEDROOM - DAY

The Guard Cowboy has backed against the wall, gun raised 
toward the door. Augie is still clutched to his chest.

The window overlooking the roof of the veranda implodes and 
Emmett arrives in a shower of glass. The stunned Guard Cowboy 
spins, opening an angle between himself and Augie. Emmett 
doesn't need much. He fires before he stops rolling. The 
Guard Cowboy falls back against the wall.

INT. CASA GRANDE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS - DAY

McKendrick, gun poised, stands over the body of the Watching 
Cowboy, reacting to the shots above. He is about to go up 
there when the front door crashes open as a Cowboy, shot by 
Mal, staggers into the hall. He leans against the hall table 
and fires out the door. Two more shots from Mal finish the 
Cowboy and a large vase.

McKendrick changes him mind about going upstairs. He moves 
quickly toward the door at the back of the house.

INT. HOSTAGE BEDROOM - DAY

Augie is trembling in Emmett's arms. Emmett soothes him, 
then looks into his tear-stained face.

			EMMETT
	Augie, where's Jake?

			AUGIE
		(chokes it out)
	He's dead.

Emmett reacts to this hard news.

			AUGIE
	They hung him!

Slowly a peculiar twinkle grows in Emmett's eyes.

			EMMETT
	They hung him?

EXT. CENTRAL AREA - DAY

AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Hoyt is hugging the side wall of the 
bunkhouse. He warily looks around the back corner.

WHAT HE SEES. Mal's horse is tethered near a stack of crates 
and barrels that rises almost to the roof.

INT. BARN - DAY

Paden is in an empty stall part-way down one side of the 
barn. The three Cowboys have him pinned down from the front. 
Paden's horse does a panicky dance in the central aisle. The 
horses in the other stalls are spooked.

Scruffy sneaks in the back door of the barn. He peeks around 
the wall of a stall at Paden's unprotected back. When he 
sees Paden stop to reload his Colt, Scruffy steps out and 
aims at him.

Quite unexpectedly, someone swings down from the loft above, 
kicking Scruffy and sending him flying into the recess of a 
stall. Now the figure drops into view. It's Jake! He dives 
after Scruffy.

Paden, reloaded now and unaware of the struggle behind him, 
has to shrink back from a splintering rail. Now he hears two 
muffled shots from the back of the barn. He looks over there. 
After a beat, Jake steps into Paden's view, grinning like a 
maniac and happily buckling his reacquired gunbelt. Paden 
does a double take. Jake gives him a big "Here I am!" gesture, 
then indicates he's going up to the loft again to help out 
with the guys up front. But first, with real relish, he checks 
his pearl-handled Colts: he draws both at once, tips them up 
to look into the cylinders, then spins them back into their 
holsters. Then, with a leap, to the loft.

EXT. RANGE NEAR CASA GRANDE - DAY

McKendrick rides flat out toward town.

INT. BARN - DAY

There are Cowboys in the first stalls on each side of the 
barn, and a third in a stall closer to Paden. Jake drops 
down from the loft behind the first two, his guns in his 
holsters. They both see him and react. Jake draws both guns 
and shoots one, spins, and shoots the other.

The third Cowboy turns to look. His mistake. Paden flies 
into view and shoots him dead.

Paden approaches Jake with wonder. Jake shows him an ugly 
bruise where the rope was around his neck. When he speaks, 
it is in a hoarse whisper --

			JAKE
	New record.

			PADEN
		(slaps him on the 
			back)
	Let's get out of here.

Paden catches his horse and swings up. Jake pulls a horse 
from a stall. It is the much-contested pinto, bare-backed 
but bridled. Paden rides out the back of the barn.

EXT. CENTRAL AREA - DAY

BACK OF THE BARN. Paden rides out, but pulls up when he 
notices that Jake is not following. He is about to go back 
when something catches his eye.

WHAT HE SEES. Hoyt is just climbing onto the roof of the 
bunkhouse, catty-corner from Mal's position.

Paden squeezes off a shot, but Hoyt has already disappeared 
from view. Paden looks along the bunkhouse, where he can see 
Mal firing. Mal is protected at present from Hoyt by the big 
chimney he is braced against. But if he isn't warned, Hoyt 
will surprise him. A Cowboy in the bunkhouse spots Paden and 
fires at him. Paden must warn Mal quickly. Yelling is hopeless 
in the din. Paden aims carefully at Mal and fires.

AT MAL. The chimney is hit just above Mal's head. He swings 
his rifle around toward -- Paden! Paden signals wildly about 
Hoyt. Mal understands just in time: he flops around the 
chimney just as Hoyt gets a bead on him. Without knowing it, 
Mal avenges his father's murder. Hoyt is blown off the roof.

The bulk of the herd has passed, but confused cattle are 
everywhere.

AT THE VERANDA. Jake has ridden across the open area under 
heavy fire and now rides for protection up and onto the side 
veranda of the house, firing into all the windows. His 
momentum carries him all the way out the other end. When he 
is beyond the porch, he hears a yell, two voices --

			EMMETT AND AUGIE
	Jake!?!

Jake looks up with a grin. Emmett has Augie out on the roof 
of the veranda. They are pleased in the extreme at the sight 
of Jake. Jake brings his horse beneath them and gestures to 
Augie.

Augie swallows hard once, strides twice, and leaps out, down, 
and onto the bare back of the pinto behind Jake.

Paden comes riding up with Emmett's horse in tow. Emmett 
moves to the edge of the veranda roof and drops into his 
saddle. He winces, his ribs throbbing. They turn their horses 
away from the ranch and head out.

EXT. RANGE NEAR CASA GRANDE - DAY

The three horses with four riders come tearing toward us. 
They form a dusty "V" as they intersect with Mal's arrival 
from the other side of the bunkhouse. Even now, shots are 
fired after them. But they are on their way.

EXT. SHOP ACROSS FROM SHERIFF'S OFFICE - SILVERADO - DAY

The SHOPKEEPER is placing items in his front window when his 
eye is caught by something across the street. We can see 
only a dim reflection of it in the glass. With a concerned 
look, the Shopkeeper comes outside.

WHAT HE SEES. Trouble. Five men, loaded for bear, are coming 
out of Cobb's office: Cobb, McKendrick, Tyree, Kyle, and 
DUSTY, another deputy.

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Dusty mounts up and rides toward the center of town. Kyle 
goes off in another direction on foot. McKendrick unhitches 
his horse and speaks to Cobb with some bitterness.

			MCKENDRICK
	It never should've got this far, 
	Cobb.

Cobb eyes him coolly.

			SHERIFF COBB
	This is as far as it's going.

McKendrick swings up and jacks a cartridge into the chamber 
of his Winchester. He's not as confident as Cobb.

			MCKENDRICK
	I'll do my part. But you better watch 
	your ass. These guys'll shoot it 
	off.

He heads off in the same direction as Dusty. Tyree moves up 
next to Cobb.

			TYREE
	I'm gonna enjoy this.

Cobb gives him a sideways glance, then looks around wistfully.

			SHERIFF COBB
	This used to be a peaceful town.

Tyree moves off in yet a new direction. The Shopkeeper 
approaches Cobb nervously.

			SHOPKEEPER
	What's going on, Sheriff?

			SHERIFF COBB
	Hide and watch.

The Shopkeeper reacts big and scurries away to spread the 
word.

EXT. STREET CORNER/HOTEL - DAY

Dusty pulls up at the hotel on the corner and throws his 
reins over the post. Then, with rifle in hand, he stands on 
his saddle and climbs to the roof of the porch. He looks 
down the street, cocks his rifle, and settles into hiding 
behind the hotel sign.

McKendrick rides by slowly, exchanging looks with Dusty, and 
moves down the street.

Several townspeople have seen Dusty. The panicky, street-
clearing word spreads.

INT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

Rae writhes in pain on the cot. Stella's hand is on Rae's 
forehead as she speaks to Phoebe.

			STELLA
	Better bring the doc.
		(as Phoebe turns)
	Be careful.

EXT. STREET - DAY

The Milliner is urgently closing the shutters on his shop as 
passersby hurry for home. Phoebe edges out of the alley 
nearby, turns, and finds herself face to face with Tyree. He 
regards her malevolently.

			TYREE
	Where you going?

			PHOEBE
		(scared)
	Nowhere.

			TYREE
	This is no time to be on the streets. 
	Maybe you oughta come along with me.

He grasps her arm hard and pulls her along the sidewalk.

EXT. BOOT HILL - OUTSIDE SILVERADO - DAY

The four horsemen and the boy pull up near the cemetery and 
look down at Silverado. Jake lowers Augie to the ground. 
Emmett hands him a blanket and speaks down to him.

			EMMETT
	Stay here till we get back. Don't 
	come in.

The four riders look from the town to each other and check 
their weapons.

			EMMETT
		(to them all)
	I'll see you around.

			PADEN
		(smiles)
	Last one to the Midnight Star buys.

			JAKE
	You're on! Let's get 'em!

Jake kicks the bare-back into motion and tears off directly 
toward town. Emmett heads off to the left. Paden begins to 
move after Jake, but slower. Mal stops him with --

			MAL
	Hey, Paden...

They look at each other.

			MAL
	Good luck.

Paden nods it back to him, and the bond is re-formed. Mal 
heads off at a gallop to the right. They are all going to 
enter town from different directions.

INT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

Rae MOANS loudly, and Stella instinctively reaches out to 
quiet her, worried about discovery. Stella throws a frustrated 
glance toward the door -- where is Phoebe?

She can't wait. She goes to the door and peeks out.

INT./EXT. MIDNIGHT STAR - SECOND FLOOR - DAY

Slick checks Rae's room and closes the door. He too is 
frustrated. Now he looks out the hall window, down at the 
alley.

WHAT HE SEES. Stella steps quickly out of the storage shed 
and moves away.

Slick runs for the steps.

EXT. ALLEY NEAR STORAGE SHED - DAY

Slick runs past the shed door and peers between buildings in 
search of Stella. She's gone. He comes back to the shed. 
Before opening the door he does an odd thing: he chops his 
left forearm sharply downward and a shiny derringer slides 
crisply into his grip from beneath his sleeve. He enters 
cautiously.

INT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

Slick moves through the dim light. He hears a MOAN and steps 
forward. He looks down at Rae. Half-delirious, she focuses 
on him and reacts in terror. He makes the derringer disappear 
and kneels beside her.

			SLICK
	Don't be afraid, baby. I'll stay 
	with you until your little friend 
	comes back.

EXT. STREET NEAR MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

Jake comes riding down the street, waving his hat, WHOOPING 
and HOLLERING. The few remaining pedestrians run for cover 
at the sight.

			JAKE
		(yelling)
	Come on out, boys! Jake's in town! 
	Let's start the ball!

EXT. MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

Jake jumps off the pinto and hitches it in front of the 
saloon. As he approaches the entrance, set in the cut-off 
corner of the building, he executes a fast pirouette, scanning 
down all four blocks that meet here. He finds the doors locked 
and kicks them open with a loud BANG. He goes inside.

EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

Tyree has heard the commotion and moves toward it.

EXT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Stella is pounding on the door without luck. She gives up, 
looks around, and hurries off.

EXT. MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

Tyree stops across the street from the Midnight Star and 
looks at Jake's horse and the open doors. Across the 
intersection Kyle appears at a run. Tyree motions him to go 
around the back of the saloon. Tyree runs across the street. 
When he is on the porch of the saloon, he pulls his gun and 
begins edging toward the open doors.

INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

It's dark in here with the shutters closed. Tyree jumps 
inside, gun poised. When Kyle bangs through from the back, 
Tyree almost shoots him. They scan the room and advance 
cautiously into the shadows. Nobody here. Now they back out, 
eyeing the dark stairwell.

When they are safely on the porch, Tyree motions for Kyle to 
go down one side of the building while he starts down the 
other.

Jake appears from beneath Stella's ramp behind the bar and 
vaults lightly over the bar. In a moment he stands just inside 
the open doorway. He peeks out, then turns so his back is to 
the outside, his guns still holstered.

EXT. MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

Jake backs quietly out onto the porch. When he stops, he can 
see both Tyree and Kyle moving along their respective porches.

			JAKE
	Hey!

Tyree and Kyle spin at the sound. Only then does Jake draw 
both guns and, pointing them in two completely different 
directions, he shoots both men at once.

INT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

Slick has made himself comfortable next to Rae, who has fallen 
into a fitful sleep. Now he hears something. The door of the 
shed opens and closes. He waits confidently for Stella to 
appear around the intervening wall of barrels and crates.

But he's looking too low. Mal steps into view, the big Henry 
rifle in his hand. Slick's eyes widen, but he gets control 
quickly and rises, trying to gauge Mal's attitude.

Mal looks from Rae to Slick and back to Rae.

			SLICK
	I'm glad you're here, Mal. I've been 
	watching her, but she needs a doctor.

			MAL
	Yeah.

He looks at Slick as he leans his rifle against the wall. 
Slick looks at the rifle, then at Mal. Mal seems to 
concentrate on Rae and makes a move that way. When he is 
past Slick, Slick makes the peculiar, chopping gesture of 
his left forearm that snaps the derringer into his hand.

Mal has been waiting for something and is already turning 
into Slick. Before Slick can raise his gun hand, Mal has 
Slick's wrist in a vise-like grip. Mal's other arm encircles 
Slick's torso and crushes him against Mal's body. Two strong 
men strain against each other.

The cocked derringer wavers perilously toward the sleeping 
Rae. Suddenly, Mal twists Slick around, banging his hand 
into the wall, and the derringer fires. Slick lets it clatter 
to the floor.

Rae wakes with a start and watches the combatants in terror.

The men's eyes are only inches apart. Something flashes 
through Mal's and he loosens his embrace. Instantly, Slick 
dips to the right, lifting his boot to his hand. But his 
dagger is not there.

Slick's surprised look is answered by Mal's tight grin.

			MAL
	Looking for this?

Their bodies jerk as Slick gets his last surprise and goes 
limp in Mal's arms. He falls to the floor, his own boot dagger 
protruding from his ribcage.

Mal kneels to embrace his sister.

EXT. STREETS ON FRINGE OF SILVERADO - DAY

Emmett rides slowly down the street, his Winchester held 
ready on his thigh. His eyes continually scan the buildings 
and alleyways. He slowly rounds a corner.

Way behind him, off his right shoulder, McKendrick has brought 
his horse to a stop between two buildings and is carefully 
aiming at Emmett's back with his Winchester. Now he pulls 
the hammer back with a CLICK.

Emmett hears it and twists in the saddle as McKendrick fires. 
The shot is good, but Emmett's Winchester takes the hit and 
jumps in his hand. He levels it at McKendrick, cocks the 
hammer, and squeezes the trigger. Nothing. He tries to work 
the lever as McKendrick fires again. Emmett's rifle is 
useless. He throws it away and draws his Colt, firing twice.

Emmett's bullets hit close to McKendrick. His horse shies. 
McKendrick turns his horse and rides behind a building.

SERIES OF SHOTS. Emmett chases after McKendrick along a 
parallel street. Each man prepares to fire as they reach the 
intermittent spaces between buildings. McKendrick gets a 
clear shot and fires twice. Emmett rides around a building 
and speeds toward McKendrick's path. He comes into the open, 
ready to fire, but McKendrick is heading off down an alley. 
Rather than follow, Emmett moves to cut him off.

EXT. EDGE OF SILVERADO - DAY

McKendrick has pulled up behind a barn. When Emmett comes 
into view, McKendrick fires twice, then spurs his horse back 
into town. Emmett squeezes off one carefully aimed shot, 
just missing McKendrick before he disappears.

EXT. BOOT HILL - DAY

The echoes of gunfire reach the little boy waiting at the 
cemetery. Augie watches and wonders.

EXT. HOTEL STREET - DAY

McKendrick comes out of an alley and tears toward the 
intersection which Dusty commands from the roof of the hotel 
porch. McKendrick waves his rifle at Dusty and rounds the 
corner of the hotel.

Now Emmett comes out of the alley in pursuit. He slows a bit 
since McKendrick is no longer in sight. As he moves down the 
block toward the hotel intersection, he looks into the loading 
yard of the feed warehouse, which forms a cul-de-sac on his 
left.

Now Dusty opens fire from the protection of the hotel sign. 
Bullets kick up dirt around Emmett, but instead of retreating, 
he slings himself Indian-fashion down along the protected 
side of his horse, and rides toward the sign.

Emmett aims over the mane and fires: once, twice, through 
the sign. Dusty rises, hit, and Emmett kills him with a third 
shot. Dusty crashes through the sign to fall to the street.

Emmett has just straightened in his saddle and snapped open 
the loading gate of his empty Colt, when McKendrick opens up 
from where he has reappeared down the street. Emmett is hit 
in the thigh.

For one long second there is perfect clarity between the 
men. Emmett's eyes stare from his pain-contorted countenance 
at his adversary. McKendrick hesitates only a breath to look 
at Emmett before raising the rifle and charging.

Emmett wheels his horse and painfully spurs it back down the 
block. As McKendrick's fire hits around him, Emmett turns 
into the nearest cover -- the loading yard of the feed 
warehouse.

McKendrick rides toward the mouth of the loading yard with 
all he's got. He can't let Emmett reload. The glint of victory 
is in his eyes as he draws near the loading yard.

He raises his rifle in preparation for the coming clear shot 
at his trapped enemy. As his horse begins to pass in front 
of the loading yard, we hear a terrible RUMBLE OF HOOFBEATS 
on wood. McKendrick's expression changes to horror.

Emmett has ridden onto the loading dock of the warehouse and 
charged toward this end. Now he jumps his horse straight out 
into the air over McKendrick's horse. The hooves of Emmett's 
horse catch McKendrick full force with a HORRIBLE SOUND.

Emmett's horse lands on its feet, but just barely. From a 
cloud of dust Emmett watches McKendrick's horse race on, 
riderless. Its master is a still shape in the dirt.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Stella has been hurrying through the empty streets. Now she 
pauses to listen to the new silence.

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Cobb listens too. He sits on the steps at the front of his 
office, toying with an object in his hands. Now he brings it 
to his mouth. It is his sheriff's badge, and he breathes a 
fog onto it, then polishes it on his sleeve. He looks at it 
another moment, smiles to himself, then pins it on his chest.

EXT. STREETS NEAR SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Paden is walking. He is calm. He rounds a corner and moves 
out into the center of the new street.

AT THE END OF THE STREET. Cobb looks up from his seat and 
sees Paden coming toward him. He had a feeling it would be 
this way. It makes him sad. He stands up and walks to the 
center of the street.

Paden keeps coming. He watches Cobb, resigned. Now Paden 
stops.

Stella comes out of an alley. When she takes in the scene, 
she steps onto the sidewalk and puts her hand on a post. She 
looks back and forth between the men.

Cobb sees her, but his only real concern is Paden. Paden 
sees her, too. His gaze returns to Cobb.

			SHERIFF COBB
	What a waste. This could have been 
	such a sweet deal for us.

			PADEN
	Yeah. Bad luck.
		(a beat)
	Good-bye, Cobb.

			SHERIFF COBB
	Good-bye, Paden.

They both draw, and it's impossible to say who moved first. 
But one is luckier. Paden stands as Cobb falls.

Paden holsters his gun as though it weighed a hundred pounds.

CUT TO BLACK.

SLOW FADE-UP over the SOUNDS of tinkling glasses, piano music, 
and friendly voices.

INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

Four shot glasses sparkle in a line on the bar. A bottle of 
the good stuff is used to fill them.

Stella is pouring the drinks from behind the bar. Now the 
glasses are lifted by Mal, Jake, Paden, and Emmett. Stella 
holds up the bottle and proposes a toast --

			STELLA
	To California!

They echo her and clink glasses. Stella clinks with the 
bottle. When they toss back their drinks, she tips the bottle 
to her lips, then puts it down on the bar, as the four glasses 
come down.

			EMMETT
	Gotta go.

			MAL
	Right.

The four men move toward the door as Stella walks down her 
ramp. Emmett walks with a slight limp.

EXT. MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

Phoebe stands on the porch talking across to Rae, much 
recovered, who sits on the seat of a wagon heavily loaded 
with farming supplies. Rae wears a simple dress and looks 
quite different.

The men come out onto the porch. Emmett shakes Mal's hand 
and watches him climb onto the wagon. Mal gets the wagon 
going, and the other wave.

Jake has slipped his arm around Phoebe's waist. Now he turns 
her into his arms for a big kiss.

Emmett is watching Mal and Rae roll away when a woman's hand 
touches his back. He turns to find Hannah looking up at him. 
Paden watches from nearby.

			HANNAH
	Weren't you going to come out to say 
	good-bye?

			EMMETT
	I already did that.

			HANNAH
	This time you're really going?
		(he nods)
	You know where I'll be.

			EMMETT
	That I do.

They look at each other. She kisses him and steps back. When 
Emmett looks up from her, Paden is watching him with an amused 
look. The two men shake hands. Emmett and Jake mount up.

			JAKE
	So long, Paden.

Paden gives him a nod. Kate and Augie roll up in a buggy. In 
the back seat, a blanket across his legs, sits J.T. They 
wait for the brothers. Augie drives for his recovering mother. 
Stella comes out and stands by Phoebe.

Hannah is now standing next to Paden. Emmett looks at them 
as though they were a couple.

			EMMETT
		(to Paden)
	You might make a farmer yet.

			PADEN
	I've got a job.

He puts his arm against the post, and his coat is drawn back 
to reveal the shiny sheriff's badge on his vest.

Emmett touches the brim of his hat and turns his horse away. 
He and Jake flank the buggy and head off.

EXT. OUTSIDE OF TOWN - MORNING

Emmett and Jake take turns leaning down from their saddles 
to kiss Kate and Augie and shake hands with J.T.

			EMMETT
		(to Augie)
	Take care of your folks.

One final look, and they're off. Jake turns in the saddle 
only once --

			JAKE
	We'll be back!

They spur their horses forward, chasing their shadows, heading 
west.
