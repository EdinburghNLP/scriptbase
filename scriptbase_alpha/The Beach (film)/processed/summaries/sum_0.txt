Garland's novel centers on a young nicotine-addicted traveler named Richard, an avid pop-culture buff with a particular love for video games and Vietnam War movies.
While at a hotel in Bangkok, he finds a map left by his strange, whacked-out neighbor, who just committed suicide.
The map supposedly leads to a legendary island paradise where some other wayward souls have settled.
