</b>

<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Mr. and Mrs. Ben McKenna at the back of a motor coach
with their seven year old son, HANK. We do not see
much of the background which is receding from us.
THEY are studying the countryside from the windows at
each side of them. The CAMERA PULLS BACK down the
aisle of the bus revealing the other passengers. They
are a surprise, consisting of Arab men and women, with
an occasional civilian and French Army officer. The
CAMERA STOPS at the end of the bus.


<b>EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The French driver and a couple of his companions, Arab.


<b>EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The CAMERA MOVES BACK TO THE REAR OF THE BUS,
photographing the side windows. At the bottom of the
screen is the destination board. By the time we get
opposite the window out of which the McKennas are
looking, we have been able to read the words "CASABLANCA --
<b>MARRAKESH."
</b>

<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Ben and Hank are looking intently out the window.
Jo's interest seems only casual.

<b>                      HANK
</b>          Daddy -- you sure I never been to Africa
          before? It looks familiar.


<b>INT. BUS (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT
</b>
Shooting through the McKenna's window at the landscape
moving by. It is semiarid desert. A line of blue-
grey mountains in the distant.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Jo studies the landscape.

<b>                      JO
</b>          We saw the same scenery last summer
          driving to Las Vegas.

Hank turns, and smiles slightly.

<b>                        HANK
</b>            Oh sure. Where daddy lost all that
            money at the cr --

<b>                        BEN
</b>            Hank!

<b>                        HANK
</b>            -- table.

Ben gives his wife a look of exasperation, She smiles
at him.

<b>                        HANK
</b>            Hey look - a camel!


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT
</b>
Shooting through the McKenna's window. The bus     is
entering a small Arab village, Squat stone and    plaster
building, narrow streets, a few carts, donkeys    and one
camel. A  few pedestrians, mostly Arab men, few    women.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Ben puts his hand on Hank's shoulder.

<b>                        JO
</b>            This isn't really Africa, Hank.    It's
            French Morocco.

<b>                         BEN
</b>                (To her)
            Northern Africa.

<b>                        HANK
</b>            Still seems like Las Vegas.

<b>                        BEN
</b>                (Slightly indignant)
            We're only a hundred miles north of
            the Sahara Desert!


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT
</b>
The bus is passing through the center of the town.     We
move past a few shops, everything looking drab and
meager. The sun is strong and hot.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT
</b>
Hank studies the scene outside.   He shrugs.

<b>                      HANK
</b>          I dunno. In school they called it the
          Dark Continent.
              (He squints)
          It's twice as bright as Indianapolis!

Jo and Ban smile at Hank.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Just wait till you see Marrakesh.

<b>                       HANK
</b>          Marrakesh.   Sounds like a drink.

Ben runs his tongue across his lips.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          You bet it does.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT
</b>
The bus rolls on past the Arab village into the open
desert once again. It looks parched and grim.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Tired of watching the sameness of the desert, Hank
grows, restless. He looks about for something to do.
Ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes.
Jo takes a paper-bound novel out of her bag, finds her
place. Hank decides to wander down the aisle of the
bus and test its possibilities for adventure.

The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK with him as he rather aimlessly
makes for the front of the bus,. Having left the Arab
village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to
bump and sway somewhat. When Hank is a little better
than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a
particularly startling manner, causing Hank to stagger.
In order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to
grab the side of a seat. He misses the seat, and only
succeeds in clutching at the veil of an Arab woman.
Unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The startled woman, instantly horrified, covers her
face with her hands and gives a sharp cry,


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
With the bus still bumping and swaying, Hank staggers
a bit without realizing that he still has, hold of the
woman's veil.

<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
</b>
The woman still covers her face, but from the seat
next to her, and nearer the window, an Arab rises and
makes a sharp comment in Arabic to Hank. The Arab's
robes are brown, with a turban-like hat combining
twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, The
Arab starts to move past the woman, toward Hank,
repeating his demand.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
</b>
People look quickly toward the sound, wondering at the
reason for the trouble.


<b>INT. BUS (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The bus driver scans his rear vision mirror for the
source of the trouble behind him.


<b>INT. BUS (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Hank looks up at the oncoming Arab, and retreats
uncertainly, not realizing he is still holding the
veil.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The Arab in the brown robes begins assaulting the boy
in furious Arabic, indicating that he wants the veil.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Two Arabs, and a veiled woman, rise in their seats
apparently disturbed by what the brown-clothed Arab is
saying. They being talking among themselves.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Ben and his wife, Jo, are straining from their back
seat and looking down the aisle to see what is wrong.
Ben looks at his wife quickly and then back, indicating
that Hank is involved.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Still staring straight at the Arab, both frightened
and fascinated by his verbal attack, Hank retreats.

<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
</b>
Except for the French passengers, everyone in the bus
is in a state of disturbance. The Arab continues to
advance on Hank keeping up a steady tirade of Arabic.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Ben rises quickly and advances protectively toward his
son and the oncoming Arab.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
</b>
Hank retreats and squeezes himself against his mother,
still with the veil in one hand. Ben faces the Arab
who stops, but continues his monologue for Ben's
benefit.

<b>                       BEN
</b>          Now wait a minute.     Wait a minute.
          Simmer down.

The Arab continues pointing, talking.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
From a nearby seat a young Frenchman in civilian clothes
rises quickly. The CAMERA PANS him to Ben and the
Arab. He pushes in between the pair.

<b>                         LOUIS
</b>              (To Ben)
          Pardon me.

He turns to the Arab, moves him back   a little, sharply
silences his attack, and then begins,   in Arabic, to
explain firmly that the boy meant, no   harm. It was an
accident. The Arab isn't convinced,    points to Hank.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The Frenchman leans toward Hank and takes the veil he
is still unconsciously holding. He hands it to the
Arab with a sharp command to return to his seat. The
Arab turns away carrying the veil. As the CAMERA PANS
him AWAY, we see the spectators resuming their seats,
growing quiet.


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Hank and Jo relax. Ben addresses the Frenchman, a
pleasant-looking young man. He is LOUIS BERNARD.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          I'd like to thank you. Without your
          help, anything might have happened.

<b>                      LOUIS
</b>              (smiles pleasantly)
          A pleasure, monsieur. There are moments
          in life when we all need a little help.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          May I introduce my wife, Mrs. McKenna.

Louis turns pleasantly to Jo.

<b>                      LOUIS
</b>          How do you do, madame.      My name is
          Louis Bernard.

She returns his smile.

<b>                      JO
</b>          Thank you, Mr. Bernard.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          And this is our son, Hank.

<b>                         LOUIS
</b>          Hallo, Hank.

He holds out his hand to Hank, who takes it.

<b>                      HANK
</b>          You talk Arab talk.

<b>                         LOUIS
</b>          A few words.

<b>                      JO
</b>          Why was he so angry?      It was an
          accident.

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>              (Half shrugs)
          The Moslem religion allows for few
          accidents.
              (To Ben)
          May I be permitted to sit down?

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Oh, sure, sure.      0f course.   Next to
          Jo, there.

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>              (Pauses)
          I thought his name was Hank.

<b>                         BEN

          That's my wife's name. Jo.      Jay oh.
          No "e."


<b>INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Louis Bernard slides into the seat next to Jo, who
moves over slightly. Ben sits on the other side so
that Hank and Jo are between himself and Louis. In
the rear windows behind them we see the retreating
landscape of French Morocco.

<b>                      LOUIS
</b>          How different.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          For Josephine. Called her Jo so long,
          nobody knows her by any other name.

<b>                       HANK
</b>          I do.   Mummy.

She smiles at Hank, rubs the back of his neck.

The bus pulls up to a stop, the door opens, and the
passengers begin to file out. The McKennas, together
with Louis Bernard, are the last off the bus. Arab
helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus,
to unload the baggage. The clean-cut airline baggage
of the McKennas is in sharp contrast to the Hessianroped
bundles of the Arabs. There are nearby fiacres to
take the people to their various destinations in the
city, and some small, undersized taxi cabs.

But he has turned his head and speaks something in

Louis turns to the porter, and orders him  in Arabia to
put the McKenna's baggage aboard the first  available
carriage. He picks up his own small bag.

a moment, while Ben turns to see what is happening to

Hank looks up happily to his mother, as she sings to
him with love. Hank whistles a harmony accompaniment
to the next verse.

<b>                      JO
</b>          Now I have children of my own
          They ask their mother "What will I
          be?"
          Will I be handsome?
          Will I be rich?
          I tell them tenderly:

They sing the chorus in harmony together.

She puts down     her drink with some exasperation. As
she does, she     glances back toward Ben. He's getting
his coat, but     pauses to give her a slight smile and a
look that says     "You're wasting your time."

The CAMERA PANS Jo past Ben to the door. He has just
put on his coat, and turns to follow her to the door.
She opens it, and standing in the corridor is a
silhouetted figure. We cannot see the face. Jo
switches on a light, which reveals a rather studious
looking man of medium height standing there.

Jo looks at Ben helplessly, who looks over his shoulder
toward Louis Bernard for help in translating the French.

As the McKennas turn, the man in the doorway lifts
himself on tiptoe a little and gives a sharp look in
the direction of Louis Bernard.


<b>INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The man immediately turns his attention back to Ben,
and begins talking in broken English.

As Ben closes the door, we see that Louis Bernard has
been advancing into the room for a better look at the

            May I use your telephone?

Ben gestures that the phone is his. The CAMERA PANS
Louis to the phone, which he picks up, and begins
talking in French asking first for the operator, and a
certain number. Beyond that his conversation is a
mystery, because his face reveals nothing. (Possibly
speaks Arabic.)


<b>INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT

As Louis Bernard talks on the phone, Ben goes to   pick
up his drink. He comes back into the room, as JO    enters
once again from the bedroom. She looks at Louis,    then
at Ben who shrugs his shoulders. Louis finishes    his
phone conversation, hangs up.

The CAMERA is slowly MOVING around the interior of an
Arab restaurant catering to European tourists. It has
a Moorish atmosphere, and the diners are sitting on
cushions or low sofas. Long-robed waiters are padding
in and out from the kitchens, quietly and efficiently
serving food. There are no Arab women to be seen.
The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled
with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes.
Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in
the background. The light is supplied principally
from candles.

As the CAMERA completes its sweep around and COMES TO
REST on the entrance, we see Ben and Jo arriving.

          me please.

The headwaiter turns and moves into the restaurant,
The McKennas follow him, the CAMERA PANNING them. Ben
is interested in everything he sees. Jo glances at
the diners, and then a look of surprise starts through
her face.

They are passing a couple who are seated on cushions
eating. The couple look up at Ben and Jo. They are
the same two people we saw come out of the Hotel
Mamounia just as the McKennas entered. The woman had
stared at Jo, and she does it again, nudging the man
next to her with an elbow. The McKennas almost pass
them, then stop. The woman continues half-looking
over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner.

The headwaiter shows them to their seats -- two cushions
directly behind those of the two people who stared at
them.

He bows and departs. Jo seems disturbed, looks around
as if trying to find another seat.

to fold his long legs underneath him.

He turns to Jo, expecting to find her amused at his
antics, but instead her face is serious, and she has a
secret look about her. She leans close to him.

</b>          What people?

She gives a quiet, warning nod toward the two people
sitting behind them. Ben cranes his head around, but
all he can see Is the back of a woman's head. He turns
back.

<b>                      JO

Ben looks at her, then slowly turns his head to look
behind him at the couple. As he does, the woman behind
him also turns. They are staring directly at each
other.

</b>          Good evening.

Hearing her voice, Jo turns, looks, and so does the
man with Mrs. Drayton. The woman then turns half way
around toward Jo.

<b>                      MRS. DRAYTON
</b>          You must think me awfully rude. I've
          been staring at you ever since I saw

the room. As he moves away from the entrance, Louis
Bernard does not look at the McKennas.

As the couple traverses the restaurant, our four diners
watch them -- the Draytons out of idle curiosity, but
the McKennas with growing astonishment as they realize
that Bernard has no intention of recognizing them, or
speaking to them. Jo turns back to Ben.

<b>                      JO
</b>          Well just what do you think of that?
          First he promises to take us to dinner --

</b>          Look, we only met him today. We can't
          expect him to change his whole life --

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Can you blame him? Turning down an
          old married couple for a date with a

<b>                       JO

Drayton, quietly amused, is listening to Ben and Jo.
But Mrs. Drayton is embarrassed. She makes conversation
at random.

          I must do some shopping in the market
          tomorrow. I do hope it'll be fine.

          how our English weather is awful, but
          I sometimes think we don't know when

          By the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd
          let us show you round the market place,
          tomorrow.

<b>                      JO
</b>          Louis Bernard, the big buyer from

She pushes him down again.

              (To the Draytons)
          We'd love to go with you.

Ben glares in Bernard's direction, and then picks up a
chicken leg.

<b>                      JO
</b>          I don't know why Ben gets so worked up
          over unimportant things.

Ben looks a her slowly, and with some amazement. Then
his eyes lift a little and he sees the headwaiter
standing nearby gesturing to him to please use only
three fingers. Ben looks down at the chicken leg. He
is holding it gripped in his fist. This is too much.
He throws the leg down to his plate in disgust.

further part of the chase. We see the white-robed

difficulty of the obstacles enables the Arab to get
ahead of them, and we see that he is now able to dodge
through an archway into the grain market.

As the Arab moves along the narrow street, with the

helplessly into a lags pottery store. The sound of

brilliantly dyed wool yarn hang, from overhead strung
along sapling poles. There is in unfortunate collision
between the fleeing Arab end a workman crossing the
street with a large vat of blue dye on his shoulder.
In a moment the whole narrow streetway is saturated
with blue dye, and everyone is lifting his robe and
hopping around to avoid being stained. The Arab
continues on past. The police dash through the street
trying to avoid the dye themselves.

up and backward with the sharp pain of the stabbing,
Then he staggers into the dark shadows.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT
</b>
A high shot shows that the stabbed man is almost out
of sight for a moment so that the police continue their
chase after the second man, who has swiftly darted
down another side turning.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
The CAMERA MOVES IN behind the stabbed Arab. The knife
is still in his back. We get a glimpse of his hands,
vainly groping behind him. The CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM
as he staggers out into the open market place. His
shadow on the ground shows us the silhouette of the
knife handle sticking out from his back. The CAMERA
MOVES IN CLOSE to follow the agony of his head and
shoulders as he attempts to go forward.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT
</b>
The CAMERA seems to pass BEYOND HIM for a moment, and
there, a few yards away, stands Ben McKenna, and his
group.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The Arab hesitates for  a moment, but the attitude of
his head shows us that  he has seen McKenna. He makes
his way desperately and  painfully toward him. He is
finding it difficult to  remain upright and even take
those last few steps.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
A closer view  of McKenna shows that those around him,
including his  wife and the Draytons, become frightened.
He spreads his  arms out to move them back protectively,
waiting to see  what is going to happen.

As the Arab reaches McKenna, the knife drops from his
back, and he collapses at Ben's feet. Ben endeavors
to grab him as he falls. He misses his shoulders, and
his hands close in and inadvertently grab the Arab's
cheeks.

A big close up of Ben's hands as his fingers slide off
the Arab's face. He turns his hands up and we see
they are covered with black grease paint.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The Arab's head his now dropped to the ground, and we
see streaks of white flesh showing through the dark
makeup which Ben's fingers had scraped off.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Ben drops to his knees to examine the man better.   The
Arab gasps out something in French.

<b>                      LOUIS
</b>          Ils ont trouvés... ils ont réussi à
          trouver...

Ben looks at him puzzled.

<b>                      LOUIS
</b>              (English)
          McKenna... I'm... Louis.... Bernard.

Ben is quite surprised.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Ben glances swiftly at the fallen knife, and then
reaches across Louis Bernard to turn him over and
examine his wound. But the Frenchman reaches up with
one arm and grabs Ben by the coat.

<b>                      LOUIS
</b>          McKenna -- listen to me -- first!

With what strength he has, Louis drags Ben down until
Ben's ear is near to his mouth. With a great effort
Louis whispers to him.

<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

A big closeup of Ben's ear and Louis' mouth enables us
to hear the whispering, but Louis' voice is fading so
much that we cannot distinguish the words -- at least
enough to make any sense out of what he says.

<b>                      LOUIS
</b>          A man...a statesman...is to be

Presently, the mouth stops speaking.    It remains still
and open.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As Ben backs away, we see the staring eyes, and open
mouth of Louis. Ben quickly puts his hand inside the
robes to feel for Louis' heart, The hand slowly
withdraws. Ben rises.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
</b>
The Arabs crowd in to see the details. Louis Bernard,
the McKennas and the Draytons are in the center of a
large flat cement section of the market place. The
Police by now have caught up to the event, and dash
quickly into the picture toward Ben and Louis.
Instinctively Ben backs away, as do the Draytons, and
Jo and Hank. However, Ben still stays closer than the
rest. One of the police picks up the knife and examines
it, another bends down to wipe the make-up off Louis
Bernard's face. Ben looks around for his wife.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Ben beckons to his wife beyond him, to join him. Jo
turns Hank over to Mrs. Drayton. Hank stands close to
the English woman as Jo comes over. As Jo comes up to
Ben, he is feeling in his pocket for something. Takes
out a pen.

<b>                      JO
</b>          Ben -- who is he?

<b>                      BEN

           Yes. Yes. He's dead.

She   produces a small address book. Ben snatches it
out   of her hand unceremoniously. He opens the book
end   begins writing something down fast. Jo watches
him   with mystified curiosity.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
Drayton strolls up, out of curiosity. He has also
seen Ben's hurried writing, but Ben casually puts the
notebook back into his inside pocket, along with the
pen. Before either man can comment on the writing,
the voice of a policeman is heard, speaking in French.

<b>                       POLICE ONE
</b>           Savez vous qui est cet homme?

The uniformed French policeman approaches Ben.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The policeman repeats his question as he stops in front
of Ben.

<b>                       POLICE
</b>           J'ai dit: Savez vous qui est cet homme?

Drayton steps forward to help.   He addresses the police.

<b>                       DRAYTON
</b>           Il ne parle pas francais.   Je traduirái.

The policeman nods.   Drayton turns to Ben.

<b>                       DRAYTON
</b>           He wants to find out if you know this
           man.

The policeman watches their faces.

<b>                       JO
</b>           Of course we know him!
               (She points)
           It's the frenchman, Louis Bernard.

Her gestures, and her comments, although In English,
give the policeman all the information he needs.

are now covering with a sheet.

He gives them some instructions in French.

Ben looks at Jo in a way that says "Who asked you to
say anything."

The French policeman returns to the group.    He addresses
Drayton.

<b>                      POLICE MAN
</b>          Quel est le nom de ces personnes?

<b>                      DRAYTON

</b>          Dites leur que j'aimerai qu'ils viennent
          tous les deux au commissariat pour

Drayton nods unhappily, and turns to Ben and Jo.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Just as I thought. He wants both of
          you to go to police headquarters to
          make a statement.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Do we have to?

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          I'm afraid so.
              (He turns to wife)
          Our friends here have to go to the

          to give what help I can.

to Hank's hand.

Police Two moves across the square with Drayton. Ben
and Jo precede them. Drayton begins conversing in
French with them about the crime, but we cannot
distinguish their words clearly. Jo looks back and
gives a little wave to Hank.


<b>EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The McKenna's are walking across the square with the
Police and Drayton a few yards behind them. The CAMERA
MOVES with them. Jo moves close to Ben and speaks to
him in a surreptitious manner.

<b>                      JO
</b>          Why should he suddenly turn up in Arab-
          outfit, wearing makeup?

<b>                      BEN

          killed?

<b>                      JO
</b>          I'll bet he was a spy, or something
          like that.

Ben looks at her with some surprise.

<b>                      JO
</b>          Ben, what did he whisper to you?    What
          did you write down?

<b>                      BEN
</b>          I'll tell you later.

Ben looks at his hands.

<b>                        JO
</b>          What is it?

<b>                      BEN

The main hallway and waiting room of the Police Station
in Marrakesh. French and Arab personnel move up and
down the wide hallway from one doorway to another.
There is a babble of voices and the sound of phones
heard off. The McKennas and Drayton are seated on a
long bench, waiting to be called into the inner office
of the Police Inspector. Drayton sits next to Ben.
It is hot. Jo has eyes for everything, but Ben seems
to be somewhat impatient. He looks at his watch for
the third or fourth time in a minute.

Drayton notices him studying his watch. He leans to
him, and at the same time wipes off the side of his on
face with a handkerchief.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Once we talk to the police inspector,

          tape.

<b>                      JO
</b>          I have to stretch.

She gets up and saunters away, looking around the police
station for whatever there is to see. Drayton speaks
to Ben with reassuring geniality.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          I'm afraid the questions will go on
          till doomsday, if you admit knew this
          chap Bernard before.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          I didn't know him at all.     We only met
          yesterday on a bus.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          They're a cynical lot, these French --
          they might refuse to believe that.

<b>                      BEN

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          It might sound a bit odd,    from their

Ben looks at Drayton, waiting for his to go on.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          The question is, are you going to show
          them what you wrote down?

Before Ben can say any more, a policeman opens the
door leading to the Police Inspector's office. He
calls out.


<b>INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
</b>
Jo turns around at the sound of the door opening, and
Ben and Drayton start to rise from the bench.

The policeman steps aside, holding the door, as a Police
Inspector comes out of the office from behind him. He
is a short, heavy-built-dark man. He does not smile.


<b>INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The Inspector walks a few steps into the corridor,
stops. Ben, Jo and Drayton approach him. Drayton
speaks first.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les
          McKenna. Mon nom est Drayton. Ils ne
          parlent pas francais et ils m'ont

The Inspector answers in English.

<b>                      INSPECTOR
</b>          Thank you, Monsieur Drayton, but a
          translator will not be necessary.

He stops aside, and wait.

</b>              (To Drayton)
          Do to the kindness to wait. I might
          have questions for you later.

He motions to the McKennas. Jo goes past him first,
into the office, followed by Ben, Drayton returns to
the bench, and watches the trio as the office door
closes on them.

He waves the McKenna to chairs, as he goes around behind
his desk and remains standing. Ben and Jo sit down.
The Inspector looks at some papers on his desk, then
holds out his hand.

<b>                      INSPECTOR

Ben looks at Jo, who fishes for them in her purse.
She takes them out, hands them to Ben, who hands them
to the Inspector. He scrutinizes them. Uncomfortable,
Ben retreats to a chair and sits down, waiting. The
inspector checks the pictures against the people he
sees sitting in his office, then puts the passports
down on his desk.

<b>                      INSPECTOR

comment was an unnecessary interruption. Then his
eyes return to Ben.

The policeman points over his shoulder to in outside
office.

The CAMERA PANS Ban as he follows the policeman down
the outside corridor, past Drayton who is still sitting
on a bench and watching Ben somewhat anxiously, and
into a small plain office.


<b>INT. SMALL OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The policeman enters the small office   first. There is
a desk, more like a table, and a phone   is lying on it
off the hook. The policeman picks it    up, and hands it
to Ben. Ben holds it without speaking    a second, and
waves the policeman out.

The policeman is indifferent.    He leaves.   Ben puts
the phone to his ear.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Hello.


<b>INT. ROOM - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

A robed Arab is sitting in a chair holding a telephone.
The room is part of a rather elaborate Moorish house.
The Arab speaks in accented English.

As Ben answers, he idly looks through the open doorway
toward Drayton sitting on the bench outside.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          This is McKenna.     Who's calling me?

The Arab doesn't bother to identify himself.

There is an audible click in the receiver held in Ben's
hand.

<b>                         BEN
</b>          Hello.

There is no answer. Ben lowers the phone slightly,
looks at it a minute, then continues on downward with
it, returning the receiver to the phone cradle. He
stands a brief moment in thought, then half turns toward
Drayton sitting in the corridor outside. He motions
to Drayton to join him in the office

<b>                         BEN
</b>          Drayton!

The Englishman gets up and comes into the small office.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Didn't your wife say she was taking
          Hank straight back to the hotel?

<b>                         DRAYTON
</b>          As I recall.     Why?

Ben picks up the phone, hands it to Drayton.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Call her. Somebody just threatened me
          about Hank. See if he's all right.

Drayton reacts with surprise, speaks into the Phone.
He speaks French.

<b>INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
As Ben enters the office, both Jo and the Inspector
look up him inquiringly.

<b>                      JO
</b>          Who was it, Ben?

Ben adopts as casual an air as he can under the
circumstances. He doesn't sit down. He speaks more
to the Inspector than to his wife, avoiding her eyes.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          It was the Concierge at the Hotel. He
          heard we were being held by the Police
          and thought there was some way he could
          help us.

<b>                      JO
</b>          That was nice of him.

<b>                      BEN
</b>              (Looking at Inspector)
          I told him if we weren't back there in
          fifteen minutes to call the American
          Consulate in Casablanca.

The Inspector has realised that he won't get any more
out of Ben.

<b>                      INSPECTOR
</b>              (charmingly)
          But, Monsieur, if you had only told me
          in the first place, that you wished to
          consult with your consul!

Ben gives him a look.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Let's go, Jo.

<b>                      INSPECTOR
</b>          There is just one small formality. I
          must request you to sign a statement

<b>                      BEN
</b>          If it doesn't take too long.

<b>                      INSPECTOR
</b>          But a moment. I will send for a typist.

Reluctantly the Inspector reaches for a phone on his
desk. Jo looks at her husband somewhat puzzled.

He gives her a warning glance to be quiet.   She does.
He reaches out, takes her hand.

Ben and Jo are riding along in an open Victoria, headed
back for the Hotel Mamounia. Ben seems preoccupied
with his thoughts.

<b>                      JO
</b>              (Holds out her hand)

<b>                      BEN

She holds out her hand more firmly.

<b>                      JO
</b>          I'm your wife, Ben -- not the police
          inspector. Let's see it.

Reluctantly, Ben takes out the notebook, hands it to
her. Ben watches her as she reads the note he has
written.

The notebook page held by Jo on which Ben has scribbled
Louis Bernard's message. It reads: "A MAN...A

Jo looks up, soberly.

<b>                      BEN

<b>                      JO

          ...is at stake, I know, But I'm not
          sure of what's the right thing to do.

She closes the notebook. Ben reaches over, takes it
from her and replaces it in his pocket. She stares
ahead, with her own thoughts. Then she speaks.

Ben is uncomfortable, and unhappy, but he tries to
hide it. He leans toward Jo as if he's about to tell
her something important. He reaches out, places his
hand over hers.

<b>                      BEN

She is puzzled with him. Shrugs her shoulders. Slumps
to a sitting position on the bed. She ribs her face
and her eyes with a gesture of fatigue. There is the
sound of running water in the bathroom. When she looks
up again, Ben is standing in front of her. In one
hand he his two capsules, in the other a glass of water.
He holds them out to her. His manner is casual and
pleasant.

She stops talking. He looks at her more closely.
Then he walks over to her and sits down on the bed
next to her. He looks at her intensely.

<b>                      JO

He prevents her.

          whispered to me in the market place
          that something...something might happen

<b>                      BEN

violent gesture, and all but screams.

</b>          Ben!!   I could kill you!   Sedative!

He reaches for her again.    She hits him away.

</b>          All this time you, knew Hank was gone,
          and you wouldn't tell me.

<b>                      BEN

She is fighting the drug which is beginning to take
over again.

</b>          He's my child more than yours!    I had

He takes hold of her again. She struggles fiercely,
trying to get away, to hit him, kick him.

          We've got to find him.

He struggles silently with her, trying to push her
down on the bed, and hold her until the drug does its
work.

He has forced her down on   the bed, pinioning her arms,
even though her legs still   struggle somewhat. She is
having a hard time seeing,   or talking. Her head waves
back and forth. It's hard    work for Ben to hold her.

Her legs grow quiet. Her arm relax somewhat. She is
still straining to move her head, and talk, but all
that comes out are unintelligible sounds and a half
moan of anguish. Then she's gone. Ben looks at her a
moment, relaxes his grip. He lowers his head down
against hers. He seem to be fighting the desire to
cry. He finally gains control of himself. He lifts
his head slightly, gives her a soft and heartfelt kiss
on the cheek.

Ben stands up. The weight of unhappiness is heavy on
him. He gets a blanket from the foot of the bed and

As the light of sunset fades into growing darkness,
the muezzin stands atop the minaret, arms raised to
the heavens and giving out his high, sing-song call to
prayer. The call is taken up by another voice somewhere
in the city, and then another, and still another --
until the prayer is a continuous round of chanting
starting close, moving away, almost fading, and then
returning.

The chant of the call to prayer can be heard In the

despondently carrying Hank's small suits, and other
articles of clothing from the closet to in open suitcase

clothes, he looks out of the door into the large

We now see Ben's face as he packs his suitcases. Beyond
him, past his shoulder, we see his wife staring in his
direction. He continues to talk, although he finds it
difficult to be matter-of-fact, moving back and forth
from the dresser drawers to the suitcases.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Both the Draytons are definitely gone.
          The hotel register says they come from
          London. Drayton told the concierge he
          was a college professor. The only
          thing to do now is to get out of
          Marrakesh.

Her face shows a slight rise in reaction, mostly
puzzlement.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          As individuals we're helpless here.
          And because of that phone call, we

          even thought of taking that chance.

He pauses, and glances at her to see how she reacts.
She just stares at his her eyes a little dull.

Ben goes to take some of Jo's clothes out of drawer,
and comes up with a play script. He looks at it a
moment, then back to Jo. Her eyes observe it, but she
says nothing. Ben continues on to the suitcase, where
he lays the script in with the clothes.

just stares at him.

</b>          So we're going to London to find him.

He looks at her for a reaction. She turns her head
away from him as if in disagreement, or perhaps fighting
for control of her emotions. Ben crosses to her, the
CAMERA PANNING him. He sits down on the edge of the
bed, and takes out the small notebook from his coat.
He opens it. In careful, low tones, he reads Louis
Bernard's message.

          Ambrose Chappell guy is our only hope.
          Understand, Jo?

Jo puts out a weary hand as though to dismiss the piece
of paper, and all that it contains. Again she turns
her head away. Slowly Ben puts the paper back into
pocket. He speaks with a shade more urgency in his
voice.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          We've only got a few hours, Jo! We
          have to got up and start moving.

Ben gets up, and the CAMERA PANS him to  the dresser
and the suitcases. Then he pauses and   looks back at
Jo who is still looking away. Jo turns   back to look
at Ben. She is studying him now as if   she has just
seen him for the first time. Her eyes   are more alert.
Ben turns back to his packing.

<b>                      BEN

For a moment she stands there looking at him, and then
impulsively she throws her arms around him and clings
to him. Her anguish is genuine.

His tone and manner  of asking them leaves little doubt
that his question is  an order. The McKennas glance at

Jo settles back, unhappy, discouraged and a little
resentful of Buchanan. Ben seems irritated by the
disappointment.

Buchanan continues quietly.

<b>                      BUCHANAN
</b>          We might find him. Quite soon, indeed,
          if we work together...Louis Bernard
          was sent to Marrakesh by the French at
          our request to check up on an
          assassination plot -- here, in London.
          A good agent keeps on staking his life.
          He doesn't always win.

Ben and Jo watch Buchanan carefully.

<b>                      BUCHANAN
</b>          Bernard reckoned you were a man to
          trust. He relied on you, to come to
          us.

Jo looks at Ben.   He thinks a moment, but says nothing.

<b>                      BUCHANAN
</b>          Those people kidnapped your boy -- in

          right, isn't it?

<b>                      BEN

<b>                      BUCHANAN
</b>          Then why didn't you go straight to

Buchanan seem only casually obvious of the exchange.
But he has noted it In his mind.

<b>                      BUCHANAN
</b>          You're convinced that these people

Ben starts to interrupt.

Buchanan holds up a hand to interrupt him.

          Your son is the trump card these people

The Pressure on Jo is beginning to weaken her.      Buchanan
persists.

</b>          If you don't tell me all you know, you

Jo, a creature of emotion, is bewildered and upset and
tired of fighting Buchanan. She is ready to give in.
She looks to Ben.

Buchanan turns to Ben.

now, trying to evaluate things quickly,

He is interrupted by a tapping at the door. Buchanan
looks up, as do the McKennas. The CAMERA PANS Buchanan
to the door as he opens it himself. His assistant
Woburn is there. There is a whispered conversation.
Woburn retreats, and Buchanan turns back to the room.

There is a sudden click. Ben rattles the receiver.
All he gets is a dial tone. He hangs up, and turns to
Jo who is quietly crying, trying to get over the shock
of hearing Hank. Buchanan enters the office as Ben
takes jo by the shoulders and turns her around to him.
He takes out a handkerchief, hands it to her. She
covers her face for a moment, then dries her tears.
She looks up at Ben.

<b>                      JO
</b>          He was scared.

She starts sobbing soundlessly again, her body shaking.
Ben takes her in his arms to quiet her. She quiets
down slowly. Buchanan standing behind the desk doesn't
look at the pair, but he speaks first.

nods for Woburn to leave. Woburn does, casting a side
glance of sympathy toward Jo and Ben. He closes the
door quietly behind him.

Buchanan looks at the pair, and sighs in a manner that
suggests he recognizes defeat, when he sees it.

Jo now has herself under control. She leaves Ben's
arms, and returns to her seat to gather herself
together, dry her eyes. Ben turns to Buchanan.

In a suite at Savoy's Hotel we see the door open and
Ben and Jo McKenna are ushered into the suite by the
frock-coated desk clerk. Behind them are two assistant
porters carrying their bags. In the foreground, through
which we are SHOOTING, are three large baskets of
assorted flowers. They are obviously gift of greeting
to London. The porters move off into the bedroom with
the bags. They lay out the bags, open the drapes and
windows, etc. The desk clerk turns on the lights in
the main room, as the McKennas look about.

Ben takes it. The    porters come out of the  bedroom.
Ben reaches in his   pocket, comes up with a  bill, hands
it to one of them.    The porter touches his  forehead in
sort of a salute.    The porters exit. The   desk clerk
follows, pauses at   the door.

smiling, they are not.

<b>                        BEN
</b>          Oh yes.    Thank you.

The desk clerk goes out the door, carefully closing
it. The McKenna are alone. Jo turns to look at the
basket of flowers, and crosses TOWARD THE CAMERA to
look at them. She takes a card in her hand, attached
to the largest basket, reads the note.

Ben puts the room key down on a table, and the CAMERA
PANS him over to a smaller desk containing the telephone
and telephone books. He sits down at the desk, and
reaches for the general telephone directory. He begins
flipping through the pages. Jo turns from the flowers
and walks over to him. He pauses, takes out of his
pocket the black notebook on which he wrote Louis
Bernard's message. He tears out the page, hands the
notebook to Jo.

to stop him. He looks at her with some annoyance.

He waits and at that moment there is a sudden, loud,
but happy pounding on the door. Both Jo and Ben jump
and turn toward the door, almost frightened.

Muffled shouts are heard of "Open up! We know you're
in there! Jo! It's us! We're here!"

people pour in. They are Val Parnall and his wife.

more of a character actress than a lead -- and Jan
Peterson, a musical comedy singer nearer Jo's age,

throws her arms around Jo in affectionate greeting.

          be here  long!

Ben has been watching them anxiously, torn between
hanging up the phone, or waiting for his call to go
through. The call finally comes through.

He looks up at the group.     They notice him for the
first time.

<b>EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
In a quiet street off Camden Town we see Ben, alight
and pay off a London taxi. The taxi does a U-turn and
disappears around a corner. Ben starts to walk TOWARD
THE CAMERA. He glances at the piece of paper from,
his pocket bearing Ambrose Chappell's address. He is
completely alone in a deserted street -- so much so
that his footsteps click on the pavement and create
the feeling of an echo. As he walks he listens to the
echo ind for a moment wonders if it is an echo. He
slows up and comes to a stop close to the CAMERA.
There is complete silence -- only the faint distant
London traffic noises.

this time the echo continues. He becomes tense, looks
around in alarm.

There is no sign of anyone.

Ben resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING  him. He
stops suddenly, as though to trap the echo  -- but the

resumes his walk with a more hurried pace.   The echo
gets louder. He glances quickly over his   shoulder
again.

A man is following him, at about the same pace.   He is
rather well dressed, and appears nonchalant.

glances behind him.

Ben glances down at the paper in his hand, and looks
up trying to locate the right house number as he walks.
The street has a mixture of houses, yards, an odd dirty-
looking store or two. Ben's expression indicates that
he would like to make his destination before the man
following catches up with him. Then he changes his
mind. He deliberately slows up.

man approaching behind him, listening with the back of

Ben instinctively clenches his right hand into a fist
of preparedness. As the man closes in Ben we see that
he is rather elderly, sixty years old, perhaps. As
the man reaches Ben, and passes him, Ben's follows him
and study him.


<b>EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Ben watches the   man go on ahead of him at a faster
pace. Suddenly    the man turns a sharp right into
doorway, and is   gone. Ben glances at the paper in his
hand. He stops    and looks up in astonishment.

through the doorway.

Ben, rather cautiously, makes his  way  across a small
and somewhat dreary-looking yard,  and  comes to face a
low building at the end of which  is a  kind of small
factory. The door of the factory   is  just closing as
he makes his way across.

Ben turns back to Chappell Jr. He moves in a little
closer, and drops his voice somewhat. Chappell Jr.
watches him warily.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Let's stop fencing with words, huh?
          Bernard told me to come here, just
          before he died.

<b>                      CHAPPELL JR.
</b>          This man is...dead?

<b>                      BEN
</b>          You know it as well as I do. Now I
          came to make a business proposition.
          And I don't see how you can turn it
          down.

Ambrose Chappell looks over to a man stuffing animal's
corpse.

<b>                      CHAPPEEL JR.
</b>          What did you have in mind?

<b>                      BEN
</b>          You want to talk here?

<b>                      CHAPPELL JR.
</b>          Certainly. We have no secrets from
          our employees.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Okay. First of all, I haven't uttered
          one word of what Bernard told to before
          he died. And I won't. Frankly I'm
          not interested in political intrigue,
          and I don't care who it is you're going
          to kill here in London. All I want is
          that boy, and I'll get on the first
          plane for America.

When Ben begins mentioning a killing, Chappell Jr's
face takes on a look of alarm, almost panic. He moves
back from Ben, watching him like a deadly cobra. Ben,
however, now convinced that he has the right man in
front of him, moves in on him to finish his proposition.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Now that isn't all.   If money will do

          something about money?

Workmen are pausing in their work to look at the pair,
wondering at the mention of money.

</b>          You told him to call the police.   Now

He reaches out quickly, grabs Chappell jr. by the label.
The man gives an involuntary cry of fear.

Ben lets go of Chappell Jr., and turns in confusion.


<b>INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The workmen drop their tools, and move in on Ben quickly
and threateningly. Even Chappell Sr. comes out of the
office in alarm. Ben backs away toward the door.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Now just a minute. Take it easy. I
          obviously got the wrong place. Now
          stay away from me.

But they don't. They come on. Ben looks quickly around
for a weapon, or an exit. He sees the door, and moves
quickly toward it, but the workmen are faster than he
is. Two of them bar the exit. Ben tries to shove
them out of the way and get through the door. The men
grapple with him. Chappell Jr., himself, and another
workman rush in, endeavoring to subdue Ben. A silent,
but furious struggle ensues. It is now a complete
melee between the four men and Ben as they try to hold
him down.

<b>                      CHAPPELL JR.
</b>          Hold him...hold him...till the police
          come.

Ben breaks loose temporarily, trying to find another
escape. He realizes that the time for talking is past.
But as fast as he is, the men are on him again. They
twist and struggle through the stuffed and mounted
animals. There is a melange of lion heads, swordfish,
and other partially completed jobs. Sometimes, Ben in
his struggles comes face to face with the angry head
of a bared-teeth lion. Ambrose Chappell Jr. himself
at one point finds the swordfish a very painful object
somewhere about his anatomy. Ben eventually wrenches
himself free.

The five persons in the McKenna suits are sitting
around. All but Jo have drinks in their hands. She
seems to be absorbed in her own thoughts, but Val
Parnell is holding forth, oblivious at first to her
disinterest.

          Flanagan comes in dressed up as the
          Countess was unconvincing ... that no

          was, even if he were dressed by

He stops talking, as he looks across at the silent Jo.
Helen and the others, follow his look. They watch her
sympathetically. Jo  seems totally unaware that anyone
else is in the room, staring, into thin air, absorbed
with thoughts of her own.

Val paces thoughtfully, and they watch him.

</b>          It must be a now American gag.    I'll
          ask Danny about it.

At that moment the door suddenly opens. Everyone turns

slowly into the room, closing the door. He is very
tired looking, and disheveled. They watch him enter
silently.

Inside of a small, almost bare room, Mrs. Drayton closes

young Hank McKenna. He is playing checkers with the

autograph hunters, watching Jo McKenna. The one with

caught the woman in a checker trap, and with obvious

on a surplice -- and then the man who knocked on the
McKennas' door in the Mamounia Hotel, looking for
someone named Montgomery. He is putting on a tie and
tuxedo. He wears a dangerous-looking revolver strapped
underneath his armpit; Mrs. Drayton, without a word,
sits down and lights a cigarette, exhaling with
something close to fatigue. Then she speaks.

He goes to a portable record player, which is open and
has a record on it. He looks down at the phonograph.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Now for the most important part.

He gestured towards the record.

<b>                        RIEN
</b>          What is it?

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          A record of the delightful Picco they
          will play tonight.

<b>                      RIEN
</b>          What about it?

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Music is less in your line than
          marksmanship. If you will listen, my
          friend, I will play for you the exact
          moment at which you can shoot. Now
          listen carefully.

Drayton plays the record.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Let me do it for you again.   Now listen
          for the cymbal crash.

Drayton plays the record again and claps his hands
together at the cymbal crash.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          You see at such a moment your shot
          will not be heard. The listeners will
          not even be disturbed. I think the
          composer would have appreciated that.
          No one will know.

<b>                      RIEN
</b>          None except one you mean.

The assassin smiles.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Ah, yes -- if you are clever, my friend.
          Any questions musical or otherwise?

<b>                        RIEN
</b>          No.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          There's's one comforting thought. It
          happens early in the evening. I hope
          I won't upset you if I say there's
          time for one shot only. If you need
          another, the risk is yours.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          That's a comfort -- traipsing all the
          way down to Marrakesh to fetch you I
          should like you to do me credit.

He looks at his watch.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Your distinguished target's on the way
          there now. A car is waiting for you
          downstairs at the back entrance. You
          will pick up a Miss Benson on your
          way. She will be your companion in
          the box. She's there to lend an air
          of respectability...if that's possible.

<b>                      RIEN
</b>          You will have the money when I return?

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          I think you can trust me.

<b>                      RIEN
</b>              (Looking him up and
               down)
          What is your English proverb -- a wolf
          in Sheep's clothing?

Drayton laughs.

<b>                         DRAYTON
</b>          I think you    had better be going. It
          is impolite    to be late for a concert.
          It would be    awkward if they made you
          wait until    the first selection is over.

He turns to his wife.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          See him downstairs, my dear.
              (To Rien)
          I'm sorry you must sneak out the back
          way, but we have to preserve our

She exits with the assassin.    Drayton turns to the
mirror and surveys himself.

His fatigue of before seems to have vanished in his
eagerness to meet Jo and find out what she knows.

Ben comes up to her.   She grips his hands.

The Chapel as seen from their viewpoint. People are
now entering it, but it seem as if the tag end of the
congregation is entering, because the service is
obviously under way, the sound of hymn singing coming
across faintly to us.

Ben takes her hand, squeezes it affectionately.
Together they cross the street, the CAMERA PANNING
them up the steps of the chapel and to the entrance.

They enter the Chapel from the rear, looking around
cautiously. A hymn is in progress. The Chapel holds
about three hundred people. It is of the non-conformist
type and the congregation consists mostly of middle-
aged and elderly women. Although the McKennas are not
aware of it, we notice that the organist is none other
than Edna, the woman who observed Jo at the airport,
and later took care of Hank.

Carefully the McKennas find their way to a back row
seat. One or two of the women in the back row turn to
look at the new arrivals. Jo wants to whisper something
to Ben, but with a gesture he silences her. Ben picks
up hymnal, hands her one, finds the right page and
begins to sing along with the hymn. But instead of
following the words of the hymn, Ben makes up his own
words to communicate with Jo, as he looks around at
the chapel.

<b>                      BEN
</b>              (singing)
          This looks like mother wild goose chase.

<b>                      JO
</b>              (Singing them)
          Let's wait and look around...

Some of the parishioners turn and listen to Jo's voice
because it has a professional quality that rises above
the rest. Whether they are watching her in suspicion,
or admiration, is hard to tell. Jo turns her attention
to the hymn book, trying to be unnoticed. Ben's eyes
catch something coming down the aisle.

<b>                      BEN
</b>              (Singing)
          Look who's coming down the aisle.

Jo follows his glance, leaning forward a little and to
one side.


<b>INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
Coming up the aisle with a collection basket, collecting
money during the hymn is Mrs. Drayton. She is
approaching the row in which the McKennas are standing.


<b>INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Jo looks towards Ben helplessly. Mrs. Drayton is
between the two of them and any possible exit. Ben
immediately eases his way along behind a column which
hides him somewhat from the front, but not from the
side. Jo endeavors to shrink her body behind a tall
woman in front of her, but she is not entirely
successful. We can see Mrs. Drayton getting closer to
them.

Jo looks toward Ben almost panicked. Suddenly Mrs.
Drayton has reached the end of their row. She pushes
forward her collection plate, and as she does so her
face blanches. She instantly identifies the two.
Ben, with little else to do, looks her straight in the
eye and puts some coins into her plate.

As the astonished Mrs. Drayton turns to go back down
the aisle with her plate of coins and bills, we now
see the surpliced Mr. Drayton ascending the pulpit.
He looks down to his wife.

From Mr. Drayton's viewpoint, as he notices his wife
coming up the aisle with a startled expression on her
face. She tries to  nod with her head to indicate
something important lies behind her.


<b>INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Mr. Drayton, trying to puzzle out her alarm, studies
her face, and then lifts his eyes to look beyond her.
The expression on his face leaves no doubt that he
cannot understand what she's trying to convey. The
hymn has come an end, and the congregation starts
seating itself.


<b>INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The McKennas take a seat along with the rest, and as
yet they are relatively inconspicuous from the front
of the chapel. Ben takes a piece of paper out of his
pocket, examines it, and satisfied it is the right
one, hands it to his wife. The congregation falls
silent as Drayton is apparently about to begin his
sermon.


<b>INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Drayton glances down to his Bible, opens it a certain
page, and as he does so, he looks at his wife who is
sitting near the organ. She half-turns to look up at
him. She seems frightened. Drayton fumbles with the
pages of the Bible, apparently trying to make something
out of his wife's attitude. Failing, he looks up and
begins his sermon. He speaks into a microphone.

<b>                       DRAYTON
</b>          Brothers and Sisters: The subject of
          my address this evening is adversity.
          The average life, yours and mine, is
          often harassed and perplexed by
          cruelties and disappointments beyond
          our control.

Strangely enough, it is often the things beyond our
control which help to make us better beings.

Pain and tribulation are the testing ground of   life
and let us be grateful for them. Let us bless    the
disappointments and the frustrations and say a   prayer
for the agony of the moment. Only thus shall    we confirm
and re-confirm our own goodness and therefore   the
essential goodness of all Mankind.

Half-glancing at Drayton as he delivers his sermon.
Ben talks to Jo. Their conversation is whispered.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          That's Buchanan's phone number. Go on
          out and call him and ask him to surround
          the place with police.

<b>                      JO
</b>          What if he asks me...

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Tell him...tell him everything. This
          is the time. I'm sure Hank is around
          here some place.

<b>                      JO
</b>          Ben, I don't want to leave you.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          I don't know how else to do it, honey.

Ben gives her a gentle push. With a regretful look at
him, she slides out of the seat.

In the middle of his sermon, Drayton looks up. He
almost falters and stops, as he sees Jo rise from her

Drayton composes his face, but his eyes are serious.
Without the slightest pause, he continues his sermon,
shifting his ideas in mid-paragraph.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Few of us pause to think how life's
          adversities work in our behalf, to

<b>                      DRAYTON (CONT'D)
</b>          But I believe we should pause now to
          do a little stock-taking -- to look
          into our own hearts and see what we
          find there. Therefore instead of
          continuing the service, I think we
          should all return to our homes for
          private meditation, remembering how
          little we have to complain of and how
          much to be grateful for. Next week I
          shall discuss the fruits of our
          meditation. Until then, my blessing
          upon each and every one of you.

Ben watches Drayton, with little charity in his heart.
There is a stir in the congregation when Drayton tells
them to go home. They look at each other, uncertainly.


<b>INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
</b>
Drayton closes the Bible, and begins to descend from
the pulpit. The congregation comes to life. The
members rise from their seats and begin filing out of
the chapel. Occasionally they cast backward glances
toward the pulpit, as if surprised at what they have
heard.


<b>INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
When Drayton reaches the two steps of the altar, he
beckons the organist to him. She comes, and he whispers
something to her. He then motions his wife nearer to
him, and also whispers something to her. Mrs. Drayton
goes off through a side door by the altar, while the
organist makes her way down the aisle through the
congregation to stand by the door.

The CAMERA PANS Ben as he threads his way up through
the women who are filing out. Drayton stands at the
front of the chapel, waiting. Finally, after a slow
and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel,
Ben comes face to face with Drayton. Drayton greets
him with bland amiability.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Well this is a pleasant surprise,
          Doctor.

<b>                      BEN

          you've just come in time to help my
          wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank
          doesn't care much for English cooking.

Drayton's eyes stray to the back of the church as he
talks. Ben, noticing Drayton's eye movement, follows
it cautiously. But before he can confirm his
suspicions, there is a loud clang of a door closing
that gives him his answer. He looks around quickly.


<b>INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

At the other end of the chapel, the woman, Edna, has
just closed the door, and is in the process of locking
the heavy iron lock with a large key. She extracts
the key and puts it into her pocket.

Ben turns back to Drayton to find that his manner has
changed somewhat. He grabs him quickly by the throat
of his robes.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          What do you want? I'll give you money
          and keep my mouth shut. All I want is
          my boy.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          And what about your wife? Did she go
          outside just to get some fresh air.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Tell me what you want.   I'll do
          anything.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          All right -- you'll see your boy in
          good time.

With a sudden twist, he wrenches himself away from
Ben. He reaches for a button on the altar, presses
it. Instantly the door by the side of the altar opens
and two rather strong men appear. Ben turns alertly
to face them, backing of a little.


<b>INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

One of the men is obviously the chauffeur type, and
the other one, a handyman type in his shirtsleeves.
Ben takes this in, and notices the open door behind
them. Ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit, and
suddenly dashes for the steps.

He surprises them with his speed, and before anyone
can stop him, he is in the pulpit. He grabs the
microphone previously used by Drayton in his sermon.
He yells into it.

As the sound roars through he chapel the two man dash
for the pulpit, and at that mount we hear, faintly
off, the voice of Hank:

<b>                       HANK
</b>          Daddy!   Daddy, I'm here!   Dad -

His voice is choked off. Ben jumps down from the pulpit
in an effort to make for the open door, but the two
men throw themselves on top of him.

pulls up at the Service entrance. A man sitting beside
the chauffeur gets out of the car. Inside the car are
the Draytons and Hark McKenna. We see the man hurry
to the door of the kitchen and enter.

There is a big staff of kitchen help, chefs, maids of

big party. The man who has entered, calls to them to
get their attention.

There is a moment of bewilderment and confusion. The
man crosses to someone obviously a butler, and whispers
some words to him. The butler turns to the workers
and starts herding them toward the corridor through a
door in the far corner of the kitchen.

away down the street.

piece we see the activities of the arrivals at a big

road odd taxis are pulling in. We see the usual line
of posters which run along the edge of the sidewalk.

The screen is filled with a large poster. It announces
for that evening the commemorative concert. Further
details on the poster indicate that a Cantata will be
sung featuring the London Symphony Orchestra, The Royal
Choral Society, and a name woman as featured mezzo
soprano, and Conductor Bernard Herrmann. Between the
CAMERA and the Poster a taxi pulls up. It is near
enough to the CAMERA so that just the driver and the
door fills the screen, Jo McKenna steps out the far
side and pays off the driver with a Ten Shilling Note.
She hurries away. The driver endeavors to call after
her as he turns the note around in his hand. He looks
at it with satisfaction, and stuffs it into the inner
recesses of his clothes.

Jo turns slowly and looks up at the dignitary's box.
He is turning to the man beside him, whom we shall
later know as the Ambassador, and indicates with
gestures how much he is enjoying the concert. He looks
back over his shoulder and gives the same gestures and
comments to 'Buchanan'. Then, turning forward, he
settles back comfortably in his seat to enjoy the music.


<b>INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - LONG SHOT

Through the doors we see a taxi pulling away and
presently a glass door opens and a dishevelled Ben
comes into the lobby. He comes up to the CAMERA and
looks about him.

From his viewpoint the lobby appears empty except
perhaps for a solitary uniformed policeman.

The CAMERA PANS Ben as he hurries forward. He touches
Jo lightly on the shoulder. She turns, startled, and
manages to suppress an exclamation on seeing him. We
do not hear what they are saying but by their pantomime
we see that Jo is telling Ben all about the impending
shooting. Ben argues with her. He indicates he will
tell Buchanan. She frantically restrains him but he
shakes her off and dashes away.

We see Ben ascending the stairs originally taken by
the dignitary and his group.

Ben comes into the corridor and looks about him. Beyond
him we see a group of men obviously detectives, and
ahead of them a police constable. We see Ben hurry in
his direction.


<b>INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
</b>
Ben comes up to the constable and is about to pass him
when he is stopped. We again do not hear the dialogue,
but the pantomime shows that Ben is trying to get to
Buchanan. The constable doesn't quite know what to
make of Ben's dramatic plea. He indicates that he
must talk to his superior. Ben waits impatiently as
the constable goes over to one of the Inspectors who
is standing in a small group a little way off. From
his viewpoint we see the constable addressing the
Inspector with skeptical nods of his head in Ben's
direction.

A few of the people around the lobby begin to look at
Jo and Ben. We see the Assistant Manager hurry over
to them. They are in a group of three, and although
we do not actually hear what he says, due to the hubbub,
he is obviously questioning Ben and being solicitous
to Jo.


<b>INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP
</b>
We go close just in time to catch the tail-end of the
conversation. Ben is just saying:

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Then he didn't kill him?

<b>                      ASSISTANT MANAGER
</b>          Your wife saved him -- it is only a
          small flesh wound...Oh here he is
          now...you must come and meet him...don't
          be nervous...I'll get the aide to
          present you...it will be all right
              (To Woburn)
          Would you present the lady to the prime
          minister?

Suddenly their attention is drawn to something off-
screen up the stairs. The hubbub increases.


<b>INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
</b>
From their viewpoint we see the Prime Minister,
obviously not wounded sufficiently to incapacitate,
being escorted down the stairs by his Aide and other
members of the staff, including Woburn of the Special
Branch. The Prime Minister is indicating his arm and
obviously by the way he waves his hands, is deprecating
their concern about his wound. In fact he is rather
over-doing it. Just beyond them at the top of the
stairs we see 'Buchanan' standing with the Ambassador.


<b>INT. LOBBY STAIRS - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

'Buchanan' is reassuring the Ambassador.

<b>                      BUCHANAN

          Your Excellency. In the meantime...

of the Prime Minister's Aides.  The latter's face lights
up. He leans over and whispers  something to the Prime
Minister. The Prime Minister is  all smiles.


<b>INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Woburn steps down and introduces Ben and Jo to the
Prime Minister's Aide.

<b>                      WOBURN
</b>          Mr. Prime Minister, this is the lady
          who --

The Prime Minister interrupts enthusiastically.

<b>                      PRIME MINISTER
</b>          My dear lady, I shall be for ever in
          your debt.

<b>                      WOBURN
</b>          And this is her husband --

The Prime Minister interrupts again, less
enthusiastically.

<b>                      PRIME MINISTER
</b>          A pleasure, my dear sir...
              (He turns to Jo)
          I trust you will permit me to wait
          upon you tomorrow and to express the
          depth of my gratitude.

<b>                       JO

</b>              (Gallantly)
          Oh but it was, my dear lady.

There is an awkward pause.  The Prime Minister collects
himself and turns to move on out of the hall, the police
making a passageway for him through the crowd. We see
the Ambassador hurrying into the picture and moving
across the screen quickly to follow the Prime Minister.

          We can talk if you'll come in here.

The CAMERA PANS the three across the top landing and
to the doors of the 'Green Room' There are various
police standing about and some of Special Branch men
can be seen inside the room. 'Buchanan' steps aside
too allow Jo to enter. Then he and Ben follow her in.

small tables. Jo sits down wearily into the nearest
chair. Ben remains standing, Buchanan takes a seat in
a chair near a telephone, he looks up at Ben as if he

look.

The door opens and another member of the Special Branch
enters.

Buchanan nods to him to speak.

<b>                      DETECTIVE

          bought a ticket that happened to place

          did the shooting. Doesn't know anything --
          but if she does, she's not talking.

<b>                      AMBASSADOR

          as my guest of honor -- when I hope
          and expected that he would be totally

          No. But I do. You've muddled
          everything from the start. Kidnapping
          that child in Marrakesh...Don't you
          realize that Americans dislike having
          their children kidnapped?

          would hold his tongue?

<b>                      AMBASSADOR
</b>              (Ignoring this)
          And then, to crown it all, you get
          cold feet and come running along here

<b>                      AMBASSADOR

          How are you going to get the child out

          I'll think of some method.   Just give

</b>              (He snorts
                Contemptuously)
          Time!

The Ambassador paces a moment, suppressing his rage,
and then he stops and looks at Drayton as if thinking
about something.

<b>                      AMBASSADOR
</b>          I want the child removed from this
          Embassy, and removed in such a way
          that he won't be able to say any more
          where he has been tonight.

<b>                      MRS. DRAYTON
</b>          Oh, no!

The Ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a
manner that she almost shrinks. She tries to say
something, but no words come out of her half-open mouth.
Drayton, however, answers the Ambassador with horrible
servility.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Right, I'll see to it..

Lucy Drayton looks at her husband with loathing. There
is a polite tap on the door. The Ambassador looks up.

<b>                      BUTLER
</b>          Your Excellency, the Princess should
          be arriving at any moment.

The Ambassador braces himself, his       chest swells out a
little, h assumes a set smile and       strides from the
room. Just at this moment we hear        a String Orchestra
in the distance strike up some gay       waltz music. The
Ambassador goes out of the door.        Mrs. Drayton is
looking down at the floor.


<b>INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Ben is talking.    Buchanan is listening carefully.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          ...recognized him, and he recognized
          me. So he jumped for it. And that is

<b>                       BUCHANAN
</b>              (Slowly)
          Trying to liquidate one of their own
          big-shots. I wish they'd stick to
          their usual custom, and do it in their
          own country...

At this moment the phone rings. Woburn, who is now re-
placing the two Special Branch men in the room, picks
up the telephone.

<b>                       WOBURN
</b>          Hello.

He turns the telephone over to Buchanan.

          Buchanan speaking.

Buchanan listens for a while, his face changing as he
listens with increased interest.

<b>                           BUCHANAN
</b>          Right.    Bye.

Buchanan hangs up, turns to Woburn, but half speaks in
the direction of the McKenna's.

Ben almost shouts as he gets up from his chair.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          If the Draytons are at the Embassy,
          Hank has to be there too!

Buchanan turns his attention back to Ben.

<b>                       BUCHANAN
</b>              (Grimly)
          You're probably right.   But we can do
          nothing.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Why can't you?

<b>                      BUCHANAN
</b>          Every Embassy in a foreign country has
          extra-territorial rights.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          What does that mean in common language?

<b>                      BUCHANAN
</b>          As far as we're concerned, this Embassy
          stands on foreign soil.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Does that mean they can steal children
          and get away with it?

<b>                      BUCHANAN
</b>          We could have the Foreign Office serve
          a writ on the Ambassador.

He breaks off and speaks apologetically as If it were

</b>          ...You know, I'm not responsible for

He resumes:

As they are talking Ben is thinking hard, obviously
hatching some scheme in his mind.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          What's the telephone number of this
          Embassy.

Both of the men looking at Ben a moment without
answering and then Woburn speaks first.

<b>                      WONBURN
</b>          Grosvenor 0144.

<b>                      JO
</b>          What are you thinking about, Ben?

Without answering Jo, Ben picks up the 'phone.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Grosvenor 0144.

Ben looks at the group briefly.   Buchanan looks at Ben
with keen curiosity.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          I'm going to speak to the Minister
          himself.

Buchanan looks intrigued and surprised. We hear the
answering click on the other end of the phone.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          May I speak to the Prime Minister,
          please?

There is a pause and the distorted sound of a voice
mumbling on the other end of the phone. Ben interrupts
the question.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Tell him the lady who saved his life
          wants to speak to him. Its important.

The voice on the other end of the phone mumbles briefly,
and there is silent. Ben has a satisfied look on his
face, as he hands the receiver to Jo. She seems
frightened.

<b>                      JO
</b>          What am I supposed to say, Ben? I
          don't know --

          Ben, half looking at Woburn and
          Buchanan, gives her instructions.

<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

In the Ambassador's study underneath the oil painting
of himself, the Prime Minister is escorted to a
telephone by the butler who hands him the instrument.
Having been told who was on the other and of the line
he is all smiles as he greets Jo.

<b>                      PRIME MINISTER
</b>          My dear lady...This is a charming
          surprise...

He listens to the other end of the phone, agreeably
making sounds such as "ah ha" "ah" "hum", then he
speaks, with a gracious sweep of his hand and a half
bow to the telephone.

<b>                      PRIME MINISTER
</b>          Delighted, delighted, delighted. The
          Ambassador, too, will be delighted.

Ben presses the doorbell. His grip on Jo's's arm slides
down to her hand. He holds it tightly.

The door opens, and a liveried man ushers them in with
gesture.


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
They enter a large hallway. The liveried man closes
the door. Standing in a nearby doorway is a group of
people listening to the music of a string quartet
playing in the room beyond. Included in the group is
the Personal Aide of the Prime Minister. He sees Jo
and Ben enter, hurries over to them, smiling and eager.
The piece that the string quartet is playing ends amid
a round of polite applause. There are people rising
from their chairs and a general movement out into the
hallway.

<b>                     AIDE
</b>          Good even. Would you come this way,
          please? The Prime Minister is waiting
          for you.

Following the Aide, Ben and Jo squeeze through the
crowded doorway.


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The Aide leads Ben and Jo through the main room, the
CAMERA DOLLIES them. As they move through the room
people begin to notice them, first of all because they
are not dressed for the occasion -- but then the looks
seem to be admiring ones, and there is a smattering of
applause at their passage. Apparently people recognize
them. The Aide takes them to the Prime Minister, who
is just getting up from his seat of honor in the first
row.

The Prime Minister recognizes them immediately, and
comes forward quickly to meet them.

          Good evening, good evening!

They move off to seats -- Jo is led to piano by
Ambassador. Aide crosses to Ben.

around the room, particularly toward the various exits.

Having strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays
the introduction to her song. We see the great
tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional
smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but
always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice
seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole
room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place
that she has become so professional in such an intimate
drawing room setting.

In a room on the other side of the door, Hank McKenna
is listening to the music. Hank seems a little puzzled.
Then, his face lights up and he jumps suddenly to his
feet. He runs towards the door and begins trying to
open it.

She kneels down quickly to him.

<b>                      MRS DRAYTON
</b>          Then go on -- whistle it.   Whistle it
          as loud as you can.

On Hank's face comes a little understanding. He can
barely believe what she means. Then he understands.
He turns, and deliberately facing the door, starts to
whistle the song. He whistles loud and vigorously.
Mrs. Drayton stands up and moves back to a chair, as
she watches him.

Down in the ballroom, Jo is looking up anxiously as
she sings. She deliberately breaks and pauses for a
moment and softens her accompaniment. Then she hears
it -- a faint whistle coming from above, not enough
for those around to appreciate it, but loud enough for
the straining ears of Jo. She looks across the ballroom
to find Ben, and her eyes go up.

Ban stands in the doorway. He instantly rushes toward
Hank, the CAMERA PANNING him. Hank leaps to his feet,
and the two of them come together. No clear words are
spoken, Just muffled sounds of words as they hug each
other. Then they release each other, and turn to look
at Mrs. Drayton. She is standing, staring at the door
with horror. Ben turns quickly to look.

Framed in the doorway is Drayton. Deftly he reaches
into his pocket and produces a small automatic.


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
For a moment the group stands there in silence.    Then
Ben speaks.

<b>                      BEN
</b>          I don't think you want to start any
          shooting, Drayton -- with all those
          people downstairs, and police outside.

Drayton looks at him without saying anything, but the
gun doesn't lower.

Mrs. Drayton addresses her husband fiercely.

<b>                      MRS. DRAYTON
</b>          You've got to let the boy go!

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          Precisely my own notion, my dear.

He moves forward on   the group, gun poised. Hank
clutches his father   in fright, and Ben tenses himself,
prepared for battle   if necessary. Mrs. Drayton stares
at her husband with   some defiance. Drayton addresses
Ben amiably.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          I'm sure you'll ba sensible, and help
          me out of here?

<b>                      BEN
</b>          Don't ask me for help, you miserable....


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Drayton seems unperturbed by Ben's refusal. He leans
down closer to the boy, and addresses him directly.

<b>                      DRAYTON
</b>          You wouldn't want your father to get
          hurt, would you?

Hank looks up towards his father.    Drayton looks up.


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Drayton's intentions are unmistakable. Ben looks down
at him with a hatred that is almost ready to explode,
but he has sense enough to understand Drayton's meaning.
Drayton straightens up, a slight smile on his face.
He slips the gun into his pocket, but still holds it.

<b>                       DRAYTON
</b>          We'll go down the stairs   together in a
          casual sort of way. Then    we'll stroll
          along to the nearest taxi   rank. I
          trust there won't be any   emotional
          outbursts...

<b>                       BEN
</b>              (Interrupting)
          There won't be. Hank -- don't say or
          do anything.

Hank just nods.   He's too frightened to talk.

<b>                         DRAYTON
</b>          Shall we go?

Ben starts for the door with Hank, and Drayton moves
into the other side of Hank. As they go through the
door, Mrs. Drayton makes an instinctive step forward,
if to attack Drayton from the rear, but the sight of
Hank in danger stops her.

<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
The trio, Hank in the center, slowly strolls down the
corridor toward the main stairway. The sound of Jo
Conway's voice can be heard from below.


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
SHOOTING FROM BELOW we see the big staircase empty for
a moment, then the three appear at the top.


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
A closer view shows the terrified, tear-stained face
of Hank, and the tense features of Ben. Drayton seems
carefully alert. The CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD in front
of them as they descend. The music coming from the
ballroom ceases, as Jo finishes her second song. There
is the sound of great applause. The three are about a
dozen steps from the bottom, when suddenly Ben shoots
out a hard and pushes Drayton forward. Taken by
surprise, he stumbles, and falls down the stairs
clumsily. Clutching for support with his hands, the
gun goes off in his pocket, and he remains in a crumpled
heap at the bottom of the stairs.


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
The applause having died out, the shot is heard loud,
and people pour out of the ballroom into the hallway.
They rush for the stairway, and Drayton's body, led by
the Ambassador and the Prime Minister.


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
As people crowd excitedly around the body, Ben is
hurrying Hank away from the scene, the CAMERA PANS
them.


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
Mrs. Drayton stops half-way down the stairway, and
looks down in shook at the sight of her dead husband.


<b>INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Inside the ballroom, which is emptying due to the rush
of people to the corridor, Jo has risen from the piano
and is almost afraid to go out and see what has
happened. In a moment, Ben and the boy appear in  the
doorway. Hank rushes across the ballroom to his  mother,
who moves quickly when she sees him.

<b>                         JO
</b>           Hank.

They embrace.

<b>INT. CLARIDGE'S SUITE - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
Inside the McKenna's hotel room, the Parnells and the
two woman guests are sprawled out in ungainly attitudes
of sleep. Val is snoring pleasantly. The door of the
room opens and the three McKennas appear. The sound
awakes Val. He peers at them sleepily and struggles
to a sitting position. Ben closes the door.

<b>                       BEN
</b>           I'm sorry we were gone so long, Val,
           but we had to go and pick up Hank.

Ben's voice awakens the other women. They sit up, and
stare with bewilderment at the smiling trio of Ben, Jo
and Hank.
