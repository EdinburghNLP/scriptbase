<b>                               BAD DREAMS
</b>


                               Written by

                   Andrew Fleming &amp; Steven E. de Souza





<b>    FADE IN:
</b>

<b>1   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET                                         1
</b>    A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun
    dips behind the mountains.

    In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the
    sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and
    very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an
    invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of
    transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve
    settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA
    ADJUSTS and reveals--


<b>2   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - LONG SHOT - SUNSET                             2
</b>    Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur
    repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But
    now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long
    shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly
    from within; it's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly. If
    the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW
    MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with
    flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign.

    As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE
    rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to
    enclose them all, he goes inside.


<b>3   INT. COMMON ROOM - SUNSET                                         3
</b>    This was probably a stately parlor in its day. There is a
    funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. There are muslin
    curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering
    ripped chairs and couches. Despite the squalor, there is a
    neatness to the place. Now, the CAMERA begins to ROAM
    through the room and down the hallways lined with fading
    wallpaper.

<b>                        VOICES
</b>                  (various)
              --where did she go...? ... was
              here a moment ago... Cynthia, come
              on, honey, we need you... Cynthia,
              come out, come out wherever you
              are... the sun's going down, we're
              losing the moment...!
<b>                        (MORE)
</b>
<b>                                                        (CONTINUED)
</b><b>                                                                2.
</b><b>    CONTINUED:             VOICES(CONT'D)
</b>                 Hey, mellow out, we got ten
                 minutes, I like, checked the
                 almanac, okay...? Ready or not,
                 here we come...

    All these comments are made in relaxed and good natured
    tones. Finally the CAMERA PANS OVER to a little storage
    alcove beneath the servant's stairway. A HAND reaches in and
    opens the door, and inside we SEE cartons, antique toys...
    and then CYNTHIA, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky
    clothing and a haunted, nervous expression.

<b>                            VOICES (CONT'D)
</b>                 ...There you are, you naughty girl!
                 You almost made us lose the
                 sunset... Come on, honey, time's
                 wasting...

    She shrinks back from the HANDS that are pulling her up and
    out, but they prevail, and she's up and on unsteady feet.
    The CAMERA stays with her as she's led back down the hallway.

<b>                           CYNTHIA
</b>                     (faintly)
                 No, please... I... I really don't
                 want to do this... Can't I just
                 wait for you..? I--I'm not sure
                 about this--

    A SET OF HANDS moves in, separates Cynthia from the others.

<b>4   NEW ANGLE                                                        4
</b>    Revealing VICTOR, a handsome youth a few years older than
    Cynthia.

<b>                           VICTOR
</b>                 Easy, Cyn, easy. You don't want to
                 do this, that's okay... right,
                 Harris?

    The VOICES stop as everyone awaits an answer. CAMERA PANS
    across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet.

    In the center of the room is a big cistern or font. As we
    watch, Harris has just DUNKED someone in it. The person
    steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. Standing
    around are other people, some already dripping wet, others
    awaiting their turns. Some are clothed and wet, others in
    varying degrees of undress. It all seems slightly off,
    slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. Harris
    splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes
    his hair back.


<b>                                                       (CONTINUED)
</b><b>                                                              3.
</b><b>    CONTINUED: (2)
</b>
<b>                            HARRIS
</b>                 No, Victor, it's not okay. Here
                 at Unity House, some things have to
                 be done...
                     (slight smile)
                 ...in Unity. This is one of them.

    He WADES CLOSER to the CAMERA, within reach of Cynthia,
    Victor and the others. Smiles again. It's the kind of a
    smile that inspires trust.

<b>                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>                 Cynthia, do you trust me?

    She nods immediately.

<b>                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>                 And have I ever lied to you?

    She shakes her head. He GESTURES. The people around Cynthia
    begin to GET INTO the tub. Some remove their clothing;
    others get in clothes and all. Toddlers and infants are held
    by their parents and playfully splashed.

<b>                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>                 Then I say to you now... to all of
                 you now... that this will be the
                 Ultimate Joining... of man and
                 woman... parent and child...
                 humanity and Godhead.

    He looks at Victor, who reluctantly lets Cynthia's hand go,
    gets in. Now only Cynthia remains.

<b>                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>                 Cynthia. Come. There is no shame
                 in this. No crime. No sin. Just
                 the final break with the old
                 world... As night falls, we start
                 a new day... a day of Unity.
                     (a command, but warm)
                 Come to me... my lovechild.

<b>5   ON CYNTHIA                                                     5
</b>    His last words melt her remaining resistance. Moving like a
    sleepwalker, she steps into the tub, wades forward. Then she
    stops, looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans... runs
    her hand through it. Her eyes widen.
<b>                                                               4.
</b>



<b>6   EXT. HOUSE - LONG SHOT                                             6
</b>    The sun almost gone now, red light reflecting on the gabled
    windows. Even the battered VW van looks good in this
    setting. It's beautiful.

<b>                            CYNTHIA'S VOICE
</b>              No!   No...

<b>                         HARRIS' VOICE
</b>              Cynthia, come back! We can't do it
              without you... We must have unity,
              my lovechild... Unity, now and
              through eternity... Cynthia, you
              cannot run... You belong to us
              forever--!

    Pause. The faint SOUNDS of SPLASHING and then FOOTSTEPS
    skittering on tired wooden floors... and then--

<b>    --UNITY HOUSE EXPLODES!
</b>
<b>7   EXPLOSION - ANOTHER ANGLE                                          7
</b>    WINDOWS blow out. Splintered BEAMS propeller through the
    air. The VW camper on the lawn ROCKS with the shock wave.
    Then a SECOND EXPLOSION blows the Victorian cupolas and
    widow's walk off the roof. From somewhere in the distance we
<b>    HEAR SIRENS...
</b>
<b>                                               CUT TO:

</b>    FIRE is CONSUMING what's left of the building. Rescue
    workers and firefighters are running back and forth.

<b>9   INSPECTOR WASSERMAN                                                9
</b>    A plainclothes detective, he NODS to some uniforms, steps
    around some debris to move closer to the scene. He puts his
    collar up against the SPRAY which leaks from firehose
    connections. Seeing one of his men, he SHOUTS over the din.

<b>                        WASSERMAN
</b>              What have we got?

<b>                        POLICEMAN

     As he says this, both men watch as firefighters carry out a

</b>     It's set down on the ground beside other blackened bodies

Cynthia's eyes crinkle with confusion. And then, ah, she
gets it! A joke, the first one in over a decade. She
SMILES, and it's a beautiful smile. Setting her jaw, she
makes a renewed effort and reaches the and of the platform.
The therapist and Berrisford both move quickly to catch her
and set her down in a wheelchair.

Berrisford begins wheeling Cynthia along. They leave the
therapy room, go down a corridor. (Note: Passage as per
location.) As they go by other patients and staff, there's a
general BUZZ as people whisper about Cynthia.

     Saying this, he turns as an elevator OPENS.      It's pretty
     crowded. He holds the door for her.

The doors CLOSE. Everyone huddles in the compact space
silently, politely. The elevator heaves into movement.     It
HUMS as it whisks down the shaft.

The overhead fluorescent light in the car is weak.    It
flickers off and on momentarily.

The light gets weaker. Finally it just goes out.     There is a
general SIGH of annoyance from the passengers.

The light FLICKERS on every few seconds giving off the effect
of a strobe light.

     It is Victor, the boy we remember from the opening scene.
     The years have been kind to him. He stands there, the dim

     looks like it came from the Age of Aquarius: beanbag
     furniture, paper "Tiffany" shades on hanging lights,
     blacklight posters, hanging macrame planters.

     Cynthia loves the room and everything in it. But she is
     particularly drawn to a canvas on an easel in the far corner.

               Then you need a new mirror.

     she smiles, flattered.    Suddenly a CAT jumps up on a crate.

</b>               That's Chairman Meow.

     Cynthia picks him up.    Victor takes out a bottle of tequila
     and two glasses.

                  lived. I really can't remember

     She stiffens.    His eyes are far away.

</b>                  A lot of people back then, they
                  hated Unity House. Hated Harris
                  and his dreams... dreams of
                  peace... of oneness. That hate
                  fed negative energy into the cosmic
                  vortex... Something bad was bound
                  to happen. That hate was so
                  strong... so envious of what we
                  had...

     He has SQUEEZED the shot glass in his hand so hard that it
     EXPLODES. Cynthia JUMPS, and that's when he notices it.

     She comes over, binds his hand with a dishcloth.     He holds
     onto her.

</b>                  I guess talking about the past can
                  be a little dangerous.

     He pours a shot into the remaining glass.

     There is a drop of blood in the glass.     She doesn't see it.

     He pulls her close. They KISS... she seems to malt in his
     grasp. The cat jumps down. Slowly they kiss and touch each
     other. They stop and stare into each other's eyes.

     He moves his hand over her shoulders, neck, through her hair.
     She is completely his.

</b>     Half a dozen candles illuminate the room.

     Cynthia and Victor are making love. Not violent, but slow,
     passionate, dreamlike. They are completely enjoying each
     other. The satisfaction seems spiritual. They stare into
     each other's eyes the entire time. They are lost.

     Gradually Victor's rhythm builds. As his momentum increases,
     as the ecstasy nears, Cynthia accelerates too. Heaving,
     gasping, they are approaching a beautiful climax.

     But just when it seems Victor is on the verge, the very
     threshold, he stops and JUMPS violently out of bed.

<b>                           VICTOR

<b>                           CYNTHIA

     Victor paces around the room, practically bouncing off the
     walls.

</b>               Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

</b>             Not wrong, Cynthia...right! The
             most right thing in the world!

He goes to his closet and pulls out a shoe box. He holds it
with a coy expression, like a kid hiding a frog. Cynthia's
annoyance with the break in mood fades in light of his
exuberance. Their tone with each other remains loving,
kidding.

<b>                       CYNTHIA

</b>             I'm sorry, Cyn, but I just got the

          Guess that's why they say life

He opens the box.    Inside it are TWO PISTOLS.

          My God, Victor! Put those away--

He ignores her, checks the cylinder on the revolver, the clip
on the automatic.

<b>                    VICTOR
</b>          This is so great! I mean, I've

</b>          Yeah. We had the answers, way back
          then. Unity. Unity, now and

She shrinks away from him on the bed. He bounces closer like
a kid at a pajama party, holds out one of the pistols.

He spreads her legs under the sheets. She's struggling
against him, but it's no use. He's too strong. He's coming
closer.

     She checks in the kitchen. Nothing.       She looks back in the
     bedroom. The apartment is empty.

     She's just calming when--MEEOW! The CAT LEAPS out of
     nowhere, startling her, and then running out of sight.

     She swallows. Very nervous now, she sits on the couch and
     starts pulling on her jeans and shoes. The CAMERA MOVES
     AROUND her, revealing the entire apartment. We see EVERY
     ANGLE. It is completely quiet and still. The CAMERA SETTLES
     at one ANGLE on Cynthia. A shadow behind her MOVES.

      Miriam gives a very theatrical scream. There's some
      laughter, but others try, too. Gilda begins to give little
      angry yelps. Ralph is really punching some ancient enemy.

Miriam then gets into the elevator.         The doors remain open,
Alan turns to Cynthia.

He heads off in the opposite direction. Cynthia watches him.
She turns back towards Miriam. Miriam is alone in the
elevator except for one other person.

Miriam smiles and waves.

Cynthia smiles and waves.

From behind Miriam, Harris, all burned and puffy, smiles and
waves.

The elevator doors close.

     Branches thrash her face. She can barely see where she is
     going, but she comes to a halt when she reaches a dark
     precipice, a cliff which seemingly has no bottom--just black
     as night.

     The people are getting nearer.

     when she sees the orderly approaching. She picks herself up
     and runs.

     opens again against a purse--Miriam's purse. The elevator is
     empty. Cynthia whips around looking for her. Orderlies and
     nurses are moving towards her.

     At the opposite and of the hallway, a window is broken.
     Cynthia runs to it. There is a WOMAN'S SCREAM from the

Berrisford addresses a pack of about thirty REPORTERS and
PHOTOGRAPHERS and CAMERAMEN.

<b>                       FIRST REPORTER
</b>             Dr. Berrisford, what would you call
             two suicides on your promises so
             close together?

<b>                       BERRISFORD
</b>             I'd call it a tragic coincidence.
             Unfortunately, Borderline
             Personality Disorder is indicative
             of a pre-existing disposition
             towards suicidal tendencies.

<b>                       SECOND REPORTER
</b>             What about the commune girl? Has
             she confirmed that the fire was
             some sort of mass suicide?

<b>                       BERRISFORD
</b>             As that is a police matter, I am
             not at liberty to comment on it.

      Suddenly, he grabs one of the Guard's guns.       He dives against

       Berrisford bashes him in the head, neatly slicing off some

      lamps and chairs in her rage. She is crying hysterically.

<b>                          CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
</b>                It was WRONG! It was stupid!

<b>                          HARRIS
</b>                    (saddened)
                Oh, Cynthia.

<b>                          CYNTHIA
</b>                I never needed you!    Any of you!

      We are TIGHT ON CYNTHIA. She is winding down, crying with
      her face buried in her arms.

<b>                          CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
</b>                I never did...

      She is still.    Gradually, the silence fills with a quiet
<b>      BREEZE.
</b>
<b>                            ALAN
</b>                Cynthia?

      She drops the knife. The knife is all rusty and corroded.
      The floor is a charred mass.

      Cynthia turns around.

      Alan comes in the front door. The room is again its empty,
      skeletal self, blackened and silent.

      Cynthia is trembling.

      She walks out of the room.

<b>                          ALAN (CONT'D)
</b>                Are you all right?

<b>                            CYNTHIA
</b>                Let's go.


<b>217   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY                                            217
</b>      She stands on the porch, holding onto a post, trying to calm
      herself. Alan comes out. As he starts the car, a gust comes
      up. The trees are thrashed around.

      The WIND ECHOES through the house.

<b>      MUSIC UP SOFTLY, EERILY.
</b>
      Cynthia descends the stairs.    The station wagon pulls up.
      She gets inside.


<b>218   INT. STATION WAGON - DAY                                           218
</b>      They pull out. Slowly we see Cynthia collect herself.      A
      sense of hope is evident.

<b>                             CYNTHIA
</b>                   It's going to be okay.   I'm going
                   to be okay.


<b>219   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                    219
</b>      The car speeds off trailing dust.

      We see the UNITY HOUSE in the distance.     The winds kicks up
      again.


<b>220   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY                                             220
</b>      We are CLOSER. Branches and leaves are being tossed around
      by violent gusts as we MOVE TOWARD the structure.

      A teenage GIRL comes running up from the field behind.     She
      is crying. She runs into the house. We FOLLOW HER.


<b>221   INT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY                                             221
</b>      She goes to a far corner and cries some more, angrily,
      hopelessly.

<b>                             BOY
</b>                       (far off)
                   Come on, where are you? I hope
                   you're not in that house... You
                   always got like this and make
                   stupid threats that you don't mean!

      The girl peeks out the corner of the window.

<b>222   ANGLE -                                                            222
</b>      The TEENAGE BOY is in the field beyond.

</b>             If you're not here on three, I'm
             history. Permanently. One...
             Two... Three! Fine. Good
             riddance.

THE GIRL backs away from the window, only more upset now.

A hand touches her shoulder.      She whirls around.

<b>                       GIRL
</b>                 (startled)

<b>                         HARRIS
</b>             A friend.    You're upset.

She nods.

<b>                       HARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>             What would you say if I could
             promise you eternal bliss?

<b>                       GIRL
</b>             Eternal bliss? What do you mean?

TRACKING IN on the old knife an the floor. It begins to
transform from its rusty and corroded state into a new and
shiny knife.

<b>MUSIC UP.
</b>
A burned, skeletal hand reaches INTO FRAME and takes it.

<b>                                             CUT TO BLACK.
