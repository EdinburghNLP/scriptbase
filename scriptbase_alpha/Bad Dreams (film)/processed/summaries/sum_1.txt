It is the mid-70's.
A sinister cult called Unity Fields commits mass suicide in a horrific manner - by fire - at the behest of its psychopathic leader, Harris.
Only one young woman named Cynthia survives to tell the tale.
Now, 13 years later, Cynthia is having grim reminders of the mass-suicide, as people around her begin to die one at a time.
Cynthia finds out quickly that the ghost of Harris is back... to claim his 'love child'.
