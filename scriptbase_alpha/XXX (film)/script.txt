               FADE IN:

               EXT. PRAGUE - NIGHT

               On a hill above the city is an old CATHEDRAL. The night is 
               spooky, with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones 
               and medieval walls.

               A NERVOUS YOUNG HACKER makes his way down an alley.

               There is a DOOR at the end of the alley. MUSIC can be faintly 
               heard from inside.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               High above the street an INTRUDER DRESSED ALL IN BLACK spies 
               from the roof. He's watching with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.

               He pulls out a CROSSBOW and FIRES.

               A BOLT flies, trailing CABLE.

               THUNK! It sticks into the alley wall below.

               EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT

               As he passes by the ominous Cathedral, the Hacker spins, 
               sure he's heard something.

               But there's nothing there. He continues on.

               Then the Intruder comes sliding down the ZIP-LINE from above.

               WHAM! He kicks the Hacker into the wall, knocking him out.

               The Intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled 
               features of a dashing BRITISH SECRET AGENT. His name is 
               STERLING.

                                     STERLING
                         I hate to drop in unexpectedly.

               Sterling searches the Hacker and pulls a SMALL BLACK CASE 
               from his coat. Inside the case is a DATA CHIP. Sterling tucks 
               it away.

               Sterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp TUXEDO 
               underneath. He pulls out CAR KEYS. In a quick insert we see 
               the "ASTON-MARTIN" LOGO.

               As he strolls back out the alley, he HEARS something and 
               flattens against the wall.

               A BLACKED OUT SUV screeches to a stop, blocking his exit.

               The SUV's HEADLIGHTS illuminate the slumped Hacker.

               BAD GUYS get out to investigate, pulling out weapons.

               Cornered, Sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in 
               the shadows. He gets to that DOOR the Hacker was heading 
               towards.

               As he PICKS THE LOCK Sterling can hear MUSIC from inside. He 
               smooths his hair and prepares to "blend in" with the crowd.

               INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

               Sterling comes through the door and his face falls. He's 
               stepped into a loud METAL CONCERT.

               We see a GO-GO DANCER in LATEX. Onstage is RAMMSTEIN, a 
               bizarre German industrial-metal band.

               The tattooed YOUNG CROWD slam dances and swings glo-stix 
               over their heads. Some wear rubber BRAIN SKULLCAPS outfitted 
               with fiber optic lights. It's a sea of SPIKED HAIR and BONDAGE 
               OUTFITS.

               Sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd. 
               With his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken 
               coop.

               ON THE BALCONY ABOVE THE CROWD stands a wild haired young 
               GANGSTER with PIERCED BROWS. With him is a STREET-TOUGH GIRL 
               with multi-colored hair. They look like a post-Apocalyptic 
               Bonnie & Clyde. They are YORGI and PETRA.

               Yorgi checks his watch. His delivery is late. Then his CELL 
               PHONE rings. He's getting the news from outside.

               He looks down, spots Sterling amidst the moshing crowd. With 
               that look, that tux, there's no mistaking what he is.

               They make EYE CONTACT and Sterling gives a little nod.

               Yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone.

               Immediately VIKTOR starts moving in Sterling's direction.

               Viktor is huge, with a MOHAWK and a six-inch GOATEE.

               Sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit, pushing 
               through the freaky crowd.

               EXT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

               Sterling's ASTON-MARTIN VANTAGE screeches away from the curb.

               INT. ASTON-MARTIN - MOVING - NIGHT

               Sterling is at the wheel of his spy car. He plugs the DATA 
               CHIP into the dash and punches buttons. A computer screen 
               says "DATA DOWNLOADING".

               He sees a BLACKED-OUT SUV racing up behind him.

               He accelerates and hits a SWITCH.

               ARMORED PLATING slides up over the rear window.

               EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT

               The SUV is right behind him. Viktor rolls down the passenger 
               window, readies his PISTOL.

               The rear bumper of the spy car opens. SMOKE BOMBS drop out.

               They explode in MASSIVE CLOUDS, obscuring the narrow, street.

               Sterling skids around a corner.

               The blinded bad guys drive straight into a STOREFRONT. Glass 
               and merchandise flies as the SUV gets stuck.

               The Aston-Martin rounds another corner and slides to a stop.

               Blocking the road ahead are two more SUV's.

               A MOTORCYCLE slides to a stop in front of them. The rider is 
               ANDERS, a leather clad biker who looks half Viking.

               Anders pulls out a SILENCED SUB-MACHINE GUN and starts 
               BLASTING.

               BULLETS SLAM into the Aston-Martin, cracking the bullet-proof 
               glass, shattering headlights, and BLOWING OUT THE FRONT TIRES!

               Sterling jams it into reverse and backs around the corner on 
               the RIMS.

               INT. ASTON-MARTIN - IDLING - NIGHT

               Sterling notices an ERROR MESSAGE now flashing on his computer 
               screen: "TRANSMISSION ERROR: - DATA PARTIALLY SENT".

               Sterling looks around desperately. Somehow he's got to get 
               this data out of here.

               Straight ahead is the RIVER. Chugging up the river: a PARTY 
               BARGE.

               PARTYGOERS in formal attire dance to an orchestra. A SWIMMING 
               POOL is in the middle of the deck for a perfect water landing.

                                     STERLING
                         Time for a slow boat to China.

               He hits a BUTTON.

               EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT

               The rear license plate folds down, revealing a ROCKET ENGINE.

               Flames spew as he jams down the accelerator.

               Sterling is pushed back into his seat by the G-forces.

               SPARKS fly from the rims as he skips across the pavement at 
               ever increasing speed.

               Anders FIRES with his gun, but Sterling is getting away!

               But then KIRILL steps around the corner. He's academic 
               looking, a CHAIN SMOKING intellectual with COKE-BOTTLE 
               GLASSES. He's also a highly proficient and cold-blooded 
               SNIPER.

               Kirill puts his lit cigarette behind his ear and unslings a 
               SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE LAUNCHER from his shoulder.

               The Aston-Martin reaches the riverbank and goes AIRBORNE. It 
               ROCKETS through the air towards the party barge.

               We see the car REFLECTED in Kirill's glasses as he AIMS.

               On a little SCREEN we see the missile launcher HOME IN on 
               the HEAT SOURCE of the jet engine.

               The missile locks-in and FIRES...

               HEATSEEKER P.O.V. - we see a GREEN CAR with all its hot spots 
               GLOWING RED. Camera ROARS towards the flying car.

               INT. ASTON-MARTIN - FLYING - NIGHT

               Sterling sees the missile streaking at him.

                                     STERLING
                         Oh bloody hell!

               EXT. THE RIVER - NIGKT

               WHOOMPH! The Aston-Martin EXPLODES in mid-air.

               Partygoers shriek as the AXLE and FLAMING RIMS rain down on 
               the deck.

               Kirill takes the cigarette from his ear, PUFFS IT.

               Finally, Sterling's flaming BOW TIE flutters down and lands 
               on a LEAPING SALMON ICE-SCULPTURE above a tantalizing SEAFOOD 
               BUFFET.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WASHINGTON D.C.

               A STRAFING SHOT over the city. We make a sudden left turn 
               and SPEED OUT OF TOWN.

               We shoot over to the BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS of VIRGINIA. In 
               the middle of NOWHERE we dive towards a COMPLEX OF BLACK 
               BUILDINGS.

               INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Inside it's modern, cold and high tech. An elevator COUNTS 
               DOWN to a deep basement level.

               The doors open and a TALL MAN man with a PROSTHETIC LEG 
               strides down the empty hall. AGENT GIBBONS is African-
               American, a battle-scarred WARRIOR. Even with a limp he looks 
               sturdy, confident, deadly.

               At the end of the hall is a METAL DOOR.

               INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - NIGHT

               Gibbons walks into the INFORMATION ROOM of the NATIONAL 
               SECURITY AGENCY (NSA). There are WORLD MAPS, SATELLITE IMAGES 
               on COMPUTER SCREENS, TECHIES monitoring everything.

               If a nuclear war broke out, you could run the country from 
               down here.

               Gibbons takes an elevator up.

               INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The office is expensive yet devoid of personality, reflecting 
               the shadowy nature of it's owner. One wall is GLASS, looking 
               down on the information room. SAM TANNICK, grizzled NSA chief, 
               looks down at the activity below.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Come.

               Gibbons enters, stands by the desk.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Evening, Sam.

               Sam remains in shadow.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         What do you have?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Not a whole helluva lot. His final 
                         transmission was mangled. About 
                         something or someone called "Ahab". 
                         Whatever it is, it cost him his life.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         He was the best there was. That makes 
                         three agents lost.

                                     GIBBONS
                         They're ruthless and they have a lot 
                         of firepower. It's only a matter of 
                         time before they figure out how to 
                         deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna 
                         have a catastrophe on our hands.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Silent Night in the hands of a bunch 
                         of impertinent cowboys

                                     GIBBONS
                         We're gonna have to step in, Sam. 
                         Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown 
                         in a field of cactus. Let me take 
                         care of it.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         How will you fix it?

                                     GIBBONS
                         I'll go in with a team. But first 
                         I'm going to need some intel. I'll 
                         have to put someone inside, someone 
                         new, someone they won't see coming. 
                         One of their own.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         So you'll dredge the bottom again. 
                         You've done that before. The results 
                         were... uneven.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You wanna find out about rats, ask a 
                         rat. I've had my people put together 
                         a talent pool. I downloaded it to 
                         your desktop.

               Gibbons snaps on the giant FLATSCREEN on Sam's desk. He starts 
               cycling through PHOTO AFTER PHOTO of TOUGH LOOKING MEN.

                                     GIBBONS
                         The usual prospects. Convicts, 
                         contract killers, murde...

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         The scum of the Earth.

                                     GIBBONS
                         But programmable. And expendable.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         I've seen enough. Turn it off.

               Gibbons clicks off the screen.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         They're degenerates. There's not a 
                         man in there that would give a damn 
                         if the Chinese took over.

                                     GIBBONS
                         That's exactly why we need them.

               Sam sighs, stares out at the information room.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Get these "scum", Mr. Gibbons, bring 
                         them in. Test them. Train them. Find 
                         your man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

               The huge ARCO TOWER rises up towards a moonlit sky.

               We see ACCOMPLICE #1 (TRAVIS PASTRANA) sneak up and take 
               position behind a FOUNTAIN.

               ACCOMPLICE #2 (CAREY HART) sneaks across a roof and takes 
               position overlooking the fountain position of #1.

               ACCOMPLICE #3 (DAVE MIRRA) takes up position in the second 
               story window of a FLOPHOUSE HOTEL down the street.

               A MESSENGER (BOB BURNQUIST) skates up to the front of the 
               skyscraper with a PACKAGE. He gets the attention of the 
               SECURITY GUARD inside. The Security Guard unlocks the door 
               and lets him in.

               Just then a VAN pulls up and ACCOMPLICES #4 (SHAUN PALMER) 
               and #5 (MAT HOFFMAN) hop out. They open up the back and a 
               BICYCLE is rolled out of the back by a MAN IN A HOODED JACKET.

               Jacket Man rolls the bike to the skyscraper and enters the 
               lobby.

               INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - NIGHT

               The Security Guard is checking his computer.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Crump... I'm sorry, no one by that 
                         name.

               K The Guard glances up as Jacket Man gets into an ELEVATOR.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hey! You can't go up there!

               The Security Guard rushes to intercept him. The Messenger 
               kicks his skateboard out, TRIPPING UP the Security Guard.

               The Messenger hauls ass out the door. The Security Guard 
               pulls out his WALKIE-TALKIE.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         We've got an intruder in the express 
                         elevator!

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               The button for "91 - ROOF ACCESS" is lit up. Jacket Man waits 
               patiently.

               INT. 91ST FLOOR - NIGHT

               This fancy office is empty for the night. The STAIRWELL DOOR 
               opens and a PLATOON of SECURITY GUARDS rushes in. They take 
               Up position in front of the elevator doors armed with BILLY 
               CLUBS and TASERS.

               DING! The elevator arrives and the door swings open. But 
               there's NOBODY INSIDE.

               One Guard steps forward and suddenly a bicycle SWINGS DOWN 
               from the ceiling, TAGGING HIM IN THE FACE. He falls back, 
               TASERING another Guard.

               Jacket Man drops down onto his bike and pedals through the 
               chaos before the Guards know what hit them. There's a CURVY 
               PIECE OF ART in the room, some kind of modern art statue.

               Jacket Man rides up the artwork like a ramp and does a 
               TABLETOP AERIAL over a DIVIDER. He hits the ground pedalling, 
               the Guards hot after him.

               Jacket Man enters a HUGE OPEN ROOM with a FIELD OF CUBICLES 
               in the middle. He bunny hops onto a desk and SLIDES TO A 
               STOP. He tosses back his hood and we get a good look at him 
               for the first time.

               He is XANDER CAGE. He's got a shaved head, bizarre TATTOOS 
               all over his body and multiple PIERCINGS. He's lean and 
               heavily cut, even dangerous looking.

               The Guards charge at him and he HOPS up onto the top of the 
               CUBICLE WALL. This thing is maybe FOUR INCHES WIDE and FIVE 
               FEET TALL.

               He pedals across the top of the cubicle wall, the Guards 
               scrambling after him.

               Xander bunny hops over one guy's head onto the next set of 
               cubicles and pedals hard. The Guards fall all over themselves 
               trying to catch him.

               At the other end Xander catches air and lands on a CONFERENCE 
               TABLE. He does a WHEELIE across it's length with Guards 
               closing in.

               Xander springs up and does a TAIL WHIP, knocking them back 
               with his rear wheel. He lands and pedals to the stairwell 
               untouched.

               EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

               Xander bursts out of the stairwell to the top of the TALLEST 
               BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN LA. He climbs on a RAISED PLATFORM.

               From here he can drop down onto another level that is strewn 
               with SATELLITE DISHES and MICROWAVE RELAYS.

               Guards rush onto the roof and try to corral him.

               Xander tears off his jacket, revealing a BACKPACK on his 
               back and VIDEO CAMERA on his chest. He pulls out a ROAD FLARE 
               and SPARKS IT. We see there are SOAKED RAGS tied to his 
               SPOKES.

               He LIGHTS THEM with the flare. Then he TOSSES THE FLARE off 
               the building.

               EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT

               The Accomplices see the flare drop. #'s 1, 2 & 3 pull CAMERAS 
               OUT and start filming.

               EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

               Xander races around the roof like a trapped animal. He evades 
               Security Guards, picking up speed.

               With Guards right behind, he drops off the TOP PLATFORM and 
               lands on a massive SATELLITE DISH.

               Using the dish as a ramp, Xander LAUNCHES himself OFF THE 
               TOP OF THE BUILDING. We're talking 90 some stories here.

               He spins through the air, his bike on fire. He's doing end 
               over end backflips. One... Two... Three... Four...

               He's looping through space on his bike, a crazy man on a 
               flaming bike against a backdrop of sleek skyscrapers and 
               night lights.

               The stunt is covered by the various Accomplices and Xander's 
               own chest camera, in SUPER 8 and DIGITAL VIDEO, from four 
               different angles.

               Xander ditches the bike, kicking it away from him and plummets 
               towards the ground.

               At the last moment he throws out a "bucket" and his PARACHUTE 
               OPENS.

               EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT

               The bicycle comes flying down and SMASHES into the pavement.

               It bounces a full TWO STORIES back up before coming to rest.

               Xander glides down and makes his landing. Accomplices #4 and 
               #5 rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the 
               van. SIRENS APPROACH as the van makes it's escape.

               As COP CARS screech up to the skyscraper, one of them RUNS 
               OVER the smoking wreckage of the bike.

                                                                   SLAM TO:

               TITLE SEQUENCE - HARDCORE MUSIC plays as we see a flowing 
               TAPESTRY OF FLORID TATTOOS. SILHOUETTED against this backdrop 
               we see the OUTLINES of NUDE WOMEN riding BMX BIKES in a HALF-
               PIPE, BLADING ever obstacles, SKY SURFING and doing street 
               SKATE TRICKS. It's a collision of outlandish imagery that 
               tells you one thing: This ain't your daddy's spy movie.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

               Xander, now on a MOTORCYCLE, zips through traffic. He's 
               smiling, leaning it way over on the turns. He's got another 
               BACKPACK on his back.

               EXT. LOFT DISTRICT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

               Xander drives his motorcycle into the garage of his building.

               INT. XANDER'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A FREIGHT ELEVATOR rises up, bringing Xander and his 
               motorcycle into the loft.

               There are EXTREME SPORTS ACTION POSTERS on the walls, 
               MOTORCYCLE PARTS and BARBELLS on the floor, and everywhere 
               there's EXTREME SPORTS EQUIPMENT of every description.

                                     XANDER
                         Sky, you there? Start packin' cause 
                         we are out of here!

               There's a NEATLY FOLDED FLAG hanging in a slightly crooked 
               FRAME on the wall. Xander straightens it as he goes by.

               He hears her in the sectioned off "bedroom" and heads back 
               there.

                                     XANDER
                         Did I promise you a fat vacation or 
                         what? Get ready to get down in 
                         paradise.

               He comes into the bedroom to find SKY, his long-suffering 
               girlfriend. She's a wannabe artist type. She's got SUITCASES 
               and BOXES scattered around and she's PACKING.

                                     XANDER
                         Hey, you don't need all this just to 
                         go on vacation. Unless this ain't 
                         for going on vacation...

                                     SKY
                         I'm through, Xander.

                                     XANDER
                         I can see that. Why?

                                     SKY
                         You run around with maniacs jumping 
                         motorcycles in the desert, you break 
                         36 bones crashing wave runners and 
                         snowboarding off cliffs, all with no 
                         health insurance... It's insane, I 
                         can't take it anymore.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm having fun, what's the problem?

                                     SKY
                         You have all this talent, and you 
                         waste it. You won't take a single 
                         endorsement deal. Meanwhile those 
                         other guys have their own video games! 
                         But no, you've got too much 
                         "integrity" for that.

                                     XANDER
                         I don't wanna go mersh, you know 
                         that. But hey, if this is about 
                         money...

               He opens up the backpack, revealing WADS OF CASH.

                                     XANDER
                         I got an advance on the next bootleg. 
                         Let's get out of here, just you and 
                         me. We'll chill out in Bora Bora for 
                         a couple months.

               She sorts through the money.

                                     SKY
                         French Polynesia? This wouldn't last 
                         us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you 
                         know how expensive it is down there?

                                     XANDER
                         Alright, so I'll get more.

                                     SKY
                         It's not about the money, X! You 
                         never plan for anything. I can't 
                         live like that anymore, I need some 
                         stability.

                                     XANDER
                         Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd 
                         better give you your surprise now.

               He pulls off his shirt. Pierced through his nipple is a 
               DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.

                                     SKY
                         What...?

                                     XANDER
                         I was gonna wait till the islands, 
                         but...

                                     SKY
                         You're serious?

                                     XANDER
                         Of course I'm serious. I bought it, 
                         didn't I?

                                     SKY
                              (shakes her head)
                         This is so typical. I can't believe 
                         you. I've barely seen you for the 
                         last three weeks and now this? Are 
                         you out of your mind?

                                     XANDER
                         I don't know. I thought this is what 
                         you wanted. You want stability, here 
                         it is.

                                     SKY
                         You can't just propose to me out of 
                         nowhere. You think that's going to 
                         solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It 
                         was a kick for a while, but it's 
                         over. You're just not going anywhere.

                                     XANDER
                         You're not exactly "going anywhere" 
                         yourself.

                                     SKY
                         You're wrong about that. I'm heading 
                         out that door right now.

               She heads towards the front door.

               Just then the door BLOWS IN.

               CRASH! -- the windows SMASH IN too. Then the LIGHTS GO OUT 
               as STORMTROOPERS in black body armor rush in, weapons drawn.

               It's a blur of FLASHLIGHTS, PISTOLS and JACK BOOTS. It's 
               scary as hell. A professional take-down.

               They slam Xander against the wall.

               Just like that it's quiet again. Sky hyperventilates, a gun 
               in her face.

                                     XANDER
                         She had nothing to do with the tower 
                         jump. She's nobody. I just met her 
                         last night. Tell them.
                              (with meaning)
                         I hardly know you.

               The Stormtrooper looks at Sky. She nods. The Stormtroopers 
               take their guns off her.

               Sky grabs up here stuff. She looks back at Xander.

                                     SKY
                         Keep the ring. It looks better on 
                         you anyways.

               She heads out.

                                     XANDER
                         God, I hate cops. What's the charges 
                         this time?

               The Stormtrooper pulls out a DART GUN and SHOOTS Xander. He 
               pulls a CHROME DART from his chest, examines it.

                                     XANDER
                              (groggy)
                         You... pussies...

               Xander slides to the floor.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. PAN'S DINER - DAY

               A SIDEWAYS IMAGE: an out of focus COFFEE CREAMER.

               Xander wakes up with his head on the counter of a DINER. He 
               shakes out the cobwebs.

                                     XANDER
                         What the hell?

               WHIP PAN as a WAITRESS walks by. Xander blinks.

                                     XANDER
                         Hey. Where am I? How did I get here?

                                     WAITRESS
                         I don't know, you wandered in ten 
                         minutes ago and put your head down. 
                         I told you we were closing.

               Xander looks around, sees a TRUCKER chewing with his mouth 
               open. A SALESMAN buried in his NEWSPAPER.

               Xander gets up. Where the hell is he? He takes a step towards 
               the door.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Want some coffee?

                                     XANDER
                         Huh?

               The Waitress pours him coffee. QUICK PUSH TO: her hands are 
               shaking.

                                     XANDER
                         You alright?

                                     WAITRESS
                              (smiles)
                         Fine, just fine. Come on and sit. 
                         I'll get you something to eat.

                                     XANDER
                         Yeah, sure.

               Xander sits. When he swigs his coffee, he notices something 
               written on his napkin in shaky ballpoint: "S.O.S."

               What the hell? He looks at the Trucker. The Trucker's staring 
               at the waitress. QUICK PUSH TO: The Trucker has a BULGE 
               underneath his vest... then PUSH TO: The Salesman's eyes 
               darting about suspiciously, newspaper pulled up to his nose. 
               Something is going down...

               He hears a SLOWED DOWN VOICE and glances back at the Trucker, 
               who's now fixing him with a DEATH STARE. Xander snaps from 
               his reverie.

                                     XANDER
                         What?

                                     TRUCKER
                         I said, you got a problem, boy?

                                     XANDER
                         Problem? No, no problem. You go right 
                         ahead.

                                     TRUCKER
                         With what? I said, go right on ahead 
                         with what?

                                     XANDER
                         Whatever, dude.

               The Trucker and the Salesman look at each other. Suddenly 
               they jump up.

               The Trucker pulls a PISTOL from his vest, the Salesman 
               brandishes the SHOTGUN he had behind the paper. The Waitress 
               cringes.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Alright, nobody make a move!
                              (to Xander)
                         Shoulda walked away when you had the 
                         chance, dumb shit.

                                     SALESMAN
                         Forget him, Buck, let's just do it.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Shut up!
                              (in Xander's face)
                         You keep still or I'm gonna make 
                         damn sure you stop breathing today. 
                         Got that?

               Xander stays strangely calm, his senses now fully focused.

                                     XANDER
                              (shrugs)
                         Alright, "Buck", whatever you say.

               The Waitress let's out a whimper.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty 
                         that register! Couldn't just let him 
                         leave, could ya! You know what I'm 
                         gonna do to ya for that? Huh? Do 
                         ya?!

               She goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses 
               on the floor. Xander springs into action.

               He CHOPS down on the Trucker's arm and ELBOWS him in the 
               face.

               Xander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out 
               from under him.

               The Salesman pumps on his shotgun, but it seems to be jammed.

                                     XANDER
                         Better shoot me quick.

               The Salesman fights with his gun but can't get it to work. 
               Xander advances on him.

                                     XANDER
                         Too late!

               He unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw.

               The Salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors.

               Xander turns to the terrified Waitress.

                                     XANDER
                         Alright, bitch, what's going on?

               She stares at him, unable to speak. He raises the gun.

                                     XANDER
                         Talk! What's the game? Who are you 
                         people?

               The front door bell JINGLES. A guy with an impeccably tailored 
               suit and a cane hobbles in. It's Gibbons. There a problem, 
               Mr. Cage?

                                     XANDER
                         Who the hell are you?

                                     GIBBONS
                         The name's Gibbons. You were saying?

                                     XANDER
                         What is this place?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Looks like a diner.

                                     XANDER
                         Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the 
                         problem is. I wake up drugged to 
                         find what? You've got a "salesman" 
                         over here reading a three week old 
                         newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a 
                         "trucker", who happens to be packing 
                         a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped 
                         that something is going down when 
                         she passes me a note. How's that for 
                         twisted logic? How did she know there 
                         was trouble unless they pulled the 
                         guns before I "walked" in? And if 
                         that's true, why'd they stop and 
                         wait until I woke up to gaffle the 
                         money? Then I notice how beefy they 
                         both are. Hell, even the waitress is 
                         cut. All three of them look like 
                         they went through the same training 
                         program. Ergo they ain't strangers 
                         and this isn't what it seems. That's 
                         how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round 
                         off even if I gave him all day. Why?

               He aims at the Waitress and FIRES! She's startled, but unhurt.

                                     XANDER
                         Cuz there's nothing but blanks in 
                         these guns. And no offense, but their 
                         performances were terrible.

               Xander tosses the gun on the counter. Gibbons gives a sly 
               smile.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Not bad. Not bad at all. Have a seat.

               Gibbons sits in a booth. Xander sits across from him. In the 
               background the Waitress helps the Trucker and Salesman up.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Most guys we ran through this either 
                         took off or helped them rob the place. 
                         I expected you to do the same.

                                     XANDER
                         That shows me already that you don't 
                         have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Whether you thought this was for 
                         real or not, you jumped in and helped 
                         the waitress on instinct. That tells 
                         me something about your character.

                                     XANDER
                         Good for you. Now why don't you stop 
                         wasting my time and tell me what you 
                         want. You didn't go through all this 
                         for my benefit.

                                     GIBBONS
                         It's your lucky day. You just might 
                         get the chance to pay back our 
                         wonderful country for all the freedom 
                         you enjoy.

                                     XANDER
                         A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else 
                         would have this kind of budget? Now 
                         you're gonna hit me with the sales 
                         pitch.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Alright, Cage, you've got me. This 
                         is one of those moments. "Many are 
                         called, few are chosen", that kind 
                         of thing. Your government needs you. 
                         Are you up for the challenge?

                                     XANDER
                         ..If you're trolling around for narcs, 
                         man, have you got the wrong guy.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Why is that?

                                     XANDER
                         Look at me, dude, do I look like a 
                         fan of law enforcement? Forget the 
                         tests, you shoulda just asked me. I 
                         woulda saved you a lot of trouble.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Oh I don't know, I think the tests 
                         work pretty well. Sometimes they 
                         give me answers you wouldn't admit 
                         to in a million years.

                                     XANDER
                         Are we done now? You've got nothing 
                         on me. So if you ain't booking me, 
                         I'm walking.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You've got this wrong. You're not 
                         under arrest, you've been abducted. 
                         And until I say different, you belong 
                         to me.

                                     XANDER
                         Is that a fact?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling 
                         about you from the start, Cage. It's 
                         nausea.

                                     XANDER
                              (smiles)
                         You know what I hate? Any scumbag 
                         with a clean shirt and a bad haircut 
                         can get one of those tin stars and 
                         suddenly they think they're God.

                                     GIBBONS
                              (smiles)
                         You know what I hate? It's always 
                         the assholes that pass the tests.

               There's a POP and Xander clutches his stomach. Gibbons tosses 
               his DART GUN onto the table. Xander blinks at him.

               He pulls another CHROME DART from his gut and examines it.

                                     XANDER
                         You bastards love to see me sleep.

               WHACK! He goes face down on the table.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               CLOSE ON - XANDER'S FACE

               He comes to, blinking in low RED LIGHT. He's shocked to find 
               that he's...

               INT. AIRPLANE - TWILIGHT

               Xander's on the floor of a military aircraft. TWO OTHER TOUGH 
               GUYS are waking up next to him. One's a greaser named VIRG, 
               the other is T.J., ex-Navy.

               Xander notices as they each pull out CHROME DARTS. They sit 
               up, looking at each other. Xander chuckles.

                                     VIRG
                         What's so damn funny?

                                     XANDER
                         Been to any good diners lately?

               The three laugh, realizing they're all in the same boat.

                                     T.J.
                         We must be the final "candidates".

               They quiet down as they notice for the first time, THEY ARE 
               NOT ALONE.

               Sitting silently on benches facing them are SOLDIERS DRESSED 
               IN BLACK. They wear BLACK MASKS over their faces. They are a 
               nasty looking BLACK OPS TEAM.

                                     XANDER
                         Nobody told me this was a costume 
                         party.

               The Black Ops Team, just stares.

                                     T.J.
                         I've worked with guys like this 
                         before. Black Ops. Serious government 
                         spooks.

               Virg notices something STRAPPED TO HIS BODY. They all have 
               them.

                                     VIRG
                         Heads up, man. What's this thing on 
                         my back?

                                     XANDER
                         A parachute. This does not argue 
                         well.

               Then the red light switches to GREEN.

               One of the Soldiers opens the JUMP DOOR. The rest of the 
               team advances on Xander, Virg and T.J.

                                     VIRG
                         This is bullshit! Hey!

               They drag Virg to the door and THROW HIM OUT. T.J. goes next, 
               kicking and fighting.

               Then they turn on Xander.

                                     XANDER
                         I get the picture.

               Xander jumps out on his own.

               We see him tumbling away from the airplane. Far below his 
               chute BLOSSOMS OPEN.

               EXT. A FIELD - TWILIGHT

               We see three chutes coming down. The first two HIT HARD.

               We ROCKET IN on the last chute as Xander lands like a pro.

               The other guys run up to him. Then they hear SHOUTING in 
               SPANISH.

                                     VIRG
                         Jee-zus, man! What the hell now? 
                         Another damn test?

                                     T.J.
                         We should head for those trees.

                                     XANDER
                         Don't look at me, brother. It's every 
                         man for himself.

               They wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as 
               they TAKE OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

               Xander runs low down a culvert. There's SHOUTING all around.

               He flattens down and crawls up over the rise. What he sees 
               stuns him.

                                     XANDER
                         You gotta be kidding me.

               We crane up to reveal A FIELD OF POT PLANTS. There's a COCAINE 
               PROCESSING PLANT along the field's edge. The whole place 
               looks exactly like a Central American DRUG FARM.

               NARCO TERRORISTS run around with AK-47's.

               Xander sneaks past EQUIPMENT covered in CAMOUFLAGE NETTING.

               A squad of Narcos runs by and Xander makes his move.

               He rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the 
               HEADLIGHTS of a truck.

               Narcos hop out and charge forward.

               Xander raises his hands.

                                     XANDER
                         You boys are too good for me. Guess 
                         I failed this one, huh?

               They grab him and haul him away.

               INT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT

               We see a RUSTY MEAT HOOK. A CHAIN is wrapped around it.

               Attached to the chain, his arms over his head, is Xander.

               He's in the middle of a bleak looking room. There are 
               BLOODSTAINS on the wooden walls, the floor strewn with filthy 
               HAY.

               Behind him against the wall Xander sees T.J. and Virg both 
               HOG-TIED.

                                     XANDER
                         So much for "every man for himself". 
                         Nice to see you again, fellas.

                                     T.J.
                         They really went all out on this 
                         one. This is a pretty gnarly setup.

                                     VIRG
                         Check the table in the corner.

               There's a BLOOD STAINED TOWEL COVERING a TABLE near the door.

                                     XANDER
                         This oughta be good.

               Then they hear talking outside and the door is UNLOCKED.

               A very nasty looking Marco comes in. By his look he's the 
               LEADER.

                                     XANDER
                         This must be el jefe. How's it goin' 
                         jefe? Some weather we're havin'.

               Narco Guards bring in one of their PARACHUTES and toss it on 
               the floor. They exit, closing the door behind them.

               Jefe goes to the table throws back the towel. Beneath it are 
               HIDEOUS, BLOOD ENCRUSTED TORTURE DEVICES: a HACK SAW, a BOLT 
               CUTTERS, KNIVES, CHISELS, a BLOW TORCH.

                                     XANDER
                         What's on the menu tonight? The old 
                         blowtorch-to-the-family jewels 
                         routine, I'll bet. Hey, you want 
                         roasted nuts, let's break out the 
                         Planters.

               T.J. and Virg both crack up. Jefe gives them a withering 
               look.

                                     JEFE
                         Do you know what we do with people 
                         come round here? You know what we do 
                         with people come in our business?

               Jefe passes his hand over the various tools. He finally 
               settles on a crude MACHETE. He walks amongst them brandishing 
               it.

                                     JEFE
                         We cut the Achilles tendon. Your 
                         feet flop around like a marionette. 
                         You ain't walkin' nowhere no more.
                         Sound good, tough guy? Or maybe 
                         instead you wanna tell me something.

               He stops in front of Xander.

                                     JEFE
                         Whatchu doing here?

                                     XANDER
                         Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.

                                     JEFE
                         That's some accident, hombre. You 
                         accidentally fall out of a plane in 
                         the middle of the night and land up 
                         in my back yard.

               He BACKHANDS Xander across the face.

                                     JEFE
                         We seen this kind of parachutes 
                         before, you know. U.S. Army. You got 
                         some friends here, jump out with you 
                         guys?

                                     XANDER
                         We're anti-social. We don't have any 
                         friends.

               Jefe SLAPS him again.

                                     JEFE
                         No friends, huh? That's funny, I 
                         don't know no U.S. Army that comes 
                         without no friends. That's cuz U.S. 
                         Army is pussies. They always come 
                         with the five hundred guys and the 
                         helicopters and the see-in-the-dark 
                         glasses. So don't you tell me you 
                         all alone out here, my friend. You 
                         bullshitting the wrong guy.

               Xander looks over at T.J. and Virg.

                                     XANDER
                         Who's writing this dude's dialogue?

                                     VIRG
                         He's a pretty good actor, though.

                                     T.J.
                         Makes the diner look like a sixth 
                         grade play. He's even got them crazy 
                         eyes.

                                     JEFE
                         You ain't begun to see crazy yet, 
                         amigo.

                                     XANDER
                         We're on to the game, ese. You got 
                         the fake blood splattered all over 
                         the walls, you got your torture 
                         tools... It's all very cute. But 
                         come on, let's quit while you're 
                         ahead. I'm only trying to save you a 
                         beatin'.

                                     JEFE
                         You saving me? You talking pretty 
                         tough for a guy got himself chained 
                         to the ceiling.

                                     XANDER
                              (shrugs)
                         Alright. You wanna eat through a 
                         tube, be my guest.

                                     JEFE
                         Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, 
                         funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the 
                         whole foot off. Whatchu think of 
                         that?

               A low THUMPING is heard outside. It's the sound of approaching 
               HELICOPTERS, lots of them.

               Then the night ERUPTS in GUNFIRE. It sounds like a full scale 
               assault outside.

                                     JEFE
                         What's that, eh? I thought you didn't 
                         have no friends!

               Jefe goes into a fury. He SWINGS his machete at Xander's 
               legs.

               Xander JUMPS UP, grabbing on to the chain above, and KICKS 
               Jefe in the chest.

               Jefe falls back and Xander climbs up to the roof BEAM.

               He grabs onto the beam with his legs and UNHOOKS his chain 
               from the meat hook.

               He drops down, six feet of chain still hanging from his cuffed 
               wrists, and Jefe comes charging at him.

               Xander dodges a few wild swings.

               He grabs Jefe's PANT CUFF and dumps him on his ass.

               Jefe scrambles to his feet, drawing his PISTOL.

               Xander swings his chain and WHIPS the gun out of Jefe's hand.

               With another swing he WRAPS the chain around Jefe's neck and 
               pulls it taught.

                                     XANDER
                         Keys. You got 'em?

               Jefe nods, choking, and reaches into his pocket.

                                     XANDER
                         Hand 'em to me.

               Instead Jefe hurls them out the window.

                                     XANDER
                         I hope you're getting paid extra for 
                         this.

               Xander jerks the chain, slamming Jefe head first into the 
               wall. Jefe drops, knocked out.

               Outside it sounds like a full scale FIREFIGHT. Xander gets 
               the machete and CUTS the ropes holding T.J. and Virg.

               Then a HAIL OF BULLETS sprays through the room.

               All three guys hit the deck but T.J. gets shot. He clutches 
               his side, BLOOD all over his hands.

                                     T.J.
                         I'm hit! I'm hit!

                                     VIRG
                         They're shooting for real! This is 
                         all real.

               Xander knows this is true.

                                     XANDER
                         Aw shit.

               He checks out T.J.'s wound.

                                     XANDER
                         Help me with this guy.

                                     VIRG
                         It's like you said, every man for 
                         himself.

               Virg bolts for the door.

                                     XANDER
                         That only works if you're a man!

               EXT. DRUG FARM - NIGHT

               Narcos are shouting, running to and fro.

               TRACER ROUNDS cut through the air. They are trying to repel 
               an UNSEEN ASSAULT FORCE.

               Overhead SIX MILITARY HELICOPTERS buzz the compound like 
               Apocalypse Now, their NIGHT SUNS lighting up the place.

               Xander comes out of the torture building holding T.J. in a 
               fireman's carry. His hands are still CUFFED, the length of 
               chain dragging.

               Xander crouches behind some equipment, putting T.J. on the 
               ground.

                                     XANDER
                         You alright?

                                     T.J.
                         I used to be a SEAL, it's not the 
                         first time I've been shot. Thanks, 
                         man.

                                     XANDER
                         Keep your head down, I'll be right 
                         back. I'm gonna steal us some wheels.

               Xander moves on, finds cover under the camouflage netting.

               He can see Narcos shooting into the trees at the UNSEEN ENEMY.

               Looking the other way, he spots Virg running back his way.

               He's been corralled by one of the Helicopters.

               He's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's Night 
               Sun.

               Xander darts out and GRABS him, pulling him under the 
               camouflage netting.

                                     VIRG
                         They're all over the place! What the 
                         hell's going on?

                                     XANDER
                         Looks like we're in the middle of 
                         the drug war.

               The Helicopter lights up the camouflage netting.

               They're pinned down.

                                     XANDER
                         Alright Mr. free-for-all, you go 
                         that way, I'm gonna go this way. 
                         They can't follow us both.

               They squat down in runners stances, the helicopter kicking 
               up DUST all around them.

                                     XANDER
                         Go!

               They jet off in opposite directions.

               Xander books, running for all he's worth. His cuffed hands 
               and the dangling chain make it difficult.

               He's heading straight into the FIELD OF POT PLANTS.

               Suddenly the massive SPOTLIGHT picks him out.

                                     XANDER
                         Shit!

               The CHOPPER swoops down after him.

               Its big GATLING GUNS turn, aiming right at him.

               BRAAAAAAAAPPP! The guns cut loose, tearing up the ground 
               right behind him.

               Xander sprints, the chopper after him like Cary Grant in 
               "North By Northwest", except instead of corn fields, Xander's 
               running through a field of HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS.

               Xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him.

               Xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the 
               plants.

               All around him it's a chaos of Helicopters and GUNFIRE.

               Two choppers attack the factory building, BLASTING it with 
               their guns. Narcos run terrified.

               Xander notices a FAT PURPLE BUD on the plant right in front 
               of him. He SNAPS IT OFF.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm gonna need to hit the trees after 
                         a night like this.

               He tucks it-into his shirt and takes off through the POT 
               FOREST.

               Xander finally spots a vehicle. It's a TRUCK LADEN WITH BAILS 
               OF COCAINE. He heads for it.

               Then the SPOTLIGHT finds him again and the Chopper swings 
               around. The gatling guns RIP the plants to pieces all around 
               him.

               Xander hauls ass, heading for the truck.

               Bullets chew up the dirt all around him.

               As the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns RAKE THE TRUCK.

               There is a FLASH as the GAS TANK goes up.

               WHOOOOPPHH! A SUPERNOVA OF FIRE AND HIGH-GRADE COKE erupts 
               into the night air.

               Xander dives into a DRAINAGE DITCH. He tumbles down into 
               FILTHY WATER.

               A powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white.

               Near him is a big DRAINPIPE leeching sewage. Xander crawls 
               inside.

               The Chopper makes another pass overhead.

               The big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on.

               Xander gives a sigh of relief. He crawls out of the drainpipe.

               JEEPS race by on the road right above him as MILITARY MEN 
               flood the compound. There's no going back.

               Xander turns and makes his way along the tree line.

               The chopper and gunfire are in the distance now. Things are 
               quieter here and he starts to relax. Bad idea.

               As he goes by, one of the TREES moves.

               He takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on 
               EXPLODES UPWARDS. ARMS reach out, tackling Xander from behind.

               Another TEAM of BLACK OPS SOLDIERS bursts from the weeds, 
               the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape.

               They fall on him like a curtain.

               XANDER'S P.O.V. - Soldiers hold him down while a BLACK HOOD 
               is pulled over his head.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - DAY

               As the MASSIVE HANGER DOORS CLOSE we can see CHOPPERS taking 
               off and landing. MEXICAN SOLDIERS load Jefe and his Narcos 
               onto a FEDERALE BUS. Virg resists and is BEATEN. T.J. can be 
               seen being loaded into an AMBULANCE.

               The hanger doors slide shut with a THUD.

               We see Xander's HANDS as the CHAINS are cut away.

               Xander sits in a chair with the BLACK HOOD still over his 
               head. He blinks when the hood is torn off. A Black Ops Soldier 
               smirks as he walks away.

               Xander looks around, sees the Black Ops Team unpacking some 
               STRANGE GEAR. Two of them are dumping bottles of a CLEAR 
               LIQUID into a RUSTY CLAWFOOT BATHTUB.

                                     XANDER
                         Nice of you to draw me a bath. Is it 
                         Saturday already?

               The Black Ops guys grin knowingly.

               On the other side, Xander sees a FLIGHT CREW readying a 
               GULFSTREAM for travel. Gibbons steps up from behind him.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Congratulations, you've just graduated 
                         at the head of your class.

                                     XANDER
                         You're a cold piece of work. You 
                         almost got three people killed out 
                         there.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Good thing you were there to save 
                         the day. Come walk with me.

               Xander gets up and Gibbons leads him on a stroll around the

                                     GIBBONS
                         You've really got me confused, Cage. 
                         On the one hand you showed leadership, 
                         courage under fire, a willingness to 
                         protect men you hardly knew... and 
                         on the other you have an arrest record 
                         that pegs you as near sociopathic. 
                         Help me out here. I'm not following 
                         your evolution.

                                     XANDER
                         You want the cheap backstory? The 
                         runaway mom, the suicide dad and the 
                         foster homes? Gimme a break. You're 
                         not interested in my past, you're 
                         interested in my future as some kind 
                         of spy.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You're perceptive too. I forgot to 
                         add that to the list of surprises. 
                         I'm with the National Security Agency. 
                         And unlikely as it may sound, I need 
                         your help.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm not interested. I've already got 
                         a job.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You're an adrenaline junkie with one 
                         foot in the penitentiary. You risk 
                         your ass building a daredevil myth 
                         that means nothing and you're not 
                         getting any younger.

                                     XANDER
                         I plan on getting a lot older. And 
                         playing spy games sounds like a quick 
                         way to get yourself dead.

                                     GIBBONS
                         That's too bad. I thought a guy like 
                         you would appreciate the challenge.

               As they walk by the Black Ops guys, Xander sees they're 
               getting busy. One spreads out a plastic DROPCLOTH. Another 
               plugs in a BONE SAW.

                                     XANDER
                         What's this? You're gonna try to 
                         scare me now?

               Gibbons grabs a CHICKEN LEG from a guy eating lunch.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Do you know the reason why I try to 
                         recruit guys like you? There's no 
                         risk.

               He tosses it into the tub. Instantly it starts to SIZZLE and 
               BUBBLE. The tub is full of ACID.

                                     GIBBONS
                         There's nobody back home who's gonna 
                         ask questions if you just... disappear 
                         for a while.

               In seconds the entire leg has been consumed, leaving only a 
               oily cloud of residue.

               Gibbons eyes him coldly, nailing the point home.

                                     XANDER
                         Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So 
                         what's the deal? What do you need me 
                         for?

                                     GIBBONS
                         There's some folks I want to keep 
                         tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. 
                         Your kind of people.

                                     XANDER
                         What do I get out of it?

                                     GIBBONS
                         If you find out what I want to know, 
                         and if I'm able to successfully use 
                         that information, you get to go back 
                         to your degenerate little life. If 
                         not, you take a bath.

                                     XANDER
                         You're one sick bastard. A sadist 
                         with a badge looking to rope me in 
                         to a suicide mission. I think no 
                         matter which way I go I'm likely to 
                         wind up face down on a sheet of 
                         plastic. So here's my answer: kiss 
                         my ass, Hop-along.

               Gibbons kicks the back of Xander's leg and dumps him on his 
               ass. Gibbons was so quick, Xander never saw it coming.

               The Black Ops guys clap and cheer, always interested in a 
               fight.

                                     XANDER
                         Not bad for a gimp.

                                     GIBBONS
                         What's with that "X" on the back of 
                         your head? Does that mean you're 
                         "extreme"? I've got some news for 
                         you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. 
                         So maybe you should tattoo another 
                         couple of X's on your head.

               Xander gets up.

                                     XANDER
                         I'll take that under advisement. 
                         Maybe I can be like you and lose a 
                         leg for the old Stars and Bars. I 
                         bet the flag's a great comfort every 
                         time you need help climbing stairs.

               Gibbons lunges and grabs Xander's throat in the vice-like 
               grip of his thumb and middle finger.

                                     GIBBONS
                         One twitch and my finger and thumb 
                         will meet inside your esophagus. 
                         Believe me, Mr. X, I've put foot to 
                         ass for my country on many occasions 
                         and I don't feel the urge to stop 
                         just yet. So think carefully before 
                         you tell me: Is "kiss my ass, Hop-
                         along" your final answer?

               The fingers are so powerful that Xander is paralysed. He 
               looks over, sees the bone saw start revving.

                                     XANDER
                              (choking)
                         No.

               Gibbons releases his grip.

                                     GIBBONS
                         I thought you might see it my way.

               Then Xander starts walking away.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Where you going, X? I said where you 
                         going?

               The Black Ops guys grab weapons, ready to stop him.

                                     XANDER
                         You tell me.

               Xander climbs up the steps of the Gulfstream.

                                     XANDER
                         There better be a movie on this Goddam 
                         flight.

               INT. GULFSTREAM - DAY

               Xander sits with Gibbons in big leather chairs. They are 
               surrounded by NSA AGENTS in suits.

               A NERDY AGENT snaps an ANKLET around Xander's ankle.

                                     XANDER
                         How about a pedicure as long as you're 
                         down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Wherever you go on the planet, I'll 
                         find you. There's no quitting. If 
                         you try to take it off, a ring of 
                         needles will inject enough curare 
                         into your bloodstream to kill you 
                         before you hit the ground. Is all 
                         that clear?

                                     XANDER
                         Yeah, I spy or I die.

               INT. EMPTY FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - SUNSET

               Orange light floods this beautiful airline lounge. There's a 
               fully stocked bar, a snack table, all unused. That's because 
               it's been sealed off for NSA use. (NOTE: perfect product 
               placement opportunity for an AIRLINE).

               Xander, Gibbons and his Men are all silhouetted against the 
               smoked glass windows.

               The Nerdy Agent hands Xander a Palm Pilot sized ELECTRONIC 
               DEVICE.

                                     NERDY AGENT
                         This is your communicator. You'll 
                         identify yourself by a call sign. 
                         From here on out you're Bulldog Omega 
                         5.

                                     XANDER
                         You must stay up late to come up 
                         with shit like that.

                                     GIBBONS
                         I expect you to call in regularly 
                         with progress reports.

                                     XANDER
                         Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog 
                         Omega 5.

               Gibbons checks his watch. They get up and start walking.

               INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - SUNSET

               The phalanx of Agents surrounds Xander and Gibbons as they 
               walk to the gate. The Nerdy Agent hurries to catch up.

                                     AGENT
                         Uh... Call signs derive from the 
                         parameters of the mission.

                                     GIBBONS
                         If he doesn't like it, we can make 
                         an exception just this once. We'll 
                         call him "Triple X".

               They walk past the gate, down the jet-way, the Agents FLASH 
               BADGES to the GATE WORKERS.

                                     XANDER
                         Up yours.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Crude and defiant as always, Triple 
                         X. It fits so well because you're 
                         obscene.

               Xander is the last one to board the plane.

                                     XANDER
                         Is that all?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Just remember, I'll be watching.

               As the door closes, he looks back at Gibbons and his phalanx 
               of Agents.

                                     XANDER
                         I've got something for you to chew 
                         on. Next time you send someone to 
                         save the world, make sure they like 
                         the planet the way it is.

               The jet's door CLOSES.

               INT. COMMERCIAL JET - NIGHT

               Xander is in the last row against the bulkhead. He's got a 
               personal DVD player and headphones and he's reviewing his 
               mission. The high-tech screen shows photos, maps, cool 
               graphics.

               The KID sitting across the aisle leans over for a look.

                                     KID
                         What game is that?

                                     XANDER
                         Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? 
                         They're called "Anarchy 99", they're 
                         the bad guy bosses.

                                     KID
                         Do they have any special powers? The 
                         bosses always have special powers.

                                     XANDER
                         You wanna check it out? Come here.

               The kid moves to the seat next to Xander.

               Onscreen see photos of the FIVE BAD GUYS from the opening 
               sequence. We DIVE IN to the computer as Xander describes 
               them.

               For each of the baddies, we'll see 3-D PHOTOS and VIDEO CLIPS, 
               all enhanced with COMPUTER GRAPHICS and POP-UP MENUS.

                                     XANDER
                         First we've got Anders, the psycho 
                         looking biker. In charge of 
                         transportation and smuggling. Controls 
                         every trucking union in Eastern 
                         Europe. Don't look too clean, either.

               We see ANDERS, the wild-eyed and unclean Swedish biker, 
               against a backdrop of MOTORCYCLES and MUSCLE CARS.

                                     XANDER
                         Next we got a Siberian redneck, 
                         Viktor. Into snowmobiles and 
                         snowboarding. So naturally, he covers 
                         prostitution and the drug trade.

                                     KID
                         Naturally.

               We see Viktor, with the goatee and belly, doing some hairy 
               snowboarding.

                                     KID
                         This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.

                                     XANDER
                         Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a 
                         bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed 
                         kills in Chechnya, they called him 
                         the "Finger of God". Assassination 
                         and weapons.

               We see Kirill in UNIFORM with his well used SNIPER RIFLE.

                                     KID
                         Who's the hottie?

               He indicates Petra, the tough gangster chick. With her LEATHER 
               and TATTOOS she looks like she could mop up the floor with 
               Lara Croft.

                                     XANDER
                         You like her, huh? Petra. She runs 
                         their finances, money laundering, 
                         computers. Joined the gang after 
                         spending some time as the girlfriend 
                         of this dude, Yorgi Azar Zimin. Capo 
                         of Anarchy 99.

               Finally we see YORGI, the unlikely looking Mafiya Don. We 
               see CRIME SCENE PHOTOS that illustrate his exploits.

                                     XANDER
                         Yorgi masterminded the take-over of 
                         three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called 
                         it "blood week". He combined all of 
                         their global enterprises into one 
                         huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.

                                     KID
                              (skeptically)
                         "Anarchy" 99"?

                                     XANDER
                         What are you gonna do? They're Euro-
                         trash.

                                     KID
                         What weapons do you have?

               Xander clicks on "INVENTORY". He scrolls through a staggering 
               array of WEAPONS and VEHICLES.

                                     XANDER
                         Just about anything I want, it looks 
                         like. This is gonna be tough, though. 
                         There's no way to save this game. I 
                         gotta get it right the first time 
                         through.

                                     KID
                         What do you get if you finish?

                                     XANDER
                         Nothing, really. My guy is just doing 
                         it to stay alive.

                                     KID
                         Oh. I bet by the end he gets something 
                         out of it.

                                     XANDER
                         Like what?

                                     KID
                         He gets to be the hero.

               The Kid's mom calls him back to his seat. Xander looks at 
               the kid, then gets back to his research.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PRAGUE - DAY

               We CRANE UP from the COBBLESTONE STREET as a BEAT-UP CAR 
               races by. We rise up, revealing PRAGUE in all it's glory.

               INT. BEAT-UP CAR - MOVING

               Xander sits in the back, wedged between TWO IDENTICAL LOOKING 
               TOUGH GUYS. If you were to call Central Casting and ask for 
               a couple of cold war spy types, this is what they'd send.

               They're both 6' 4", have sloppily cut hair, square jaws, 
               wrinkled overcoats.

                                     XANDER
                         This is bullshit, man, I wanna see 
                         some ID.

               The two tough guys flash their COP ID's. Xander studies them. 
               "IVAN PEDGRAG" and "IVAN PODROV".

                                     XANDER
                         You're both named Ivan? That's gotta 
                         be confusing on Valentine's Day. So 
                         where we headed? Fellas, I said where 
                         we headed?
                              (beat)
                         Yeah, whatever.

               He looks out the window, sees a GRAND HOTEL. They drive right 
               on by.

               EXT. DIRTY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               It's a crumbling old dump in a nasty part of town. Xander 
               shakes his head.

                                     XANDER
                         James Bond never had to put up with 
                         this shit.

               Ivan 1 pulls Xander's gear bag from the trunk and throws it 
               on the sidewalk.

               Xander picks it up and carries it into the building.

               INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY

               Dumpy furniture, roaches, cracked windows. Xander is ushered 
               in. There's another GUY in a UGLY SUIT waiting. He is 
               DETECTIVE MILAN SLOVO.

                                     SLOVO
                         Sit down.

                                     XANDER
                         I've been on a plane for twelve hours, 
                         I think I'll stand.

               Ivan 1 shoves him into a chair.

                                     SLOVO
                         My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. 
                         When you are here you are under my 
                         jurisdiction, you take my orders, 
                         you do what I say. If you become any 
                         kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot 
                         you.

                                     XANDER
                         Here we go again.

                                     SLOVO
                         You're here because your government 
                         is putting pressure on my government. 
                         This is an internal affair, a Czech 
                         affair, that you are interfering 
                         with. I will warn you once: Don't 
                         shit in my lawn. Get whatever 
                         information your government seeks 
                         and get our.

                                     XANDER
                         First of all, you should kill whoever 
                         sold you that suit. Two, I don't 
                         wanna be here either, so just step 
                         off. Three, if you had the authority 
                         to shoot me you would've done it by 
                         now, so just ease up on the machismo, 
                         bitch. Now that we've got that sorted 
                         out, I'm gonna get some rest.

               Xander lays down on the bed. Slovo stares, burning with 
               hatred. He heads to the door.

                                     SLOVO
                         Be ready in three hours.

               Slovo exits. Ivans 1 & 2 stay, staring at Xander.

               EXT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT

               A fancy, flashy disco with an extreme sports theme. A big 
               bouncer in a leather coat works the door. This is a highclass, 
               expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous.

               Xander and Slovo walk up to the place. Xander's wearing a 
               Tshirt that says "RON JEREMY: AMERICAN LEGEND" complete with 
               a photo of the Hedgehog.

               INT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT

               A STRIPPER that looks like a runway model SLIDES across the 
               stage on SKATEBOARD KNEE-PADS while PATRONS cheer. The disco 
               is a combination STRIP-CLUB and CONCERT VENUE. All the 
               STRIPPERS are outfitted in HELMETS, ELBOW PADS, G-STRINGS 
               and BELLY SHIRTS.

               There's a WARPED TOUR BAND playing on a STAGE. On either 
               side of the stage are two MINI-HALF PIPES that the GIRLS are 
               cutting back and forth on.

               WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN sit in plush booths getting table dances 
               while the dance floor is packed with sexily dressed YOUNG 
               HIPSTERS.

               Xander gets a beer from a BUXOM COCKTAIL WAITRESS on IN-LINE 
               SKATES.

                                     XANDER
                         Nice hops.

                                     SLOVO
                         The corner. Anarchy 99.

               Slovo points them out in the far corner. They're surrounded 
               by straight faced BODYGUARDS.

               What ANARCHY 99 is doing in their booth with the STRIPPERS 
               looks like Led Zeppelin on tour. Booze, broads, good times... 
               These guys are living like rock stars.

               They're all here: Anders the biker, Viktor, Kirill. In the 
               middle sit Yorgi and Petra. Petra's wearing an "I AM EVIL" 
               Tshirt.

                                     SLOVO
                         See the one with the funny colored 
                         hair? Crazy bitch stabbed one of my 
                         men in the knee-cap. There they are, 
                         American. The low-rent millionaire 
                         criminals. And you thought only your 
                         country had white trash. American?

               He looks around but Xander is gone. He heads for the exit, 
               pushing his way through the crowd. But then he spots him, 
               not by the door but deeper in the club.

                                     SLOVO
                         Oh no!

               He sees Xander walk right up to the Anarchy 99 booth and 
               start talking to them.

                                     SLOVO
                         Jesus Christ!

               Slovo can't hear a thing, but they're obviously interested 
               in what he has to say. Next thing he knows Xander is pointing 
               at him and waving him over.

                                     SLOVO
                              (horrified)
                         What the hell...?

               Slovo makes his way through the crowd to the booth. Yorgi 
               looks him up and down.

                                     XANDER
                         That's the guy.

                                     YORGI
                         This pizda? Never seen him before.

                                     XANDER
                              (to Slovo)
                         Who you workin' for? What do you do 
                         for a living, dickhead?

                                     SLOVO
                         Uh... I am... I work in insurance.

               Xander grabs Slovo and starts searching him.

                                     SLOVO
                              (panicked whisper)
                         What the hell are you doing?

               He slams Slovo up against the wall and pulls out Slovo's 
               police badge.

                                     XANDER
                         Look what we have here. Czech 5-0 on 
                         the mack.

               The Bodyguards pull out guns and Slovo rushes for the 
               emergency exit in a panic. In seconds he's out and gone.

                                     YORGI
                         Cops. Like a plague. No matter how 
                         many you pay there's always another 
                         with his hand out. How did you pick 
                         him out?

                                     XANDER
                         He flashed his badge to half the bar 
                         when he bought his drink.

                                     YORGI
                         I appreciate you bringing this to 
                         our attention. Whatever you want, 
                         the rest of the night, consider it 
                         on the house.

               Yorgi waves over some strippers.

                                     XANDER
                         Thanks, but I'm here on business. I 
                         heard you're the G around here. I'm 
                         looking for some cars, expensive 
                         ones. A lot of them.

                                     YORGI
                         Sorry, man, don't know what you're 
                         talking about.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm talking about the sports cars 
                         that disappear off the docks in Genoa 
                         and wind up here. If you don't know 
                         about 'em, who does?

               Yorgi nods and the Bodyguards step in front of Xander.

                                     XANDER
                         I guess I heard wrong.

               Xander turns to leave.

               That's when Anders notices the "X" tattoo on the back of 
               Xander's head. He gets excited and alerts Yorgi.

                                     YORGI
                         Xander Cage!

               Xander turns. Suddenly their whole demeanor changes. All 
               five guys get up, awed, and push the Bodyguards out of the 
               way.

                                     ANDERS
                         The X man! We seen your bootleg 
                         videos!

                                     VIKTOR
                         You sick! You sick crazy on a board, 
                         on a bike! Everything!

                                     YORGI
                         This is insane, man. Xander Cage in 
                         Prague. Come on, sit. Sit with us.

               Yorgi signals for more drinks.

                                     YORGI
                         I remember that one where you jump 
                         the motorcycle over the freeway at 
                         rush hour.

                                     XANDER
                         When else are you gonna do it?

                                     VIKTOR
                         You almost died on that one.

                                     XANDER
                         Cops arrested me while I was still 
                         in surgery. Did two months.

                                     YORGI
                         We seen all your shit! So you want 
                         cars? We get whatever cars you need. 
                         What are you looking for?

                                     XANDER
                         Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end 
                         pasta rockets. Ten to start.

                                     ANDERS
                         Ten! No problem! We do that no 
                         problem!

               Petra elbows Anders.

                                     PETRA
                         Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're 
                         talking a lousy million five U.S.

                                     XANDER
                         I have Japanese buyers who are looking 
                         to move a fleet, if you have the 
                         quality of merchandise they're after. 
                         And it's a mil two, max.

               Petra glances at Yorgi who nods.

                                     PETRA
                         Do you know what a wire transfer is?

                                     XANDER
                         Is she for real? Honey, maybe you 
                         should quiet down and let the grownups 
                         have a conversation.

                                     PETRA
                         My goodness, a word with four 
                         syllables. I should get some ice 
                         before your brain gets too hot.

                                     XANDER
                         Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.

                                     PETRA
                              (smiles)
                         So cute. He shows up for a battle of 
                         wits with a mental butter knife.

               Xander looks to Yorgi.

                                     YORGI
                              (laughing)
                         Don't look at me, X, she handles all 
                         the details.

                                     XANDER
                         It'll work faster if I have an account 
                         number.

               Petra scrawls numbers on a cocktail napkin.

                                     PETRA
                         You'll have forty-eight hours to 
                         complete the transfer. Don't waste 
                         our time.

               Xander snatches the napkin.

                                     XANDER
                         Wouldn't dream of it. I'm even gonna 
                         throw in a few extra bucks to send 
                         you to charm school.

               Petra glares at him.

                                     YORGI
                         Alright, now that business is 
                         finished, we party! Bitches, come! 
                         We have a drink and toast the deal!

               Yorgi claps and a flock of strippers descends on the booth.

               Anarchy 99 lifts their glasses. Xander joins in the toast.

                                     XANDER
                         I believe I can hang with you fellas 
                         for a while.

               INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MORNING

               We see the FEET of AGENT POLK sprinting down the hallway.

               INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - MORNING

               Agent Polk looks around, spots Gibbons. He rushes to him, 
               waving a COMMUNIQUÉ.

               Gibbons grabs the communiqué, reads it. He looks up, stunned.

               INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY

               Xander is having coffee at his window when his communicator 
               RINGS.

                                     XANDER
                              (into phone)
                         I guess you got my E-mail. I set up 
                         a purchase. Ten cars.

               INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN INFORMATION ROOM

                                     GIBBONS
                         If you're trying to push my buttons, 
                         you're on the right track. Don't 
                         make me question my own judgment, X.

                                     XANDER
                         Buddy, you sent me here to get close 
                         to their organization, that costs 
                         money.

                                     GIBBONS
                         One point two million dollars? I did 
                         not authorize you to spend one point 
                         two million dollars!

                                     XANDER
                         I'm already on a first name basis 
                         with these dudes, I got a deal set 
                         up, you want me to hammer it or not?

                                     GIBBONS
                         We're not after car thieves here.

                                     XANDER
                         What the hell am I after? You're 
                         telling me dick.

                                     GIBBONS
                         That information is classified. You're 
                         there to gather information on their 
                         operations, period.

                                     XANDER
                         Call me crazy, but I thought hooking 
                         up a million dollar deal was a great 
                         way to get on their good side. What 
                         else? You gonna hassle me about the 
                         weapons and spy stuff too?

                                     GIBBONS
                         My friend, if you're planning on 
                         crossing me...

                                     XANDER
                         I know, poison needles in my shins. 
                         You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.

               Xander hangs up.

               INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - DAY

               Gibbons stands before Sam's desk. Sam scans over the 
               communiqué.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry 
                         Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this 
                         time.

                                     GIBBONS
                         I think we should send him whatever 
                         he wants.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         You what? A wire transfer of this 
                         size?

                                     GIBBONS
                         If it means getting Silent Night 
                         back, absolutely.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         You're talking about a very expensive 
                         risk here.

                                     GIBBONS
                         He's gotten closer in 24 hours than 
                         all of the other operatives combined. 
                         He got us an account number to boot. 
                         Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, 
                         I say we back his play.
                              (beat)
                         I put him out there, Sam. If he 
                         doesn't come up with the money, 
                         they'll kill him. I can't let that 
                         happen.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Why not? You were going to throw him 
                         in a tub full of acid, weren't you?

               Gibbons smiles.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Alright, do what you want. But keep 
                         the screws on him. He's a wild card. 
                         That could be either good or bad.

                                     GIBBONS
                         So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I 
                         can deal with that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY

               A HELICOPTER comes flying in, a MAN standing out on the strut. 
               He's a disgruntled GADGET WRANGLER from the NSA. His name is 
               TOBY LEE SHAVERS.

               Slovo and Xander watch from a distance as a series of METAL 
               CASES is unloaded by CZECH COPS. Slovo lets out a low whistle.

                                     SLOVO
                         Your government must know something 
                         we don't.

               Shavers walks up to them.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle-
                         trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent 
                         Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking 
                         for what's his name. Three X' s.

                                     XANDER
                         That's would be me.

               Shavers gives him a disapproving look.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Figures. You got someplace we can 
                         spread out my gear or what? I mean 
                         today.

               Slovo gestures towards the stairs and Shavers marches off, 
               muttering to himself.

                                     SLOVO
                         I'll leave you two alone to talk.

                                     XANDER
                         Yeah, thanks a lot.

               INT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - BASEMENT TRAINING AREA - DAY

               Down in the basement there is a SHOOTING RANGE along one 
               wall. A squad of CZECH COPS is BLASTING AWAY. They become 
               distracted by the noise in the middle of the room.

               One of the metal boxes has been dropped by a Cop. The rest 
               are spread out in front of Xander, Slovo and Shavers.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Back off, just go away you klutz. 
                         Alright, here's the story. The items 
                         in these cases belong to me. I 
                         designed them, built them, and was 
                         going to use them in the field myself 
                         until you showed up.

                                     XANDER
                         I stole your beat, huh? Guess you 
                         forgot to brown-nose the right people.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Is that supposed to be funny? I'm 
                         not laughing. I've worked for ten 
                         years to get my shot at being a field 
                         agent, funny boy. And ar the last 
                         minute I get bumped by you, some 
                         reject from the Ozzfest.

                                     XANDER
                         Why don't you show me some gear before 
                         you get hurt.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Listen to you. Right away, sir, 
                         anything you say, sir.

               Shavers pops open the first metal case. Inside are various 
               GADGETS laid into the molded carbon fiber lining.

                                     XANDER
                         What is all this? I didn't even order 
                         some of this stuff.

               Shavers holds up a small METAL BALL.

                                     SHAVERS
                         You're gonna need it, rookie, trust 
                         me.

               The metal ball unrolls into a six legged ROBOT INSECT.

                                     SHAVERS
                         An all-terrain mobile video monitoring 
                         system for surveillance. I call it 
                         the "Roach Cam". See the little camera 
                         it's got for a head?

               Xander picks it up.

                                     XANDER
                         Kinda looks like you.

               Shavers snatches it back. He puts on a METAL GLOVE, it's 
               fingers are SHARP TALONS.

                                     SHAVERS
                         "Terminator" climbing claws.

               He CLAMPS the claw onto the metal case. It holds fast.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Miniature power cams set in on 
                         contact, giving you a sure grip on 
                         any surface.

                                     XANDER
                         They come in any other styles or 
                         colors?

               He tosses the glove aside, pulls out a DART GUN.

                                     SHAVERS
                         This is your standard dart gun.

                                     XANDER
                         That one I'm real familiar with.

               Shavers displays a case of DARTS.

                                     SHAVERS
                         You've got your chromium knock-out 
                         dart, microphone listening dart, 
                         explosive dart, even one with a 
                         splatter blood packet, whatever you 
                         need. They also come in a special 
                         9mm casing for use with your service 
                         pistol.

               Xander pulls out some SUPER BINOCULARS.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Multi-view binoculars. Nine different 
                         enhanced vision modes, plus a digital 
                         camera.

               Xander looks through them, starts cycling through the 
               different modes.

               BINOCULAR P.O.V. - we see the various modes as Xander scans 
               the grounds.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Infrared, starlight... Even a special 
                         "penetrator" mode to see through 
                         walls, curtains, almost anything...

               Xander aims at the shooting range.

               BINOCULAR P.O.V. - we see through the clothes of the FEMALE 
               COPS on the shooting range. (PG-13 style, of course). We can 
               even see the INNER WORKINGS of their GUNS. One of the Female 
               Cops turns and gives Xander an approving look.

                                     XANDER
                         I think I'll hang on to these.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Think again, that's government 
                         property. You have to sign for 
                         everything. I've got one more that 
                         wasn't on your list.

               Shavers pulls out a JUMPSUIT.

                                     XANDER
                         From the Beastie Boys collection?

                                     SHAVERS
                         It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, 
                         water, recording gear, anything you 
                         need for covert spying. It's all-
                         weather, fire retardant, and if you 
                         give this buckle a sharp pull, the 
                         whole outfit deploys into a parachute.

                                     XANDER
                         You're joking, right?

               Shavers just gives him a deadpan look.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Now that I've given you the overview, 
                         we're going to spend the next couple 
                         hours going into extensive operational 
                         detail.

                                     XANDER
                         I thought that was in detail.

               As Shavers drones on, Xander hangs his head.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DAY

               The TEN BLACK MARKET EUROPEAN SPORTS CARS are loaded on two 
               TRANSPORT TRUCKS. Mafiya BODYGUARDS keep watch.

               The Ivans (in Teamster garb) inspect the cars while Xander 
               supervises. Anders hovers around him.

                                     ANDERS
                         So what you think? Beautiful!

               Sitting in an OFFICE watching are Yorgi, Kirill and Petra.

               Petra has a LAPTOP.

                                     YORGI
                         Has it arrived yet?

               Petra checks her computer. ON SCREEN she's monitoring their 
               BANK ACCOUNT.

                                     PETRA
                         Nothing. He had two days.

                                     YORGI
                         Perhaps he is not all he says he is.

               Outside the Ivans nod approval and Xander heads to the office. 
               Yorgi looks to kirill, who puts his hand on his PISTOL.

               Xander opens the door.

                                     XANDER
                         Very nice. I'm impressed.

                                     YORGI
                         I'm somewhat less so. We seem to 
                         have a bit of a problem...

               Just then Petra's computer BEEPS and the MONEY floods into 
               their account. Xander holds up a CELL PHONE and smiles.

                                     XANDER
                         I had to inspect the merchandise 
                         first.

                                     YORGI
                         Of course.

               He nods for Kirill to stand down.

               OUTSIDE - the two transport trucks are driven off by the 
               Ivans. As they pull out they reveal ANOTHER CAR under a COVER.

                                     XANDER
                         What's this?

                                     YORGI
                         This is a gift. From me to you.

               Anders pulls off the cover, revealing a cherry '72 PONTIAC 
               GTO.

                                     YORGI
                         It's a little nothing, you take it.

               Xander checks out his new ride. Yorgi gets in the passenger 
               seat.

                                     YORGI
                         Come on, get in.

               Xander sits behind the wheel and STARTS IT UP. The big engine 
               ROARS.

                                     XANDER
                         You're alright, Yorgi.

               Next door to the warehouse sits an ABANDONED BUILDING. Up on 
               the sloped roof, Slovo spies down on the transaction. He's 
               got a camera with a big zoom lens.

                                     SLOVO
                         Smile, bychara.

               Slovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured. To get 
               a better vantage, he JUMPS DOWN onto a lower part of the 
               roof.

               CRUNCH! His foot BREAKS THROUGH THE SHABBY ROOF TILE.

               Down below, Kirill hears the noise.

                                     KIRILL
                         Yorgi!

               They all look to the abandoned building.

               Through the second floor window they can see Slovo's leg 
               poking through the ceiling.

               Xander is taken aback.

                                     YORGI
                         What in the hell...?

               Yorgi turns to Xander, goes for his pistol.

               Thinking fast, Xander does the same.

               They draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each other's 
               heads as they sit in the car. Petra, Kirill and Anders draw 
               as well, all of them covering Xander.

                                     YORGI
                         What's going on, my friend?

                                     XANDER
                         You tell me! You got a sniper up 
                         there or what?

                                     YORGI
                         He's not with us, Xander. He must be 
                         with you.

                                     XANDER
                              (he cocks the hammer)
                         Bullshit! You get your boy off that 
                         roof or I swear to God I'm gonna 
                         give you another hole to breathe out 
                         of.

               Yorgi stares, finally believes him. He lowers his gun.

                                     YORGI
                         Get him! Find out who he is!

               By now Slovo is down the fire escape. He hits the ground and 
               goes running down the street.

               The Anarchy 99 crew heads for their cars. Xander SPINS the 
               cylinder on his REVOLVER.

                                     XANDER
                         I've got him. Buckle up.

               The GTO peels out.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Slovo is huffing and puffing as fast as he can when Xander 
               comes skidding around the corner. He looks back and sees the 
               speeding GTO.

                                     YORGI
                         That's the cop from the club!

               Xander does the only thing he can. He puts the car sideways 
               and aims out the window as he slides to a stop.

               Slovo turns and BLAM! Xander SHOOTS Slovo right in the chest.

               IN SLO-MO: a spray of BLOOD erupts from his chest and Slovo 
               falls backwards, his face frozen in a look of shock and 
               betrayal.

               The smoking shell clatters to the ground.

               Slovo blinks up at Xander, gasping for words, then lays still.

               Xander hops out, rifles through Slovo's pockets. The other 
               Anarchy 99 cars pull up, the whole group looking on.

                                     YORGI
                         What are you doing? Get in the car!

               Xander heads back to the GTO and the cars peel out.

               INT. GTO - MOVING - DAY

               The rest of Anarchy 99 follows behind the GTO.

                                     YORGI
                         I don't believe it! You can't shoot 
                         a cop in the middle of the street!

                                     XANDER
                              (grim)
                         Had to do what I had to do.

               He pulls out the roll of FILM. Yorgi laughs.

                                     YORGI
                         You say you get a million, you get 
                         the million. Some cop gives us shit, 
                         he's dead. Jesus Christ, man, you're 
                         hard-core!

               EXT. DEAD END STREET - DAY

               The Ivans pull up in their transport trucks. They see all 
               the blood and rush towards Slovo. But something doesn't look 
               right.

               Ivan 1 TASTES the blood and spits it out.

                                     IVAN 1
                         It's sweet.

               Ivan 2 pulls a CHROME DART from Slovo's chest. Slovo GROANS.

               INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               It's a crowded basement rave club. Hot and sweaty RAVERS 
               dance in provocative outfits. The Anarchy 99 group is standing 
               on the best booth, right on the packed dance floor.

               Surrounding them are a handful of MAFIYA BODYGUARDS who stand 
               at attention like the Secret Service.

               Anders swings from a water pipe and then drops onto the table, 
               smashing glass.

               A DRUNK GUY tries to pull Petra onto the dance floor and she 
               PUNCHES him. The Bodyguards drag the dude out for a proper 
               thrashing. Yorgi shatters a BOTTLE against the wall.

                                     YORGI
                         Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 
                         99!

                                     XANDER
                         What's "Anarchy 99"?

                                     YORGI
                         It's all this craziness! It's what 
                         we've been living since 99, when we 
                         left the Army. One of our brothers 
                         died in Grozny and we said the hell 
                         with this shit. What for? He dies 
                         for what? Politics? Who's politics? 
                         Not ours.

                                     XANDER
                         You wanna see my politics?

               Xander shows him a TATTOO on his arm. It shows PLANET EARTH 
               with a giant SCREW through it.

                                     XANDER
                         Screw the world. If I'm gonna die 
                         for something, it better be bitches 
                         and money.

                                     YORGI
                         That's what I'm talking about, man! 
                         That's why Anarchy 99 was born.

               Yorgi rolls up his sleeve, revealing an Anarchy 99 tat (a 
               circled "A" with "99" underneath).

                                     YORGI
                         To us it means no walls, no speed 
                         limits, no jails. It's everybody 
                         does what he wants. People think 
                         democracy is freedom but they don't 
                         have a clue. There's an old punk 
                         song. It says: "America stands for 
                         freedom, but if you think you're 
                         free..."

                                     XANDER
                         "...try walking into a deli and 
                         urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy 
                         Burger' by the Vandals.

                                     YORGI
                         You got it, man. It's stupid but 
                         it's true. True freedom is when you 
                         do whatever you want anytime you 
                         want. That's when you know you're 
                         living, man.

                                     XANDER
                         How you gonna do that with government 
                         and rules everywhere?

                                     YORGI
                         Easy. You get enough money that you 
                         grow an ass big enough for the whole 
                         world to kiss.

               Yorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor. The 
               Xed out ravers swat it around like confetti.

                                     YORGI
                         You hang with us, buddy, taste some 
                         freedom! Petra! Dance with this guy!

               Yorgi melts into the dance floor crowd, leaving Xander alone 
               with Petra. She gets up grumpily and starts dancing. Xander 
               joins her, but she won't even look at him.

                                     XANDER
                         This is great, dancing with the back 
                         of your head.

               She reluctantly turns around.

                                     XANDER
                         If you got a problem with me, why 
                         are we dancing?

                                     PETRA
                         Yorgi asked me to.

                                     XANDER
                         You do everything Yorgi says?

                                     PETRA
                         Go to hell.

                                     XANDER
                         It's gonna be like that, huh? You 
                         got all bent out of shape as soon as 
                         he started dancing with someone else. 
                         Why's that?

                                     PETRA
                         Mind your business.

                                     XANDER
                         Did you guys used to date? That's 
                         it, right? He broke your heart and 
                         you're still soft on him. That's 
                         funny, it don't seem to fit with a 
                         tough broad like you.

               She glares at him and walks away. Xander follows.

                                     XANDER
                         Where are you going?

                                     PETRA
                         Why are you still hanging around? 
                         Your business is finished, you should 
                         go home.

                                     XANDER
                         I was invited. What's your story?

                                     PETRA
                         I don't know who you are or where 
                         you come from, but I don't like you. 
                         You ask too many questions.

               There's a big line outside the "ladies" and no line at the 
               "men's". Petra heads into the Men's Room.

               Some DUDE whistles at her. She pushes him out of the way and 
               enters a stall. Xander leans on the sink.

                                     XANDER
                         Come on, don't front like that. You'll 
                         put a guy right off you.

                                     PETRA
                         Don't even bother, X man, I'm not 
                         your type.

                                     XANDER
                         That right? Why's that?

               The stall door flies open and Petra marches out.

                                     PETRA
                         My chest is too small and my brain 
                         is too big.

               She shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall.

               Xander walks back out, shaking his head and laughing.

               Across the room, Viktor shoves the D.J. out of the way and 
               puts on "ANARCHY BURGER" by the Vandals. The rave dance is 
               interrupted by the pounding punk beat.

                                     YORGI
                         Xander, check it out! The revolution 
                         begins!

               Viktor and Anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent 
               mosh pit. Xander can't help it, he actually likes these guys.

                                     YORGI
                         Let's get some air, man.

               Yorgi and Xander head outside. A moment later, Kirill hurries 
               out another door.

               EXT. PRAGUE RIVERFRONT - NIGHT

               It's late. Yorgi and Xander stroll along the river.

                                     XANDER
                         You got a great set-up here Yorgi. 
                         You really know how to live.

                                     YORGI
                         It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's 
                         been good to me.

                                     XANDER
                         I've been here before, when I was a 
                         kid. My old man was in the service, 
                         we used to live on the Army base in 
                         Hamburg.

                                     YORGI
                         You, an Army brat? I don't see that 
                         one at all. Did you join the service 
                         as well?

                                     XANDER
                         Hell no. My dad was a straight up 
                         tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this 
                         general off and got himself 
                         dishonorably discharged. Had a court 
                         martial and everything. The charges 
                         were total bullshit, so he was sure 
                         he'd get his name cleared, but it 
                         didn't happen.

                                     YORGI
                         Connections and politics, it's the 
                         same everywhere.

                                     XANDER
                         My old man, he bought into the system, 
                         and it screwed him. So he swallowed 
                         a bullet. Me, I don't believe in 
                         nothing I can't see and touch.

               The camera suddenly ZOOMS across the city, flying over streets 
               and houses until, half a mile away, it finds Kirill in a 
               window with his SNIPER RIFLE.

               P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is in the crosshairs.

               The scope pans over to Yorgi, who looks INTO CAMERA and gives 
               a small signal, calling off the hit.

               BACK ON YORGI AND XANDER

               Yorgi looks up at a "PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE" banner.

                                     YORGI
                         Next week these idiots are having a 
                         peace conference here. What the hell 
                         are they going to talk about? It's 
                         the system itself that causes all 
                         the world's problems. You're okay, 
                         buddy. Come on, it's getting early.

               They stroll off and Kirill stands down.

               EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - SUNRISE

               A flotilla of VEHICLES (Xander's GTO among them) drives 
               through the gate in a massive, stone wall. It's a big manor 
               house in the middle of town.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - PRAGUE - SUNRISE

               The GTO, sedans, SUV's park in the courtyard. Xander sees a 
               row of MOTORCYCLES parked here as well.

               Xander also sees a Guard hit a switch that LOWERS the HEAVY 
               WOODEN GATE.

               Yorgi corrals a bunch of STRIPPERS he's brought home.

                                     YORGI
                         This way, girls, let's go!

               He leads the whole troop inside.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - SUNRISE

               As they go down the hall/Xander sees ROOMS FULL OF OFFICE 
               WORKERS and MAFIYA GOONS.

                                     VIKTOR
                         Diversified global operations. The 
                         sun never sets on our empire.

               Xander takes in WORLD MAPS, FAX MACHINES, BANKS OF COMPUTERS.

               For all their screwing around, it's clear Anarchy 99 runs a 
               large operation.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - SUNRISE

               With leaded glass windows overlooking the river, this place 
               is beautiful. Inside it's done up more like the house from 
               MTV's "Real World", except trashed. There's cool fish tanks, 
               a pool table, PS2 on a flatscreen and spray paint and holes 
               all over the walls.

               SERVANTS welcome them with food and Yorgi's SECRETARY gives 
               him important messages.

                                     YORGI
                              (sorting through 
                              messages)
                         Not bad, yes? The original owners, 
                         they just one day decide to move 
                         out.

               Anders starts pounding on a drumset. Petra kicks a soccer 
               ball at him.

                                     PETRA
                         Yeb vas, z'opa. Shut up!

               Yorgi paws at a Stripper.

                                     YORGI
                         I've got meetings this afternoon, 
                         I've got to get some sleep. Just 
                         pick a girl.

                                     XANDER
                         That's alright, I'm kinda tired.

                                     YORGI
                         You want to insult me? This is my 
                         hospitality. Pick one.

               Xander points at one of the Strippers. She's wearing a 
               fashionable FLAK JACKET.

                                     YORGI
                         Good, now find a room to crash in.

               Petra, show him.

               The surly Petra opens a door, revealing a hall of doors.

               Xander and Flak Jacket follow.

                                     XANDER
                         You gonna tuck us in?

               She just gives him a nasty look, walks into her room and 
               slams the door. Xander scratches his head and picks a room.

               The others shuffle off to their beds with their Strippers.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - XANDER'S ROOM - SUNRISE

               Flak Jacket is out of sight in the bathroom. Xander talks to 
               her while he gets undressed.

                                     XANDER
                         Listen, no offense, but I'm not in 
                         the market right now, okay? You can 
                         stay here, but let's not --

               He trails off as she steps out of the bathroom. She's wearing 
               just a G-string and the flak jacket.

                                     XANDER
                         You don't understand a word I'm 
                         saying, do you?

               She just smiles at him sweetly and pulls his shirt off. She 
               looks at the ENGAGEMENT RING still pierced through his nipple 
               and gives a puzzled look.

                                     XANDER
                         Stupid, right? That's what I was 
                         trying to tell you. I just got out 
                         of this heavy thing...

               She kisses him and lets the flak jacket fall (PG-13 style).

                                     XANDER
                         The things I have to do for my 
                         country.

               He gives in and starts making out with her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - LATER THAT MORNING

               Xander sneaks out of his room and down the hail. Behind him, 
               we can see Flak Jacket asleep amongst the tussled sheets.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - MORNING

               Anders is snoring on the floor. Xander skirrs around him and 
               goes through another door.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY

               Xander finds an office and starts going through the desk. He 
               finds a PALM PILOT and snaps a RECORDING DEVICE to the bottom. 
               In seconds he's copied everything on it. He moves on to some 
               drawers.

                                     PETRA
                         What are you doing?

               He turns, sees Petra standing in the doorway with a GUN.

                                     XANDER
                         Looking for a phone book. I want to 
                         call a cab. Unless you wanna give me 
                         a ride?

               She shuts the door, advances, staring him down.

                                     PETRA
                         Who are you?

                                     XANDER
                         We hung out last night, remember?

                                     PETRA
                         I also remember you drove your car 
                         here. Who are you really? Make no 
                         mistake, I will shoot you and not 
                         feel bad about it. Who are you working 
                         for?

                                     XANDER
                         Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude 
                         trying to make a buck.

               She SLAPS him, hard.

                                     PETRA
                         Bullshit. I see you look at 
                         everything, study everything, ask 
                         questions. I know exactly what you're 
                         doing. Empty your pockets.

                                     XANDER
                         You've got to relax, baby, you're 
                         paranoid.

               She SLAPS him again and Xander goes for her gun. Before he 
               can pry it from her hand, she's pulled another gun from 
               nowhere and has it jammed against his neck. He lets go.

                                     XANDER
                         Hey, you're good.

                                     PETRA
                         Maybe we should start again, yes? I 
                         know so little about you, except 
                         that you're not what you say you 
                         are.

                                     XANDER
                         That makes two of us then, sweetheart, 
                         because I ain't buying your bullshit 
                         either. You're not like them, I can 
                         see it in your eyes. So you tell me, 
                         who's bullshitting who?

               INT. YORGI'S BEDROOM - DAY

               There are THREE STRIPPERS asleep in bed. Yorgi is sitting at 
               his COMPUTER in his underwear.

               He's hacked in to the CZECH POLICE network.

                                     YORGI
                         Something bothers me about you, Mr. 
                         Xander Cage...

               He looks around a bit, doesn't find what he's looking for.

               He sits up, getting pissed.

                                     YORGI
                         Get Kirill. Now!

               She heads out. Yorgi goes to the bathroom, splashes water on 
               his face.

               Kirill enters, still half asleep.

                                     KIRILL
                         What's the problem?

                                     YORGI
                         I'm inside the police mainframe. Do 
                         you see anything?

               Kirill studies the screen while Yorgi pulls on clothes.

                                     KIRILL
                         What?

                                     YORGI
                         I've searched their E-mail. No funeral 
                         announcement, no obituary, no call-
                         to-arms. Nothing on the news, even. 
                         I swear I saw a cop get shot 
                         yesterday. How come no one is talking 
                         about it?

               Kirill looks back at the screen. Nothing there.

                                     YORGI
                         I also check the wire transfer. I 
                         follow the money back to it's source, 
                         but there is no source. It comes 
                         from nowhere. First they bring CIA, 
                         then British SAS, now maybe they 
                         plumb the lower depths. Maybe now 
                         they send someone who looks like us. 
                         Maybe someone like our houseguest 
                         Mr. X.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY

               Petra still has the gun on Xander.

                                     PETRA
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     XANDER
                         The eyes don't lie. All this has 
                         gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You 
                         came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and 
                         you stayed because it was fun. Now 
                         you don't like it so much, but you're 
                         in so deep you can't get out anymore. 
                         Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.

                                     PETRA
                         Go to hell!

                                     XANDER
                         Look at you. You're helping run things 
                         now. You're a gangster. I bet that 
                         snuck up on you. You woke up one day 
                         and you were a criminal.

               She pulls back the hammer on her gun.

                                     XANDER
                         It's cool, I feel you. I might even 
                         be able to help. Here, let me show 
                         you something. You wanna see what's 
                         in my pocket, I'll show you.

               He makes a move and she jabs the gun at him. She reaches 
               into the pocket for him and pulls out his little data 
               recorder.

                                     PETRA
                         What are you?

                                     XANDER
                         I'm an information gatherer. You 
                         wanna go somewhere and talk about 
                         it?

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - DAY

               Yorgi creeps down the hall, Kirill in tow. They both screw 
               SILENCERS onto their PISTOLS.

               They flatten themselves up against the wall and prepare to 
               burst into Xander's room.

               One...

               Two...

               THREE! They kick in the door and aim their guns around.

               Flak Jacket sits up, terrified.

               Yorgi and Kirill lower their guns. Viktor stumbles by in his 
               underwear.

                                     YORGI
                         Where is he?

                                     VIKTOR
                         They went to breakfast.

               INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY

               This is a beautiful and historic Prague location with WINDOWS 
               and a nice view. It's rather fancy and PACKED with UPSCALE 
               PATRONS. Petra and Xander sit in the middle of the room, 
               sticking out badly in their grungy clothes.

               A WAITER takes their order.

                                     PETRA
                         Perogies, potato pancakes, fried 
                         goose livers, the sausage plate and 
                         a pot of Turkish coffee.

               Xander shakes his head.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm just gonna have a garden salad. 
                         Oil and balsamic vinegar on the side.

               The Waiter takes off. Petra puffs on a cigarette, staring at 
               Xander.

                                     PETRA
                         That's how you eat? It's like a 
                         gerbil.

                                     XANDER
                              (shrugs)
                         I'm from L.A.

                                     PETRA
                         So why don't you tell me something 
                         about who you gather information 
                         for. They obviously have very deep 
                         pockets. Are you from a rival clan?

                                     XANDER
                         Let's just say I'm freelancing and 
                         leave it at that.

                                     PETRA
                         Whoever sent you knew what they were 
                         doing. You and Yorgi are practically 
                         twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims 
                         who make a lot of noise but don't 
                         say much.

                                     XANDER
                         Don't judge a comic book by it's 
                         cover.

                                     PETRA
                         You agree with a lot of what he says, 
                         don't you.

                                     XANDER
                         I know where he's coming from. The 
                         only thing I really don't get is why 
                         he dumped you. Up until I found that 
                         out, I thought his judgment was pretty 
                         sound.

                                     PETRA
                         Don't even start. I'll be honest, I 
                         don't trust you. Bur lets pretend 
                         for a minute that what you say is 
                         true, that I want to leave. What can 
                         you do about it?

                                     XANDER
                         The people I know want facts, the 
                         kinds of things an insider would 
                         know. They're interested in putting 
                         Anarchy 99 out of business.

                                     PETRA
                         All I have to do is risk my life 
                         providing you with these facts.

                                     XANDER
                         We could work together. Then maybe 
                         we could both get the hell out of 
                         here. There's a beach in Bora Bora 
                         with my name on it.

                                     PETRA
                         A beach named X? That I'd like to 
                         see.

                                     XANDER
                         So there you have it. I guess you 
                         just have to ask yourself, how bad 
                         to you want out?

               She thinks on it. Then her cell phone RINGS.

                                     PETRA
                              (into phone)
                         Da!

                                     KIRILL (O.S.)
                              (on phone)
                         Listen very carefully, Petra. We 
                         think Cage may be an American agent, 
                         do you understand what I'm telling 
                         you?

                                     PETRA
                              (into phone)
                         Yes.

                                     KIRILL (O.S.)
                              (on phone)
                         Don't worry, I've got your back. I'm 
                         right across the street, above the 
                         bakery. Just bring him outside and 
                         let me do the rest.

               Kirill hangs up. She looks back at Xander, shell shocked.

                                     XANDER
                         What's up? Is there a problem?

               She studies his eyes, decides to risk it.

                                     PETRA
                         They tell me you're an American agent.

                                     XANDER
                         What are you talking about?

                                     PETRA
                         There's no more time for games. They 
                         made you. There's a sniper out front 
                         waiting to put a bullet in your eye. 
                         Tell me if it's true.

                                     XANDER
                         It's a long story, but yeah, more or 
                         less.

                                     PETRA
                         Jesus Christ. You're going to have 
                         to go out the back. The data that 
                         you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, 
                         at six o'clock. Look it up. We're 
                         taking a trip. Be there at six and 
                         you'll have plenty to tell your 
                         people.

                                     XANDER
                         If I go out the back, he'll know 
                         you've warned me.

                                     PETRA
                         That's alright, I'll figure something 
                         out.

                                     XANDER
                         Not an option. Just get up slowly 
                         like everything's cool. Petra, trust 
                         me. You just hung yourself out to 
                         dry for me, I'm not gonna let you 
                         down.

               EXT. BAKERY ROOF - DAY

               Kirill lays on his stomach, peering into the scope of his 
               SILENCED SNIPER RIFLE.

                P.O.V. Through scope - he can faintly see them inside the 
               crowded restaurant. Xander and Petra are making their way 
               towards the exit.

                                     KIRILL
                         Nice and easy, Petra...

               INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY

               They work their way through the lunchtime crowd.

                                     PETRA
                         I can't let this happen. I want you 
                         to go out the back. I'll make up 
                         some excuse.

                                     XANDER
                         They'll kill you, you know they will. 
                         Besides, there is no back door. Keep 
                         smiling. Ready? Now.

               EXT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY

               Xander's timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the 
               door, a BUS passes by.

               Kirill keeps focused, waiting for the bus to pass.

                P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is sporadically visible 
               through the bus windows.

               Kirill's finger tightens on the trigger...

               As soon as the bus passes he FIRES!

               But Xander's not there, he's ducked down to tie his shoe.

               CRASH! The glass door behind him shatters. Feigning surprise, 
               Xander PUNCHES PETRA IN THE FACE and sprints down the block.

               He runs bent low, the parked cars protecting him from the 
               sniper. Kirill fires anyway, taking out car windows.

               At the end of the block is a long staircase with a METAL 
               RAIL down the middle.

               As he runs by an outdoor restaurant Xander snatches the 
               SERVING TRAY from a startled WAITER, sending food and drink 
               flying.

               He hops on the serving tray like it's a skateboard and does 
               a RAIL-SLIDE down the length of the stairs. He's moving too 
               fast for Kirill.

               He jumps off at the bottom and the tray POPS UP INTO THE 
               AIR.

               Kirill BLASTS it like a clay pigeon.

               By now Xander is out of sight. Kirill pounds his rifle in 
               frustration.

               Petra gets to the top of the stairs. She gives Kirill a "Where 
               did he go?" look. Her nose is bloody, helping to sell her 
               performance.

               Then she turns and looks off after Xander. She sees his GTO 
               speeding away.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               EXT. NORWEGIAN FJORDS - LATE AFTERNOON

               We're looking down at a SHIP moving through the fjord, seen 
               from high above. It's towing a SMALLER BOAT behind it. An 
               airplane? No, we're at the top of the Trollveggen, Norway's 
               legendary "Troll Wall". It's a near 5,000 foot sheer drop to 
               the ocean.

               Six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff. They wear 
               webbed "squirrel" jumpsuits, helmets and parachutes. On each 
               thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced 
               MP-5 sub-machine guns. Together they stare down at the ship.

               Petra is among them. She looks down at her watch. It is 
               precisely 5:59PM. She glances around. The top of the cliff 
               is rocky and flat. Xander is nowhere to be seen.

               FIFTY YARDS AWAY - we see Xander sneaking forward military 
               style. He's got his "stakeout suit" on and is keeping low.

               HE CHECKS HIS WATCH: "6 PM"

               The members of Anarchy 99 put on their goggles and, without 
               saying a word, they leap off the Troll Wall.

               Xander runs to the edge and looks down. He sees the group 
               freefailing down the sheer cliff face.

                                     XANDER
                         Very nice.

               The six plummet away from him at incredible speed. In a hard 
               arch, they peak at 120 m.p.h.

               Then, using the webbed wings under their arms and between 
               their legs, they go into aerodynamic "track" positions and 
               rocket away from the wall.

               Like dark angels, they soar out over the water in formation.

               ON THE SHIP BELOW --

               The ship below is a scientific research vessel. On the deck, 
               a few SAILORS and SCIENTISTS watch the sun set.

               The six dark figures close in rapidly.

               At the last moment they pull their chutes and deftly glide 
               towards the ship.

               A sailor looks up and spots them.

               Before he can shout, he's SHOT IN THE LEG and goes down.

               Seconds later, they're on the deck, tearing off their rigs.

               They race across the deck, taking over the ship in a surgical 
               manner. They herd everyone back heading for the bridge.

               Petra hangs back. She looks back at the cliff, up towards 
               Xander.

               XANDER'S P.O.V.

               Through his SUPER BINOCULARS we see them storming the bridge.

               As they head inside, they disappear from view.

               Xander hits a button on the side of the binoculars.

                                     XANDER
                         Let's see what's going on inside...

               "PENETRATOR" P.O.V.

               Now he can see THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE SHIP.

               He sees THE CREW, herded into a room and LOCKED IN by Anarchy 
               99.

               INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               Anarchy 99 seals the door, locking the crew away. They slap 
               five and bump chests, still totally amped up.

               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               ANGLE ON - a LARGE SUBMERSIBLE VEHICLE. It's white and twelve 
               feet long. There are MOTORS on either side and a PANEL OF 
               SOLAR CELLS on the top of a periscope-like projection rising 
               from the back.

               This is the AHAB DEVICE. It sits in the WET WELL at the back 
               of the ship, ready to be launched out the back sea doors.

                                     YORGI
                         Ready the boat.

               There is a SMALLER BOAT moored to the back of the ship.

               Kirill and Viktor hop onto it's deck. They start to WHISTLE 
               as they work. Sounds like the "Andy Griffith" theme.

               XANDER'S BINOCULARS P.O.V.

               He takes DIGITAL PHOTOS of the Ahab device.

                                     XANDER
                         What the hell are you guys stealing?

               BACK ON THE SHIP

               The smaller boat is launched and ready to do. Yorgi goes to 
               the WET WELL CONTROLS and hits a switch.

               The aft doors open, letting water into the wet well. In 
               seconds Ahab starts to float. Anders loosens it from it's 
               moorings and they TIE AHAB TO THE BACK OF THE SMALLER BOAT.

                                     KIRILL
                         Ready.

               Yorgi hits another switch, opening the BALLAST DOORS on the 
               port side of the ship. Air flows out, causing the ship to 
               list to one side.

                                     PETRA
                         What are you doing?

                                     YORGI
                         It all happened so fast. Such an 
                         unfortunate accident.

               Yorgi MACHINE GUNS the wet well control panel.

                                     YORGI
                         Let's go.

               They climb onto the boat. Petra is the last to board. She 
               looks up towards Xander and MACHINE GUNS the panel some more, 
               making sure he notices.

               XANDER'S P.O.V.

               He sees the smaller boat pulling away, the Ahab device being 
               towed behind. He pans over and ZOOMS IN on the shot-up control 
               panel.

                                     XANDER
                         What the hell...?

               He pans over to the wet well and sees it's flooding.

               With the ballast open on only one side, the ship starts 
               LISTING. The thing is going down.

               He pans over, clicks into "penetrator" mode, and sees the 
               Crew pounding on the walls below decks. They're trapped, 
               their WRISTS AND ANKLES BOUND WITH PLEXI-CUFFS.

               EXT. TOP OF TROLL WALL - LATE AFTERNOON

               Xander puts down the binoculars and gets up.

                                     XANDER
                         No way, man, no way. I'm just supposed 
                         to be an observer. Aw shit. This job 
                         sucks.

               He pats his jumpsuit, checking for the buckle.

                                     XANDER
                         Toby Lee Shavers, if this thing don't 
                         work, your ass is kicked.

               Xander steels himself, takes a few deep breaths.

               Then he sprints to the edge and JUMPS off the cliff...

               And that's it. He's gone. One mile, straight down.

               Suddenly we're falling with him.

               We hear the rush of air as he free-falls a dozen feet from 
               the craggy rock face.

               The force of the wind ripples his cheeks.

               He streamlines himself into a track position and jets away 
               from the cliff like Superman.

               Before he gets too low, he RIPS THE BUCKLE.

               Immediately his jumpsuit TEARS OFF HIS BODY in MULTIPLE 
               LAYERS, unfurling into a full sized PARASAIL.

               Xander looks up at his parasail, relieved, and glides towards 
               the ship.

               EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON

               Petra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep Yorgi 
               from spotting it. She grabs him suddenly and KISSES him.

                                     YORGI
                         What was that for?

                                     PETRA
                         I'd forgotten how exciting it is 
                         working together.

                                     YORGI
                         You've been so quiet lately, Petra, 
                         I thought you no longer cared.

                                     PETRA
                         Why don't we go below decks and work 
                         off some of this adrenaline.

                                     YORGI
                              (smiles)
                         Viktor! Stay the course.

               Yorgi kisses her again and heads to the cabin below.

               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               Xander comes in for a perfect landing. He lands on the listing 
               deck and undoes his harness.

               He sees several WOUNDED scattered on the deck.

                                     XANDER
                         Son of a bitch!

               He looks across the water, sees the smaller boat far away.

               EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON

               Petra looks back one last time, catching sight of Xander on 
               the deck of the ship. She smiles, relieved.

               Then she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the 
               price.

               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               Xander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in.

               With the ship listing like this, the water is pouring below 
               decks.

               INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               Xander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold. Here 
               is where the entire Crew has been left to drown. They are 
               struggling to stay above water, their hands and feet bound.

               As the far end of the room is another HATCH. Water pours in 
               from this one and Xander has to get it shut.

               He swims through the struggling Crew, spots the CAPTAIN 
               holding his YOUNG SON above water. The water is rising 
               rapidly, filling up the compartment.

               Xander braces his feet against the bulkhead and PUSHES, but 
               the force of the water is too much.

               He surfaces. He's got to wait until the room floods before 
               he can close that door.

               He watches as the Crew goes into a panic, the water rising 
               up to the ceiling. They are gasping in the last foot of air 
               that's available. He sees the Captain's Son, crying and 
               clutching at his father.

               Xander takes a deep breath and dives down. He grabs the hatch 
               door, braces his feet and PULLS.

               His muscles strain as the heavy metal door slowly swings 
               SHUT.

               Xander surfaces and swims to the ladder. He CUTS the Captain's 
               plastic cuffs.

                                     XANDER
                         Is the boy alright?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yes. I will cut the others loose, 
                         you must run the bilge pumps!

               The Captain takes the knife and swims to free his men.

               Xander takes the Captain's Son and climbs up the ladder.

               EXT. SHIP'S BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Xander scans the controls but has no idea what he's looking 
               for. The Captain's Son shows him the right switch.

                                     XANDER
                         You sure?

               The Son nods and Xander flips the switch. MOTORS start to 
               HUM.

               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               The bilge pumps spew out water furiously. Crew members come 
               up from below decks. They are soaked and grateful. They go 
               about tending to the wounded as Xander slumps down next to 
               the exhausted Captain.

                                     XANDER
                         Captain, huh? You get a lot of broads 
                         with that uniform?

               They both laugh, relieved, as the ship slowly rights itself.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - THAT NIGHT

               Xander is in a room with the SCIENTISTS from the ship. They 
               have blueprints of the torpedo spread out. The Captain's Son 
               is wrapped in BLANKETS, shivering.

               Xander is talking to Gibbons on his communicator.

                                     XANDER
                              (into communicator)
                         They call it "Ahab", it's a solar 
                         powered submersible. It can 
                         circumnavigate the globe on it's 
                         own. They use it to track and study 
                         the migration patterns of whales.

               INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN THE ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM

               Gibbons jots down the information furiously.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about 
                         that?

                                     XANDER
                         Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's 
                         what I'm thinking. If they take out 
                         the cameras and sensors, they could 
                         probably put a bomb in this thing. 
                         You drop it in the water in the Red 
                         Sea and three weeks later it's 
                         swimming up the Potomac.

                                     GIBBONS
                         This is good work, X, damn fine work. 
                         You need to press on at all costs, 
                         find out what they have planned with 
                         this "Ahab".

                                     XANDER
                         Hey, one miracle at a time. They're 
                         on to me now, remember?

                                     GIBBONS
                         I'm gonna be en route with a team 
                         shortly to relieve you. Just keep 
                         the pressure on until the cavalry 
                         arrives. And X? You done yourself 
                         proud helping those people today.

               Xander tussles the hair of the Captain's Son.

                                     XANDER
                         Thanks.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You're a grungy little phoenix, you 
                         know that? Keep up the good work.

                                     XANDER
                         You ain't seen nothing yet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - DAY

               The GTO screeches into the lot. Shavers is on his way out 
               with his SUITCASE.

                                     XANDER
                         Get in. We've got work to do.

               INT. POLICE BUILDING BASEMENT - DAY

               PAN OVER WEAPONS - they're all laid out on the floor. 50 
               cal. MACHINE GUNS, MINES, ROCKETS, BELTS OF AMMO.

               We finally arrive at Xander leaning on his GTO. He sparks a 
               BLOWTORCH and lights a CIGAR.

                                     XANDER
                         I want all that...
                              (he pats the GTO)
                         In there.

               Shavers looks on in shock. He's got a crew of MECHANICS with 
               him. Xander hands him the blowtorch and walks away.

               EXT. PRAGUE OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY

               This is a beautiful open air market in a town square 
               surrounded by old buildings. The place is PACKED.

               In the midst of it all, we make out Petra moving through the 
               crowd. She stops to look at some vegetables when Xander passes 
               by her.

                                     XANDER
                         Right behind you.

               They keep talking, pretending to shop.

                                     XANDER
                         So what's the plan with this Ahab? 
                         Are they selling it or what?

                                     PETRA
                         No, something worse. He says it's a 
                         surprise, but I know him. This is 
                         his masterpiece.

                                     XANDER
                         We've got to find out what it is. 
                         Can you handle that?

                                     PETRA
                              (beat)
                         There's something I didn't have time 
                         to tell you before.

                                     XANDER
                         What's that?

                                     PETRA
                         I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been 
                         undercover for over a year.

                                     XANDER
                         You're what? What the hell have you 
                         been doing?

                                     PETRA
                         I don't know. Eight months ago I 
                         stop hearing from my people. No 
                         explanation, just silence. So I stay 
                         and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm 
                         in so far, they'd kill me if I left. 
                         Now every day I get farther and 
                         farther away from what I was. I'm 
                         like you said, a criminal.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, 
                         what the hell are you doing? Those 
                         people almost drowned on that boat 
                         and you didn't lift a finger.

               This stings her. She knows well the price she paid.

                                     PETRA
                         No, I guess I've been no help at all 
                         to you.

                                     XANDER
                         Get your head back in the game. There 
                         are lives at stake here.

                                     PETRA
                         Of course. I'll do what I can. I 
                         have to go, before they notice.

                                     XANDER
                         When can I see you again?

                                     PETRA
                         You can't, it's too risky. I'm not 
                         much help anyway, remember?

               Then she's off into the crowd.

               EXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - NIGHT

               The craggy surface of the wall is swathed in shadows. Xander 
               approaches and flattens himself against it. He's all in BLACK, 
               packed with weapons and sporting a COMBAT VEST.

               He grabs a toehold on the wall and ZOOM! He SPEED CLIMBS up 
               the side.

               He reaches the top in seconds and scopes out the manor house.

               VIDEO CAMERAS, PATROLLING GUARDS. It's not gonna be easy.

               Xander slips over the wall down to the courtyard below.

               EXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - NIGHT

               Xander places an EXPLOSIVE on a CONTROL BOX.

               He waits for a GUARD to stroll by and then slips through a 
               basement window.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - DARKENED ROOMS - NIGHT

               Xander makes his way through a series of rooms. Finally he 
               finds himself in a study with a window overlooking the 
               CAVERNOUS BASEMENT of the Manor.

               Laid out below he can see the AHAB DEVICE, hanging from 
               chains. TECHIES are working with the Anarchy 99 crew to 
               RETROFIT the thing.

               They are installing a LAUNCHER RACK of TEN TUBES.

               Xander can't hear a thing through the thick glass.

               He takes a METAL BALL from his pocket. There's a sink in the 
               corner and he drops the metal ball down the drain.

               INT. DRAIN PIPE

               We follow the metal ball as it rolls through the trap and 
               down into the wall. The pipe zigzags around like a 
               rollercoaster and then levels off.

               The ball rolls past a T-intersection, stops, and unrolls 
               like a pill bug.

               Six metal legs appear and we see it's the ROACH CAM. It 
               scuttles back up the pipe and makes the turn.

               INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

               We're close on a sink as the Roach Cam comes up the pipe. It 
               scurries into hiding just as a HAND reaches in to turn on 
               the water.

               The roach peers out from between items on a workbench and we 
               PUSH IN on it's VIDEO CAMERA head.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON - VIDEO MONITOR - ROACH CAM P.O.V.

               We see a handheld video image of Viktor.

                                     VIKTOR
                         Okay, fire one.

               Viktor pushes a button on Ahab and a VODKA BOTTLE launches 
               from tube one, SHATTERING against the ceiling.

                                     YORGI
                         Perfect!

               Pull back to reveal Xander watching the image on his 
               communicator. Using a joystick he's able to control the roach.

               He steers the camera towards Petra, gets a low-angle shot of 
               her legs in a punked-out CATHOLIC SCHOOL GIRL SKIRT.

               He smiles, enjoying himself.

                                     XANDER
                         Great piece of hardware.

               He plugs his earpiece in and listens in.

               INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

               Petra works on a COMPUTER CONTROLLER.

               The roach scurries across the floor, circling to get a better 
               look at Ahab.

               Anders pushes a CART holding TEN GLASS CANISTERS OF LIQUID.

               Each canister is separated in two, with a BLACK LIQUID on 
               top and a WHITE LIQUID on the bottom.

               He hands the canisters to Viktor one by one.

                                     ANDERS
                              (singing)
                         "Silent Night... Holy Night"

               Viktor laughs and joins in.

               Then Kirill looks down and SPOTS THE ROACH CAM.

               He STOMPS it with his boot.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

               Xander jerks out his earpiece and rubs his ear.

                                     XANDER
                         Damn.

               He looks down into the room, sees Kirill bending down to 
               examine the roach. Time to go.

               INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

               Kirill lifts the dead "roach" and sees its wires.

                                     KIRILL
                         There's some bullshit going on!

               Yorgi hits an ALARM switch, alerting the guards.

               The Anarchy boys grab weapons and start racing through the 
               house.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - VARIOUS - NIGHT

               The Anarchy boys move swiftly from room to room in practiced 
               close combat maneuvers.

               Cueing each other with hand signals, they run through each 
               room, weapons ready.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Xander sprints down the hallway. With the Anarchy 99 boys 
               and Guards roaming the house, he's having a hard time finding 
               his way out.

               INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

               He runs into a darkened dining hall, sprints across only to 
               find the opposite door locked. He hides behind one of the 
               many COLUMNS as his pursuers enter the room.

               Kirill gives a thumbs up and puts on a pair of NIGHT VISION 
               GOGGLES. He scans the big room but sees nothing.

               Xander, hidden at the opposite end, waits breathlessly.

               Kirill advances slowly, his buddies covering him from the 
               door.

                                     YORGI
                         Xander, my friend, that can only be 
                         you. Why don't we put our weapons 
                         down for a few minutes and discuss 
                         this like friends. How would you 
                         like to come to work for us instead? 
                         We could Rage Against the Machine 
                         together.

               Across the room, Xander sees a small window leading to the 
               courtyard. He has to run across open ground to reach it. He 
               calls out to Yorgi.

                                     XANDER
                         Speaking of people that are full of 
                         shit, funny you should mention those 
                         guys!

               Xander's voice echoes around the empty hall, making it 
               impossible to pinpoint.

                                     XANDER
                         They put their records out through 
                         Sony, one of the biggest corporate 
                         machines on the planet. Some 
                         revolutionaries, huh?

               He pulls out his gun as Kirill creeps ever closer.

               Against the far wall Xander spots a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

                                     YORGI
                         Come on, you're the one who's fooling 
                         yourself. Why risk your life for 
                         your government when we can offer 
                         you a future that is truly free?

               Kirill is almost on top of him.

               Xander sights up and FIRES.

               The fire extinguisher EXPLODES, blinding Kirill.

               Xander makes a run for it.

               Everyone FIRES WILDLY (except for Petra), bullets tearing 
               tapestries off the walls.

               Xander dives and crashes through the window.

               EXT. COURTYARD - SUNRISE

               Xander tuck and rolls, comes up running.

               Guards are running around, unsure just what the hell is going 
               on.

               Xander hops on one of the TRIALS MOTORCYCLES parked nearby 
               and fires up the engine. He hits a remote switch and BLAM!

               The EXPLOSIVE CHARGE he left earlier blows-up.

               He points the bike at a set of STONE STAIRS. They form a 
               "ramp" that he can use to JUMP THE WALL. He GUNS THE ENGINE.

               A Guard races across the wall with a rifle, taking aim.

               Xander races and JUMPS THE BIKE over the wail. As he goes by 
               he does a CAN-CAN AERIAL, KICKING THE GUARD OFF THE WALL 
               before he can shoot.

               The Anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go.

                                     YORGI
                         He blew the gate control. Anders! 
                         Get the bastard!

               Anders fires up the other trials bike, slings a submachine 
               gun across his back and goes up and over. Petra watches him 
               go, hoping for the best.

               EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAYBREAK

               (NOTE: action will be re-choreographed based on actual 
               locations. Any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated 
               by a physical reason)

               Xander blazes down the street, Anders racing right behind 
               him. A wrong turn sends him into a dead end.

               At the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall.

               Xander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of 
               the truck and onto it's roof. Balancing on the rear wheel, 
               he hops onto the wall.

               The machine gun blasts again. Xander drives off along the 
               top of the wall. Anders shoulders his gun and follows.

               They are riding a 15' high wall that's only a foot wide.

               They make several 90 degree turns, racing above a sleeping 
               neighborhood. Xander sees the end of the wall ahead and takes 
               a detour.

               He hops onto the second floor balcony of a BUILDING UNDER 
               CONSTRUCTION.

               INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MORNING

               CONSTRUCTION WORKERS bolt out of the way as the motorcycle 
               leaps into their building.

               Xander pops a wheelie and slams through a BLUEPRINT TABLE.

               Anders follows, demolishing their SNACK TABLE.

               Xander darts through the building, between beams and 2 x 
               4's, until he reaches a skeletal STAIRCASE.

               More WORKERS appear at the bottom of the stairs so Xander 
               goes up. He cranks up three flights of stairs and bashes 
               onto the roof.

               EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MORNING

               Xander looks around for a way out. The next building isn't 
               that far away. He revs up and JUMPS ACROSS.

               Anders jams another magazine into his sub-machine gun and 
               follows Xander.

               They jump from roof to roof, down a DESCENDING SERIES OF 
               ROOFTOPS towards the river. Anders pulls up alongside as 
               they race towards that last apartment building.

               Neck and neck they head for the brink. At the last jump, 
               Xander pulls up behind Anders.

               They hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel. Anders clamps 
               on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop, Xander right 
               behind him.

               They skid to a stop at the very edge, with Anders balanced 
               on his front wheel. He looks down, sees street five stories 
               below.

               He glances back at Xander, sweat beading, struggling to keep 
               his balance. Xander observes him coolly, totally in control.

               Anders reaches for his machine gun. Xander pops a wheelie 
               and RAMS Anders over the edge.

               The bike tumbles and PANCAKES into the pavement. Anders tears 
               through several AWNINGS before slamming into the ground.

               Xander turns and rides to the next apartment building.

               He hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually 
               take him to street level.

               As he makes his way down, Anders stirs. The guy is a bloody, 
               broken mess but he gets to his feet. He sees where Xander is 
               headed and he scurries off to intercept him.

               EXT. ALLEY - MORNING

               Xander is heading to the far end of a dead end alley. The 
               only way out is fenced in. But there's a RAMP leading up to 
               a LOADING DOCK. Xander will have to use that ramp to jump 
               the fence.

               Anders climbs to the second floor of the building. There is 
               a small crane arm loaded with metal. If he pushes it at the 
               right time, it will swing out and knock Xander from his bike.

               He giggles maniacally, blood dripping.

               Xander drops down into the alley and heads towards the jump.

               Anders times it perfectly and swings the crane arm out.

               IN SLOW MOTION: The bike leaves the ramp and soars up over 
               the fence.

               The crane arm swings out, on a collision course with Xander.

               Xander sees it and THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE BIKE, grabbing 
               onto the back in a SUPERMAN SEAT-GRAB. He passes RIGHT 
               UNDERNEATH the swinging crane arm.

               Anders's face falls when he sees Xander go by, hanging on 
               with ONE HAND. In his OTHER HAND Xander's got his PISTOL.

               BLAP!

               Xander pulls himself back onto the bike and lands. He stops, 
               sees Anders' BLOODY HELMET come bouncing into the alley. He 
               tucks his pistol away and roars off.

               INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY

               Xander comes up the stairs and sees LIGHTS ON in his 
               apartment. He draws his gun and pushes the door open.

                                     XANDER
                         Slovo?

               Slovo is sitting in the armchair.

                                     XANDER
                         Dude, what are you doing here?

                                     SLOVO
                         You killed me, remember? Now I have 
                         to hide out here with you. Where 
                         have you been?

               Xander holsters his gun, searches around for his communicator.

                                     XANDER
                         I found something big enough for us 
                         to take these guys down with. They've 
                         got a of nerve agent they're gonna 
                         unleash.

                                     SLOVO
                         Is this what you're looking for?

               Xander turns to see Slovo waving the communicator.

                                     XANDER
                         Yeah, give it here.

               Slovo raises his pistol.

                                     SLOVO
                         Sorry, "dude".

                                     XANDER
                              (stunned beat)
                         What's the deal?

                                     SLOVO
                         Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got 
                         played, so what? You're new at this. 
                         Did you think you could just stroll 
                         into this business one day and have 
                         all the angles figured out?

                                     XANDER
                         Why you dogging me up?

                                     SLOVO
                              (shrugs)
                         They came and found me. They said 
                         they'd kill me unless I help them. 
                         Plus they offer me a lot of money. 
                         No big deal. These things happen. 
                         Dump your gun on the floor.

               Xander does so.

                                     SLOVO
                         Where do you want it? The head to be 
                         quick? Or the chest for an open 
                         casket?

               Suddenly GUNFIRE blasts through the closed door.

               Bullets shatter a LAMP, a PICTURE, and finally tag Slovo in 
               a wild salvo.

               Slovo crumples, never knowing what hit him.

               The door creaks open. It's Petra, her gun still smoking.

               She's with the Ivans.

                                     PETRA
                         Are you alright?

                                     XANDER
                         What the hell are you doing? You 
                         could've killed me!

                                     PETRA
                              (shrugs)
                         I heard you talking. I could tell 
                         where you were in the room.

                                     XANDER
                         I don't know what's going on anymore. 
                         I thought I was square with that 
                         dude. Now everybody's switching sides 
                         like it's the WWF.

               The Ivans go to Slovo's body, kicking the gun from his hands.

               One of them SPITS on his corpse in disgust.

                                     XANDER
                         What are you doing with the Ivans?

                                     PETRA
                         I know which cops are good and which 
                         are bad. Come with me. Come on, right 
                         now.

               She drags him to the door.

               EXT. ST. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY

               The beautiful and historic St. Charles bridge spans the river. 
               There are BANNERS hanging in celebration of the coming PRAGUE 
               PEACE CONFERENCE. Petra leads Xander across it.

                                     XANDER
                         Where are we going?

                                     PETRA
                         We're getting out of this place. 
                         We've done enough.

                                     XANDER
                         Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go 
                         now. What's Yorgi got planned with 
                         that nerve agent?

                                     PETRA
                         It doesn't matter anymore, forget 
                         it.

                                     XANDER
                         Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!

                                     PETRA
                         What do we owe our governments? Yours 
                         kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.

                                     XANDER
                         Petra, this ain't about the people 
                         that sent us here, you know that.

                                     PETRA
                         No, now it's about us. Let's do 
                         something for us before we both get 
                         killed. Don't you want to get to 
                         Bora Bora, Xander?

                                     XANDER
                         We can't leave now. We have to do 
                         something.

                                     PETRA
                         Why? You're the one who believes in 
                         nothing. Screw the world, or whatever 
                         you said.

               Xander grabs her by shoulders.

                                     XANDER
                         Alright, so I was full of shit. I 
                         thought believing in things was wrong. 
                         Turns out believing in nothing is 
                         worse. You might as well be dead. 
                         I'm not thrilled with the world, but 
                         I'm not gonna let those idiots start 
                         killing people. Come on, you're a 
                         cop, we've got to get these guys.

               He's gotten through to her. She nods in agreement.

                                     PETRA
                         They left. To a fortress in the 
                         mountains.

                                     XANDER
                         We'll have to go after them.

                                     PETRA
                         Aren't you afraid?

                                     XANDER
                         A long time ago I learned how to put 
                         fear away in a little place in my 
                         head. Maybe that's my problem. If 
                         you don't feel fear you can do some 
                         amazing things, but you can also 
                         screw your life up in ways you can't 
                         imagine.

                                     PETRA
                         I must be healthy, then, because I'm 
                         scared to death. I guess I'd better 
                         get back to Yorgi.

                                     XANDER
                         You don't have to do that.

                                     PETRA
                         Yes, I do. You're right. I can't 
                         just let him go free. Besides, I can 
                         help you from the inside.

                                     XANDER
                         Aren't they gonna wonder were you've 
                         been?

                                     PETRA
                              (shrugs)
                         I was supposed to wait for the cop 
                         to kill you and then kill the cop. 
                         They'll believe me.
                              (beat)
                         I've been lying for so long, one 
                         more time won't hurt.

                                     XANDER
                         When this is over, we're just gonna 
                         take off, the two of us. Take a 
                         vacation.

                                     PETRA
                         What the hell are we doing? We're 
                         doing all this together, trusting 
                         each other, making plans, and we 
                         haven't even slept together yet.

               Xander kisses her.

                                     XANDER
                         That gives us something to live for.

               Together they walk back across the bridge. We crane up, 
               revealing the PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE banners all over a big 
               BUILDING on the river.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

               We see a craggy, gnarly mountain. The front side is a rock 
               strewn, near vertical drop.

               Then we see Xander come scaling up from the back side. He's 
               got GEAR strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a 
               helluva climb.

               Xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath. It's 
               beautiful up here.

               He pulls a COLLAPSIBLE SNOWBOARD off his back, hits a switch 
               and the thing SWITCHBLADES OUT to full size. He clamps it on 
               his feet.

               Xander moves to the edge and peers down. At the bottom of 
               the mountain he can see the CASTLE, an imposing medieval 
               fortress in the snow. He leans over the edge and starts down 
               the mountain. He doesn't get far before he notices something 
               else. He slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging 
               to rocks for balance.

               On the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a 
               GUARD OUTPOST. Right now he's in full view and he's been 
               spotted. He sees GUARDS scrambling out, hopping on 
               SNOWMOBILES. From up here they look like ants.

               EXT. GUARD OUTPOST - DAY

               Viktor, the goateed cold weather warrior, strides out of the 
               Outpost and looks up the mountain. He shouts orders to his 
               men.

               A Guard runs up and brings him his weapon: A FLAME-THROWER.

               Viktor straps it on and. climbs onto his SNOWMOBILE.

               All around him the Guards are driving into position. They 
               form a gauntlet of AK-47's. There must be a DOZEN of them.

               Viktor rides up twenty yards and waits, his engine idling.

                                     VIKTOR
                         Hold positions!

               He squints up at the speck that is Xander.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

               Xander pulls a CONCUSSION GRENADE from his jacket.

                                     XANDER
                         Nothing like fresh powder.

               He puts his goggles on and pulls the pin from the grenade.

               Then he TOSSES IT OVER HIS SHOULDER.

               The grenade lands in the snow above him and starts ROLLING 
               DOWNHILL TOWARDS HIM. Xander pushes off and starts bombing 
               down the mountain.

               The grenade bounces after him and then WHAM! It goes up with 
               a tremendous shock.

               There is a SHIFT in the snow, a GROAN of shifting weight, 
               then the ENTIRE CORNICE cracks loose and topples over the 
               brink.

               Xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at 
               his heels.

               From down below it's an awesome sight. The slack-jawed Guards 
               watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them.

               Shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer, they 
               can see Xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face.

               There's a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles and 
               ride for their lives. A furious Viktor spins around and makes 
               a run for it as well.

               Nobody has a chance. The avalanche is coming like a freight 
               train, frothing like white water.

               Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hits a 
               JUMP. He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof 
               of the Outpost.

               The avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everything 
               and everyone in its way.

               Guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbling 
               under the onslaught.

               Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over 
               the Outpost. He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a 
               stop.

               Then it's all quiet.

               Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble. There's 
               nothing moving up there anymore. Xander pulls himself free.

               Then he hears a gushing sound and a DEEP BENEATH THE SURFACE, 
               he sees the WARM ORANGE GLOW OF FLAME. It's Viktor and his 
               flame thrower. There's another SPURT and the glow fades for 
               good.

               Xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath. He's 
               right above the Castle now. Then his communicator starts to 
               BEEP.

                                     XANDER
                              (into communicator)
                         Gibbons, long time no talk. You 
                         wouldn't believe my day.

               INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS ON THE PRIVATE JET WITH A TEAM OF 
               AGENTS.

                                     GIBBONS
                         What the hell has been going on, 
                         Triple X? How about a status report?

               Xander looks down on the Castle. There seem to be MAFIYA 
               HENCHMEN all over the grounds.

                                     XANDER
                         Snow covered fortress. Army of bad 
                         guys. The usual.

                                     GIBBONS
                         I'm on the way with a team to relieve 
                         you. What's the latest?

                                     XANDER
                         They retrofitted Ahab with some kind 
                         of rocket launcher. They were loading 
                         canisters of liquid into it, light 
                         colored and dark colored in the same 
                         tube but separate. Something tells 
                         me this it that "classified" stuff 
                         you didn't want me to know about. 
                         Does the song "Silent Night" mean 
                         anything to you?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Yes it does.

                                     XANDER
                         Come on, Gibbons, you can do better 
                         then that.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Silent Night is the name of a top 
                         secret binary nerve agent. The glass 
                         canister is shot into the air and 
                         detonated. The black and white 
                         chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. 
                         When it settles down to Earth, it'll 
                         kill everything in the vicinity.

                                     XANDER
                         Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is 
                         something we came up with?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Yeah, that's right. So now that you 
                         know, you understand why it's 
                         important that we get it back.

                                     XANDER
                         Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're 
                         not supposed to be making weapons 
                         like that anyway. Guess we shoulda 
                         played by the rules.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Somebody else makes those decisions, 
                         not guys like you and me. You've 
                         done your job, X, head back to Prague. 
                         I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This 
                         is my operation now.

                                     XANDER
                         We don't have that kinda time, boss, 
                         I don't think Prague's gonna be around 
                         much longer. I've gotta go now. I've 
                         got a lot of bad guys to kill.

               Xander hangs up and heads down the hill.

               EXT. CASTLE - DAY

               A GUARD patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle. He 
               stops for a smoke when Xander walks right up to him.

               WHACK! With two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps 
               walking. He's a man on a mission.

               He runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall. There's 
               no hand-holds, it's, a perfectly flat climb. A canyon of 
               ROCKS is below.

               Xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the "TERMINATOR" 
               CLIMBING CLAWS. He pulls on the metal gloves and CLAWS into 
               the solid rock.

               Just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface.

               We see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making 
               this impossible climb.

               At the top is an overhang. It's a gnarly transition. As he's 
               rounding it, his FEET SLIP. His legs dangle over the rocky 
               chasm below.

               Using all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the 
               way with his climbing claws.

               At the top a GUARD leans over, aiming his gun at him. Xander 
               grabs him and pulls him over the edge.

               The Guard FALLS into the chasm.

               Xander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted. Then another GUARD 
               rushes him, grabbing for his rifle.

               Xander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun 
               from his hands. With the other hand he SLASHES, taking the 
               Guard down.

               He pulls off the claws and heads into the Guard Tower.

               INT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

               Xander exits the Guard Tower at the ground level.

               As he crosses the courtyard an EXPLOSION rocks the tower he 
               just left.

               There is shouting as GUARDS race around the parapets, unsure 
               where the attack is coming from. A GUARD runs up to Xander.

                                     GUARD
                              (in Russian)
                         What's going on?

               Xander CLOTHESLINES him and catches his AK-47 as he drops.

               Up inside the castle he can see Yorgi at a window. Yorgi 
               appears mildly shocked as they make EYE CONTACT.

               Xander takes aim.

               POV ON XANDER THRU SNIPER SCOPE

               From up above, Kirill has Xander in his sights.

               BLAW! The bullet hits Xander's AK, sending it spinning.

               Xander rubs his sore hand but stays put. Kirill could have 
               killed him and he knows it. From a doorway comes Yorgi with 
               some Guards.

               Yorgi walks up and SMASHES Xander in the face.

                                     YORGI
                         That was for Anders.

                                     XANDER
                         Don't forget goatee boy. I greased 
                         him up on the diamond run.

               Yorgi punches him again.

               INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

               Petra sits at a desk working on a LAPTOP. Yorgi enters with 
               Xander and Kirill.

                                     YORGI
                         Look who we found playing outside.

               Petra looks up. She can barely hide her shock.

                                     YORGI
                         Petra, my sweet dove, do you notice 
                         anything strange about X? He looks 
                         slightly less than dead.

               Kirill aims his gun at Petra.

                                     PETRA
                         Yorgi, I thought he was --

               Yorgi SLAPS her.

                                     YORGI
                         Do you think I didn't know about you 
                         all along? My contacts in the KGB 
                         told me you were coming. You show up 
                         undercover and, I must admit, you 
                         play your part to the hilt. When 
                         it's time to be cruel, you are cruel. 
                         When it's time to be passionate, you 
                         are very very passionate indeed.

               Petra is devastated by this revelation.

                                     YORGI
                         I could have killed you, but I thought 
                         this would be so much more fun. To 
                         twist you and use you how I see fit. 
                         And to be honest, you went much 
                         farther than I ever expected you 
                         would for your country.

               He runs this fingers through her hair and moves on to Xander.

                                     YORGI
                         And you. Why do you have such a 
                         problem staying away, my friend? Did 
                         you miss us that much?

                                     XANDER
                         I wanted to get the hell out of Prague 
                         before Silent Night falls.

                                     YORGI
                         Not bad, man, not bad. You put things 
                         together quick. Prague it is.

                                     PETRA
                         The Peace conference...

                                     YORGI
                         Nice place to start, don't you think?

                                     XANDER
                         What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's 
                         the part I don't get. You gonna hold 
                         the world hostage with your gas bombs? 
                         I didn't think you were dumb enough 
                         to go with that hack cliche.

                                     YORGI
                         You think I'm after money? I told 
                         you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a 
                         change. Money is good, but for true 
                         freedom you have to get rid of the 
                         rules themselves.

                                     XANDER
                         So all by yourself, you're going to 
                         destroy every government; in the 
                         world.

                                     YORGI
                         Easier than that, buddy. I'll get 
                         them to destroy each other. You kill 
                         an entire Peace conference, someone 
                         is going to have to pay. Then our 
                         friend Ahab continues down the river 
                         to the ocean and begins his world 
                         tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty 
                         soon everyone's involved. These guys 
                         bomb those guys, those guys invade 
                         these guys. Soon the whole world is 
                         like your wild West cowboy days. No 
                         rules, no law, everybody free to do 
                         what they want.

                                     XANDER
                         Including rape, pillage, murder.

                                     YORGI
                         Sure, if that's what you want. Why 
                         not? It's all human nature. So we 
                         just have to launch our baby and 
                         wait for the decline and fall of 
                         civilization as we know it.

                                     XANDER
                         And here I thought "anarchy" was 
                         just something cool to put on a 
                         Tshirt.

                                     YORGI
                         Come on, Xander. You used to stand 
                         for something. What happened to you, 
                         man? I thought you'd get it.

                                     PETRA
                         Don't you see, X? For the betterment 
                         of humanity, he's going to start 
                         World War Three.

                                     XANDER
                         He's a regular humanitarian. And all 
                         this time I thought he was just a 
                         tool.

                                     YORGI
                         You both could have been a part of 
                         it. You could have ridden with us 
                         into a new day, the dawning of a new 
                         age of --

                                     XANDER
                         Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry 
                         I asked.

               Yorgi's eye twitches.

                                     YORGI
                         Screw you too, buddy.

               He raises his gun and suddenly BOOOOOM! A massive explosion 
               rocks the whole castle. Shrapnel shatters the windows, 
               spraying glass, and Yorgi's shot goes wide.

               EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

               The front gates have just been blown apart. Through the smoke 
               and wreckage come Ivans 1 & 2 with a PLATOON OF CRACK CZECH 
               SECRET POLICE. Their submachine guns rattle in threeshot 
               bursts, sweeping Guards from the parapets.

               INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

               Kirill looks down at the carnage below. Xander takes advantage 
               of the distraction and charges at Yorgi.

               Yorgi goes to shoot but his hand won't work. There's a HUGE 
               SHARD OF GLASS sticking through his forearm.

               By the time he pulls it out, Xander is on top of him. He 
               body checks Yorgi, sending him flying over a desk. Kirill 
               spins and starts FIRING. Xander ducks for cover.

               EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

               The Czech Secret Police are having their way. They cross the 
               courtyard and burst into the main building.

               INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

               The Police whip through the building like lightening, mowing 
               down everyone in their path.

               One Czech Secret Policeman is wounded and the others retaliate 
               with a volley of RPG's that evaporates a pocket of resistance.

               In the main room upstairs, Kirill is blasting away. Yorgi 
               starts rounding up the computer gear.

                                     YORGI
                         Hurry up, kill him!

               Before Kirill can do so, Cops burst into the room, spraying 
               bullets everywhere.

               Xander and Petra are pinned down, but Yorgi and Kirill manage 
               to make a fast exit out another door.

                                     XANDER
                         Hey! We're on your side!

               The Cops keep shooting.

               EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

               Ivan 1 is talking on the radio when Yorgi appears behind him 
               and shoots him in the back.

               They step over him and enter a GARAGE.

               INT. CASTLE - GARAGE - DAY

               The Ahab device is in the back of a flatbed TRUCK. Yorgi and 
               Kirill start up the truck and jam it into gear.

               EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

               The truck smashes through the garage doors and rumbles across 
               the courtyard.

               Police open fire, but the truck tears out the gate and starts 
               heading down the mountain.

               INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

               Meanwhile, Xander and Petra are still pinned down.

                                     XANDER
                         Petra! Tell them something!

               Petra starts calling out in RUSSIAN. Finally the cops stop 
               shooting.

               EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

               Xander and Petra are brought outside. They see the Police 
               working on the wounded Ivan 1. Ivan 2 walks up.

                                     XANDER
                         How's Ivan?

                                     IVAN 2
                         He is okay.

                                     XANDER
                         Thanks for coming, man, you guys 
                         were right on time.

                                     IVAN 2
                         We are always on time. Two have 
                         escaped, in truck.

                                     PETRA
                         Yorgi and Kirill.

                                     XANDER
                         Let me guess, they had a big white 
                         torpedo with them.

                                     IVAN 2
                         Yes. Your friend, the angry one, he 
                         send something for you.

               EXT. CASTLE - DAY

               A big truck pulls to a stop. Its ramp lowers and Xander's 
               blown-out '72 GTO comes rolling out.

                                     IVAN 2
                         We'll be right behind you.

               Xander and Petra both strap on grenades and pistols.

                                     XANDER
                         Did you do your homework?

                                     PETRA
                              (nods)
                         If they launch it, I know how to 
                         bring it back.

                                     XANDER
                         Let's do this.

               They both climb in and the GTO peels out.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

               Xander drives all out, trying hard to catch up.

               He passes several of Ivan's Police Jeeps at a furious clip.

               Up ahead they see the truck winding it's way down the 
               mountain.

                                     XANDER
                         Where's he headed?

                                     PETRA
                         He owns a big industrial complex on 
                         the river. He'll launch it from there.

               Xander floors it.

               Up ahead, in the flatbed truck, Yorgi drives. He can see the 
               GTO gaining on them.

                                     YORGI
                              (in Russian, subtitled)
                         They're coming! Get back there.

               Kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab. He 
               lays down, resting the rifle on the Ahab container.

               As the GTO comes into view, he sights up and FIRES, WHACK! 
               The first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows 
               the headrest off Xander's seat.

                                     XANDER
                         You get down! I'll take care of this 
                         fool!

               He pulls out an Mp-5 out and hangs it out the window.

                                     PETRA
                         No! Don't shoot! He's hiding behind 
                         the nerve agent!

               Another shot blasts through, taking off the rear-view mirror.

                                     XANDER
                         Goddamit! He's gonna stop playing 
                         around soon and shoot something 
                         valuable!

               Kirill laughs and takes aim once again. He puts Petra in the 
               sights.

               Xander jerks the steering wheel and BLAM! the shot goes wide.

               The GTO veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain.

               Xander fights for control as they slide around the turns.

               The road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex 
               up ahead. They cut across a field, heading right for it.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY

               The truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex.

               Quickly the gates are closed again. Armed GUARDS can be seen 
               up above.

               The GTO comes at the gates at full speed.

                                     XANDER
                         Let's see what my man put together.

               Xander opens a DASH PANEL, revealing a ROW OF SWITCHES. He 
               flips one.

               The HEADLIGHTS EJECT, revealing a MINI-GUN IN EACH FENDER.

               BRRRAAAAAAPPP!! The mini-guns spin.

               The metal doors are getting SHREDDED.

               Empty SHELLS spill down the sides of the GTO.

               The metal doors come apart, falling in chunks.

               The GTO slams through the wreckage without slowing down.

               A Guard comes tumbling down and BOUNCES off the trunk as the 
               GTO zips inside.

               EXT. INSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY

               The Anarchy 99 guys seem to have a whole other army in here.

               Guards spill onto the road, shooting at them from everywhere.

               A BELLY PANEL on the GTO opens and ping-pong ball sized 
               MINIBOMBS dump onto the road. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The bombs 
               send the Guards scattering.

               The GTO sizzles away.

                                     XANDER
                         Where'd the damn truck go?!

                                     PETRA
                         Go to the water, it's that way!

               A tactical (a pick-up with a .50 cal machine gun attached) 
               pulls up behind them and opens fire.

                                     XANDER
                         Toadies right behind.

                                     PETRA
                         Let me.

               Petra punches another button.

               The REAR HUBCAPS pop off. They roll along the road on their 
               own. Inside they seem to be LINED WITH SPIKES.

               As the Tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they BLOW 
               UP, SPRAYING SPIKES at both sides of the Tactical.

               All four wheels BLOW OUT and the Tactical goes out of control.

               It crashes through a fence and pitches into the water, the 
               men going sprawling.

                                     PETRA
                         Fantastic options.

               At the riverbank Yorgi and Kirill pull Ahab off the truck 
               and prepare for launching.

               They remove it from it's box and carry it waist deep into 
               the water. Yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on Ahab's 
               insides.

                                     YORGI
                         I've got it, go! Cover me!

               Kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off.

               He climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building 
               on a WHARF. From here he can shoot and NOT BE SEEN. He takes 
               his LIT CIGARETTE and tucks it behind his ear.

               When the GTO rounds the corner he FIRES.

               The bullet goes through the window and SLAMS into the steering 
               column.

               Xander jams it into reverse. They retreat behind a building.

               Petra clutches her arm, wounded.

                                     XANDER
                         You okay?

                                     PETRA
                         A piece of shrapnel hit me.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop 
                         playing nice.

               Kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make 
               their second approach. The GTO comes roaring out, spinning 
               in circles wildly. Xander's is just doing donuts as fast as 
               he can.

               Kirill aims, but with all the dust being kicked up he doesn't 
               have much of a target.

                                     KIRILL
                         What are you doing!

               He doesn't notice Petra pop up from behind a fence with a 
               HEAT SEEKING MISSILE LAUNCHER.

               ANGLE ON - the missile launcher's COMPUTER SCREEN. The green 
               display shows a faint red glow in the upstairs window. Its 
               the GLOWING POINT of Kirill's lit cigarette.

               The Launcher BEEPS as it locks in and she FIRES.

               Kirill looks up to see the missile blazing down the wharf at 
               him.

               He gets it immediately. In a panic he fumbles for the 
               cigarette...

               Too late. The missile zeroes in on his head.

               WHOOOSH! The entire wooden shack blows apart.

               Xander walks up to Petra.

                                     XANDER
                         I guess the surgeon general was right.

               ANGLE ON - Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and let's it go. The 
               electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the river.

               Xander and Petra run to the water's edge in time to see Yorgi 
               escaping in a MOTORBOAT. In the opposite direction they see 
               the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards it's destination.

               Petra finds the CONTROLLER in the cab of the truck. She 
               presses buttons desperately.

                                     PETRA
                         He's shut out the communication 
                         circuit!

                                     XANDER
                         You can't talk to it?

                                     PETRA
                         No, it's like a safety. We are going 
                         to have to access the manual controls.

                                     XANDER
                         A manual control on a moving torpedo. 
                         This day keeps getting better and 
                         better.

               Xander starts running towards a second moored MOTORBOAT.

                                     XANDER
                         Radio Ivan! Tell him what's going 
                         down! Have them evacuate downtown!

               EXT. THE RIVER - DAY

               Yorgi is motoring away, smiling, when he glances back and 
               sees Xander and Petra take off after Ahab. He pounds on his 
               steering wheel and turns around. His bigger boat closes on 
               them and he reloads his weapons.

               Xander drives while Petra checks her controller.

                                     PETRA
                         It's running three meters down. Twenty 
                         knots.

                                     XANDER
                         It has to surface to release the 
                         nerve agent, right?

                                     PETRA
                         By then it's too late! The only way 
                         to safely dispose of the nerve agent 
                         is in deep water! The chemicals will 
                         break down and dissipate!

                                     XANDER
                         Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow 
                         it up underwater!

               They're heading into downtown Prague now, the riverbank 
               getting more and more populated. Yorgi is closing fast.

               Down below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab beneath 
               the water.

                                     PETRA
                         There it is! Hold it steady!

               Petra pulls the pin on a grenade. She tosses it out in front 
               of Ahab. WHOOMPH! A jet of water goes up, but too far behind. 
               She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's 
               boat pulls up alongside. Yorgi aims and FIRES and the bullet 
               GRAZES Petra's arm.

                                     XANDER
                         Petra!

               She loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the 
               engine compartment.

               Xander grabs Petra and jumps. Together they land in Yorgi's 
               boat. The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge 
               support and shatters.

               They are in the heart of the old city now. We see piazza's 
               full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing 
               in front of cathedrals. And on the river Yorgi and

               Xander battle it out while Petra steers the boat.

                                     PETRA
                         Xander! It's coming up!

               Xander glances down, sees Ahab nearing the surface. Yorgi 
               clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat. Petra 
               tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm.

               Xander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs 
               him from behind in a chokehold.

                                     YORGI
                         This is going to be exciting, buddy! 
                         Front row seats to the apocalypse! 
                         Come on, sing with me!
                              (singing madly)
                         "I am an Antichrist / I am an 
                         anarchist / I... wan-na be... 
                         Anarchy!"

               Xander elbow's Yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold. He flips 
               him and they both topple overboard.

               They land on Ahab and both grab on. They punch and pummel 
               each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding 
               torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St. 
               Charles bridge.

               On the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF 
               PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from 
               the river.

               Xander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi 
               slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in 
               the torpedo's wake.

               Ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open.

               Inside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing 
               Silent Night. The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION.

                                     XANDER
                         No you don't.

               He pries the first rocket off it's launcher. The thing is 
               BEEPING menacingly.

               IN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his 
               hands. He looks over at Petra. She's shouting at him, but he 
               doesn't hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT.

               He looks the other direction, to the mass of PEOPLE on the 
               bridge above him. Total strangers...

               The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former 
               nihilist.

               Through the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with 
               his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact.

               Then Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the 
               water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab 
               starts to DIVE.

               EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

               With Yorgi hanging on his back, Xander turns the rocket upside 
               down and stuffs it BACK IN THE LAUNCHER.

               Ahab heads down to the bottom of the river, the two men 
               fighting.

               We see one man get THROWN FREE, the other is caught up on 
               Ahab and continues downstream.

               Then the booster rocket FIRES, giving off SPARKS and BUBBLES.

               It's all in silhouette now as WHAM! The rocket EXPLODES, 
               setting off a CHAIN REACTION. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ahab and 
               it's unfortunate passenger are DISINTEGRATED by the BLASTS.

               The chemicals BELCH OUT in harmless clouds.

               EXT. THE RIVER - DAY

               A FUNNEL OF WATER blasts into the sky. The crowd recoils.

               EXT. THE RIVERBANK - DAY

               Ivan 2 helps Petra off the motorboat. They look down at the 
               water, but there's no sign of Xander.

               Gibbons and his men push through the cordon of POLICE, 
               scanning the water. Nothing.

               Tears well in Petra's eyes. Even Gibbons looks dejected.

               Then Petra let's out a gasp and they look downstream.

               There's a boat ramp leading into the water. At first they 
               see a ripple, then the top of a SHAVED HEAD emerges.

               The whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water, 
               walking up the boat ramp.

               His shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered. But there's 
               a look on his face, a calm, a self-confidence we haven't 
               seen before. The Phoenix has risen.

               Petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him. Xander 
               shakes Ivan 2's hand and then turns to Gibbons.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Thought you bought the farm down 
                         there, X. Glad as hell to see you.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm pretty happy to see me too. So 
                         are you done with me yet?

                                     GIBBONS
                         You've kept up your end of the 
                         bargain, I'll do the same. But you 
                         really should consider staying on, 
                         you make a decent agent.

                                     XANDER
                         But I hate cops, remember? Except 
                         for her.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. 
                         You're a hero. Don't be afraid to 
                         join the good guys.

                                     XANDER
                         Who says you're the good guys?

               He starts walking off with Petra.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You know what they say, the only way 
                         to change the system is from the 
                         inside.

                                     XANDER
                         Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking 
                         this thing off my ankle? The poison 
                         needles?

                                     GIBBONS
                         On come on, X. Did you really think 
                         we were that barbaric?

                                     XANDER
                         No needles, huh? What about the acid 
                         bath?

                                     GIBBONS
                         All for show. Just a psychological 
                         mind game to get you to do the right 
                         thing.

                                     XANDER
                              (smiles)
                         You're a jerk-off, you know that?

               Gibbons waves.

                                     GIBBONS
                         We'll be talking soon, you'll see. 
                         You'll be back.

               Xander and Petra move off through the crowd arm in arm.

                                     PETRA
                         I can't believe my mission is finally 
                         over. I don't even know what to do 
                         with myself.

                                     XANDER
                         You can't welch on me now. We had a 
                         deal.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ANGLE ON - a big "X" spelled out in SEASHELLS on the sand.

               The camera shoots up into the sky, showing a perfect white 
               beach, a perfect lagoon, a lush green island... BORA BORA...

               Then we hear the BUZZING of a TATTOO NEEDLE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A THIRD "X" BEING TATTOOED ON THE BACK OF XANDER'S HEAD.

               INT. HUT - DAY

               His ink done, Xander walks out onto the back deck.

               EXT. BORA BORA - DAY

               Craggy mountain peaks and perfect turquoise blue water.

               Xander steps out of a hut built over the water.

               We see Petra sprawled out on the deck in a bikini. She's got 
               a bucket of HINANO BEER chilling down. It's a vision of 
               heaven.

               He lays down next to her, starts pulling her bikini bottom 
               off.

                                     PETRA
                              (laughing)
                         What are you doing?

                                     XANDER
                         It's about your next mission. You 
                         need to be debriefed.

               FROM UNDERWATER - we see the two of them dive into the lagoon 
               nude. There's too many bubbles to see any real skin, but we 
               know what they're up to.

               Back on the surface we see BUBBLES rising and catch glimpses 
               of their outlines beneath the water.

               The Camera pulls back to the deck, where we see Xander's 
               COMMUNICATOR on the table next to the beers. We hear them 
               surface and start SPLASHING off camera.

               Then the damn communicator starts to BEEP.

               FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
