screenplay by 
David McKenna 
February 6, 1997 


<b>INT. HOUSE - CLOSED EYES                                                                                
</b>
A young man's blue eyes slowly open.  A girl moans from the next room.

<b>EXT. STREET CORNER - A LARGE TIRE
</b>
turns the corner and splashes through a puddle from an
earlier rain. TUPAC SHAKUR blares from inside.

<b>INT. HOUSE - TIGHT ON THE EYES
</b>
They snap wide as the young woman in the next room MOANS
even louder.

<b>EXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A WET NIGHT
</b>
A slight buzz emanates from the power lines and street
lights above the humble VINYARD household. A black FORD
BRONCO rests in the driveway.

<b>EXT. WET STREET - A GRAY TRANS AM
</b>
TUPAC'S rapping builds. The window-tinted drive-by
slowly heads down the residential street, cruises past
the Bronco in the driveway, and slows to a stop. The
music stops and TWO BLACK MEN spring from the car.

They move with purpose. The larger figure, crowbar in
hand, moves to the truck. The GUN wielding passenger
hurries to the front door and stands guard. Inside the
car, another man methodically waits.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DANNY VINYARD'S EYES
</b>
The sex happening in the next room makes it difficult for
Danny to sleep. Next to a digital clock that reads
3:07AM, the clean cut 14-year-old flips to his side.

A poster of Lee Ving of FEAR onstage, taped to the wall.
Pre-Calculus and Biology books on the floor. Cassettes
scattered on his tiny desk. A stereo in the corner.

The off-screen sound of breaking glass grabs Danny's
attention. He sits up and looks through the blinds.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - SAME
</b>
Danny SEES a man reach through the broken window and
unlock the door. He quickly. pans to the idling Trans Am.

<b>INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY
</b>
His fearful expression says it all.

<b>          DANNY
</b>Holy shit.

Danny quickly bolts out of his room and into the adjacent
bedroom down the hall. He barges through the door.

<b>INT. DEREK'S BEDROOM - A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG
</b>
It hangs above a serious computer and next to a giant,
tome-filled bookshelf. The moans, meanwhile, approach
orgasm.

TIGHT ON DEREK VINYARD. The young man has a shaved head,
a thick goatee, and a well-crafted SWASTIKA on his left
tit. On top of Derek in the bed is his barely-of-age
girlfriend, STACEY. The covers are completely off and a
BLACK ROSE is tattooed across her right shoulder blade.
Danny watches her fuck, only for a second.

<b>         DANNY
</b>(softly)

Der !

Danny walks over and shakes him. Startled, Derek
forcefully grabs his little brother's arm.

<b>        DEREK
</b>(controlled)

What?

Stacey stops and looks over.  Frustated, she rolls off
Derek and onto her side.

<b>                 STACEY
</b>Fucking pervert, Dan!

<b>          DANNY
</b>There's a black guy outside Der...
breaking into your car.

Derek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and
quickly puts on his skivvies. He reaches under his
mattress, pulls out a SIG .45 semi-automatic pistol, and
shoves in a clip.

<b>              DEREK
</b>How long has he been out there?

<b>          DANNY
</b>Not long.

<b>STACEY
</b>
Who?


<b>                 DEREK
</b>Nobody. Relax.

Stacey sits up quickly from the bed as Derek pulls on his
black combat boots.

<b>          STACEY
</b>Who's out there, Derek?

<b>          DEREK
</b>Not right now, honey.
     (to Danny)
How many?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>One...I think.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>Is he strapped?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Hunh?

<b>              DEREK
</b>Does he have a fucking gun, Dan?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>I'm not sure.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Is there a driver?

Danny nods his head yes.

<b>       DEREK
</b>Okay.  Stay the luck here.

<b>                 STACEY
</b>Derek? Be careful.

He looks at his girlfriend and walks off.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - SAME
</b>
TIGHT ON DEREK. He walks down the hall. The intensity
on his face is alarming. He stops at the front door and
grabs the doorknob. Before he turns the knob, he peeks
through the eye hole on the door.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - DEREK'S EYE POV
</b>
THE BLACK GUARD carelessly turns toward the driveway to
see what's taking his partner so long with the wires.

<b>INT. HOUSE - DEREK AT THE DOOR
</b>
The guard has his back to him. Derek goes.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - THE DUEL
</b>
Derek throws open the door and the black man standing
guard wheels and fires a shot into the front door. Derek
buries two bullets in his chest.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Fuck you!

The force propels the man six feet backwards.

<b>INT./EXT. BRONCO - THE OTHER MAN
</b>
Stunned by the gunfire, he charges back to the getaway
Tranny. Derek buries a bullet into his shoulder. The
car splits and Derek fires a shot through the side
window. He then walks towards the car and fires shot
after shot at it until it disappears.

<b>INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - DARKNESS
</b>
Davina and Doris Vinyard yell in the background like they
were in Vietnam. They meet in the hallway, still not
able to place the direction of the gunfire.

<b>DAVINA
</b>
<b>MOM!!!!
</b>
<b>                 DORIS
</b><b>STAY DOWN, HONEY!  DANNY?!
</b>
They stay down on the carpet together.

<b>EXT. BEDROOM - DANNY'S POV
</b>
From the rain-soaked window he watches Derek face his
wounded prey - crawling on the ground. Sirens sound from
a distance.

<b>                 STACEY (O.S.)
</b>Get down, Danny! Jesus!

TIGHT ON DANNY. His gaze is locked on his brother from
his bedroom window. Derek cocks his piece, points it and
walks toward the man.

TIGHT ON DEREK'S FACE. Eyes blistering.

<b>FADE TO BLACK:
</b>
<b>THREE YEARS LATER
</b>
<b>EXT. POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNING
</b>
A black man in a suit and tie, ROBERT SWEENEY, goes
through the automatic doors and into the station. He
approaches a DESK SERGEANT. A daily calendar on her desk
reads MONDAY. MARCH 3. 1997.

<b>                 SWEENEY
</b>Captain Rasmussen?

<b>          DESK SERGEANT
</b>Briefing room. Down that hall...third
door on the left.

<b>INT. BRIEFING ROOM - A MEETING
</b>
Cops and detectives sit attentively and a few sip coffee.
The clock on the wall above reads 7:38 AM. Middle-aged
with slicked-back hair, CAPTAIN JOHN RASMUSSEN finishes a
thought. He spots Sweeney as he enters and aimlessly
reaches for a file.

<b>RASMUSSEN
</b>All right. Moving on--
(acknowledging)
Good Morning, Doctor.

The group looks over and meets Sweeney's hard glare.

<b>                 SWEENEY
</b>Good morning.

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>Gentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney.
He's Principal over at Venice High and
for some time now he's done a load of
outreach work with gangs...in and out
of the can.

Sweeney nods as Rasmussen cough.  He sips water and
continues.

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>Three years ago a local kid named
Derek Vinyard gets sent up for
murdering a couple of Crips who were
trying to jack his car. Bob taught
Vinyard back in high school and has
followed the case closely.

<b>              YOUNG COP
</b>He was a skinhead, right?

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Derek was more like...the skinhead.
He and Cameron Alexander.

<b>COP #2
</b>
Who?

Rasmussen opens a FILE in front of him. There rests
Derek's mug shot. He flips it over and reveals
CAMMERON'S MUG SHOT. Front and side view.

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>Cammeron Alexander is probably the
biggest writer and distributor of
white power literature in LA County.
He promotes white power bands, writes
reviews, columns, all at the ripe age
of forty.

<b>             YOUNG COP
</b>     (smiling)
He's forty? Jesus.

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>Pretty clean record...runs everything
out of his house down by the beach.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>There weren't any organized white
gangs around Venice before those two
hooked up. Very few, if any. It was
mostly just black and Mexican. But it
was tiny. They hit it off though...
and Alexander hit the jackpot with
Derek.

Rasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a VCR.

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>We got some uncut footage here.
Courtesy of NBC.

<b>ON THE TELEVISION--
</b>
<b>          REPORTER
</b>Earlier this evening...LA County
Firefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot
and killed while putting out a fire in
a suspected Compton drug den.

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>       (to the group)
This being February of '90.

<b>EXT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - A LIVE BROADCAST - VIDEOTAPE
</b>
A YOUNGER DEREK, short haired with no tattoos, stands
next to the reporter. Derek wears a Venice High
Basketball jersey drenched in sweat. Towel around neck,
he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera.

<b>          REPORTER
</b>To my right I have Lieutenant
Vinyard's oldest son Derek.
     (to Derek)
How do you feel about all this, son?

<b>          DEREK
</b>How do I feel? How do you think I
feel? It's typical.

<b>                 REPORTER
</b>Typical how, Derek?

<b>          DEREK
</b>Well...look at our country. It's a
haven for criminals. Black...brown...
yellow...whatever.

<b>          REPORTER
</b>So you're saying the murder of your
father is "race" related?

<b>          DEREK
</b>Every problem in this country is
"race" related. Every problem, not
just crime. These problems are rooted
in the black community, the Hispanic
community, the Asian...every non-
Protestant group in our society.
     (then)
Look at the shit. Immigration...
welfare...AIDS...they're all the
problems of the non-white. Look at
the statistics.

<b>          REPORTER
</b>Most of these issues you're referring
to though son are related to--

<b>          DEREK
</b>     (interrupting)
No no no! Don't say poverty right now
cause that's not it. They're not a
product of our fucking environment
either! Minorities don't give two
shits about this country! They're
here to exploit...not embrace.

<b>          RASMUSSEN (O.S)
</b>     (over reporter's question)
When Alexander got his hands on this
segment...he copied it, sent it out
and it became the Gettysberg Address
for hate groups across the country.

<b>BACK TO THE TELEVISION.
</b>
<b>          DEREK
</b>Millions of white Europeans came to
this country and flourished within a
generation! A generation! So what
the fuck is wrong with these people?!

<b>          REPORTER
</b>What does any of this have to do with
your father?

<b>          DEREK
</b>Because my father was doing his
fucking job! Saving a nigger
neighborhood he didn't give two shits
about! And he got killed by some drug
dealer who still collects a fucking
welfare check.

Derek looks at the man and walks over to HIS MOTHER
DORIS, who smokes a cigarette. The camera follows him as
he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside
their Venice Beach residence. The camera pans back to
the reporter who just stands there, speechless.

<b>INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME
</b>
Rasmussen ejects the tape, the screen turns to fuzz, and
he turns it off.

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>Vinyard was quietly released from
Chino on Saturday after three and some
odd years. And I think it's something
we might want to keep an eye on for a
few days.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>I don't wanna be an alarmist. But
payback is out there. I know it is.
And in this particular case...if
Vinyard gets popped...more people will
get popped.

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>It's not exactly LAPD policy but I
want 24-hour surveillance on Vinyard
for a few days.

<b>          COP #2
</b>(smiling in disbelief)
Twenty-four hour surveillance, sir?

<b>                 RASMUSSEN
</b>Just for a few days.

<b>          ANOTHER COP
</b>He doesn't sound like Mr. Lovely here,
Captain. You want us to bust him or
protect him?

Rasmussen offers Sweeney a look that it's his question.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>I don't think Vinyard's gonna be the
one to start anything. It's his
following.

<b>              RASMUSSEN
</b>Either way...let's keep it low.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - MORNING
</b>
PEACEFUL DAY by PENNYWISE blasts from Danny's walkman
headphones. The day is cloudy and overcast but that
doesn't bother the local SURFERS. A twosome paddles
north to get a better break on the next set. Danny
watches as he skateboards down the strand.

His appearance is changed, now resembling a younger,
softer Derek.

Head shaved to a quarter of an inch, he wears a PLAIN
WHITE BACKPACK with punk/white power bands scribbled all
over it. Your standard Sex Pistols, DK, Germs, G.B.M.,
and Adolescents in black. Cro-Magnons and Skrewdriver
off to the left. In red is the largest name, DICK NIXON.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b> EXT. VENICE HIGH SCHOOL - THE BIKE CORRAL
</b>
 Kids from all walks of life park their cars, lock their
 bikes and head off to class.

<b> EXT. HALLWAY - TIGHT ON A THRASHED LOCKER
</b>
 Danny throws his SKATEBOARD in, slams the door, and turns
 to face LIZZY, a pretty, redheaded freshman.

Danny takes a piss. Outside, a voice pleads "It wasn't
me!" DARYL DAWSON, pale and thin, is shoved into the
bathroom and he trips into the sink. LITTLE HENRY, a
young black kid, enters with two of his buddies. Danny
zips up and faces them.

<b>                                   LITTLE HENRY

                 I've never cheated in my life.

<b>                                  BUDDY #1

</b>                 I didn't say anything, Henry. I

</b>                 He's lying, man! I was right there!

Little Henry cracks Daryl in the face and practically
knocks him down with one shot. A bleeding Daryl
struggles to his hands and knees behind Danny.

<b>                                  LITTLE HENRY
</b>                 Next time, man.

Danny stares into Henry's eyes and the trio exits. Dannv
helps Daryl back up to the sink. THE SECOND BELL RINGS.

Kids have just settled into their seats.  Danny walks in 
and tries to be discrete.

</b>Vinyard!?

An OLDER TEACHER writes an Algebra problem on the board
for the students to solve.

<b>                 OLDER TEACHER
</b>You're late.

The man grabs a pink slip off his desk and hands it to
Danny.

<b>          OLD TEACHER
</b>But it looks like you got bigger
problems.

He sits in a chair next to an office door marked DR.
ROBERT SWEENEY - PRINCIPAL. Danny glances at the
secretary as she types and talks on the phone.

TIGHT ON DANNY. He listens to the conversation through
the the crack in the door as his eyes swell.

<b>          MURRAY (O.S.)
</b>I do not have a problem with him as an

<b>          SWEENEY (O.S.)
</b>Oh shit Murray sure you do.  You hate

<b>INT. OFFICE - THE CONVERSATION

The bespectacled, short-haired MURRAY ROSENBERG, 48,
looks over and spots Danny listening outside. Murray
walks over and shuts the door. He looks at DR. SWEENEY,
who now has his jacket off.

He points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles
in horror. It is titled BOOK REPORT--MEIN KAMPF.
"Daniel Vinvard - American History" is in the upper left
hand corner.

<b>          MURRAY
</b>This paper is a travesty, Bob!
Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights
hero?! You've gotta draw a line.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Murray...it says in your syllabus that
they could do their report on any book
related to the struggle for Civil
Rights.

<b>                 MURRAY
</b>Oh come on, Bob!

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Let me finish! He needs help...I'm
not disputing that. But I read it and
I'm not going to throw him out.

<b>              MURRAY
</b>His brother probably put him up to it.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>I can guarantee you his brother didn't
have anything to do with it, Murray.

Murray sighs and takes off his glasses.

<b>          MURRAY
</b>Don't let him walk scot-free here.
For his sake...not mine. You might be

Sweeney stares at the younger teacher and nods.

<b>                       SWEENEY
</b>          You said it, all right. Sit down.

Danny does what he's told. Sweeney stares at the
teenager and leans back in his chair.

<b>                       SWEENEY
</b>         Are you okay?

<b>                   DANNY

<b>                 SWEENEY
</b>Adjusting okay?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Yeah.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>He was a student of mine. Honors
English. He was a great student...
like you...but he hung out with
scumbags. Also like you. That's why
he ended up in the pen, hunh?

No answer. Sweeney holds up Danny's paper.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Great writing. I can't correct it
though. It wreaks too much of shit.

<b>          DANNY
</b>Come on, man! I followed directions
and wrote an "A" paper. It's got
nothing to do with Derek.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Everything you do now has something to
do with Derek. Who told you to do
this?

<b>              DANNY
</b>Let us get on with our lives, man!

<b>              SWEENEY
</b>Hey, I'm not worried about Derek--he
can take care of himself.  I'm worried
about his little brother.
(softly)
Mein Kampf, Dan? I should expel you!

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Do it. What?  You don't think I could
handle it?

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>     (smiling in disbelief)
The street would kill you, Danny.
You're not tough. The second a
brother pulls a gun on your ass you'll
be holierin' for Doris.
     (pondering to himself)
So here's the drill. Take it or leave
it cause I'm sick of babysitting. I'm
your history teacher from here on out.
We're gonna deal with shit happening
right now. Call it American
History...X. I see your ass once a
day. Any more, any less, and you're a

<b>          DANNY
</b>It took me a week to read Mein Kampf.

</b>My name is Dr. Sweeney. And I want a

A series of intercuts shows activity in and around the
pier. A HOMELESS LATINO MAN searches a trash dumpster.
OPEN VENDORS sell tie-dye and water bong paraphernalia.
A FAT WOMAN walks past eating a hot dog. BLACK GANG
MEMBERS play basketball in their low-rider shorts and
boxers.

TIGHT ON DANNY. He skateboards down the boardwalk,
performing tricks and spinning the board. He eats shit,
recovers, and looks off into the distance.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>People look at me...and they see my
brother. That's how things have gone
since the murder of our father.

<b>EXT. BOARDWALK - NEAR THE BASKETBALL COURT
</b>
From afar, he spots a group of black gang members shoot
hoops. He and Little Henry from earlier exchange a cold
glance.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>Little Henry Hastings and his older
brother Jerome. Jerome's a Shoreline
Crip...Henry's on his way.

Little Henry and older brother JEROME catch their breath
and stare down Dan. Danny doesn't flinch. Jerome sips
from a 40 oz. beer and resumes playing.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>Venice Beach, man. It didn't always
look like this. I mean...our Dad used
to take us down here to run...and it
was cool. Derek fucking owned this
place.        Since then though...the gangs,
man--

TIGHT ON DANNy. He watches the basketball action as he
takes a drag off his Marlboro Red.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>--they've moved west from Inglewood
and South Central and have really
just...taken over. Especially at my
high school. The Venice Locos are big
too but they hang out in bumluck Mar
Vista. It's scary.
     (then)
And then there's The Disciples of
Christ. The D.O.C.

Jerome and Little Henry joke and argue with eight extra
players and spectators.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - A GAME - FLASHBACK
</b>
DANNY'S POV. The teams are a mixed assemblage of 3
blacks and 2 Latinos and 3 whites and 1 black and 1
Latino. SKINHEAD FAT SETH RYAN, early twenties, and his
two skinhead buddies, can't compete against the better,
predominantly black team. One of the skins, CURTIS, has
a shaved head, a light beard and an M-16 RIFLE tattooed
on his head.

JEROME and LITTLE HENRY sit together to the right of the
court and monitor closely. Danny looks over his left
shoulder and sees Derek and Stacey sit with CAMMERON.
Cowboy hat and BRONCO JERSEY, they sit and converse on
the bleachers.

<b>                 LAWRENCE
</b>Seven-six. Let's go!  Set some picks!

<b>                 SETH
</b>Bring it on, boy.

Derek quickly moves his eyes to the court.

<b>LAWRENCE
</b>Boy?

Lawrence quickly pivots past Seth, dunks it, and yells as
he hangs on the rim. The crowd cheers.

<b>          SETH
</b>Lucky piece of shit! I'm through
"monkeying" around with your ass!

Lawrence spins around and challenges Seth.

<b>           LAWRENCE
</b>Fat, pasty, pale, pastrami eating,
cracker, motherfucker. A hundred
bucks says I make you my bitch.

<b>          SETH
</b>     (to the crowd)
Here we go! Trying to make ends meet
for that cut in welfare.

He makes a scene and passes Danny on the sideline.
Lawrence waits for Seth to take it further. Danny looks
at him, concerned.

<b>              DANNY
</b>It's eight-six, Seth.

<b>          SETH
</b>When I want your fucking opinion I'll
ask for it, fuckhead.
     (to Derek and Cam)
Help me cover here, guys.

Derek and Cameron stare at Seth, knowing Seth will lose
and embarrass them.

<b>              CAMMERON
</b>You got a big fucking mouth, fat kid.

<b>              SETH
</b>I'll take this negro down.

<b>              DEREK
</b>You can't take a shit, Seth.  Shut up.

Derek shoots a look to Cameron, comes to a decision, and
stands. He shouts for all to hear.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>I got a bet.

Lawrence stares at him, sensing something harder.

<b>          DEREK
</b>I come in, same score now, first one
to eleven. Black boys against the
white boys.

Lawrence looks back to his boys in disbelief.

<b>              LAWRENCE
</b>Name your price, Cracker.

<b>          DEREK
</b>No money...for the court. We win, you
grab your shit and find a different
place to run. Not just today...
forever. You win, and we don't come
back. No hitching, no fighting, here
in front of everyone. Six-eight, our
ball.

The action around the court gets very still.  Finally,
Lawrence nods.


<b>          LAWRENCE
</b>You got a lot of fucking balls, man.
Bring it. Right now.

Derek pulls off his sweatshirt and gives it to Stacey.
Lawrence gets his team together.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. COURT - BLACK VERSUS WHITE
</b>
No more mixed assemblage of players.  One team is white, 
one team is black.

<b>A SERIES OF SMOTS
</b>
Derek blows by Lawrence for a left handed layup. Derek
hits a thirty looter. Curtis grabs a rebound and uses
his elbows to get defenders off him. Big Lawrence fouls
Derek hard and Derek stares at him. Big Lawrence makes a
twenty foot turnaround. Lawrence advances on a three on
two and dunks it. Derek pump fakes three times and uses
the glass for a deuce. Finally, Derek drives the lane
and dishes to Seth at the last minute for a bucket.

<b>                       SETH
</b>          Yes! Ten a piece! Nice fucking dish.
<b>                                     
</b>SETH and CURTIS slap Derek's hand as they get back on
transition. Derek stares at Lawrence. CAMMERON watches
intently.

<b>                 CAMMERON
</b>It's all you, Der!

<b>                 LAWRENCE
</b>Fuckin' BYU, man!  All right!  All we
need is one now!

Lawrence and Derek lock eyes, a look exceeding
competitive boundary. A look filled with rage.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>Use that fat ass and keep him out,
Seth!

Seth and the opposing player bang to get position
underneath.

<b>          LAWRENCE
</b>I ain't losin' in my house!  Clear it 
out!

The POWER FORWARD dribbles beautifully up the court --
his teammates clearing out the key. Defensively, Derek
is solid. He tries to pass Derek but Derek's defense is
stifling. Again. With another tricky move, Lawrence
inadvertently puts his LEFT ELBOW into Derek's face,
sending him quickly to the pavement. EVERYBODY STOPS.

<b>              CURTIS
</b>That's fuckin' offense!

<b>          LAWRENCE
</b>Get the fuck outta here!  He was
movin' his feet!

Derek, teeth bloodied, rises. The two have a stare down.

<b>          DEREK
</b>(threateningly)
I'll go if you want to.

<b>          LAWRENCE
</b>You wanna piece! Bring it!

Players quickly rush to restrain the two even though the
teams hate each other.

<b>          DEREK
</b>If you wanna go...I'm ready.  Don't be
throwin' fuckin' elbows.

<b>          LAWRENCE
</b>Fuck you!

Derek walks over to Cammeron, Danny and Stacey standing
courtside. She has a water bottle and a towel waiting
for him. He wipes his BLOODY LIP and takes a sip.
Cameron stares at Derek.

<b>        CAMMERON
</b>Hey.  Are you copacetic?

Derek nods and looks at Danny and Stacey.

<b>              CAMMERON
</b>He's gonna do that 180 spin move.

<b>          DEREK
</b>I know what he's gonna do.

<b>              DANNY
</b>You gotta call offense on that shit.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Not on point game you don't.

<b>          STACEY
</b>Fuck that, D. That chucker can't pull
that shit. It's fucking-

<b>              DEREK
</b>Not on point, honey.

He turns back to the court and walks over to Lawrence.
He stands in front of him and checks the ball in.

<b>DEREK
</b>
Tens!

Lawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and
quickly gets it back. Lawrence dribbles up top, makes a
marvelous 180 spin with the ball, and pulls up for a ten
foot jumper. Derek reads it perfectly and REJECTS IT.
Lawrence trips to the ground, Derek grabs the ball off
the fast break and DUNKS IT.

<b>          DANNY
</b>         (amazed by the dunk)
Holy shit!

Everybody courtside goes nuts. Derek walks to the
sideline, ignoring all the hand slaps being offered.
Everyone is riveted on Derek.

<b>          SETH
</b>         (to the other team)
Get off my  fucking court!  This is my
house!

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Yeah! Fuck...yeah!

A sweaty Derek pulls his little brother close. He takes
a drink of water, spits out more blood, looks at his
bitter opponent, and says nothing.

<b>CUT TO:

Derek, Danny, Seth, Cammeron, Curtis and Stacey stand
outside the Bronco. The doors are all open and the
stereo softly plays music in the b.g. Derek dries off.

DANNY'S POV. Derek throws a shirt and tie over his
sweaty, tattooed body. Danny watches the tats disappear,
and it's almost like his brother is normal. A name tag
reads LA COPY CENTER - DEREK - ASSISTANT MANAGER.

Derek looks at JEROME and LAWRENCE from afar. Danny
notices the two men stare at his brother, ready to kill.
Derek meets their gaze.

The two young girls giggle and take off.

<b>INT. TINY, MESSY BEDROOM - SAME

JASON and CHRIS, two 17-year-old skinheads with shaved

clock that reads 4:47 p.m.

<b>          DANNY
</b>I've been trying to buy this.  You

The two look at Dan.

</b>          Back in his bedroom.

Seth pushes Danny to the side, passes Doris and yells.

<b>                   SETH
</b>               (smiling)
         Where are you, you free motherfucker?

Seth moves down the hall and bangs on Derek's door.

<b>                   SETH
</b>         Vinyard!

<b>                   DAVINA
</b>         He's on the phone, asshole!

<b>                   SETH
</b>          Fuck off.

<b>              DEREK (O.S.)
</b>I'll be out in a minute!

Without pushing it, Seth undoes his pants and moves into
the bathroom. Danny walks down the hall.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - THE CAN
</b>
Seth sits on the toilet. Danny pushes the door slightly
and stares at Seth's GUN on the bathroom counter. Danny
looks at him. After a few seconds--

<b>          SETH
</b>What are you lookin' at?

<b>              DANNY
</b>I'm still trying to figure it out.

<b>          SETH
</b>Come in here and I'll show you,
maggot.

<b>              DANNY
</b>Fuck off. When'd you start carryin'?

<b>          SETH
</b>I'm dropping the kids off at the pool,
junior. Shut the fuckin' door!

Danny grabs his nose and turns to the door behind him.

<b>      DANNY
</b>Jesus!  Chew your food, dude!

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DEREK
</b>
He continues into the phone receiver.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>All right. Thanks.  I'll take care of
it. Yeah.

DANNY'S POV. He opens the door and sees Derek on the
phone with his back to him. Above Derek is Danny's
surfboard, hanging on ropes hooked to the ceiling.

Blue jeans, black boots and slicked back hair, Derek
holds his hand up and motions for Dan to be quiet. The
sleeves of tats covering his arms, shoulders and back
(D.O.C.) define the hatred that has engulfed his past.


<b>    DEREK
</b>(into the receiver)
Okay.  Okay. I'm what?  What channel?

He covers the receiver, turns on a ten inch TV, and flips
to the correct channel.

<b>          DEREK
</b>         (without turning)
What is it, Danny?

<b>              DANNY
</b>You got pigs outside.

<b>DEREK
</b>
I know.

Derek leans over the computer to check it out.

<b>INT./EXT. BEDROOM - DEREM'S POV
</b>
He looks through the blinds and stares at the UNMARKED
CAR. Danny throws his backpack on the bed and exits.

TIGHT ON DEREK. He listens to the television.

<b>          TV ANCROR (O.S.)
</b>Saturday's prison release of a former
skinhead gang leader has many
community leaders up in arms tonight.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON SETH
</b>
He points his Glock 9mm at the mirror.

<b>          SETH
</b>Drop the t.v., nigger.

He laughs to himself and exits.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - SETH CONTINUED
</b>
He bangs on Derek's door once more, pissed that Derek
didn't open it earlier. He heads for the living room.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUE TV ACTION
</b>
Danny, Davina, and Doris are glued to the news story on
the same station. Doris, once beautiful, is now aged and
graying. NYQUIL, PEPTO BISMOL, two PRESCRIPTION
CONTAINERS, and a spoon rest on the coffee table.

<b>TIGHT ON THE TELEVISION. A WELL-DRESSED BLACK WOMAN
</b>speaks angrily to the reporter covering the story.
Random black protestors nod and comment in the
background.

<b>          BLACK WOMAN
</b>Maybe now whites will understand the
motives behind people like Malcolm X
and the Black Panthers.  Just put the
shoe on the other foot.

<b>FLASH TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. CHINO PRISON - THE VINYARDS ON NEWS FOOTAGE
</b>
Danny walks' towards Derek and they smile and hug.  Davina
and Doris soon join in.

Davina

<b>          BLACK WOMAN (V/O)
</b>Derek Vinyard deserved the death
penalty for what he did to that young
man! And now he walks the street as
free as you and I.

<b>          DANNY
</b>     {to the tv)
What about OJ, bitch!?

<b>INT. VINYARD HOUSE - TIGHT ON THE TV
</b>
The news segment winds down.

<b>          BLACK WOMAN
</b>         (fed up, to the camera)
They've done it to us again.

A hand reaches over to turn the channel. IT'S SETH.
Doris, in an awful state, lays back down.

TIGHT ON SETH. Tattoos cover his forearms. A BLOODY
SNAKE is halfway tucked under his rolled-up sleeves.

<b>          SETH
</b>Nigger lovin' Jew media calling the
shots. Watch cartoons. It's the only
t.v. that's safe nowadays.

<b>              DORIS
</b>No one's safe--until we all are.

Seth looks at the woman like she's from another planet.
He laughs and goes into the kitchen.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - SETH'S POV
</b>
He looks through the fridge but finds nothing. He closes
the door and looks at the family pictures on the door.

A FAMILY SHOT of Doris, Derek, Danny, Davina, and DENNIS
VINYARD in front of church. Seth appreciates Dennis in a
coat and tie. Below that, a picture of a dirty and
rugged Dennis and a young Davina, wearing her father's
FIRE HELMET. Danny with Doris.

<b>                       SETH
</b>          Come in here, Dan.

<b>INT. SMALL KITCHEN - SAME
</b>
He sits and comes upon Davina's revealing CROTCH. She
studies and so does he. Danny walks in the kitchen and
looks through the fridge. He pulls out a leftover piece
of steak and gnaws on it. Seth looks over at Dan

<b>                       SETH
</b>          Where the fuck you find that?

<b>                       DANNY
</b>          Goin' to Cam's party tonight?

<b>                       SETH
</b>          Is Davina's ass water tight?

Danny laughs.

<b>                   DAVINA
</b>          Hurry up and leave, Goodyear.  You've 
          taken your dump now go.

<b>                   SETH
</b>         Listen to you. You callin' me a
         blimp, you fuckin' Democrat?!

<b>                       DAVINA
</b>          Yes! I am!

Danny takes a bite and laughs at Seth.

<b>                       DANNY
</b>         I'm there tonight.

<b>                   SETH
</b>         Oh yeah? You ask Derek?

<b>                       DANNY
</b>         Noo...but he's got two kegs.

<b>          SETH
</b>Well...you can think of me drinkin'
'em then when you're studying with
fuckin'... White Trash in there.

Davina scoffs and Seth looks up her shirt.

<b>          SETH
</b>Where is the fucker, by the way!?
He's hiding from us.

Davina looks up from her homework and catches the pervert
looking at her.

<b>                 DAVINA
</b>You're not even human.

Seth erupts with laughter.

<b>              DANNY
</b>Is Cam playing sticks?

<b>                 SETH
</b>Of course, man.

Seth drums on the table as Danny shoves the last bite
into his mouth.

<b>          SETH
</b>Sit down. I wanna ask you some
questions.

<b>              DANNY
</b>I got homework, Seth.

<b>          SETH
</b>Two fucking seconds, dude!

Danny sits and looks at Seth.

<b>          SETH
</b>Tell me your convictions.

<b>          DANNY
</b>Fuck off.

<b>          SETH
</b>Tell me some of the shit you've
learned luckbrain or I'll pistol-whip
you.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>About Adolf?

<b>                 SETH
</b>About anything.  What do you believe
in?

Danny thinks to himself and smiles.

<b>          DANNY
</b>I believe in filth and destruction and
chaos and death and greed.

<b>                 SETH
</b>What else?

<b>          DANNY
</b>I believe in my family.

<b>          SETH
</b>Why?
<b>          DANNY
</b>"Respect your father and your mother.
Whoever curses your mother and
father... is to be put to death."
Matthew 15-4.

<b>                 SETH
</b>Good. What else?  Tell me what I want 
to hear, asshole.

<b>              DANNY
</b>You mean that stuff about your mother?

Davina CACKLES in the background.

<b>          SETH
</b>You wanna get beaten?

<b>           DANNY
</b>No.

<b>              SETH
</b>Then tell me about Adolf and Mein.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - DAVINA
</b>
She puts down her homework and looks over at Seth.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>Hey Seth? Cut the shit.

<b>          SETH
</b>I'm not fuckin' talkin' to you,
Davina, shut up! Do you believe in
Adolf?

<b>              DANNY
</b>Yeah, man. I believe in Adolf.

Seth smiles at the youth and speaks intimately.

<b>          SETH
</b>What do you hate, Danny?

<b>          DANNY
</b>I hate everyone that isn't white
Protestant.

<b>          SETH
</b>Why? And say it with some fucking
conviction!

<b>          DANNY
</b>Because they're a burden to the
advancement of the white race.  Some
of them are all right--

<b>          SETH
</b>None of them are all right, Danny.
They're all a bunch of fucking
freeloaders.
     (after a beat)
Remermber Canuneron. "We don't know
them, we don't want to know them,
they're the fucking enemy." What
don't you like about them?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>I don't know.  I feel threatened by
them.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>They feel threatened by you!

<b>          SETH
</b>     (ignoring her)
What else, Danny? And speak
intelligently you little queer faggot.

Davina's attention is rapt on her little brother.

<b>          DANNY
</b>I hate the fact that it's cool to be
black these days.

<b>SETH
</b>Good.
<b>          DANNY
</b>I hate this hip hop influence on white
fuckin' suburbia.

<b>SETH
</b>
Good!

<b>          DANNY
</b>I hate Hilary Clinton and all of her
Zionist MTV pigs telling us we should
get along. Save the rhetorical
bullshit honey, it ain't gonna happen.

Seth looks at the young man.  He smiles at him with
distinct revelation.

<b>          SETH
</b>That's the best shit I've ever heard
come out of that mouth.

TIGHT ON DAVINA. She stares at the two hate mongers.

<b>              DAVINA
</b>I feel.sorry for you, Danny.

<b>                 SETH
</b>Shut up, Davina.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>You shut up, you poison to fuckin'
society! Get out of our house!

<b>          SETH
</b>     (laughing)
Is this any way to treat a guest?

<b>              DAVINA
</b>Derek hates you, Seth.

<b>              DEREK (O.S.)
</b>How do you know who I hate, Davina?

<b>TIGHT ON DEREM VINYARD - SILENCE.
</b>
He's a striking presence with his scruff, tight t-shirt
and tats hanging down his arm. A black jacket wraps
around his waist.

<b>                 DAVINA (O.S)
</b>What do you mean?

Seth stands and smiles.

<b>          SETH
</b>Hey! How are you, man? Fuckin' A.
Long time no see. Look at that hair.

Seth moves to hug his old friend but Derek offers a
reluctant hand instead.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Gimme just one second, okay?

Seth nods as Derek stares at Danny.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Did you do a book report on Mein Kampf?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>What's it to you?

<b>          DEREK
</b>         (ready to kill)
What's it to me?

<b>          DANNY
</b>     (seeing this)
I mean...how'd you find out?

<b>          DEREK
</b>None of your fucking business how I
found out.

<b>              SETH
</b>I thought it was a great idea.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>That figures.  You're more stupid than
he is.

<b>              SETH
</b>It's nice to see you too, man.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>Why'd you do it, Dan?  Because of
Seth.

<b>                DANNY
</b>No.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Cammeron?

<b>              DANNY
</b>I did it cause I felt like it.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Oh, you do everything you feel like?
I feel like smacking you in the
fucking head. Would you mind if I did
a report on that?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Uhhh...yeah.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Get a clue, you dumbshit. Hey! Look
at me! Don't be a dickhead. Sweeney
cares about you.

<b>              SETH
</b>         (smiling)
Sweeney does?  Since when?

<b>          DANNY
</b>Was that him on the phone?

<b>                 DEREK
</b>Yep. So wise up.  You hear me?

<b>          SETH
</b>Sweeney's a fuckin' nigger on a power
trip, Vinyard. That's what he was
like when we were there and that's how
he is now. It'll never change either.
A nigger is a nigger.

Derek stares at Seth, ready to beat the fuck out of him.
Suddenly, Doris starts in with a COUGHING ATTACK. Derek                                      
quickly fills a glass of water and goes in there.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - THE PINK BLANKET
</b>
She coughs incessantly. Derek sits down beside her,
hands her the water, and caresses her head. The others
stare at her in the background.

<b>              DORIS
</b>Just put me out of my mercy.

<b>          DEREK
</b>You'll be okay. You want me to pick
you up any more medicine?

Together they look at all the bottles and laugh.  Derek
checks out the couch.


<b>          DEREK
</b>Jesus. I can't believe I ever let it
get this bad.

<b>              DORIS
</b>It's not that uncomfortable.

<b>              DANNY
</b>Are you gonna to live or what, Mom?

<b>              DORIS
</b>I need a cigarette.

<b>                   DEREK
</b>         My ass. You smoke two packs a day.
         That's why you're spittin' phlegm.

Doris coughs once again and spits green into her napkin.

<b>SETH
</b>(astonished)
Jesus, Mrs. Vinyard.  I think a lung
just came up.

Everybody laughs -- including Doris.  Derek tenderly puts 
his hand on his mother's cheek.

<b>              DORIS
</b>I'm high as a kite.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>You got any more?

<b> DORIS
</b>Daniel?  I know you got homework.

<b>              DANNY
</b>I'm goin' in a second.  Relax.

<b>          SETH
</b>     (interjecting to Derek)
Hey. I'm gonna re-wipe and we're out
of here.

Seth laughs as he walks down the hall.

<b>                 DAVINA
</b>You're a pig.

<b>              DORIS
</b>I don't like him in this house.

<b>         DEREK
</b>I knew.

<b>              DAVINA
</b>He ' s a fuckin ' loser, Nazi scumbag.

<b>              DANNY
</b>No he's not.

<b>                   DEREK
</b>          Yes he is. Open your eyes.

Danny looks at Derek and smiles.

<b>                   DANNY
</b>          Whatever, dude. I'm gonna go power
          that shit and I'll see you later.

He pats his brother on the shoulder and walks off.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Not at Cammeron's you won't see me.

<b>          DANNY
</b>     (turning back)
Come on, Der! It's gonna be fuckin'--

<b>                   DEREK
</b>          Forget it, Danny! It ain't gonna
          happen for you tonight.

Danny walks off, frustrated. He crosses Seth's path,
gets shoved into the wall, and reacts like it's an
everyday occurrence. Seth moves out the side window and
climbs out.

<b>                   SETH
</b>          Hurry up. I'm starving.

<b>                       DAVINA
</b>         What else is new?

Derek nods, looks at his mother and kisses her on the
forehead.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>I'll see ya.

<b>                 DORIS
</b>Okay. Be careful.

<b>DEREK
</b>
I will.

Derek follows Seth out the SIDE WINDOW and goes down the
alley.

<b>INT. APARTMENT - TIGHT ON DORIS
</b>
She thinks to herself and closes her eyes.

<b>EXT. SIDE STREET - SETH'S TRUCK
</b>
Derek looks at the oblivious cops and drops into the
passenger's seat. Seth starts the engine and drives
away. As the truck disappears, we pick up on a WHITE
SOUPED UP JEEP CHEROKEE turning the corner. Tinted
windows, it cruises past the apartment complex.

<b>INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - A DESK
</b>
<b>CUT TO:
</b>
Danny's attention is everywhere except on his homework.

<b>                       DANNY
</b>         This sucks.

He walks back out of his bedroom.

<b>INT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM - DANNY'S POV
</b>
He watches Davina complete her homework on the couch.
Doris, on the sofa opposite, tries to sleep.

<b>                   DANNY
</b>         Hey.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>Hey what?

<b>          DANNY
</b>Come here.

<b>DAVINA
</b>
What!?

<b>          DANNY
</b>Come here for a second!

The scholar sets her homework aside and impatiently
follows him down the hall.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - TWO SINGLE BEDS
</b>
She sits on the edge of DANNY'S bed.  Danny hands her his
assignment instructions.

<b>              DAVINA
</b>I got shit to do, Dan.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Just read it.

She sighs and begins to read it out loud.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>"American History X? Take home paper
as assigned by Principal Robert
Sweeney?"
     (to Danny)
Why is he giving you homework? What
happened to Murray?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Asshole turned me in.

<b>DAVINA
</b>Why?

<b>          DANNY
</b>Just read.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>"Describe in detail your opinion of
-the historical event that took place
in the early morning of October 4th,
1993." What's that?

<b>              DANNY
</b>The night Derek wasted those guys.

Davina takes a moment.

<b>                 DAVINA
</b>Sweeney gave you this?

<b>DANNY
</b>
Yep.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>     (continuing her reading)
"Before and after...how has this event

contemporary America. Use the
standard five paragraph format, blab
blab blah--this'll be good for you..

<b>              DANNY
</b>Nooo...it'll be good for you.

She stares at him for a good three seconds.

<b>                 DAVINA
</b>Eat me, Dan.

<b>          DANNY
</b>Come on! Dick Nixon's playin' at
Cammeron's tonight. You owe me.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>I'm not doing your homework for you!
I gotta spreadsheet due!

<b>          DANNY
</b>Goddammit!

Davina walks to the door and looks back to her brother.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>What's the matter with you? You wanna
be a fuckin' loser your whole life?

Not receiving a response, she walks out the door.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Asshole Sweeney.

He slowly begins to strike the computer keys. The screen
reads "People look at me and they see my brother. That's
the way things have gone since the murder of our father,"

TIGHT ON DANNY.  The frustated kid sits and thinks to himself.
himself.

<b>QUICK CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
</b>

THE BROAD EXPANSE OF AN EMPTY, DIMLY LIT PARKING LOT. In
the distant corner we see a few parked cars and a group
of skins gathering.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>It was lunacy after he left us. All
the time. Derek believed in
Cammeron...he was angry...that
combination gave them bodies. White
punks...sick of gettin' their asses
kicked by black and mexican gangs at
school.

<b>TIGHT ON DANNY LEANING AGAINST AN ADJACENT CAR.
</b>
Seven skins, including Seth and Curtis, smoke and wait.

DANNY'S POV. Danny looks to his left and sees Derek with
Cammeron, who sits in the driver's seat of the BRONCO.
Stacey leans in from the backseat.

<b>              STACEY
</b>I hope you kill that fucker.

Derek looks back at her and straight to Cameron.

<b>                 CAMMERON
</b>He might have a gun.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Are you going in or not?

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>You know I got the cops on me. If I
come up on one of those cameras I'm a
dead man.

Derek stares at the older man, who appears nervous.

<b>              CAMMERON
</b>Somebody needs to drive, Derek.

<b>          DEREK
</b>     (referring to his mouth)
All right. You can turn it off now.
     (back to Stacey)
You're right on his tail, right?

<b>          STACEY
</b>     (nodding)
I hate that fucking Korean.  I hope
you smash his face in.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Just be ready, okay?

She nods and Derek gets out. The group is silent.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Come on. Let's pull it together.
Hey! We're not playing fuckin' games
here. Let's go.

The group snaps to attention behind him as Seth toys with
the camera. CURTIS from earlier takes a hit off a joint
and makes Derek wait for him. Derek walks over to the
crazy man, takes the joint, and throws it onto the
ground.

<b>          DEREK
</b>What the fuck, Curtis? You a fuckin'
nigger now? Want some crack?

<b>CURTIS
</b>No.

<b>          DEREK
</b>     (grabbing his neck)
Pull your fucking stupid head out of
your ass then.

<b>                 CURTIS
</b>Okay. Jesus.

<b>          DEREK
</b>     (to the group)
We're here tonight cause we got

fucking Yen. Mexicans...flocking into
this place like some giant fucking
Pinata was shattered.

The group busts up. Cammeron watches Derek and smiles.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Don't laugh. It's tragic. On the
Statue of Liberty it says "Give me
your tired, your hungry, your poor,
your huddled masses...yearning to be
free." It does not say give me your
shiftless, your greedy, your indolent,
your criminals, looking for a free
ticket.

The group agrees.

<b>          DEREK
</b>We're here tonight to show the
government how we feel about
minorities taking over our country.
The treat us like criminals while they
reward them with jobs and fucking
welfare checks. And it's only getting
worse.

<b>              ET AL
</b>(nodding)
Fuck yeah it is.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Are you ready to do something about
it?                                   

<b>ET AL
</b>Yeah.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Okay then.

AND THEY'RE MOVING.  In formation.  Fast.  Directly at
us.    Angry.

As the camera swings into line, TRACKING WITH THEM, Derek
reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a STOCKING
MASK. He pulls it down over his face.

The foot soldiers follow him in unison.

<b>          DEREK
</b>         (back to his troops)
Remember. No names. Danny?  Stay
right on my fucking ass, man.

And now they're getting ahead of us. As the CAMERA
SWINGS behind them, we see their destination.

<b>EXT. LIGHTED GROCERY STORE - SAME
</b>
They storm the front entrance. The few people who are in
there scream and scramble for cover. Derek grabs a
Mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground. Seth
catches up to another and gets him on the ground.

<b>          SETH
</b>Wheto's your fucking green card,
asshole?

Seth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot
and continues. DEREK leaves a terrified white woman
alone like she's not even there and pushes over an
adjacent shelf, knocking over another worker with CANS OF
<b>BEANS.
</b>
<b>          DEREK
</b>(referring to the border)
Can't hide from me, motherfucker!

He kicks the man and looks around the market for more.
Danny watches in awe. Curtis breaks a giant jelly jar
over a head. Another skin throws a BLACK CHECKER into a
shelf of POTATO CHIPS.

DEREK'S POV. He looks up at one of the aisle mirrors.

<b>INT. BACK STOCK AREA - THE 55-YEAR-OLD KOREAN OWNER
</b>
He rushes out with a pistol. He takes aim on Curtis and--
<b>FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, DEREK TAKES A MOP TO THE OWNER'S
</b>HEAD AND PROCEEDS TO KICK HIM. Danny looks at Derek like
he's Superman.

Derek looks to his watch and straightens up.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Let's go! We're outta here!  Move !

From just inside the door we see skins get in their last
blows and pour out the aisles and pass us through the
doors. TIRES SCREECH. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE WRECKAGE
<b>OF THE MARKET AND THE MOTIONLESS BODIES ON THE FLOOR;
</b>
<b>INT. BRONCO - TIGHT ON DANNY
</b>
He takes off his stocking mask and stares at his stone-
faced brother.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>And before Derek could even blink...he
had a crazed army behind him.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. BEDROOM - PRESENT - THE COMPUTER
</b>
Danny sparks up a cigarette and types on the screen.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>Willing to follow his word like it was
the word of God.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A RAINY NIGHT - FLASHBACK
</b>
As the rain falls, we see the Vinyards sitting at the
table. Stacey and Murray Rosenberg, Doris' then
boyfriend who we met earlier, round out the clan. Stacey
sits close to Derek.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>And then came October 4th, 1993.

<b>INT. BEACH HOUSE - THE DINING ROOM
</b>
Doris looks wonderful while Murray, mustache and beard,
shakes his head at Derek as he chatters away.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>Things were fine on the homefront. My
Mom had a good job but a below average
boyfriend. We had a four-bedroom
house that Dad left us with. Everyone
was happy.

TIGHT ON DEREK. Shaved head, rolled-up sleeves, tattoos,
loosened tie, LA COPY CENTER name tag from earlier. His
charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the
crackling rainfall.

<b>                 DANNY (V/O)
</b>Everyone but Derek.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Fuck you, Murray. White men don't
cruise the streets of LA killing each
other.

<b>         MURRAY
</b>No.  You guys make bombs.

Derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide.

<b>          DEREK
</b>You're so fucking lame. A couple of
cranks in cabins in Montana is not
statistically significant.
     (then)
White Americans don't take PCP and
drink and drive a hundred and twenty
fuckin' miles an hour! We pull over
and trust the law.

<b>                 MURRAY
</b>You're kidding, right?

<b>          DAVINA
</b>     (sarcastically)
Don't you know, Murray? White people
never break the law. We're perfect
little angels.

<b>          DEREK
</b>That's not what I said, Davina.
     (to the group)
Three different times Rodney King
comes at those officers with the
intent to hurt them. To hurt them!
Three times! But since we see it on
some fucking tampered videotape...the
bleeding heart media makes you believe
that he only comes at them once. All
we see is Powell, Koon and Wind
hittin' him and--
     (busting up laughing)
Briseno kickin' him in the back of the
fuckin' skull with his boot. Still,
the dumbfuck's tryin' to get up and
kick their asses! That's how stupid
that motherfucker is. Those cops used
textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were
still here he'd say the same damn
thing.

<b>          DORIS
</b>That doesn't make it right.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Yes it does. Yes it does. They're
cops! They are taught to use that
stick and they did.

<b>                 MURRAY
</b>Excessively.

<b>          DEREK
</b>No. Appropriately. Appropriately!
Cops have been granted a certain
amount of authority by society and
white people, unfortunately, are the
only ones who acknowledge it. I
acknowledge a cop's authority.

Davina starts to laugh.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>Look who's talking about respecting
the law? Mr. K.K.K. here.

<b>          DEREK
</b>That's two errors in one sentence,
Davina, so take a fucking course in
semantics. First error--I didn't say
I respect the law. I said I respect a
cop's authority. Second error...I'm
not a member of the fuckin' low rent,
disorganized, redneck Ku Klux Klan..
Pull your head outta your ass and look
at who you're dealing with.

<b>             MURRAY
</b>Don't speak to her that way, Derek.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Murray, stay out of it. You're not a
member of this family and you never
will be.

<b>          MURRAY
</b>What the hell does that have to do
with anything?

<b>          DORIS
</b>     (to Derek)
You know...sometimes it's hard to
believe I gave birth to you.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Give thanks to the food on the table
and then believe it, Doris.

<b>              DORIS
</b>We both put food on this table, fella.

<b>          DEREK
</b>True enough. The point is...if Dan
was walking across the street that
night and Rodney King plowed into him--

<b>          DORIS
</b>Can we forget about Rodney King for
chrissake?!

<b>          DEREK
</b>     (fiercely continuing)
--while hopped up on Chivas and
P.C.P...you'd consider the force those
cops used to be justified!

<b>              DORIS
</b>He didn't hit anybody!

<b>          DEREK
</b>If he did though! If that shithead
killed Dan...you would have believed
the beating to be justified and so
would everybody else. But since he
didn't hit anyone...it's "Hands Across
America" for the son of a bitch.

Derek takes a bite of food.

<b>          DEREK
</b>We are still so hung up in this notion
that we have an obligation to help the
struggling black man and all you
contribute to it! Lincoln freed the
slaves a hundred and thirty years ago!
Get off your fucking asses!

<b>          STACEY
</b>I'm with you, honey. All the way.
It's one...giant...ploy.

<b>                 DAVINA
</b>Here we go.

<b>          STACEY
</b>I mean...nobody likes Chief whatever
his name is, right?

<b>DAVINA
</b>Gates.

<b>          STACEY
</b>Yeah. So here comes this filthy piece
of garbage in his Hyundai. He pulls
over in front of a perfectly lighted
area where a video camera is sitting
there...fucking waiting for him, man.
What happens next? Chief Gates is
dust. It's total--

Davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter
and looks at her mother. Everyone stares at Davina.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>     (to Doris)
May I be excused please?

<b>          DEREK
</b>Don't interrupt, Davina.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>I didn't interrupt shit.

<b>          DEREK
</b>The hell you didn't. I was listening
to Stacey and then I heard you.
That's called interrupting. Wait 'til
she's finished and you can be excused.

<b>              DAVINA
</b>Who the hell do you think you are?

Derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back
of the hair.  The table JOLTS and plates tumble to zhe
floor.                                                           

<b>              DEREK
</b>You don't know when to shut up.

<b>                 DORIS
</b>Dammit Derek!

<b>              MURRAY
</b>What are you trying to prove, man?!

Derek turns and laughs at Murray.

<b>          DEREK
</b>I'm trying to teach my sister some
respect, Murray.

<b>          DAVI NA
</b>Let go of my fucking hair!

<b>          DEREK
</b>     (to Murray)
See! See the way she speaks! Tell me
you're gonna shut up and I'll let go.

<b>          DORIS
</b>Derek!  Let go of her hair and sit
down!

<b>          DEREK
</b>I will when I hear an answer, Doris.
Are you going to shut up, Davina?

TIGHT ON DANNY. He gets up quickly and tries to pull
Derek off. Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with
a BACKHAND, dropping him back into a cabinet. A crystal
vase with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing
Danny's head.

<b>MURRAY
</b>
Jesus!

<b>          DEREK
</b>     (to Danny)
What are  you thinkin'?

<b> DORIS
</b> Danny?!  Are you okay?!

Danny nods his head as everyone looks at Derek.

<b>          DEREK
</b>It's a real easy question, Davina. A
simple yes or no will suffice. Tell
me what I want to hear and I'll let
go.

<b>                 DAVINA
</b>Fuck...you.

Derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and
shoves it in her mouth. Me holds the whole piece inside
so she can't spit it out. Davina cries as she chokes on
the meat.

<b>          MURRAY
</b>She can't breathe, Derek!

<b>                 DEREK
</b>Stay back, both of you!  It's her bed,
she's gotta lie in it.
         (grabbing harder)
You can cry all you want, Davina. I'm
not gonna let go until you tell me
what I wanna hear! Are you going to
shut that fat fucking mouth of your's
and let my girlfriend tell her
opinion? Are you?!

DORIS grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on
her. Derek curls his tongue behind his teeth and raises
his arm like he's actually going to smack his mother.
She grabs his arm though, forcefully.

<b>              DORIS
</b>Let go of her hair and get out.

Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the
roast beef onto the floor. She runs into the back
bedroom crying, choking and coughing.

<b>          DAVINA (O.S)
</b>I hate you, you fucking asshole!

The door slams shut in the background.  Doris, Murray,
Danny, and Stacey all stare at Derek.  Derek calmly faces
his brother.

<b>          DEREK
</b>You okay?

Danny nods.

<b>             MURRAY
</b>         (softly)
Psycho.

IN SLO MO--Time FREEZES as Derek slowly turns his head
back to Murray. ON THE TRACK we hear a few keys being
typed and then silence. A cigarette sizzles.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. BEDROOM - DANNY THINKING - PRESENT
</b>
He takes a long drag off his cigarette and exhales. He
slowly runs his hands over his stubbly head, marveling at
the past.

<b>BACK QUICKLY TO:
</b>
<b>INT. DINING ROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK - FLASHBACK CONT.
</b>
Derek smiles at Murray in wonder and disbelief.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Would you care to repeat that, Murray?
I'm not sure I got all of it.

<b>          STACEY
</b>     (smiling)
He called you a "psycho", honey.

<b>          DEREK
</b>     (smiling back)
Was that it?    Thanks Murray.

<b>          MURRAY
</b>See. Here we go again with this,
Derek. Making me out to be the bad
guy again.

<b>              STACEY
</b>You callin' me a liar, RosenKike?

<b>                 MURRAY
</b>(to Stacey)
Hey goddammit! You talk to me with
respect or--!



<b>          DEREK
</b>Or what, Murray!? What're you gonna
do? Give her fucking detention?

<b>                 DORIS          
</b>Both of you get out right now.

Murray stares at Derek with pity.  Doris becomes
emotional.

<b>         DORIS
</b>     (to Derek)
Do you think you're the only one who's
affected around here?

Derek focuses on his mother for a moment. A captivated
Danny watches and waits as Derek turns to Murray.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Out of respect for my mother...I'm
gonna let that comment go, Murray. I
won't bash your face in. But let me
tell you somethin'...man to fuckin'
mouse here. Normally in a situation
like this I'd take my steel-tips to
your fucking Jewish temple. That goes
for anyone making comments about me,
my family, Stacey, whomever. You know
and I know that I could crush that
puny fuckin' skull of yours in a
second. So it's beyond me why you
would say something like that without
being able to back it up? What's
worse, you sack of shit, is you
calling the woman I love a liar.

<b>              MURRAY
</b>I never said she was a liar.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Weasel like that again Murray...you
fuckin' ponytail, pussy, bagel eating,
teacher, faggot...and I'll cut your
shylock nose off. Make no mistake.

Murray silently walks out of the house. Derek claps and
sings the Jewish celebration song "Hava Naghila." Stacey
joins in and the two laugh. Doris goes after Murray.

<b>              STACEY
</b>Murray Rosenberg...International Jew.

<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Murray goes to his car and Doris follows.  Danny watches
from the door.

<b>          DORIS
</b>He's a stupid kid, Murray!  I'm sorry!

<b>          MURRAY
</b>He's not a kid, Doris. We were kids.
We didn't call people kikes.

<b>          DORIS
</b>It's just gonna take some time with
him. What can I do?

<b>          MURRAY
</b>You don't know your children, Doris!
You have no clue about the world they
live in. Your son is a terrorist.

<b>              DORIS
</b>He's not a terrorist, Murray.  Jesus!

<b>          MURRAY
</b>He's a member of the Disciples of
Christ. You remember that grocery
store incident?!

<b>DORIS
</b>
Murray?

<b>          MURRAY
</b>My sister and her two kids got
evacuated from her Temple in Woodland
Hills!

<b>          DORIS
</b>Murray! Please! Derek would never
have anything to do with bombs, okay?!
You don't know him like I do.

<b>                       MURRAY
</b>          And I wouldn't want to. Goodbye.

Murray gets inside and goes down the street.

<b>INT. HOUSE - SAME
</b>
DANNY'S POV -- He watches Doris stand alone, her face in
her hands, crying.

BEHIND Dan a humiliated Davina storms towards Derek, now
wielding a BASEBALL BAT.

<b>DANNY
</b>
Davina?

Derek hears Dan and looks out of the corner of his eye.
He spots her at the last moment.

<b>         DAVINA
</b>Take this, you fucking dick!

Derek pops up quickly, disarms her, and pulls her close.

<b>          DEREK 
</b>Davina!  It's okay!  Calm down.  
Please.

<b>                 DAVINA
</b>Fuck you! Let go!

<b>          DEREK
</b>         (whispering in her ear)
I'm sorry, Davina. Come on.

<b>                 DAVINA
</b>Let go of me!

<b>                 DEREK
</b>Come on, Davina.  I'm sorry. I lost
control. Please.  I screwed up.

Derek holds tight until the crying girl settles down.
He's gripped as desperately by remorse as he was moments
before by rage. He kisses and repeats his apology over
and over. Finally, she succumbs and puts her arms around
him. Derek looks to Danny.

<b>          DEREK
</b>     (hugging Davina)
You guys are my life and I'd do
anything for you. You do know that?

<b>          DAVINA
</b>     (wiping her tears)
I don't believe you anymore.

<b>          DEREK
</b>I swear to God I would, Davina.
Please.

<b>              DANNY
</b>I believe you, Der.

Derek smiles at his little brother, lovingly.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Davina? Please forgive me.  Please.
I'm sorry.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>     (nodding, after a beat)
That fuckin' sucked, Derek.

<b>          DEREK
</b>I know it did. And I'm sorry.
I just really hate that guy.

<b>                 DAVINA
</b>You couldn't tell.

A RAINSOAKED DORIS walks through the front door.

<b>          DORIS
</b>Find an apartment because I want you
out of here.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Morn, I'm sorry but that guy's--

<b>          DORIS
</b>I don't wanna hear it anymore!  I want
you out!

<b>              STACEY
</b>He can move in with me.

<b>               DORIS
</b>When?

<b>          STACEY
</b>Tomorrow.

<b>           DORIS
</b>Good.

She walks past Derek and into the back bedroom.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES - PRESENT
</b>
He rises from the computer and PEEKS out the blinds. The
two cops supposedly watching Derek are now eating in the
car. One of them looks up. Danny flips the blinds down.
From the other room, he hears Doris break into another
coughing fit.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - DANNY
</b>
He sits beside her and hands her a glass of water.

<b>DANNY
</b>Here.

<b>                 DORIS
</b>Thank you, honey.

She coughs, recovers, and sips. Danny walks away.

<b>                 DORIS
</b>Hey. Come here.  Sit with me.

<b>          DANNY
</b>I've got this thing to do.

<b>              DORIS
</b>You can sit down for two seconds.

He looks at her and sits beside her.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Don't breathe on me.

<b>DORIS
</b>I won't.

They share a smile.

<b>          DANNY
</b>It's cold in here, no wonder your
sick.

She stares and smiles at him for a few moments.

<b>DANNY
</b>What?

<b>          DORIS
</b>What? I'm not allowed to look at you
anymore?

He smothers her face with his hand, jokingly.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>No. You're not.

<b>          DORIS
</b>     (laughing)
Daniel Patrick! Stop it! Are you
ever gonna let that beautiful hair
grow back?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Nope. Never.

<b>                 DORIS
</b>I bet you will.

He smiles and locks eyes with his mother for several
moments. He finally rises and walks back to his room.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Get some sleep.

<b>          DORIS
</b>If you need me to proof anything for
you I will.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>I'll be all right.

<b>              DORIS
</b>Wake up early if you get tired.

Doris watches him disappear down the hall, distant
thoughts creeping back slowly.

<b>INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - DANNY
</b>
He grabs a flannel and throws it on. He sees a cigar box
that rests on the right shelf. He grabs it and looks
inside. The rolled-up LA TIMES clipping reads "Prominent
Skinhead Charged with Murder." The accompanying picture
of Derek is near evil.

TIGHT ON HIS EYES.  Danny stares at the clipping.  ON THE
<b>TRACK--GUNSHOTS.
</b>
<b>MATCH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. BEDROOM WINDOW - THE EYES - FLASHBACK
</b>
He watches Derek fire his gun at the TRANS AM as it
blazes down the street. He walks over to the wounded man
on the lawn and points his weapon.

<b>                 STACEY (O.S.)
</b>Get on the floor, Danny!  Jesus!

Danny looks down at her and hurries out of his room.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - TIGHT ON DEREK
</b>
He hovers over big Lawrence. Gun pointed steadily, he
kicks him in the stomach over and over -- tongue pressed
against teeth.  Hot air flows from Derek's breath and
into the cold.

<b>                       DEREK
</b>          You fucked with the wrong bull.

<b>                       LAWRENCE
</b>          Goddamn, man!

Danny watches his brother from the front porch.

<b>                       DANNY
</b>         Let the cops handle it, Der!

<b>          DEREK
</b>Fuck that. The cops will let him
walk.

Derek grabs Lawrence and drags him to the CURB.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Ever shoot at firemen, you fuck?
     (then)
Open your mouth and put it on the
corner of the curb. I'm gonna teach
you a little lesson.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Derek!?

<b>              DEREK
</b>Get in the fucking house, Dan!

Danny doesn't move.

<b>              LAWRENCE
</b>Come on, man. Call an ambulance.

<b>          DEREK
</b>My dad gave me that truck,
motherfucker. Couldn't leave well
enough alone. Put your mouth on the
corner of the fucking curb!

Derek cocks his piece and Lawrence complies--his teeth
now scraping concrete. SIRENS sound from afar. Danny
walks out into the middle of the street to check it out.

<b>DANNY
</b>The cops are comin' Der'
<b>                            
</b>
Lawrence mumbles something unintelligible from his
outstretched mouth.

<b>          DEREK
</b>What the fuck did you say?  You just
threaten me? Hunh? Hunh? Hunh?

<b>        DANNY
</b>(anticipating)

No!

Derek STOMPS his foot on the back of LAWRENCE'S head -
completely tearing his jaw in half on the curb's corner.

<b>             DANNY
</b>     (crying)
Holy fucking shit!  Derek!    What the
hell was that for?!  Jesus!

The two lock eyes. Derek does not flinch. Helicopter
lights shine on the house. COP CARS SCREECH TO A HALT.

DANNY'S POV. Two cops take cover behind their door, draw
their guns, and shout instructions. Derek puts the gun
down, puts his arms behind his head, and drops to his
knees. His eyes are remorseless.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>Joseph Conrad once wrote that "murder
is always with us. It's almost an
institution." That couldn't rang more
true than with me.

<b>EXT. WET STREET - THE CRIME SCENE - LATER
</b>
FIVE PATROL CARS, a FIRE TRUCK, TWO AMBULANCES, and a
throng of terrified NEIGHBORS strangle the front of the
house. Clothed and handcuffed, Derek is escorted from
the house by two uniformed cops and RASMUSSEN.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>Bobby Lawrence died of massive head
trauma early that morning.

Derek marches past the bodies -- which are being tended
to thoroughly.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>Six months after that...Derek was
convicted and sentenced to seven years
for voluntary manslaughter...to be
served at the California State
Penitentiary in Chino.

Rasmussen forces Derek's head down and he gets in the
car. He stares at his brother and sister as police
lights flash on him. Then to Stacey. Finally, to a
lifeless Doris. They lock eyes as the patrol car takes
off down the street.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>Prosecutors wanted murder one for my
brother's torture method...but there
wasn't enough "premeditated" evidence.

They clearly focus on the computer. HIGHLIGHTED is the
sentence "There might have been if I testified." Only
when he hits the DELETE KEY does it disappear. He
continues typing.

<b>                   DANNY (V/O)
</b>               (continuing)
          Over the next year we'd lose our house
          and the rest of our father's pension
          to attorney fees. My mother...much to
          all of our surprise...stood by Derek.

Danny's interrupted by a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.

<b>INT. FRONT HALL - DANNY'S POV
</b>
He looks through the PEEPHOLE and sees it's CHRIS AND
JASON. He sighs in relief and opens the door.

<b>                 JASON
</b>We're here, dude.

<b>              CHRIS
</b>Drop your dick and grab your stick.

<b>          DANNY
</b>I told you I can't tonight.

<b>              DORIS (O.S.)
</b>         (from the couch)
Danny?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>It's okay, Mom.

The two punks laugh as Danny pushes them and their boards 
back to his bedroom.  He shuts his bedroom door.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - THE THREESOME
</b>
Danny looks at the two.

<b>              DANNY
</b>If I don't finish this thing I'm dead.

<b>              CHRIS
</b>Just tell 'em you'll do it tomorrow.
You can't miss the party.

<b>              JASON
</b>Fire pie Lizzy called and told us to 
grab your ass.

<b>              DANNY
</b>She did?

<b>                CHRIS
</b>             (nodding)
You gotta hit that shit.  It's the 
only fun thing that's legal anymore.

The PHONE RINGS and Danny grabs it.

<b>                DANNY
</b>Hello?

<b>INT.  DARK OFFICE - TIGHT ON SWEENEY
</b>
The only illumination shines through the window from the 
street.  Holding his briefcase, he stands over his desk
phone, all packed up and almost out the door.

<b>              SWEENEY
</b>Dan?

<b>                DANNY (O.S.)
</b>Yeah?

<b>                SWEENEY
</b>Dr.  Sweeney.

<b>INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION

<b>                DANNY
</b>             (worried)
What's going on?


<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Nothing here. Is everything all right
over there?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Everything's fine.

<b>                 SWEENEY
</b>How's it comin'?

<b>          DANNY
</b>I'm doing it right now.

<b>                 CMRIS
</b>Who is it, dude?

<b>          DANNY
</b>         (covering the receiver)
It's Sweeney.

<b>          CHRIS
</b>Who?! Why is he calling here!?  Fuck
you, Sweeney! Asshole!

<b>          JASON
</b>(grabbing the receiver)
Get a fucking job, you reggie!

Danny grabs the receiver back and yells at his friends.

<b>          DANNY
</b>You fuckers are going to get me
booted!
     (into the receiver)
Dr. Sweeney? I'm sorry, man.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Just make sure it's on my desk
tomorrow, Danny.

<b>          DANNY
</b>It'll be there, alright!?

<b>                 SWEENEY
</b>It better be.

Sweeney hangs up abruptly. Danny slams the phone on the
hook, gives it TME FINGER, and looks at his friends.

<b>          DANNY
</b>Let's go.

<b>EXT. CAMMERON'S HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT
</b>
A TRUCK sits across the street.

<b>INT. TRUCK - DEREK AND SETH
</b>
They sit in the car as a band JAMS from Cam's house.
Shiftless Seth throws on a black CRO-MAG t-shirt and
tosses his work shirt in the back. He wolfs down a
burger as Derek rolls his foot on a basketball on the
floor.

<b>              SETH
</b>You're an idiot if you ask me.

<b>              DEREK
</b>I'm not asking you.

<b>          SETH
</b>What if he writes something stupid and
that nigger turns you in? Jesus. He
didn't testify, Der. They can use
that shit and re-try you.

Derek takes a long stare at Seth, who devourshis burger.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Sweeney's not gonna do anything, Seth.
He helped get me released.

Seth is a pathetic vision to Derek.  Derek stares at him
for several moments.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>I'm out, Seth.

Seth wipes his mouth and casually meets eyes with Derek.

<b>          DEREK
</b>I'm only going to tell you this once
so pay attention. I'm done, Seth. I
don't want you to come near me...near
Dan...I want you to leave my family
alone.

Seth stares and laughs at Derek.

<b>                 SETH
</b>You're serious.

<b>          DEREK
</b>I'm dead fucking serious. No more
phone calls, no more visits, no more
nothing.

Seth doesn't know what to say.

<b>          DEREK
</b>We don't exist as far as you're
concerned, Seth.

<b>          SETH
</b>I can't believe I'm hearing this shit
come out of your mouth.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Believe it, Seth. Believe it. I
spent over three years away from my
family. My family, Seth. For what?

<b>          SETH
</b>For your country, fuckhole, that's
what. I'd do a hundred years before I
felt like that.

Seth gets out, slams the door, and walks to the party.

<b>                       SETH
</b>          You're a motherfucking traitor!

Derek stares out the window and sighs.

<b>EXT. STREET - DEREK'S POV
</b>
He watches the house. Suddenly, Danny, Chris and Jason
skate up to the residence and follow Seth inside.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>What the--? Shit.

DICK NIXON plays a punk version of WHITE CHRISTMAS as
skins slam dance.

<b>EXT. CAMMERON'S BACK PATIO - A SKINHEAD
</b>
His face is tattooed with crow's feet and prison ink.
CASSANDRA, a frail, older, English woman with green hair
and multiple piercings, approaches JASON at the keg.

<b>                 CASSANDRA
</b>You're full of shit!

<b>              JASON
</b>If he ain't here, he's comin'.

<b>INT. HOUSE - MORE SLAMMING
</b>
Chris, Danny and Jason pound beer and huck DARTS at a
picture of O.J. SIMPSON. Seth violently slams past the
kids. Derek walks in.

<b>         CHRIS
</b>Yo!  What's up, Fat Seth!?

Seth throws Chris against the wall.

<b>          SETH
</b>I'm not fat, cockwart!  I'm husky!

<b>              CMRIS
</b>Okay! I'm sorry, bro!

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Take it easy, dude!

Seth then grabs Danny hard by the shirt.  Chris and Jason
stare at him like he's gonna hurt him.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>What're you doin'?!

<b>              DEREK
</b>Your brother's a piece of shit!

Seth sees Derek enter and he releases Danny. Seth mixes
into the party and SLAM DANCES into ten other skins.
Danny follows Seth towards the keg.

DEREK'S POV. He analyzes the crowd.  Quickly, Chris
recognizes him.

<b>              CHRIS
</b>Holy shit.  Father Vinyard!?

<b>                 JASON
</b>Son of a bitch.

Derek looks at the two kids.

<b>          JASON
</b>I'm Jason and that's Chris! We're
friends with your brother!

They stick out their hands but Derek prefers to check the
scene.

<b>          CHRIS
</b>You're a fuckin' god, man!

<b>JASON
</b>
No shit!

<b>                 DEREK
</b>Do me a favor.  Grab Danny and get
outta here!

The two boys look at each other and LAUGH.

<b>              CHRIS
</b>We just got here, man!

<b>                 DEREK
</b>You what!?

Chris looks at Derek like he's dead.

<b>              DEREK
</b>You don't have any homework?!

<b>              JASON
</b>School doesn't exist anymore, Father.

Derek stares at him, not really knowing what to do.

<b>          CHRIS
</b>I wrote you. Two letters while you
were in there! Did you get them?!

Derek ignores them and weaves his way through the crowd,
causing many an individual to double-take. Chris and
Jason look on in wonderment.

<b>EXT. LARGE, OPEN SHED AREA - A CROWD
</b>
TIGHT ON CAMMERON ALEXANDEr. The older, white trash skin
furiously bangs his sticks on the drums to the song.
Cam's hair is still long but now he's got a swastika
between his eyebrows like CHARLES MANSON. He wears TROY
AIKMAN'S DALLAS JERSEY and a BLACK COWBOY HAT.

DEREK'S POV. He pans right to check out the crowd. A
man pisses out the window. Then to a distinct woman.

IT'S STACEY. Her head is now completely SHAVED but she's
still gorgeous as ever. Derek indulges her for a few
moments until he turns and walks away.  He bumps into a
girl and knocks her drink.

<b>                 CASSANDRA
</b>Excuse fuckin' me!

<b>DEREK
</b>
Sorry.

She smiles at Derek as the SONG comes to a close.

<b>CASSANDRA
</b>
Derek?

<b>          DEREK
</b>Cassandra.

<b>          CASSANDRA
</b>Oh my God! They said you might be
here but I didn't fucking believe 'em!

CURTIS, the M-16 on the side of his head perfectly
intact, walks by Derek. He walks past Derek with his
young son on his shoulders.

<b>          CURTIS
</b>I hope what I heard ain't true, man.
You better hightail it the fuck outta
here if it is.

After a moment, Derek looks away and Curtis heads off.

<b>          CASSANDRA
</b>You gotta chop that mop, Der!

Cassandra lights a brown menthol cigarette.

<b>          CASSANDRA
</b>     (exhaling)
Stacey's meandering around here
somewhere! Have you seen the bitch?!

Derek shakes his head.

<b>              DEREK
</b>The only person I've seen is Seth.

<b>CASSANDRA
</b>Oh God.  I'm sorry.

DEREK'S POV. He sees Cameron puts his arm around her
and kiss her. Cameron sticks his hand down the back of
her pants, smiles, pulls it out, and licks his finger.

Derek watches as Danny delivers a beer to Cammeron.  Ca
puts his arm around Dan and they go into the bedroom.
Stacey looks at Derek and follows them.

<b>                 LIZZY (0. S. )
</b>Are you going in there?

Derek looks down to see Lizzy and Kammi.

<b>          LIZZY
</b>Can you tell Danny that Lizzy's
looking for him?

Derek can only stare at the girl's youth.

<b>INT. LARGE BEDROOM/OFFICE - A SHRINE TO HITLER
</b>
DEREM'S PoV. He stands in the doorwell and listens.
White Power paraphernalia cover the walls. Articles,
posters, everything. The room has a bed, a couch, a
glass coffee table and a desk with a computer on it.
Organized stacks of papers, pamphlets and magazines are
strewn throughout the floor. Cameron sips a beer and
talks with Dan. Stacey listens in the background.

<b>              CAMMERON
</b>He won't do anything'drastic I hope.

<b>              DANNY
</b>I gotta do that paper though.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>I thought you already turned that
fucker in?

</b>My teacher cried to Sweeney, man.

Cammeron laughs.

<b> CAMMERON
</b>Oh man.  Fucking Sweeney.

<b>          STACEY
</b>     (chiming in)
Meanwhile, niggers and spics do their
reports on Malcolm X and fucking Fidel
Castro.

Cameron laughs again but then becomes quickly serious.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>Sweeney's got an agenda, Danny. And
it's all a load of crap. You hear me?
He's all about brainwashing. Don't
get fucking fooled by it.

<b>              DEREK (O.S.)
</b>What the hell are you doing here, Dan?

They all look over.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>     (smiling)
Hey. I was wondering when he was
going to show his face.

Derek doesn't lift his eyes from Danny.

<b>          DEREK
</b>What did I tell you, Dan?

<b>              DANNY
</b>I had to check it out, Der.  Come on.

<b>                   CAMMERON
</b>          He'll be all right, Derek.

Derek shoots Cameron a look and tries another way.

<b>                   DEREK
</b>          There's a redhead out there looking
          for you. Go talk to her.

Danny gets up and walks out. Cam looks to Stacey.

<b>                       CAMMERON
</b>         You go with.

Derek seizes his brother with the eyes as he exits.  Then
Stacey.

<b>                 STACEY
</b>Welcome back.

He just closes the door on her.  Cammeron looks for his
cigarettes.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>You made it, man. When I heard they
threw you in General Population I
thought it was curtains.

<b>              DEREK
</b>It wasn't too bad.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>So what's all this self-righteous,
born-again shit I'm hearing then?

Derek doesn't blink.  Cameron smiles and points to a
chair.

<b>                 CAMMERON
</b>Have a seat, Derek.  Relax.

TIGHT ON CAMMERON. He sparks up a cigi to break Derek's
uncomfortable stare.

<b>              CAMMERON
</b>How was it in there with all those
fuckin' monkeys, man?  You're lucky
they didn't kill you.

<b>          DEREK
</b>I agree.

<b>                 CAMMERON
</b>Who runs the place?  The monkeys or
the wetbacks?

<b>                 DEREK
</b>The Mexicans.
<b>          CAMMERON
</b>It's a fuckin' vacation for them in

Derek and Cam converse over the coffee table.

</b>They're fuckin' peasants, Derek.  All
of them.
         (then)
So what's up, man? I'm hearing a lot
of shit about you.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Be careful with me, Cam. You don't
know what's going on with me.

<b>              CAMMERON
</b>Fuckin' talk to me then. We're family

</b><b>          DEREK
</b>I'm family, Cam? Is that why you came
to see me all the time up there?

Cameron smiles but doesn't know what to say.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>I had to distance myself from you
after that.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Fuck you, Cameron. You're a fucking
chicken hawk...praying on kids.

<b>              CAMMERON
</b>I don't pray on fucking anyone.

<b>          DEREK
</b>No. You fucking use them.  To filter
your insanity.

Cameron smiles in disbelief.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>You and Danny are like brothers to me,
Derek. Come on, man.

<b>          DEREK
</b>He's not your brother, Cameron.  All
right? He's my brother.
     (after a beat)
You hear me, Cam?

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>     (exploding)
Fuck you, Derek! Fuck you! Don't
think you can threaten me with this
shit for a fuckin' second! I'm more
important to him now then you ever
were.

Derek EXPLODES. With his feet, he pushes the GLASS
COFFEE TABLE hard into Cammeron's knees. Cam screams in
agony. Derek SLUGS him in the face and Cam RETALIATES
with two of his own. They wrestle around the room and
push their way into the BATHROOM.

<b>INT. TINY BATHROOM - DEREK AND CAM
</b>
Derek takes Cam by his long hair and SMASHES his face
into the mirror. IT SHATTERS. Derek follows with a
solid punch to the kidney.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>You gonna listen?!

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

Derek bangs Cam's face against the mirror ONCE MORE.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Shut the fuck up! You're gonna stay
away! That's what you're gonna do!

Derek rinses Cam's bloody face off by PLUNGING it into
the toilet. He pulls him back up and they face the
mirror.

<b>          DEREK
</b>It's over.

Derek stares at him in silence. CAMMERON RETALIATES. He
forcefully backs Derek into the wall behind him. He
throws two punches at Derek -- one in the stomach and one
to the face that opens his lip. He misses on his third
and Derek gets the upper hand.

BACK TO THE MIRROR. Derek prepares to crash Cam's face
into the shards of glass one last time. The final blow.
As Cam screams, Derek launches him forward then pulls
back at the very last moment. Derek, noticing Cam's
condition, throws him into the tub.

Derek throws him a towel, grabs one for his lip, and
exits.

<b>EXT. SHED AREA - A GROUP OF 20 NAZI'S
</b>
They SALUTE the band and chant as they tune up for
another set. The singer inquires about his DRUMMER.
Derek pushes his way through and spills a few beers cn
the way. Cassandra smokes a cigarette with a few random
skins as Derek passes by.

<b>                 RANDOM SKIN
</b>Hey Derek!?

<b>DEREK
</b>What?!

<b>CASSANDRA

Jesus, Der.  What happened?

<b>CURTIS

Where's Cammeron, man?!

<b>              DEREK
</b>I haven't seen him.

Cassandra looks at him curiously and then focuses her
attention to the bedroom.

<b>STACEY (O/S)
</b>
Hey!

Derek turns around and faces her.

<b>          DEREK
</b>         (pointing his finger)
Stay away from me.

<b>              STACEY
</b>Don't point your fucking finger at me.

<b>              DEREK
</b>I'm serious, Stacey!  Stay away!

She grabs and pulls on his shirt.

<b>          STACEY
</b>What are you gonna do?! Hunh?! Hit
me?! Kick me as I roll on the fuckin'
ground screaming?!
     (then)
That bullshit with Cammeron is
nothing, Derek!

<b>                DEREK
</b>I don't care.

Stacey looks deep into his eyes and can feel it.

<b>          STACEY
</b>Goddamn you, Derek! Those two niggers
deserved what they got. They deserved
to die! And just like Cameron and
Seth and a million others out
there...I'll believe that 'til the day
I fucking die. I will. Nothing will
ever change that either.

Derek breaks from her grasp and walks away.

<b>EXT. PATIO - DEREM'E POV
</b>
He looks over to the kegs. Through the sliding glass
window, he sees Seth taking a "tap hit" off the keg. All
the guys in the b.g., INCLUDING DANNY, count and cheer.
Seth sucks the tap while skins count in the background.
Derek walks out and watches Dan pump the keg.

<b>                 ET AL
</b>Forty-five! Forty-six!  Forty-
seven...!

Seth removes his mouth from the tap and belches like a
pig. All the guys laugh.

<b>          SETH
</b>     (grabbing Danny)
Why the fuck did you pump it?! I
coulda gone for a minute at least!

Danny looks over and meets eyes with a bloody Derek.  He
FREEZES while everyone turns to look Derek over.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>Let him go, Seth.

Seth sees blood on Derek's face and shirt and takes a
moment to identify the source. He draws his 9mm Baretta
and points it at Derek's head from four feet away.

<b>                 SETH
</b>Where's Cameron?

Derek stares directly into the BARREL.

<b>          DANNY
</b>(frightened)
Seth, man!? Come on!

Seth puts the gun directly to Derek's cool head.

<b>          SETH
</b>I'd be doing America a great fucking
favor, let me tell you.

<b>                 STACEY
</b>Do it, Seth.

Seth glances at her and Derek quickly GRABS the pistol.
A shot goes off and people hit the deck. Derek wrestles
the pistol away and punches Seth in the STOMACH. Falling
to the ground in pain, Derek cracks him in the face once
more and it's over.

<b>INT. CAM'S BATHROOM - CASSANDRA AND CURTIS
</b>
They walk in and look at Cammeron, bleeding in the tub.
Curtis pulls the METAL TOWEL HOLDER off the wall and
storms after Derek. Cassandra laughs.

</b>You got fuckin' guests out there, Cam.

<b>EXT. PATIO - SAME
</b>
Derek tosses the gun over the fence and looks to Danny.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Come with me right now.

He looks at his brother. He then sees Curtis and three
other skins come through the house. Derek stares at Dan
and hauls ass down the back alley.

DANNY'S POV. Curtis arrives and tends to Seth rather
than go after Derek. Confused and mildly embarrassed,
Danny bolts back into the house to get his board.

<b>CUT TO:

<b>EXT. VENICE BLVD. - SLEEPING HOMELESS

Danny passes them on his board as he conguers the cracks
in the street at an incredible rate. He turns the tight
corner and cuts off a turning car. The man yells.

Danny spots his brother walking twenty yards up on the
left-hand side of the street and crosses. Approaching
quickly, he skates faster and faster as Derek nears a BUS
STOP BENCH. Hearing the board, Derek turns to face the
clickity clack behind him.

DANNY LUNGES FROM HIS BOARD AND TACKLES DEREE. The two
crash into the street as a car henks from the inside
lane, barely missing the duo. Danny punches his brozher
in the face.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Fucking asshole!

Derek gets on top of his brother, spots a speeding car
heading right for him, and pulls his brother to the
sidewalk. Just in time.

</b>What the luck are you thinking!?

<b>          DANNY
</b>What are you thinking!? Friends don't

together!

<b>          DEREK
</b>They're not friends, Dan!

<b>              DEREK
</b>Just sit there and relax for a second.

<b>          DANNY
</b>I don't wanna relax!  You looked like
an idiot back there!

Derek stares and sits next to him. Cars and homeless
randomly pass in the b.g. Danny looks at his brother,
transfixed in thought.

<b>              DANNY
</b>What's happened to you, Derek?

TIGHT ON DEREK. He looks into his brother's eyes.

<b>DISSOLVE TO BLACKNESS:

</b>
<b>FILING OUT OF THE CELL.
</b>
The morning drill. His roommate, an old Latino guy,
right behind. Derek's eyes cast among the inmates,
noting everyone and looking for a friendly face. He
notes a familiar tattoo, catches the guy's eye and nods.

<b>WALKING THROUGH THE CAFETERIA.
</b>
Derek with his tray. A sea of tables divided by race. He
spots a tiny island of white guys at a distant table. He
looks at STEVIE THE LEADER, but gets a nod from the HUGE
ARYAN next to him. Derek moves to sit with them.

<b>A WIDE SHOT OF THE YARD.
</b>
From a distance, he approaches the Aryan corner. They
casually greet each other. Derek then looks over to the
HUGE ARYAN from the cafeteria and to STEVIE MCCORMICK,
the crazy looking leader. Derek walks over and shakes
their hands.

<b>INT. PRISON LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

Derek quietly folds towels with a young, chattering black
man.

<b>          YOUNG MAN
</b>You got lucky, man. I was in the
kitchen for a year before making it in
here. Pots and motherfucking pans...
disgusting beef stroganoff shit...
boiling hot water...fuck that!
     (looking over)
My name's Lamont, man.

Derek doesn't even look at LAMONT.  Stone cold, he
continues folding.

<b>          LAMONT
</b>I got your back. Righteous white
Cracker with attitude. Just like the
Judge who sentenced me, man.

Lamont laughs but then becomes serious.

<b>         LAMONT
</b>If your smart though you'll remember
one thing. You're the nigger in here.
Not me.

DEREK'S POV. He sees Stevie McCormick conferring with a
Mexican gang leader.  The Mexican hands Stevie a joint
through a handshake.

Derek turns and talks to two white guys who seem
impressed. Stevie walks up and takes a hit off his
joint.

<b>          STEVIE
</b>I was just talking about you.  You're
Cammeron's boy?

Derek turns and stares at him.

<b>          DEREK
</b>His boy? No, I don't think so, man.
I'm not anybody's boy.

<b>          STEVIE
</b>Well...you know what I mean.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Nooo, I don't know what you mean.

Derek and Stevie lock eyes.  Stevie sneaks a hit and
offers Derek.

<b>              STEVIE
</b>Here, man. Relax and have a hit.

Derek stares at him.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Nooo...how about you getting that
fucking shit awax from me?

Stevie looks at him, ready to kill. The other two can't
believe Derek's gall. Stevie shrugs.

<b>          STEVIE
</b>You got a problem, man?

<b>          DEREK
</b>Excuse me? Do I have a problem? No,
I don't have a problem. Do you have a
problem?

<b>                 STEVIE
</b>No. I don't.

Stevie stares at Derek and walks off. He turns back
again and he and Derek lock eyes. He walks back to his
group.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Who the fuck are you?

Derek turns back to the other two and they are already
walking away. Derek looks at the two and back to Stevie.
Stevie sits with HUGE ARYAN and says something to him.

Derek looks over and meets his eyes.
Lamont sees this and laughs.

Just for a second.

<b>                   LAMONT

                 Let me ask you this one though cause I
                 don't know the white man's take. You
                 like eating pussy?

Derek can't help but smile.

<b>          LAMONT
</b>Oh man! You sick fucking bastard!
You sick pig!

<b>                 DEREK
</b>And you don't!?  Shut up.

<b>         LAMONT
</b>Man...you don't know shit about the

Derek laughs and the two continue to converse.

A group of White Aryans are gathered in the yard. Derek
plays basketball with a mixed assemblage, including
Lamont. Derek continues to look over every now and then
at Stevie and his group. Stevie suddenly smiles towards
Derek.

Not understanding what it's all about, Derek turns
'around. Standing there is HUGE ARYAN and his STOCKY
 FRIEND.. They proceed to beat the shit out of Derek right
 in the middle of the court. The players circle as Derek
 rolls on the ground. He gets bombarded with kicks and
 punches, a few even coming from randoms on the court.

Derek looks over to the white table and they something
amongst themselves. They break into laughter. Derek
thinks about eating somewhere else, but there's nowhere
to go. He walks BACK over to the white table and looks
at STEVIE.

<b>                 STEVIE
</b>How's your face, man?

Everyone laughs. Derek sits and eats, his tail between
his legs.

<b>                 STEVIE
</b>That'll teach you.  Don't be a prick
to your superiors.

Stevie walks by himself and smokes a cigarette. He turns
a corner and standing there waiting for him is DEREK.
Derek stares him down.

</b>What do you want?

<b>          DEREK
</b>I'm right here, man. You wanna have
it out with me, let's go. Just me and
you though.

<b>          STEVIE
</b>Man...you are a stupid motherfucker.
You know that? When are you--?

Derek cracks him in the face and Stevie falls to the
ground.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Stupid?! You have anything else to
say, you little pussy! Hunh?!

<b>         STEVIE
</b>Fuck you!

Derek kicks the man a few more times and takes off. A
few black prisoners laugh at Stevie from the PING PONG
<b>TABLE.
</b>
<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. PRISON SHOWER - MORNING
</b>
Derek puts his head down under the warm water and closes
his eyes. From out of nowhere, he is slammed out of
frame to the floor. HUGE ARYAN'and his STOCKY BUDDY from
earlier proceed to beat him. Bathers leave and after a
few moments, Stevie's boys drop their TOWELS.

<b>              HUGE ARYAN
</b>Well well well. A virgin.

</b>You ain't so tough now, are you?

The two men smile at each other, kick him and exit.
After a few seconds, LAMONT enters with the cart and
picks up dirty towels. He spots Derek laying on the
tile.

<b>                 LAMONT
</b>Motherfucker. What now, man?

He tends to Derek. He picks him up, throws him over his
shoulder, and carries him off.

<b>                   LAMONT
</b>         Shit, holmes.
               (carrying him)
         Hang on to me, man. You're heavy.

<b>INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - EVENING

Derek lies on a table, silent.  A Mexican DOCTOR examines
his ass.

<b>          DOCTOR
</b>Well, you do have some tearing down
here. Christ. Okay. I'm gonna have
to stitch you up so I'll be back.    

The doctor passes Dr. Sweeney on his way out. Derek hears
Sweeney talk to the doctor and turns his head. The two
look at each other for a long moment. Sweeney sits down
next to him and puts his hand on Derek's shoulder. Derek
finally breaks down and sobs.

Sweeney and Derek in mid-conversation.  A small lamp
shines off their faces.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Honor and loyalty run thick, Derek.
Not skin color. Skin is thin. I
don't get you, man.  I don't.
         (after a beat)
I got my Doctorate in Education...not

come into this world evil...you're
fucked up, Derek. You're way to smart
to believe that shit.
     (then)
There's nothin' more beautiful Derek,
nothin' more pure, nothin' more

<b>             DEREK
</b>They killed my father, Sweeney.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Jesus Derek. Use that brain God gave

Think, man. None of your guys back
home give a shit about you.
     (after a beat)
They only care about your brother.
The new blood. And he sure as hell
can't take care of himself like you
could.

Derek looks at the man with regret.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Get me outta here, Sweeney.

Sweeney looks at the young man, heavily weighing his
options. The two lock eyes.

Derek reads by himself on the cement stairs by himself.
A shadow approaches from behind.

Derek turns his head and sees LAMONT standing there.

<b>          DEREK
</b>All right.

How are you?

<b>          LAMONT
</b>I'm fucking incarcerated, man. With a

Derek looks at the young man and can't help but laugh.
Derek slowly gets up and limps past Lamont.

<b>          LAMONT
</b>What are you gonna do, man?

Derek looks at him for a few moments, still shaken.

Hey Mom.

<b>DORIS

Hello.

The two sit there and stare at each other for a few
moments.

<b>          DORIS
</b>Dr. Sweeney called me. He spoke with
a guy on the parole board here.
     (then)
He thinks you might be getting out
soon.

Derek nods and stares at his mother, broken.

<b>              DEREK
</b>How are the others?

<b>          DORIS
</b>Davina's good. UCLA Math major.
     (frustrated)
All three of you have always been so
great in school. I wonder why all
this--

<b>              DEREK
</b>What about Dan, Mom?  How's he?

<b>          DORIS
</b>He's doing the same stuff you were
doing, Derek. Hanging out with
Cammeron, getting into trouble. It
brings back a lot of sad memories.
And I can't do anything...he won't
listen to me. He needs you.

Derek stares at his mother like it's the last thing he
wanted to hear.

The two rub heads as DEREK puts his arm around him.
Danny squeezes back and Derek kisses him on the top of

Derek stares at himself in the mirror. A million
thoughts race through his head as computer keys echo in
the b.g. He looks at all of his tattoos and SCARS.

TIGHT ON HIS UPPER BODY. He stares at the SWASTIKA on
his tit. He puts his hand over the tattoo to see what
he looks like without it. He turns on the shower and
gets inside.

<b>129 INT. SHOWER - TIGHT ON DEREE

As he soaps himself down, the soap slips out of his hand

time before he bends over to pick it up. He immerses his
face into the shower faucet and thinks to himself.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY

He sits back down at the computer and looks back at his

types a sentence.

muscular, receding hairline, zero facial hair. Handsome.
A pretty and well-dressed Doris SINGS while she scrambles
eight eggs with mushrooms and peppers.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>That was Dad. They were best friendS.
Fathers and sons are never best
friends...but they were..

YOUNGER DANNY stares at his larger-than-life father with
a cap turned backwards. Doris breaks from song and yells
to the back.

<b>          DORIS
</b>Breakfast!

<b>              DENNIS
</b>Okay! Let's go, Davina! Derek!

<b>              DORIS
</b>So what's this all about, Dennis?

Dennis doesn't hear because his attention is on Danny.
YOUNGER DEREK, donning a flat-top haircut and no tattoos,
walks into the kitchen. The smiling athlete has his
backpack and blue VENICE HIGH gym bag. He drops it all
onto the ground and sits at the table.

<b>                 DENNIS
</b>Good morning.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>Good morning.

Doris sets food in front of her two sons and they both go
to work. Young Danny eats quietly.

<b>              DORIS
</b>What about this gang stuff?

<b>          DENNIS
</b>Jesus Doris...it's not that big of a
deal. All departments have to take a
precaution class on gang patrol today.

<b>          DEREK
</b>What for?

<b>          DENNIS
</b>A guy was shot yesterday in
Inglewood...changin' a valve on a
hydrant. LAPD is worried that more
firefighters will become targets.
That's what this bullshit is about.
     (sipping his coffee)
A good father this guy was though and
now he's in intensive care because of
some goddamn--! They've pretty much
declared war on LAPD and us.

<b>          DORIS
</b>Why you guys though? I can see them
but the fire department?

<b>          DENNIS
</b>They think we would rather let a
building burn down over there than
fight it. So now we got two fights
goin' on at one goddamn time.

Dennis takes a bite of his eggs and explodes.

</b>I'm coming right now! Jesus!

<b>          DENNIS
</b>I'll tell you one more thing. This

me up the fucking wall. Firefighters
gettin' 99's on their tests while
rappers who score a goddamn 62 walk
away with the job.

<b>         DANNY
</b>Don't we have to have "affirmative
action?"

<b>              DENNIS
</b>Not when a job requires ability.  No.

<b>          DORIS
</b>A lot of people say otherwise, Danny.

<b>          DENNIS
</b>A lot of people don't know shit,

Doris just stares at the back of her husband's head like
she wants to smack it. He turns back and disarms her
with a look.

<b>          DENNIS
</b>If I'm fightin' a brush fire...

<b>          DORIS
</b>Nooo...what you don't see are

<b>          DENNIS
</b>Doris! I'm tired of your damn

<b>          DEREK
</b>Sweeney actually had a pretty good
take on affirmative action the other
day.

<b>          DENNIS
</b>     (smiling)
Really? I didn't know you spoke
"African", Derek? Where'd you learn
that shit? Johannesberg?

Dennis laughs and Derek eventually smiles. Danny looks
at them, not really understanding. Doris stares down
Dennis.

<b>          DORIS
</b>Honey? Please don't speak that way.
They don't--

<b>          DENNIS
</b>How am I speaking, Doris!? Hunh?!
I'm speakin' fineP
     (quickly to Derek)
Hey. Don't let that him confuse you
over there, Derek. Look at me. This
shit he's pulling is a load of crap.
Hey. Look at me, Derek. I mean it.
If we keep givin' niggers everything,
there'll be nothing left for us.

Derek and Danny stare at their father, not knowing how to
react.

<b>          DORIS
</b>You can be a stupid son of a bitch
sometimes.

<b>              DENNIS
</b>And then we have naive fools like her.

<b>          DORIS
</b>I really hate you with a passion some

An upset Doris exits the room past YOUNG DAVINA.  Dennis
looks to Derek.

<b>              DENNIS
</b>You know what I mean though, right?

<b>        DEREK
</b>(nodding)

Yeah.

<b>          DAVINA
</b>         (to the family)

Her lips glare excessively this morning.

<b>          DENNIS
</b>Well...good morning, Miss Monroe!

<b>          DEREK
</b>I like that color, Davina.

<b>DAVINA
</b>Thanks
<b>                 DENNIS
</b>You did like it.

Dennis reaches over and wipes it off with his napkin.

<b>                   DAVINA

         Come on, Dad.

<b>          DENNIS
</b>Yeah. Well you're lucky I'm letting

<b>                 DAVINA
</b>That sucks, man.

<b>          DENNIS
</b>It totally sucks. And we all

Everyone laughs but Dan, still shaken over his mother.

Danny shakes his head no.

<b>         CAMMERON
</b>Well...we might be pussies too if we
got treated the way he did.

<b>                 SETH
</b>What do you mean?

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>Stevie McCormick called...old school
Venice bro. He's at Chino...doin'
life. He hated Derek.
     (exhaling)
Said he was a fucking blow-up doll in
there.

<b>          SETH
</b>         (overwhelmed)
Fucking A.

Seth continues to eat.  Cammeron looks out the window and
hates what he sees.

<b>              CAMMERON
</b>Oh Christ. You gotta be kidding me?

<b>SETH
</b>
What?

CAMMERON'S POV. A large, mature and sharp-looking BLACK
MAN helps A BEAUTIFUL BLOND out of a RED BMW. THEY KISS.
Cammeron is at a loss for words. Cam puts out his
cigarette as the couple ENTERS.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>     (looking at the two)
Is there anything sacred in this
country anymore? Jesus Christ. Hey.
Stop feeding your face for a second
and look behind you.

Seth turns his head and stares at the interracial couple.
He turns back to Cam and sings a verse from the famous
atevie Wonder song, EBONY AND IVORY. Cameron laughs.
The black man turns and looks at the two.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>Can we help you with something? Do
you have any questions about the menu?

<b>                 BLACK MAN
</b>No questions.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>I recommend either the "Big Ben
Burger" or the "Chicken Taco Special."
Ben'll replace the dark meat with the
white meat if you ask nicely.

<b>          BLACK MAN
</b>     (fed up)
What's your problem, pal?

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>I ain't your fucking pal first of all.
Secondly...I don't have problems.
People who luck with me have problems.

<b>              WHITE GIRL
</b>Come on. Let's get out of here.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>Hey! What a great idea! You got a
clever little whatever it is there.
I'd listen to it if I were you.

<b>                 BLACK MAN
</b>You're not me.

<b>          CAMHERON
</b>     (smiling)
And I thank God Almighty every day for
that, believe me.

<b>                 SETH
</b>Excuse me? Tyrone?

<b>          BLACK MAN
</b>My name's not Tyrone either.

<b>SETH
</b>Whatever.  Why can't you stick to your
own race?

<b>          WHITE GIRL
</b>     (disgusted)
Jesus Christ! Where do you assholes
come from?!

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>What the luck difference does it make
where we come from, bitch? I'm from a
place called America. A place that
used to be a nice place to live before
it became fuckin' Africa-America.

<b>               BLACK MAN
</b>You ignorant mother--

Seth quickly gets out of his chair and makes his gun
totally visible to the couple.

<b>          SETH
</b>You got a fuckin' death wish, asshole?
Do you? Make your move now if you do.
If you don't...get the luck out of my
sight. Cause I'm real close to
shoving my piece up your girlfriend's
stinky pussy.

The black man stares at the gun sticking out of Seth's
belly. He grabs his girlfriend and walks out of the
joint. Seth sits back down and the two laugh. Cameron
looks over at Ben and raises his hands in the air.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>     (smiling)
Everything's hunky dory, Ben!  No
problemo. Only us white folk.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. BEDROOM - A DIGITAL CLOCK
</b>
It reads 2:36 a.m. Shiftless Derek lifts a sleeping
Danny off the computer keyboard. He helps him into the
bottom bunk, tucks him in, and watches him snooze.

<b>             DEREK
</b>     (softly)
Did you "save" it?

An asleep Danny nods. Derek slowly walks back into the
bathroom to grab his towel off the floor. He looks at
his SWASTIKA TAT in the mirror and sighs to himself. He
turns off the light and exits.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. BURGER JOINT - SETH AND CAMMERON
</b>
Seth finishes his display of gluttony.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>It wouldn't irritate me so much if the
ratio was a little more even.

<b>                 SETH
</b>What's that?

<b>         CAMMERON
</b>       (going mad)
Ebony and Ivory back there! Almost
all of those orange kid relationships
are black man and white women and I'm
fucking sick of seein' it! I wouldn't
mind so much if it were more even.

<b>                 SETH
</b>Huge dicks, Cam.  That's all it is.

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>I used to think that too but...it's
gotta be more, man. It has to be more
than the fact they they carry a big
load. Chicks aren't that shallow, are
they? It's politically correct...
that's what it is. White
women...bein' seen with the
coloreds...it's great for their image.
Bitches today want to be known as
bein' fuckin' color blind.

<b>              SETH
</b>They get off on it.

<b>              CAMMERON
</b>And you can't really blame Tyrone.

<b>                 SETH
</b>Why the fuck not?

<b>          CAMMERON
</b>Well...how'd you like to drag around
some fat fly girl? I wouldn't.

<b>          SETH
</b>No shit.
     (imitating)
Oh go girlfriend! Don't be puttin' up
wid dat, girl! Oh stop girl!

Seth and Cammeron laugh and head outside--leaving a mess
on the table.

<b>EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - THE CHEROKEE FROM EARLIER
</b>
The white vehicle gets passed by cars left and right.

<b>INT. CHEROKEE - HENRY'S POV
</b>
Henry sits up front with JEROME, nervous and scared.  The
three thugs in back lock and load.

<b>                       LITTLE HENRY
</b>          You gonna waste 'em?

<b>                       JEROME
</b>          Only if we have to.

Jerome grabs a baseball bat and they quietly get out.

<b>INT. VAN - TIGHT ON LITTLE HENRY
</b>
Me bites his nails and watches the foursome sneak up on
an oblivious Seth and Cammeron.

<b>EXT. GRAVEL PARKING LOT - HENRY'S POV
</b>
The men close in. Seth and Cam are blind to it.  Jerome
raises the bat as they close in and we--

<b>FADE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING - BIRDS CHIRPING
</b>
Danny stares at himself in the mirror and tries to find
some stubble on his chin.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - A SLICK DEREK
</b>
He stares into the mirror in a coat and pants.  Danny
rushes to get his things together.

<b>          DANNY
</b>I'm printing it up and we're out of
here.

<b>          DEREK
</b>Hurry up.

Derek walks out into the living room.

<b>INT. MESSY LIVING ROOM - DORIS
</b>
She's on the couch watching cartoons. She takes a jar of
Vick's Vapor Rub and puts some on her chest. Derek walks
in the room, bends over and kisses her on the forehead.
Davina sits on the couch and writes. Derek just smiles.

<b>              DORIS
</b>Wow. What happened?

<b>              DEREK
</b>I gotta see my parole officer.

<b>              DAVINA
</b>Hey Der? Do you have Excel on disk?

<b>             DEREK
</b>I've got everything on disk.

Davina smiles and walks into the back bedroom.  Doris
looks at Derek.

<b>                 DORIS
</b>You look good.

Derek smiles and caresses his mother's cheek.

<b>          DEREK
</b>We're getting out of here soon.  Is
that okay with you?

<b>          DORIS
</b>I'd love it.
     (after a beat)
Do you think I should color my hair?

<b>DEREK
</b>
Yes.

He sits beside his mother and enjoys the moment.  He
thinks to himself.

<b>          DORIS
</b>I'm glad you made it back. I wasn't
too sure I was going to see you again.
You know how I get.

Filled with regret, he nods.

<b>          DEREK
</b>You think you'll be able to forgive
me? Someday maybe?

<b>              DORIS
</b>You're my son. Of course I will.

Derek smiles and can't believe his tearful reaction.

<b>              DEREK
</b>Look at me. I'm such a pussy.

<b>                 DORIS
</b>No you're not.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. VENICE BLVD. - A NEWSPAPER MACHINE
</b>
Derek plunks a quarter down the slot and removes a copy
of the LA TIMES. Danny continues to skate ahead of him.
Sensing danger, Derek looks back behind him. With no one
in sight, he walks into a doughnut shop.

<b>INT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - DEREK'S POV
</b>
He takes a guarded look outside. Everything seems
normal. A bus drives by. A group of Mexican laborers,
dressed for work and smiling, walk past in the other
direction.

Inside, a black woman orders a dozen doughnuts from a
short Korean.man behind the counter. Her young daughter
grabs her leg. Danny sits down and reads Derek's paper.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>What do you want?

<b>              DANNY
</b>Maple bar and a...large milk.

Derek smiles at the little girl while he waits. She
wanders from her mother's leg and over towards Derek.

<b>          DEREK
</b>         (to the girl)
You look pretty.

She laughs.

<b>          TISHA
</b>Thank you.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>How do I look?

<b>       BLACK GIRL
</b>(bashfully)
Fine.

DANNY'S POV. He looks up from the paper.  He watches the
girl together with his brother.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>What's your name?

<b>BLACK GIRL
</b>
Tisha.

<b>         DEREK
</b>How old are you, Tisha?

She holds up four fingers. Derek smiles.

<b>         BLACK MOTHER
</b>         (staring at Derek)
Come here, Tisha.

Tisha returns to her mother and they quickly exit. Derek
watches the girl as she continues to stare at him as they
make their way down the street.

Outside, a BLUE FORD screeches out front. Rasmussen and
the Young Mark Fuhrman type from earlier get out and
wait. Dr. Sweeney meets the duo and together they walk
inside.

<b>                 DEREK
</b>What's goin' on?

<b>              SWEENEY
</b>We need to talk, Derek.

<b>              DEREK
</b>How'd you find out I was here?

<b>              SWEENEY
</b>We were just at your apartment.

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>Cammeron and Seth are in the ICU at
St. Johns, Derek. They were jumped in
front of Ben's Burgets early this
morning.

Derek thinks to himself for a few more seconds.

<b>          DEREK
</b>How bad?

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>They'll live.
     (then)
They must have been looking for
somebody else.

Derek stares at Rasmussen and walks away.
Sweeney, who knows to walk over to him.

He eyes

TIGHT ON SWEENEY AND DEREK. The two lock eyes.

<b>         SWEENEY
</b>Are they coming after you?

<b>          DEREK
</b>Fuckin' A.

Sweeney sighs.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>I don't know.
     (after a long beat)
You might have to talk to your old
crew though.

Derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his
brother.

<b>              DEREK
</b>I can't, Sweeney.

<b>                 SWEENEY
</b>Try, Derek. Okay?

Derek senses the danger in his voice.

<b>       SWEENEY
</b>Okay?  Before it explodes.

Sweeney walks away and then turns back to Derek.

<b>                 SWEENEY
</b>And watch your back.

Derek nods.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>(back to Danny)
You showing up today?

Danny looks at Sweeney and nods his head yes.

<b>SWEENEY
</b>
Good.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. VENICE HIGH - DEREK AND DANNY
</b>
They are outside the fence surrounding the field.
Students head off to morning class.

<b>        DEREK
</b>Hey. Keep your head up, alright?  I'm 
going to take care of this.

<b>DANNY
</b>How?

<b>          DEREK
</b>I don't know. I'll figure it out
though. You gonna be okay?

<b>DANNY
</b>Yeah.

The two stare at each other as THE BELL RINGS.

<b>              DANNY
</b>I gotta turn that paper in.

Danny hops the fence with his backpack on. He looks back
at Derek. Cops #1 and #2 sit in their car in the b.g.

<b>DEREK
</b>Hey.

<b>DANNY
</b>What?

<b>          DEREK
</b>Come here.

Derek puts his hand over the fence. Danny walks up and
clasps it -- FINGERS INTERTWINED. Derek wants to say one
thing but something else comes out.

<b>              DEREK
</b>I'll see you at home.

Danny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear
phones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother
through the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy
and they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns
and walks down the street.

<b>          COP #1
</b>You need a lift anywhere?

<b>DEREK
</b>Nope.

Derek stops in his tracks, walks back over to the fence,
and stares at the school.

<b>INT. MESSY HALLWAY - DANNY AND LIZZY
</b>
Students rush past them. Danny kisses Lizzy and she
hurries off to class. He pushes on the men's room door.

<b>INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - SAME
</b>
Danny enters, sets his "AMERICAN HISTORY X" PAPER on top
of the sink, and takes an unearthly long piss at the
urinal. He finishes, flushes and turns.

Standing there is LITTLE HENRY. A GUN IN HIS HAND.

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Jesus Christ.  What are you doing,
Henry?

<b>          LITTLE HENRY
</b>     (afraid)
What does it look like I'm doin'?

<b>                 DANNY
</b>Come on, man, no.  You don't want to
do this. Come on.  Henry?

THE DOOR SMACKS OPEN and Danny moves to grab the pistol.
It discharges and a bullet rockets into Danny's chest.
He SLAMS back into the URINAL and gasps for air. The
force of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground. The two
kids who just entered bolt for help.

Danny slides to the tile, leaving a bloody trail. The
two stare at each other - EYE TO EYE. THE BLOODSTAINED
PAPER falls into the DAMP SINK. Danny inhales like glass
is raking his lungs.

<b>              LITTLE HENRY
</b>         (terrified)
Danny?

Danny's breathing slows to a choked whisper.  He blinks,
coughs, twitches. And dies.

<b>                       LITTLE HENRY
</b>         Vinyard? Danny?

Henry watches teary-eyed with the same altered look Derek
had after killing Lawrence. Together they FREEZE on the
cold tile floor.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. HALL AT VENICE HIGH BATHROOM - YELLOW POLICE TAPE
</b>
Officers and detectives monitor the area. Young
students, including Lizzy and her friends, stand around
and cry. Rasmussen brings THE BLOODY PAPER over to
Sweeney. Sweeney looks at it for a moment but is
interrupted.

<b>          RASMUSSEN
</b>He won't let go. Will you talk to
him?

<b>INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK AND DANNY
</b>
Derek cradles his bloody brother. Sweeney walks over,
crouches, and talks to Derek's back.

<b>         SWEENEY
</b>Derek? You gotta let him go, man.
They gotta get him outta here.

<b>DEREK
</b>
I can't.

Derek begins to cry outright. He can't control himself.
He lets go of Danny's corpse and charges out into the
hall.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DORIS AND DAVINA
</b>
Derek embraces them. Doris grabs his face -- torn
between love and hate. Guilt-ridden, Derek tears from
them and storms down the hall with Sweeney soon in tow.

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Derek! I know what you're thinkin'
right now and I want you to forget
about it!

<b>          DEREK
</b>How the luck do you know what I'm
thinkin', Sweeney!?

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>Cause I'm thinkin' the same damn
thing!

Drowning in rage, Derek turns back to a misty eyed
Sweeney.

<b>              DEREK
</b>They shot him in a fucking...pisshole!

<b>          SWEENEY
</b>And goin' after them won't bring him
back. Don't do it, Derek. Please,
man. You've come too far. The war is
over.

Derek contemplates the situation and presses his tongue
against his teeth, crackbrained. Sweeney slowly
approaches and cautiously wraps his arms around the young
man. Derek buries his tearing face in Sweeney's
shoulder.

<b>              DEREK
</b>It stops now, Sweeney.

Sweeney nods and the two lock eyes. Derek makes his way
back to Doris and Davina and together, they grieve.

<b>              DANNY (V/O)
</b>We've heard it a million times, a
Bible quote become cliche: "Vengeance
is mine, sayeth the Lord."

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - DANNY AND HENRY
</b>
A still of the two immediately after the murder. We move
in tighter and tighter until we get close on Danny.

<b>          DANNY (V/O)
</b>Vengeance brought about by hate...and
fear. When it points its head in our
direction, we take notice and
everything changes. The way we choose
our friends, the way we protect our
families, the way we create enemies
out of strangers.
     (then)
Welcome to America.

TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES. They are gently pushed shut by
Henry's two small BLACK FINGERS.
