          FADE UP ON:
          SPACE. Infinite stars. A TITLE:

          1870. THE ARIZONA TERRITORY.
          We descend past DARK CLOUDS. Violent FLASHES ripple within.
          Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON...

          A BONFIRE -- SILHOUETTED BODIES -- APACHE WARRIORS
          Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses --
          a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION. On the periphery, we FIND...
          A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN. Softly singing to the even more
          beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO --
          A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the
          baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes.
          But.
          The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF
          LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET:
          FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!!

          THE E IRE TENT IS RIPPED UP INTO THE SKY, LEAVING THE WOMAN AND
          HER BABY-EXPOSED!!!! She SCREAMS -- grabs her child and starts
          to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR --
          Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some
          superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we
          WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS --
          And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE

          DOWN, CRASHING LIKE COMETS TO THE CANYON FLOOR AND CRUSHING

          FLEEING PEOPLE.
          Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap
          open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE --
          faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND.
          THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her
          baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK. Over which we read:
          C--() ... .-4ï¿½_ s A N D A

          EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

          burning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on... A MAN.
          Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD.
          We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a
          MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet.
          COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where
          the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side...
          .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve
          this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist:
          A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the
          surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT!
          And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to
          shield his eyes... but STOFS:
          A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young,
          beautiful. SMILING.
          The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat?
          The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches
          toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS.

          THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE:
          THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough.
          Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          Howdy.

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          We're riding towards Absolution. You
          know how far west we are?
          The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about.

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          Maybe he's a dummy.
          Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          There a reason you don't wanna answer my
          question, friend?
          And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --

                         MOSE CLAIBORNE
          Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and
          he's been shot.

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          Bet he's a chain jumper.
          Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         LUKE
          If he escaped, there'll be a bounty.
          Let's bring him with us.
          Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back
          scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn
          round and start walking.
          But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes
          steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --

          WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D)
          Dead or alive, no difference. I said

                         WALK OR--
          THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle
          forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE
          MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST!
          As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again --
          SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER
          Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on
          his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          -- P-please, God -- d-don't --
          -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY.
          Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down,
          knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds.
          This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't
          seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at
          his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake.
          The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES
          on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks
          it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --

          "TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY

          OUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN -- STOP

          -- ABSOLUTION AWAITS -- STOP"

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (a hoarse whisper)
          Absolution...

          SLAM TO MOMENTS LATER:
          With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the
          third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off...
          sees the dog following...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
          Get outta here. Leave me alone.
          But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man
          turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN
          VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is:

          EXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY

          A CROOKED SIGN: "ABSOLUTION." The town is dismal and forgotten.
          Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in --
          dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him.
          His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          BAM! The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER. The Man
          looks at the dog and says --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Stay.
          The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's
          moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey --
          uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound --
          then A PISTOL COCKS behind him --
          Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:

                         MEACHAM
          Palms to heaven, Friend.
          The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Been shot.

                         MEACHAM
          Only two kinds of men get shot --
          criminals and victims.
          (steps forward; hard)
          Which one're you?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          don't know.
          Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when
          he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening...

                         MEACHAM
          Got a name, son?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Don't know that either.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         MEACHAM
          What do you know?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (a beat; then)
          ... English.
          Off Meacham, INTRIGUED -- we CUT TO:

          INT. CHURCH RECTORY - LATER

          A CANDLE FLAME -- a NEEDLE passing through it -- it's LATER and
          Meacham's studying The Man's wound:

                         MEACHAM
          Odd wound. Looks... cauterized.
          (off The Man's look)
          Means somethin' burned it half closed.
          The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans
          over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to
          twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the
          strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet?
          The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?"
          Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Try'n hold still.
          He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces
          slightly, but bears the pain.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Where'd you ride in from?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          West. Woke up in the desert.
          Looking up at the sun like I'd been
          dropped outta the sky.

                         MEACHAM
          Seems I remember a story about that
          happening once... fella by the name of
          Lucifer.

                         (GRINS)
          How 'bout I just call you "Luke," for
          short.
          But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror:
          his own face unfamiliar. Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          That blood yours or somebody else's?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Three men rode up. Drew on me.

                         (STILL CONFUSED)
          My hands... moved on their own.

                         MEACHAM

                         (A BEAT)
          Anything else you wanna confess to while
          you got my attention?
          And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is... but:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Everything that happened before I woke
          up...
          (shakes his head)
          It's gone.

                         MEACHAM
          Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for
          your sins if you don't recall 'em. That
          bein' said...
          Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n'
          brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          I seen bad men do good things and good
          men do bad things. Whether you end up in
          heaven or hell... it's not God's plan...
          it's yours.

                         (BEAT)
          You just got to remember what it was.
          The Man considers. Darkly --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          What if I don't want to remember?

                         MEACHAM

                         (BEAT; GRINS)
          Then you're probl'y goin' to hell.
          On cue -- SMASH!!! The stained glass window EXPLODES as a
          MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church. FIRE spreads around
          the pews -- MEACHAM ACTIVATES -- tears curtains off the
          confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men!
          WHOOPS and HOLLERS and GUNSHOTS outside! The Man whirls to see
          A DOZEN MEN ON HORSEBACK, marauding through town --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Their leader is PERCY DOLARHYDE, a cocky, hot-tempered bastard --
          he ignites another Molotov, hurls it at the CLAIMS OFFICE --

                         PERCY

          THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM MY FATHER! ONLY

          CLAIM TO LAND AROUND HERE'S THE ONE WITH
          HiS NAME ON IT!
          The gang rides down Main Street, HOOTING -- Percy cocks another
          Molotov, aiming for the SALOON --
          But one of his men, half-Apache NAT COLORADO, shouts:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Percy! N2t the saloon!

                         PERCY
          Why the goddamn hell not?!

                         NAT COLORADO
          Cause your dady said so.
          Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes "daddy." Percy GLARES
          -- strange RESENTMENT between them. With a growl, Percy GALLOPS
          OFF, chucks the flaming bottle onto the CHURCH STEPS:

          INT. MEACHAN'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          Meacham finishes putting out the fire, grabbing a couple
          blankets as he moves past The Man --

                         MEACHAM
          You wanna help or are you just gonna
          stand there and burn?!

          EXT. CHURCH - PORCH - CONTINUOUS

          FRIGHTENED TOWNSPEOPLE run for the sanctuary of the church,
          Meacham SWATS OUT the fire on the steps --

                         MEACHAM
          All right, folks -- don't panic! Get
          inside and you'll be fine... C'mon...
          Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the
          street to the GENERAL STORE which is just STARTING to burn --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Put it out before it gets goin'!
          ON THE MAN, not sure how he suddenly became the damn fire
          brigade, but HUSTLING across the street to --

          THE GENERAL STORE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          WHIPS open the blanket, beats at the flames advancing toward the
          roof -- PUTS THE FIRE OUT as the door FLIES OPEN and out steps:
          A KID. 11. Rough n' tumble. And right now, mouth full of
           LICORICE. Two FULL JARS of CANDY in his hands. OOPS:

                         KID
          Just tryin' to save the candy.
          (SWALLOWS, worried now)
          You one of my Pa's hired guns?
          Before he can answer, HOOFBEATS behind them -- and here's PERCY.
          He yanks the reins, pulls his REVOLVER on our Man --

                         PERCY
          Who the hell're yam?
          Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is, THIS is it:

                         THE MAN
          Nobody.

                         PERCY
          Nobody is right. You think you can just
          collect your fifty dollars and ride off?
          You signed up for the wrong side, boy.
          The kid's scared. The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face:

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          Tell you what. You get down on your
          knees and kiss my boot.
          The Man's eyes narrow --

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          You do that and I'll let you run back to
          wherever the hell you came from so you
          can tell whoever you see...
          (cocks his gun)
          Absolution belongs -tg..th-e- 1Dolar es.

                         THE MAN
          You want me to kiss your boot?
          Percy extends his boot just INCHES from The Man's face:

                         PERCY
          Tongue's just fine if you're feelin'
          amorous. Don't hold ba --
          THWIP! The Man YANKS Percy's boot off his foot in one quick
          move and KWHAM!!!1 WINGS IT RIGHT INTO PERCY'S FACE!
          Percy FLIES off the HORSE -- The Man grabbing his rifle -- the
          moment Percy lands, it's STICKING into his NECK:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         THE MAN
          Kiss this, you sonofa --

          NAT COLORADO (O.S.)

          -- PUT IT DOWN !
          -- Nat Colorado gallops around the corner, SHOTGUN RAISED.

                         PERCY
          Goddamnit, Nat -- SHOOT HIM!!!
          -- but The Man yanks Percy up by his collar, using him as a
          SHIELD between himself and Colorado. Eerily calm --

                         THE MAN
          Wherever you came from? Go back.
          Colorado knows he's dealing with a PROFESSIONAL. MORE GANG
          MEMBERS ride up, surprised -- a dirty outlaw, GREAVEY, barks:

                         GREAVEY
          Sheriff's right behind us, Nat!

                         PERCY
          You goddamned shitheels! Don't you even
          THINK about leavin' me!!!!
          Colorado -- DECISION -- doesn't take long -- glares at The Man --

                         NAT COLORADO
          Be seeing you.

                         THE MAN
          Look forward to it.
          With that, Nat spurs his horse -- YA! The others follow him as
          he RIDES HARD out of town. Percy growls at The Man --

                         PERCY
          You are a dead man. You hear me? So
          help me God I will kill you my--
          DM! The Man's SMASHES Percy's skull with the gun, knocking him
          OUT COLD, as LAWMEN approach on horseback --

                         KID
          FA! He caught Percy Dolarhyde!
          SHERIFF KYLE TAGGART rears up on his horse. Tall, dark and
          handsome despite a SADNESS in his eyes, already dismounting:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Emmett -- you all right?
          The Kid (now EMMETT) strides towards his father excitedly:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         EMMETT

                         YOU-SHOULDA-SEEN-IT-HE-TOSSED-PERCY-L IKE-
          a-f lap jack- then-stared-down-Nat-Colorado-
          like-he-wasn't-even-scared!!!!
          Taggart turns to The Man now, cautious, but grateful --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Pardon my boy, mister. He can be
          excitable.
          (puts out his hand)
          Kyle Taggart.
          The Man shakes Taggart's hand. A beat. Then --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          . Luke.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Well I'm in your debt, Luke. Tune of
          fifty dollars, actually.
          (off The Man's look)
          Our advert? The telegram?
          The Man NODS -- Oh, RIGHT.

           SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Could use a man like you in case any of
          'em come back...

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          -- I'm just passing through.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Fair enough. You don't mind spending the
          night, bank opens in the morning... I'll
          get you your money then.
          (nods down the street)
          Saloon's got rooms. You just tell Maria
          I sent you.
          The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett (still STARSTRUCK), turns
          to go. Taggart furrows his brow as the DOG scampers after him.

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          You here with the prospector woman?
          The Man stops. Intrigued. Turns back --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          woman?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Yup. Real looker. Came into town
          yesterday with that there dog. She a
          friend of yours?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          ON THE MAN. His first real LEAD.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Maybe.
          And as The Man heads off, we HOLD ON TAGGART, his spidey-sense
          tingling that all is not RIGHT with this...

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Somethin' wrong, Kyle?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's that French sayin' where you swear
          you seen someone before?

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Don't speak French.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          No... you sure's hell don't.
          Taggart takes one last look at The Man departing as we CUT TO:

          EXT. CATTLE RANGE - MAGIC HOUR

          300 head of CATTLE under a blood red sky -- BOOM DOWN to THREE
          RANCH HANDS by a fire. One's drinking liberally from a BOTTLE;
          call him ROY CLANTON. The other two trade glances, nervous:

                         RANCH HAND #1
          Should take it easy there, Pal --

                         RANCH HAND #2
          Mr. Dolarhyde don't like it when we drink
          on the job.

                         ROY CLANTON
          I don't give a damn what he don't like --
          gotta sit here and babysit a damn herd of
          cattle. Dolarhyde ain't gonna do squat.
          (rises; grabs his

                         CROTCH)
          Gotta see a man about a buffalo...
          He lets out a big BURP and stumbles off behind a ridge. More
          THUNDER. Something doesn't feel right. A sudden WHOOSH and --

          A COW'S PULLED INTO THE AIR BEHIND THEM BY SOME INVISIBLE FORCE,
          JUST LIKE THE APACHES IN OUR OPENING! Flies STRAIGHT UP, out of
          FRAME. Its PLAINTIVE MOO blending into all the others:

                         RANCH HAND #1
          You hear that?

                         RANCH HAND #2
          Hear what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          ANOTHER COW zips up from the herd behind them. And ANOTHER.
          MANY OF THE SWSSHS. The men slowly turn toward the sound as --

          ALL AT ONCE, HUNDREDS OF COWS FLY OFF INTO THE SKY!

                         RANCH HAND #1

          SWEET JESUS!!!

          THE DARKNESS EXPLODES WITH EERILY BRILLIANT BLUE LIGHT! THE MEN

          SCREAM AS THEY'RE ENGULFED IN IT AND --
          ROY CLANTON -- comes RUNNING back up the hill, pulling up his
          pants as the light DISAPPEARS -- to find the men GONE. So are
          the COWS. PULL BACK... he's ALL THAT'S LEFT in the open range.

          INT. GOLD LEAF SALOON - NIGHT

          THE BATWING DOORS SWING OPEN: The Man In Black enters with the
          dog, tips his hat to a couple WHORES. They GRIN, liking what
          they see. RANCH HANDS drink their pay. Behind the bar, a MAN
          and WOMAN argue. DOC and MARIA; she's a buxom Mexican beauty;
          he's 300 roly-poly pounds of ANXIOUS CASTILIAN JEALOUSY:

                         DOC
          -- I know you are, don't lie to me!

                         MARIA
          How many times do we have to do this,
          Arturo? J. love you.

                         DOC
          Really? Do you?!?
          (holds up a POCKETWATCH)
          I found this in our bed! And I don't
          k3 Vg. a watch, Maria. I can't AfjQrd a
          watch because y insisted we buy this
          saloon!
          She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld. As The
          Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this:

                         MARIA
          We have customers.
          And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the
          back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses:

                         DOC

          AFUERA! ADULTS ONLY!!!
          Emmett RUNS OUT. The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS.
          The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a STEAK on Atticus' plate:

                         ATTICUS
          That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll
          drill him down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         MARIA
          Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who
          took out Percy Dolarhyde.
          Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before
          sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria
          rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          I'm looking for a woman.
          She gestures to the WHORES --

                          MARIA
          What kind?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          This kind.
          He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat. The one of the WOMAN.

                         MARIA
          Never seen her before. But she is
          beautiful.
          (pours him whiskey; then
          one for herself)
          Here's to you finding her, Senor.
          ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK
          glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another:

                         MARIA (CONT'D)
          You have any idea what kind of mess you
          just stepped into?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          No. But I figured I'd be safe in here
          seein' as how that boy I tossed off his
          horse didn't wanna burn your saloon.
          Maria's eyes go down. Somehow GUILTY. But then:

                          - -

                         MARIA
          It's not the boy you should worry about.

                         (OMINOUS)
          It's his papa.

          EXT. RANCH - NIGHT

          POV: UPSIDE DOWN, A MAN, surrounded by his RANCH HANDS -- his
          FACE just out of the light, hat brim lowered under an oil lamp:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde. I'm what you
          might call, the Tall Hog at the trough.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          His face comes INTO light: 50's, tailored finery, patent leather
          Wellington boots that bespeak wealth. HARD. Exudes POWER:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          You're Roy, right? Clanton, is it? Been
          working for me two weeks now, and I
          haven't had the pleasure.
          Our POV belongs to ROY CLANTON, the ranch hand from the cow
          abductions. TERRIFIED -- his arms and legs TIED TO THE SADDLES
          OF TWO HORSES, kicking dirt in front of Dolarhyde's RANCH HOUSE:

                         CLANTON
          Mr. Dolarhyde, I... I swear I didn't

                         STEAL YOUR--
          -- a VIOLENT "SSST" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses --
          STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP -- he SCREAMS --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the
          horses skittish.

                         (THEN)
          You partial to history? Here's a primer,

                         LISTEN CLOSE:
          He pulls out a WHIP, gripping it by its STERLING SILVER HANDLE.
          Starts CIRCLING the horses as he lets the whip UNFURL:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Following the War Of Northern Aggression
          -- what some ironically refer to as the
          "Civil" War -- came a prodigious nation-
          wide market for beef. Cowtowns sprang up
          all along these prairies, Roy; populated
          by enterprising young drovers -- among
          'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde. Sold
          six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted
          to him by Robert E. Lee for twenty of the
          scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then
          turned 'em into the fattest herd West of
          the Chisholm Trail.
          (stops: the WHIP)
          Watched him work this lash, driving those
          steer til his fingers bled... but what
          good's a whip without a herd, Roy?
          And slowly, torturously, SWEEPS the whip tip in the dirt...

                         ROY CLANTON
          Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me
          -- I went to take a piss and and -- saw a
          light in the sky -- blue -- and when I
          ran back the cows and fellas were gone!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         DOLARHYDE
          The sky. Opened up. And took my cows.
          Incoming HOOFBEATS -- Dolarhyde looks up to see COLORADO and the
          rest of the GANG returning from Absolution.
          A WOMAN emerges from the servant's quarters. APACHE. 50's.
          Beautiful. As the men REAR, Nat Colorado MEETS EYES with her.
          A relationship we don't understand yet as Dolar strides up --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Where's Percy?

                         NAT COLORADO
          Jail. Sheriff locked him up.
          Dolar darkens. Unsheathes a KNIFE. Looks down at Roy:

                         DOLARHYDE
          When're these people gonna lgarn?
          He STABS the knife down... SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's
          FEET. His lower body SLUMPS to the ground, he breathes a SIGH:

                         ROY CLANTON

                         THANK Y--
          Dolar SLAPS the horse's rump, to which Roy's UPPER TORSO is
          tied; it GALLOPS off, dragging a SCREAMING ROY into the night.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Everyone saddle up. Got us a sheriff to
          kill.
          As he MOVES OFF, Dolarhyde's eyes go to the Apache Woman.
          Something passes between them. She seems CONCERNED.

                         NAT COLORADO
          Wasn't the sheriff, got him caught. It
          was a stranger.
          That STOPS Dolarhyde. He turns back, face dark:

                         DOLARHYDE
          ... What stranger?

                         NAT COLORADO
          Usually a man gives off a scent. Where
          he's been. What he's done.

                         (STILL SPOOKED)
          He didn't have one.

          OFF DOLARHYDE, EYES BURNING --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

          INT. SHERIFF TAGGART'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          A BULLET, in close up, twirling between the thumb and forefinger
          of SHERIFF TAGGART. Boots up on his desk, TROUBLED.
          Deputy Wade pours himself a cup from a TIN POT OF COFFEE:

          DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE
          Percy wouldn't've come in shooting
          without his daddy's say-so, Kyle. You
          best get ready for a war 'cause that's
          what's comin'.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Tomorrow we ride the little shit up
          Phoenix way, turn him over. Dolarhyde's
          got a beef, he can take it up with the
          6th cavalry.
          Taggart's on his feet, grabs his JACKET off the door --

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Goddamn tired of this... fatass rancher
          scaring good people off their lan--
          He STOPS. Something catches his eye on the posting board.
          YANKS a piece of paper off, a mixture of CONFUSION and CONCERN

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Sonofabitch.
          WHAT DOES HE SEE? Before we get a chance to KNOW --

          EXT. SALOON - NIGHT

          EMMETT'S FACE rises into frame, peering into the saloon from
          below a windowsill. Sees THE MAN IN BLACK at the bar as ---

          INT. SALOON - NIGHT

          -- he SLUGS back a shot, the dog at his feet, still eyeing that
          steak on Atticus' plate. The Man points to his GLASS:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Another.

                         MARIA
          You drink like a man who wants to forget.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (haunted; the irony)
          Other way round.
          The dog WHINES AGAIN for the steak. Atticus SLAMS down his
          silverware. Draws his GUN --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         ATTICUS
          You got three seconds to get your dog
          outta here or I blow his balls off.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (without a blink)
          Not my dog.

                         ATTICUS
          Q=... two...
          -- and just before "three"... CA-CLICK. Atticus FREEZES,
          because there's a RIFLE BARREL at the back of h,iS head now:

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Give you odds you don't get to 'three.'
          RACK TO FIND the person holding the rifle is A WOMAN.
          Beautiful. EXOTIC. Dressed in leather. Meet ELLA SWENSON.
          ON THE MAN IN BLACK. Can't help himself. immediate and
          undeniable CHEMISTRY. But she pays him no mind -- makes a PSST
          sound and the dog snaps to her side. Atticus uncocks his gun,
          slowly slides it back in the holster --

                         ATTICUS
          I was just havin' some fun, Miss --

                         ELLA
          Give- him, the steak.
          Atticus HESITATES, angry at the humiliation. Ella PRESSES THE
          GUN HARDER against his neck, lowering him -- and his plate -- to
          the floor. Right in front of the dog, who GROWLS --

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Now say you're sorry.

                         ATTICUS
          (biting his tongue)
          I'm-- sorry.

                         ELLA
          His name's 'Happy.'
          HappyBARES HIS TEETH. INCHES from Atticus' face

                         ATTICUS
          I'm sorry... 'Happy.'

                         ELLA
          Alright then.
          (lowers her rifle)
          You're right. That was fun.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.
          -- Atticus scrambles back to his feet and OUT the door, as Ella
          looks at the Man In Black:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          What're you doing with my dog?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          I was hoping you could tell me.

                         ELLA
          The hell're you talking ab--?
          WRIST BRACELET. Surprise and REVELATION:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Where... did you get that?
          Before he can answer, SHERIFF TAGGART enters, along with DEPUTY
          WADE (carrying a SHOTGUN), and 5 other deputies. They move
          cautiously to THE MAN, like he's a powder keg about to go off...

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Hey there, "Luke." Mind following me
          down to the office so we can have us a
          chat...?

          THE MAN IN BLACK

                         (CONFUSED; ALERT)
          What for?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          All due respect, I'm the law, mister.
          That's what for.
          The men LOCK EYES:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Tell you what, Sheriff. How about you
          keep the fifty dollars you owe me and I
          just walk outta here like we. never met?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Because we did meet.
          ON ELLA. For reasons we're not sure of, the idea of The Man
          leaving ALARMS her. All the Gunslingers' hands are POISED by
          holsters. The Man stays preternaturally COOL:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          L can't be accountable for what happens
          if they draw on me.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          And what's gonna happen?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Best you don't find out.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Now why'd you have to go and say that?
          Taggart gives a nod and the men start to CONVERGE --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (low; genuine plea)
          Don't.
          But Charlie makes a MOVE and The Man SLAMS his head into a pole
          -- the NEXT GUNMAN reaches for his pistol -- The Man PUNCHES his
          THROAT -- SLAMS the third into a bench -- The FOURTH straight
          down on the Faro table --
          TAGGART levels his REPEATER -- but The Man just GRABS the barrel
          as Taggart FIRES a ROUND into the ceiling -- now the rifle's in
          THE MAN'S HANDS and just before he PULLS THE TRIGGER on Taggart:
          HE SEES EMMETT AT THE WINDOW. About to watch his father's
          MURDER... and The Man LOWERS the gun:

          THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
          I told you, I don't wanna hurt anyb--
          CRACK! The butt of a PISTOL WHIPS the side of his SKULL! The
          Man DROPS as we REVEAL who just knocked his ass OUT:
          ELLA! Taggart draws a gun and pins The Man, whipping out that
          piece of paper he pulled from his office...

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Yup -- looks just like him.

          NOW WE IT'S A WANTED POSTER WITH THE MAN'S FACE ON IT:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          "Jake Lonergan. Scourge a' The
          Territories. Wanted Dead or Alive."
          And The Man... now forever known as JAKE... stares WOOZILY into
          his OVERTURNED HAT... the photo tucked inside of the BEAUTIFUL
          WOMAN... her image goes BLURRY... then mil{:

                         AND WHAM:

          MEMORY FLASHCUTS1 STROBELIXE IMAGES --
          1.) A tilted, handmade trail sign: "SAGUARO PASS."
          2.) We're in a CABIN somewhere. BLINDING ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT
          EXPLODES INTO THE CABIN, against which a DEMONIC SILHOUETTE
          appears -- it looks like an INDIAN IN FULL-FEATHER HEADDRESS --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          3.) A WOMAN'S FACE -- THE WOMAN FROM JAKE'S PHOTOGRAPH -- she
          looks at us and SCREAMS --
          4.) Now we're someplace VERY DARK -- a cave? As some kind of
          TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes --
          5.) Now we're RUNNING through the cave -- ESCAPE -- BREATHING
          HARD -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us
          as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see:
          6.) A STRANGE ROCK FORMATION on the rim of a canyon -- like a
          STONE TOWER pointing to heaven as the SUN WHITEWASHES US TO:

          INT. JAIL CELL - PRE-DAWN

          JAKE'S EYES OPEN and he GASPS AIR! His POV: a FACE comes into
          FOCUS -- PERCY DOLARHYDE. GRINNING at him from the next cell:

                         PERCY
          You're a dead.
          Jake sits up. Woozy. Blinking back to reality.

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          My daddy's comin' for me, Boy. You're
          gonna end up another dead shitheel under
          his spurs. I am gonna watch you suffer
          for a long, long --
          Jake moves LIGHTNING QUICK -- reaching through the bars,
          GRABBING PERCY'S COLLAR, YANKING FORWARDS -- SLAMMING Percy's
          head into the bars, KNOCKING hIM OUT COLD AGAIN. Percy DROPS.

                         JAKE
          Shut up.
          Jake sits back on his cot, rubbing his still-throbbing head.

          EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - JAIL - CONTINUOUS

          A PRISON WAGON pulls up in front of the Sheriff's office, along
          with Taggart's GUNMEN on horseback. ELLA takes frame as the men
          dismount and head into the office -- she pursues DEPUTY WADE
          with a real sense of PURPOSE:

                         ELLA
          I need to see Lonergan. It's important.

                         DEPUTY WADE
          'Fraid not, Miss -- we're preppin' him
          for transport.
          And pushes PAST her, into the office with the men. HOLD on Ella
          -- dammit, she NEEDS to find a way in there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

          INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS

          A KEY in the LOCK as the cell door OPENS: Sheriff Taggart, Wade,
          the gunmen. GLARING at Jake, then noticing Percy --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What happened to him?

                         JAKE

                         (DEADPAN)
          Man walked into a bar.
          Taggart shakes his head as Charlie and a deputy unlock Percy's
          cell, CUFF HIM, drag him out. Taggart points to Jake:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Step back against the wall there. Move
          and I shoot you dead.

                         JAKE
          (as he does)
          You should've let me go.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Yeah, I should've shot you in your knee.
          You put down six of my deputies.

                         JAKE
          Six was all you had.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Hell, they're gonna love you in Phoenix.

                         JAKE
          Yeah? What's in Phoenix?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What you got comin', Jake Lonergan.
          Taggart reaches into his shirt, pulls out a pair of GLASSES.
          Slips them on his nose. Takes out that WANTED poster and reads:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Aggravated banditry, 17 counts, Forgery,
          Blackmail, Hijacking, injurious use of a
          cattle prod, Arson, Incitement of
          Whorehouse Riot, and Trespassing with
          intent to deflower. You're also leader
          of a gang of outlaws includin' Creek
          Johnson and Bull McCade, which makes you
          accessory to every law they broke too.

                         JAKE
          (after a long BEAT:)
          That it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Saved the best for last... 'Murder.'
          That LANDS on Jake. Wondering if this is TRUE. Evenly --

                         JAKE
          It say who I killed?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Prostitute outta Mojave, name of Alice
          Wills.
          Taggart rises, removes Jake's BLACK STETSON from a hook on the
          wall, pulls that PHOTOGRAPH OF THE WOMAN from the inner brim:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          If I were a bettin' man, I'd say this
          would be Ms. Wills, would it not?
          Jake just stares, CONFUSED. SHAKEN.

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          They found her dead in a cabin round
          Saguaro Pass, twenty miles west of here.
          With that, a CLUE falls into place: SAGUARO PASS.

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Deed was in your name.
          He slips the photo back in the brim, tosses the hat to Jake:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Dead hooker with a hole in her chest, in
          your cabin, plus your sterling reputation
          equals guilty as goddamned sin.
          (draws his GUN)
          And you're gonna hang for it.
          At gunpoint, Taggart PUSHES Jake out the door --

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - DAWN

          Against the RISING SUN, Dolarhyde and 15 GUNMEN ride hard, armed
          to the teems. They REAR in the hills above Absolution. Dolar
          looks down through BINOCULARS as NAT COLORADO turns to...
          an incoming WIND. Across the valley, a massive BLACK CLOUD
          is starting to SWIRL. Violent BLUE FLASHES within. Eerie.

                         GREAVEY
          blue light... Clanton said he saw
          blue light before the cows disappeared...

                         DOLARHYDE
          Just a storm.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         COLORADO
          No storm I've ever seen... I say we wait
          'til it passes.
          But Dolar isn't listening. THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS: he sees
          PERCY being carried into the prison wagon. Followed by Jake.

                         DOLARHYDE
          No time, they put him in an iron coach.
          With a HYA! he's OFF, the others FOLLOWING with reluctant looks
          -- still SPOOKED by that incoming STORM:

          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          As Jake's loaded into the prison wagon after the still-
          unconscious Percy, he SEES MEACHAM through the barred window.
          The preacher flashes SYMPATHY as Wade takes out the cuff key:

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Gimme your wrist.
          Jake holds out his hands. Wade unlocks one wrist, freeing a
          cuff... then takes that cuff and LOCKS IT to Percy's wrist.

                         JAKE
          What're you --?

                         CHARLIE
          Best way to make a man stay put: chain
          him to his enemy.

                         (A GRIN)
          You lovebirds have a nice trip now.
          SLAM: the door CLOSES and LOCKS. Jake SIGHS and tries to sit
          back, but it's hard tethered to Percy's slumped form. Shit.
          Then QWW -- something starts to STING and he looks down:
          HIS BRACELET. Has started PULSING RED. And it's getting WARM.
          Jake stares -- ON EDGE -- what the hell's happening? As --
          OUTSIDE, Taggart mounts the buckboard. EMMETT feeds the horses:

                         EMMETT
          You sure he's a bad guy, Pa? He did give
          Percy a lickin'.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          He's bad enough.

                         EMMETT
          (not so sure, but --)
          . can I come with you?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Too dangerous.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         EMMETT
          Dangerous to drive a damn coach? Why
          can't Charlie just take him?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what
          these people pay me to do. And your
          mother would kill me if I brought you.
          Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --

                         EMMETT
          Good thing she's already dead then.
          And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing
          he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS:
          THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster
          toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE.
          IN THE COACH -- WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing
          growing MORE FREQUENT -- and then, a VOICE:

          ELLA (0.S. )

          HEY!
          Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Tell me where you got that bracelet...

                         JAKE
          Maybe you should'a asked before you
          knocked me out..

                         ELLA
          Please... I need to know. Just tell me
          where you got it.

                         JAKE
          Y dOli' .xBmbgX - - I don' t remember my
          name or where I've been or any of the
          things they said I done, so leave me the
          hell alone.
          And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the
          dust. Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback
          cover the coach in a protective ring.
          Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH:

                         DEPUTY WADE

          KYLE!!!
          Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

                         DAMNIT --
          He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons --
          ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too --
          This is about to get UGLY. BUT... from the OTHER end of town,
          the WIND picks up --
          As the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have STORED AT A
          H -- its EYE churning, ROARING and... TWO BOLTS OF BLUE
          LIGHTNING CRACK DOWN FROM IT! Happy starts BARKING MADLY. Ella
          sees the lightning and starts to BACK AWAY in fear:

                         ELLA
          NonoNO -- GET TO YOUR CELLARS! EVERYONE

          UNDERGROUND NAT!
          But her cries are LOST as -- RRRRRRRR!!!!!

          A LONG, NARROW FUNNEL SHOOTS FROM THE CHURNING CLOUD: A TORNADO!

          BREAKING THE MOMENTUM OF THE SHOWDOWN --
          The stagecoach UPENDS, FLIPPING SIDEWAYS as the animals try to
          break free -- Taggart and his men are THROWN --
          Inside, Jake and Percy TUMBLE end-over-end -- SLAMMING into
          walls, LOCKED TOGETHER -- JARRING Percy back to consciousness --
          Dolarhyde's men are THROWN from their horses too as the animals
          STAMPEDE OFF in different directions --
          THE 1Q8k=O ENGULFS THE TOWN! THE CONCUSSIVE BLAST BUCKLES

          BUILDINGS, PULLING WHOLE SECTIONS OF THEM INTO THE SKY!

          THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE. SHERIFF'S STATION. BROTHEL. WOOD

          STRIPPED RIGHT OFF THEIR FALSE FRONTS LIKE PIANO KEYS!
          Okay, wait. Just wait. Take a breath. 'Cause it's
          about ... . to get... . MORE insane...

          TEN MANTA RAY-SHAPED HOVER-SPEEDERS BURST FROM THE CYCLONE!
          ROARING into the town, FLYING just above ground --

          TOWNSPEOPLE'S FACES -- GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE -- 19TH

          CENTURY BRAINS TRYING TO PROCESS THE IMPOSSIBLE --

                         MEACHAM
          Jesus God!!
          STRANGE STEEL RINGS fire from the speeders and mushroom out --
          KA-CHING! -- SNAP OPEN and CLAMP around necks, arms, legs -- and
          from these steel collars, CABLES LASH OUT, whip-snapping back to
          the speeders and TETHERING MAGNETICALLY to them --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          Yeah-these are HIGH-TECH LASSOS:

          HELPLESS VICTIMS ARE YANKED OFF THE GROUND AND PULLED BEHIND THE
          SPEEDERS LIKE ROPED STEER! Two of TAGGART'S GUNMEN. Now some
          of DOLARYHYDE' S. Screaming, just gone. THIS IS A...Qlp lam.
          EMMETT -- stunned -- as SHERIFF TAGGART runs for him --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

          EMMETT !
          Emmett runs into his dad's embrace --

          EMMETT SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's happening?! -- Stay _by-mvside!
           A_LIVERY_STABLE -- the HORSES stamp in their stalls as Taggart
           tears the door open and rushes Emmett inside; as he's about to
          follow... am c1:t lU 01 If

                          EMMETT

          PA!!
          -- a STEEL CABLE fires from the collar, SNAPS TAUT as it
          connects to a speeder and WHOOSH! Taggart's RIPPED off his
          feet, dragged away -- ELLA tackles the boy as ANOTHER RING zooms
          overhead, locks around a FLEEING WOMAN -- she's TAKEN --

                         EMMETT (CONT'D)

          THEY TOOK HIM! LEMME 9Q11!!

          -- HE'S COMING INTO FOCUS -- TEARS IN HIS EYES --

                         EMMETT

          BIRDCAGE THEATER!
          With a "C'MON!!!" she rushes him through the FRENZIED CROWD --

          INT. PRISON WAGON - CONTINUOUS

          JAKE AND !MERCY -- TRAPPED IN THE UPSIDE-DOWN COACH -- Jake sees
          DEPUTY WADE on the ground just a few feet away, head bleeding --

                         JAKE

          HEY!! LET US OUT!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          -- but WHOOSH! A METAL COLLAR CLAMPS AROUND WADE AND YANKS HIM
          AWAY! Percy STRUGGLES wildly against Jake in a TUG-O'-WAR:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)

          STOP PULLING AND GIMME YOUR HAND--!

                         PERCY JAKE

          -- THE HELL FOR-- ?! -- I CAN GET US FREE! GIMME

          YOUR DAMN HAND!!!
          Percy RELENTS. Offers up his hand. Jake grabs all of Percy's

          FINGERS, TIGHTENS HIS FIST AROUND THEM -- CRRRRAAACKI
          SNAPS THEM BACKWARDS!!!!! Percy SHRIEKS as Jake KICKS him back
          against the wall, FORCING Percy's hand out of the cuff -- and
          now Jake's UNTETHERED too!
          THROUGH THE CROWD -- DOLARHYDE hears his son SCREAM. SEES the
          overturned coach and TWO-FINGER WHISTLES to:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Colorado!
          Nat Colorado RACES IN as Dolar draws his .45 -- BANG! --
          shatters the coach lock -- they PULL Percy out:

                         PERCY

          MY FINGERS!! HZ BE= MY FINGERS!!!

                         DOLARHYDE

          QUIT WHININ' AND FIND A HORSE!
          As Dolar runs for his horse, Percy sees a PISTOL left on the
          ground -- grabs it with his good hand and FIRES at Jake who
          JUKES behind the coach for cover, Percy SHOOTING in a FURY but:
          -- KLINK! A collar CLAMPS around Percy's neck and he's YANKED
          OFF TOO! Dolarhyde turns and SEES HIS SON DISAPPEAR:

          INT. MEACHAM' S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          Meacham ushers people into the church as WALLS SHAKE, PEWS JUMP:

          INT. BLACKSMITH'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          DOC AND MARIA burst in, huddle under a window. Across the room,
          a YOUNG MAN clamps a hand over his TERRIFIED WIFE's mouth --

          CRAAASFI! MORE RINGS SMASH THROUGH THE WALL, YANKING THE YOUNG

          COUPLE THROUGH IT! ANOTHER RING CLAMPS AROUND MARIA'S NECK!

                         MARIA

          AYUDAMEEEEEEE!
          Doc LEAPS after her but her collar's LASSO CABLE whips out,
          TETHERING to a passing Speeder and she's RIPPED OUT THE DOOR --

          MARIA!!!

          EXT. BIRDCAGE THEATER - CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

          ELLA -- hurrying Emmett toward the theater's CELLAR DOOR, but a
          SPEEDER circles around and ROARS toward them --
          ON JAKE. He SEES this -- and suddenly, to HIS surprise as much
          as OURS... HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! METAL COMING TO LIFE,
          coiling up around his arm -- WHAT? HOW? -- as it becomes...

          A SMART GUN BLASTER WE PON! A HOLOGRAPHIC SCOPE MATERIALIZES,
          tracking that speeder as it DESCENDS on Ella and the mother and:

          BALLLLAMMMI THE BLASTER FIRES A PULSE, VAPORIZING THE SPEEDER

          MID-AIR! THE RECOIL HURTLES JAKE BACK 15 FEET, INTO A WALL.
          Ella reaches the CELLAR DOOR with Emmett. LOCKED. Sees a
          HATCHET in a stump -- rips it out and HAMMERS the lock to bits:

                         ELLA
          Everyone inside! GO GO GO!!
          Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT --

          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          JAKE stumbles up... as a speeder FIRES A RING AT HIM. But
          reflexively, his WRIST WEAPON FIRES ANOTHER BLAST, vaporizing
          it! He looks down at the blaster: "Hell y ."
          Another speeder circles around -- KABOOM! The blaster's
          incredible firepower SPIRALS THE SPEEDER OUT OF CONTROL, it

                         CRASHES INTO:

          INT. MEACHAM'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          The speeder PLOWS through, parishioners flee -- the CHURCH BELL
          breaks from the BELL TOWER -- CRASHES DOWN ON THE SPEEDER --

          EXT. TOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          As Jake keeps FIRING, the last speeders turn tail and RETREAT --
          disappearing back INTO THE TORNADO as the cloud overhead OPENS
          UP and INHALES the swirling mass, which spirals to the heavens.
          ... GONE. The massive cloud seems to VAPORIZE and the DESERT
          SUN returns... debris flutters... smoke clears...
          And all... is... STILL.
          As our CAMERA RISES to reveal... HALF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN

          SUCKED INTO THE SKY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          From the rubble, SURVIVORS EMERGE: EMMETT and ELLA from the
          cellar with inhabitants. DOLARHYDE. DOC. Al in SHOCK:

                         DOC
          Maria -- oh God-- they t-took her-- What
          just...?
          MOANS, WAILS... desperate cries as people search for loved ones.
          JAKE'S BLASTER -- RETRACTS, folding in on itself -- shrinks down
          to size, reverting back into a BRACELET. He's stunned. So are
          the remaining townsfolk. DOLARHYDE is first to speak:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Who the hell're ?

                         NAT COLORADO
          He's the one who caged Percy.
          Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake -- wild killer eyes --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Whatwere__tho_se__thinae?

                         JAKE
          -- why're you asking m&?!
          Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm -- THE BRACELET:

                         DOLARHYDE
          This! Where'd you get this?! It was
          shooting the same light beams they were --

                         JAKE
          Let go of my wrist.

                         DOLARHYDE
          -- I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you
          tell me what the he--
          KA-LLLANG!! Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the
          church wreckage, PLOWS through debris. People scatter. And out
          of the church stumbles...
          AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted --
           limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and
          Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES:
          WHUPWHUP -- something SPINNING through the air -- A HATCHET ---

          SCHLUCK!!!! -- EMBEDDING IN THE ALIEN'S HEAD! WHIP TO --
          ELLA, hang iust hurled it. The alien lets out a DEATH RATTLE
          then FALLS FORWARD, the hatchet embedding deeper as it HITS THE
          DIRT. Holy SHIT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          Ella's adrenaline dynamo starts to die down, replaced now by
          SHOCK. And for what seems like the first time, FEAR. She
          EXHALES a crazy breath, stumbles back... as slowly... people
          converge around the corpse:

                         EMMETT
          Is it... dead?
          Jake KICKS the alien. It doesn't move. Happy BARKS --

                         DOLARHYDE
          . The hell j,,a it?

          MEACHAM (O.S.)
          A demon.
          They all turn to see MEACHAM. TERRIFIED.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Revelations 16:14: "For there are
          spirits of demons, showing signs."
          (points to the alien)
          Escaped from hell itself.

                         EMMETT
          Lookit its wrist! It's got one'a those
          bracelet things too!
          Indeed, there on the creature's wrist is an IDENTICAL BRACELET.
          ON JAKE. Mind tumbling. He meets eyes with ELLA. Her face as
          EAGER as his to understand this and now... BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.
          What's that SOUND? Everyone looks at each other. Colorado
          bends closer to the corpse... SCARED...

                         NAT COLORADO
          I think... it's comin' from somewhere
          inside it.
          People look at each other: WHAT NOW? Trying to control the near-
          hysteria they all feel. Finally, Dolarhyde takes a BREATH --
          more BRAVADO than actual courage:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Only one way to find out. We need to cut
          it open.

                         (TO DOC)
          You're a doctor. Got a bone saw?
          DOC snaps out of his stupor, looks up, FREAKED --

                         DOC
          . Are you... serious?
          (looks to them all)

          WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Wake u Those things took your wife --

                         DOC

          I KNOW THAT!!

                         DOLARHYDE
          Well this one here's our only chance of
          findin' where they went.
          That LANDS on all of them. A long beat. Doc looks down at the
          thing, ORANGE GOO dribbling around the AXE in its head...

                         DOLLARHYDE
          So you got a bone saw or don't you?

          INT. GOLD LBAP SALOON - DAY

          THUD! The alien corpse is DROPPED onto the bar by Doc and
          Meacham. As Dolarhyde and Colorado follow through the batwings
          -- Doc WHIPS a SHOTGUN from under the bar:

                         DOC
          Stay outside. You're not welcome in
          here!
          Dolar brings up his COLT -- so does COLORADO --

                         DOLARRYDE
          I own more of this town than any man in
          it so I'll go wherever the hell I damn
          please. And for the record? You ain't
          welcome in my country, Mexican.
          Ella steps between them, BAD ASS --

                         ELLA
          Whatever troubles you had don't mean a
          damn thing against the ones we got now.
          We wanna see our way through 'em, your
          guns better start pointing in the same
          direction, Goddammit.
          Doc and Dolar never take eyes off each other. or their GUNS.
          Finally... Dolar LOWERS his. So does Doc. People BREATHE.
          Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and
          muscles through the creature's viscous outer layers. Doc turns
          his focus to the alien too. Picks up his PUMP-OPERATED BONE
          SAW. Presses his boot on the bellows, it turns with a WHIR...
          SHAKING as he brings the SPINNING BLADE to the alien's CHEST.
          Looks at Meacham, AFRAID --

                         DOC
          If it 'mss a demon, and I cut it open... am
          I going to burn for it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Meacham hesitates a beat, then CROSSES the air in front of Doc --

                         MEACHAM
          That should cover ya.
          ON DOC. Little relief. BROW SWEATING, he brings the spinning
          blade down toward the disgusting ALIEN -- VRRRRZZ -- HESITATES --

                         DOC
          Excuse me.
          B GH! He PUKES on the ground.

                         EMMETT
          Jesus, Doc!!!
          Doc wipes his mouth with a handkerchief, slightly DEFIANT --

                         DOC
          This is not normal. I'm entitled to
          vomit. We should XU be vomiting.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Just cut, Lardass.
          Doc GLARES... with a still-shakitig hand, gets back to business --

          VRRRRZ -- CUTS THROUGH THE STERNUM -- ORANGE BLOOD SPRAYING --
          and... SHUNK! Doc looks up at Jake, gestures to the carcass:

                         DOC
          Senor? A hand?

                         (TO DOLARHYDE)
          You too, maricon.
          The men all grip the chest plate and PULL -- A DISGUSTING CRACK.
          Everyone turns away, scowling, Emmett wafting the air:

                         EMMETT
          Damn! Smells like a dead dog's ass.

                         MEACHAM
          Emmett.

                         EMMETT
          Sorry, Father.
          Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores...

                         DOC
          Chet wall's partially collapsed... no
          familiar organs of any kind...

                         DOLARHYDE
          'course they're not familiar. Just look
          at this th--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          SUDDENLY THE ALIEN'S ARM LASHES OUT -- claws SNAP OPEN and PIN
          Dolarhyde against the wall! Everyone tries to PRY the claws
          from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the
          alien's chest, its arm goes LIMP. Dolarhyde drops, GASPING...

                         DOC
          Spinal reflex.
          And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around
          Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST:

                         MEACHAM
          Something on your neck. Hold still.
          Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb
          and forefinger. The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp:

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          I'll be damned... gold.
          They check the creature's hand talons: GOLD FLAKES underneath
          'em, and Lots of it. Colorado checks its taloned feet:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Down here too.
          (looks to Dolar)
          This much ore... could only have come
          from a digging in a mine.
          That LANDS on everyone. but most especially ELLA. Who looks up
          to see Jake READING her in this moment.

                         EMMETT
          In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT. On/Off/On/Off in
          time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP.

                         DOC
          Gimme my scalpel.
          In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he
          pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE
          dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB:
          -- he takes hold of the blinking orb. It FLARES to life, the
          light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM. Confusion.
          Doc REMOVES it from the optic nerve and the hologram DISAPPEARS:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Where'd it go? The hell'd you do?

                         DOC
          Nothing, just pulled it off --
          He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS:

          I think... it's a compass. Look:
          (fiddles with tweezers)
          No matter how you move it, it points in
          the same direction.

                         EMMETT
          Compasses point north. That's west.

                         MEACHAM
          (realizing; to Jake)
          West's where 141 came from.
          ON JAKE. Another puzzle piece falling into place.

                         EMMETT
          If you're right, what's it pointing to?

                         ELLA
          The rest of 'em.

                         (THEN)
          Be my guess.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Then that's where I'm goin'.
          He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          One of my ranchers said my herd
          disappeared into the sky. 'Til about ten
          minutes ago, I figured him for a liar.
          (SNAPS barrel closed)
          Nobody takes my cattle.

                         MEACHAM
          Your b was taken too.
          A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde -- could that be EMOTION?
          But just as fast, it's GONE. Almost a THROWAWAY:

                         DOLARHYDE
          I noticed.

                         NAT COLORADO
          What if they're already dead?

                         EMMETT
          They're not dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         ELLA
          Kid's right. If all they wanted was to
          kill us, they would've.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Looked to me like... they were ropin'
          people.

                         (THEN)
          Means they need 'em for something.
          Whatever it is, we can either stand here
          guessin'... or go find out.
          His eyes flash to Nat: "C'mon." And they EXIT. Everyone looks
          at each other, working up the courage to face what they know
          they must. Doc grabs his SHOTGUN, starts gathering shells:

                         DOC
          If she's alive -- if there's even a

                         CHANCE --

                         MEACHAM
          Lord hates a coward... but our bullets
          were useless against those things. Other
          than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and
          outnumbered.
          As one by one, they turn... to JAKE. Who until this point has
          been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now -- he's gone from enemy
          to potential savior in a heartbeat.

                         JAKE
          Whoa, I got nothing to do with this --

                         ELLA
          You got everything to do with it. If you
          can remember where you got that thing --

                         JAKE
          I remember you all wantin' me on the end
          of a damned rope. Whatever's happenin'
          here's got nothin' to do with me.

                         ELLA
          You sure. about that?
          He LOOKS at her. No, he isn't. But he sure as hell won't stay
          to debate it -- turns to go --

                         EMMETT
          Mr. Lonergan? Sir?
          The EMOTION in the boy's voice STOPS Jake at the door.

                         EMMETT (CONT'D)
          My mother died last year. My Paw... he's
          all I got.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          And despite a fleeting moment of SYMPATHY, Jake darkens --

                         JAKE
          Kid, I'm the last man you want anywhere
          near you, your Pa... or anyone else in
          this goddamned town.
          OUT the door. Everyone trades looks, then Ella FOLLOWS:

          EXT. SALOON - NIGHT

          Jake moves FAST past blown-out STOREFRONTS as Ella PURSUES:

                         ELLA
          That's it? You're just gonna run away?

                         JAKE
          No, Sister. I'm walking away.

                         ELLA
          Well s w.
          As he keeps on walking, Ella picks up a ROCK, wings it at the
          back of his HEAD -- WHAMI Jake stumbles forward, TURNS AROUND --

                         JAKE ELLA
          SONOVA-- -- I told you to gyp.
          Ella strides forward, picking up another rock on the move --

                         JAKE
          What's your damn problem?!

                         ELLA
          You're comin' with us.

                         JAKE
          I'm not coming anywhere. And you throw
          that rock I swear I'll--
          WHAM! The rock glances off his shoulder --

                         ELLA
          If you're walkin' away from here, what
          the hell're you walking tsQ?
          That PENETRATES as Jake realizes he doesn't really KNOW. And
          that's the last thing he's gonna admit --

                         JAKE
          What the hell are you walkin' to, Lady?
          'Cause if I heard right, it sounds like
          suicide to me.
          -- now it's her turn to pause. Cryptically:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         ELLA
          I... just wanna help these people.

                         JAKE
          Bullshit. You wanna help yourself. Saw
          your face light up the minute you knew
          that thing might lead you to gold.
          And the fact that he's BUSTED her gets Ella's hackles up --

                         ELLA
          It's not gold I want, you dumb
          sonofabitch, it's what it'll buy me.

                         JAKE
          And what's that?

                         ELLA
          Remange.
          Whatever that means, it's a deep, painful LONGING in her. She
          stares at him, DEAD ON:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          And lookin' at you? I'd bet a silver
          dollar... its what you want, too.
          With that, Ella turns and STRIDES OFF as we HOLD ON JAKE, face
          knotted in conflict. As her words RESONATE.

          scared. They form an EXODUS LINE, heading off toward the fort.
          Dolarhyde, Colorado and his REMAINING MEN (6) load the ALIEN
          CORPSE onto the back of a WAGON. Some of them trade glances --
          DAMN WORRIED about staying. Dolarhyde sees it:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Somebody got something to say?
          His withering GLARE keeps them from speaking up. Doc and
          Meacham climb onto the wagon:

                         MEACHAM

                         (THE ALIEN)
          Sure we need to bring that thing along?
          Doc nods as he TWISTS the forceps in the Alien's eye, the
          COMPASS HOLOGRAM flickering to life before them:

                         DOC
          If this arrow points me back to Maria?
          Yeah -- J'm sure.
          Emmett appears leading a PONY, a BOW and quiver of ARROWS slung
          around his back:

                         MEACHAM
          Can't come, Emmett, too dangerous.

                         EMMETT
          I can protect myself -- shoot, I'm the
          only master bowman in my archery club.
          Won the county tournament by shootin' a

          Somethin' tells me these things don't
          carry nickels, son. Answers's no.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         EMMETT
          You want me to ride off with the
          chickenshits, then double back, be happy
          to. But let's just skip that part and
          get to it, Padre.
          And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice... finally:

                         MEACHAM
          Go fill your canteen, dammit.
          He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and
          mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from
          Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily:

                         ELLA
          C'mon, Happy.
          But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking
          up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME?

                         JAKE
          Oh shut up.
          Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde
          VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off:

                         DOLARHYDE
          I was ridin' into town to kill you for
          what you done to my son. You owe me your
          life, Boy.

                         (BEAT)
          Ride with us, we'll call it square.
          His hand rests on his nickel-plated .38. Eyes gleaming cruelly.

                         JAKE
          You that fast?

                         DOLARHYDE

                         FAST ENOU--
          -- WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having
          drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence:

                         JAKE
          Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square.
          In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point
          made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out-
          drawn, turns to CULOBAI)U -- speaks LOW:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Follow him. Soon as he's got his back
          turned... kill him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          Shit. Colorado hesitates. Dolar GLARES: "Do it." Finally
          Colorado NODS acquiescence, moves off...
          JAKE -- on the OUTSKIRTS of town now -- riding past Meacham and
          Doc on the WAGON:

                         MEACHAM
          Figure out which way you're headed yet?

                         JAKE
          West. Saguaro Pass.

                         MEACHAM
          That's not what I meant.
          The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off.
          Meacham watches Jake go... MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH:

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS


          JAKE -- RIDING HARD THROUGH THE DESERT:
          A man running from his demons, or maybe toward them... through
          plains and pasturage... until he sees the tilted ROAD SIGN:
          "SAGUARO PASS." Up ahead, he sees DEBRIS...
          Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground. Pieces of a STONE
          CHIMNEY. Jake comes over a rise... to REVEAL:

          EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY

          A DESTROYED LOG CABIN. Walls partially TORN AWAY. Something in
          Jake is DEEPLY STIRRED. Dismounts, tentatively... walks up to
          the PORCH. Boots CRUNCH over broken window glass as they ENTER:

          INT. ABANDONED CABIN - CONTINUOUS

          LIGHT BEAMS stream in. Eerie quiet.
          Jake takes it in, HAUNTED. Something CRUNCHES under his boot --
          DRIED FLOWERS. Sticking out from an OVERTURNED CRACKED VASE.
          Jake BLINKS, affected -- Bends over, TOUCHES the VASE AS:
          MEMORY FLASECUT! FRESH FLOWERS in a woman's hand... THE W B&
          FROM JAKE'S PICTURE. She smiles at him --

                         THE WOMAN
          You shouldn't have.
          She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's
          talking to JAKE.

                         JAKE
          Got you somethin' else.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.
          CLINK -- He drops a LEATHER POUCH on the table next to the vase.
          A FEW GOLD COINS clink out. The woman turns to him, WORRIED:

                         THE WOMAN
          Where'd you get this?

                         JAKE
          Where do you think?
          The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins.
          TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here.

                         THE WOMAN
          Your boys '11 come after you.
          ON JAKE. Dark. But DETERMINED:

                         JAKE
          Let 'em come.
          She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft.
          Tender. Soulful.
          But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window:
          A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town.
          The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch
          slides off the table... THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and --

          BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
          REELING. What is this memory? Who the hell is the woman?
          Something GLINTS in the far wall where the chimney used to be:

          ONE OF THE GOLD COINS
          EMBEDDED in the wood. Jake pulls it out of the wall, a thousand
          questions in his eyes. Sunlight SHIMMERS off it and --
          MEMORY FLASHCUT! The spilled coins start SLIDING across the
          floor all by themselves, as if magnetically drawn to THE CHIMNEY
          -- WHOOSH! -- SUCKED right up into it by some VACUUM FORCE!

                         THE WOMAN
          What's happening?!!!

          WINDOWS EXPLODE! THE ROOF'S RIPPED AWAY BY SOME NSANE VACUUM
          FORCE AS ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT CRASHES IN! The Woman SCREAMS and --

          KA-CHINNNG! A STEEL COLLAR SHOOTS DOWN FROM THE LIGHT, CLAMPING

          AROUND HER NECK! A CABLE SNAPS OUT FROM IT AND WHIPS UPWARD,

          PULLING HER INTO THE LIGHT --
          She manages to GRAB a doorknob and DANGLES UPWARD, CHOKING as --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          A DEMONIC SILHOUETTE drops in front of them!
          JESUS!! Jake draws his pistol and FIRES!
           The demon SHRIEKS IN RAGE as SPIKED PLUMES fan out from its
           huge, elongated skull... making it look like a SILHOUETTED
          It QIAï¿½1.-L 2 A T EI! R HEADDRESS!
           Its HIDEOUS FACE comes into the light -- AN AIJIE -- as it
           raises its arm, wearing a WRIST BRACELET that reshapes into a

                         BLASTER --
           JAKE DIVES AWAY but a searing pulse RIPS A WICKED GASH in his
          side (now we know how he woke up with it in the desert) --

          THE PULSE PASSES THROUGH JAKE AND HITS THE WOMAN SQUARE IN THE
          C-Mr-M. She 's HURLED backward into the wall, Jake. CRIES OUT:

                         JAKE
          Alice!
          As he RUSHES to her, her collar UNLOCKS... and FLIES AT JAKE,
          clamping HE'S PULLED INTO THE LIGHT, CHOKING, SCREAMING --

          BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
          As he STUMBLES back -- GASPING -- touching his neck --
          Catches his breath. ROCKED. Sees "Alice's" BLOOD STAIN on the
          wall. His shaking hand reaches out, brushes over it...

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          (trying out the name)
          "Alice"...
          Whoever she was to him, he feels sledgehammered with GRIEF. All
          he knows is, it was THEM. The creatures killed her. And this
          revelation... well, it galvanizes him with RAGE.
          Rage that gives him NEW PURPOSE... then--

          SUDDENLY -- INSTINCT -- JAKE SENSING SOMETHING IS HERE -- GRABS

          A CHIMNEY STONE AND SPINS, HURLS IT...

          AT COLORADO, IN THE DOORWAY BEHIND HIM AIMING A GUN:
          The stone HITS Colorado as he FIRES, the bullet tears PAST Jake
          -- as Colorado recovers, Jake BODYSLAMS HIM -- the GUN goes
          flying, they go hurling THROUGH THE WALL -- LANDING HARD on the
          other side -- aaballs-out. messy. close-quarter death match --
          Jake takes a PUNCH -- Colorado LOOPS an arm around his throat,
          YANKS -- they TUMBLE/SLAM to the floor, Jake LANDING on top of
          Colorado who holds the arm lock, CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.
          Jake -- EYES POPPING -- SEES THE GUN just out of reach --
          fingers GRASP for it -- seconds before he PASSES OUT
          He GRABS the gun and swings it back -- BLAMMII!Colorado ROLLS
          aside as the WALL where his head just was BLOWSOPEN--and
          Jake's ON HIM, PISTOL WHIPPING HIM MERCILESSLYuntilheSPINS
          the gun back around and POINTS IT between Colorado's eyes:
          ON JAKE -- quaking with rage -- he wants to kill this guy so bad
          he can taste it... but something's HOLDING HIM BACK -- GRITS his
          teeth, COCKS the trigger and:

          EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY

          -- we CUT WIDE on the cabin as a GUNSHOT CRACKS. A flock of
          BIRDS screech into the sky from the overgrown corn field...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - DAY

          The rest of our people RIDE along, following the ever-tilting
          HOLOGRAPHIC ARROW, their COMPASS, floating from the dead alien's
          eye in the back of the wagon.
          Greavey, Dolar's ranch hand, heels up to ELLA. COCKY SWAGGER:

                         GREAVEY
          So... what's a pretty lady like y--

                         ELLA
          -- you finish that sentence, I shoot you
          in your beef whistle.
          Doc, sipping from his canteen, does a SPIT TAKE. Ella's eyes
          DRILL Greavey. Cut down a peg, he tips his hat, red-faced:

                         GREAVEY
          Ma'am.
          And rides past her, taking us to EMMETT and DOLARHYDE:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Tell me somethin', Kid... why didn't your
          father just take my money?

                         EMMETT

                         (CONFUSED)
          What money?

                         UOLARHY DE
          offered him a thousand dollars to leave
          town. He could's taken you outta harm's
          way, relocated... found you a new momma.
          And this just BURNS Emmett. A beat; then:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         EMMETT
          Is it true Percy's momma died givin'
          birth to him, Mister Dolarhyde?
          Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde. But he's contained:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Yeah.

                         EMMETT
          Then maybe you should use that thousand
          dollars to buy yourself a new wife.
          Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and
          UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie... but
          it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:

                         DOC
          Madre Dios...
          And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's
          reacting to --
          AN ENORMOUS CRATER. ACRES WIDE... TWENTY FEET DEEP. Even
          Dolarhyde looks nervous now:

                         DOLARYHYDE
          What the... hell is it?

                         MEACHAM
          It was Winfield's Landing.
          They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN:
          Holds it UP. " Winfield's Landing... Population 133."
          ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit. He doesn't mean...?

                         GREAVEY
          You tryin' to tell me those... things
          pulled the whole damn town into the sky?
          And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon -- like the SOUND
          BARRIER BREAKING -- everyone's look goes UP where:
          SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM. The same clouds that dropped the
          tornado on Absolution. And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at
          the cabin. But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them --

                         MEACHAM
          That can't be good.
          The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND

          PLUME -- ROLLING TOWARD THEM --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Scatter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          -- everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over
          rocks -- then SLOWS... to a STOP.
          They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly...
          DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN. What he sees is SHOCKING:
          It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of
          TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a
          GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH.
          The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK
          and FEAR. But the thing doesn't MOVE.

                         DOC
          Should we... open it?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Should we open it? Hell NO we shouldn--

                         EMMETT
          -- oops --
          -- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a
          Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer -- GOO leaks --
          then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING
          the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out.
          BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come
          FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground:

          A COW. YES, A COW.
          Motionless. DEAD, in fact. A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth,
          connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell.
          Greavey notices a BRANDING on the cow's rump -- the letter "D":

                         GREAVEY
          Boss... it's one'a yours.
          Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:

                         EMMETT
          Is-- is this what happened to my Pa?
          Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE
          with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through:

                         DOC
          This was stuck down its throat... to help
          it breathe. That means they wanted to
          keep it alive, Emmett.
          (forces a small smile)
          I'm sure your father is fine.
          But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         MEACHAM
          Why'd they dump it?

                         ELLA
          Whatever they needed from it, they
          must've got.

                         (THEN)
          Gonna get dark soon, need to keep moving.
          She does. The others FOLLOW in a chilled daze. The last is
          DOLARHYDE, glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - DUSK

          Now our people APPEAR riding up a ridge... Dolarhyde shoots up a
          HAND, bringing the caravan to a STOP. Once again, SHOCK:

                         EMMETT
          Ho-ly shit.
          BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below:
          AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels
          facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the
          desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS --

          EXT. DESERT - THE PADDLEBOAT - MINUTES LATER

          TRACKING alongside of the TILTED PADDLEBOAT, our team rides
          around it. Trying to make SENSE. STENCILED on the stern is...

                         DOC
          "Colorado Queen."

                         (THEN)
          The river's two hundred miles from here.
          But Ella doesn't seem as impressed as the rest of them. In
          fact, her attention is drawn BEHIND them, to something coming up
          over the DUNES... the barest flicker of a smile --

                         ELLA
          Son of a bitch.
          IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with
          COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides
          to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS
          the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:

                         JAKE
          Your man got it in his head that he was
          s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his
          ear 'til he says sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          As Colorado stumbles to his feet angrily, humiliated, Dolar
          notices his BLOODY EAR. The LOBE has been SHOT OFF. He looks
          up at Jake, half-angry, half-EMBARRASSED --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Why'd you let him live?
          Jake's hard-as-nails. DRIVEN now --

                         JAKE
          Gonna need him.
          He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Nice boat.
          (then... SNIFFS)
          What's that smell?

                         ELLA
          That'd be me.
          He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow.

                         JAKE
          Why're you blue?

                         ELLA

                         (DRYLY)
          Cause I missed ya.
          Their look HOLDS. A MOMENT. Something REAL between them.

                         DOLARHYDE
          We better keep movin'.
          A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN.

                         JAKE
          Storm's comin'. I say we dig in here til
          it passes.
          (to Colorado; fucking

                         WITH HIM)
          How's that sound, Nat?
          Nat BURNS. Dolar feels his AUTHORITY being undermined:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Storm or no storm, I say we keep movin'.
          Colorado finally turns to Uolarhyde. DEFIANT:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Too hard tracking anything in the rain.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.
          Dolarhyde GLARES at Colorado, who GLARES BACK: his loyalty now
          in QUESTION. The tide IS turning against the rancher.

          EXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - NIGHT - LATER

          RAIN POURS on the overturned boat. Horses tethered. The ALIEN
          CORPSE has been moved onto a slanted deck, covered by a TARP...
          WE TILT TO THE ALIEN'S HAND. Poking out. Motionless. HOLD on
          it, longer than we're comfortable.

          INT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A RATTLESNAKE is coiled around a CHANDELIER... except the
          chandelier is on the floor and the floor is the CEILING.
          Upended gambling tables. WOODRATS scurry over FOOD. Every
          window's SMASHED... as if something just TOOK everyone.
          Dolar sits by a FIRE made from furniture parts, drinking from a
          WHISKEY FLASK. Colorado opposite, rubbing his MANGLED EAR.

                         DOLARHYDE
          You okay?

                         COLORADO
          (low, eyes averted)
          Yeah.
          Dolar pours some whiskey on a BANDANA, leans towards Colorado --

                         DOLARHYDE COLORADO
          Lemme clean it for you or
          it'll get -- -- I'm fine.
          Dolarhyde backs away. Colorado GLARES.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Say it.

                         COLORADO
          (after a beat)
          Is Percy worth dyin' for?
          Dolar's eyes flash. A mixture of anger and PAIN. Then --

                         DOLARHYDE
          He's my son.

                         (POINTED)
          I take care of my kin, Nat.
          ON COLORADO as that lands. Clearly, there's something here...
          a bond that seems to go deeper than just boss and employee. But
          WHAT? Finally Nat just gets up and LEAVES.
          Dolar watches him go, takes a healthy SWIG. Hears a WHIMPER.
          Looks over and sees... EMMETT, huddled in a corner. CRYING.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          ON DOLARHYDE. The kid's naked emotion AFFECTING him, but the
          fact Dolar might have a conscience makes him ANGRY too. Low:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Hey. Kid.
          Emmett looks up, SNIFFLES. Dolar tosses him the WHISKEY FLASK:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Take a drink and shut p.
          He gets up, walks off. Leaving the kid with the flask. As
          Emmett looks at it confusedly, stuffs it in his POCKET --

          INT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Meacham has set out TIN PANS under holes to collect RAIN WATER.
          Dumps a pan into his CANTEEN as Doc enters with COFFEE for him:

                         DOC
          (re: the tin plates)
          We brought enough water.

                         MEACHAM
          Not for drinkin', it's for blessin'.
          Doc nods: ah. Turns to go... STOPS. Turns back. Intense eyes:

                         DOC
          Padre... Maria came to see you in
          confession every Sunday. It seemed...
          she had a lot to talk about.
          (beat, this is hard)
          Was she having an affair?
          Meacham removes his spectacles. Looks at Doc --

                         MEACHAM
          You know I can't say.
          And Doc DOES know. But there's a quiet DESPERATION here --

                         DOC
          The last thing I said to her... I...
          (shakes his head; then)
          Please. If I'm wrong about my wife... I
          don't want to die angry.
          Meacham sees the PAIN in his friend's eyes.

                         MEACHAM
          You can ask Maria if she was cheatin' on
          you once we get her back. 'Til then?
          (bit of a grin)
          Don't die.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          And OFF DOC, thunder CRACKS --

          INT. RIVERBOAT - COMMODORE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

          RAIN pours down through an open gash in the roof, splashing the
          floor. Ella enters, glances back toward the door to make sure
          she's alone, then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a stool.
          Upper body NAKED in the moonlight. We catch only a FLASH of
          this, and for a moment it's PURE HOTNESS...
          . until she turns and something ELSE is revealed: criss-
          crossed LASH MARKS on her back.
          She turns away and starts to SPLASH herself with water, erasing
          the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face... then: A MATCH
          ignites behind her. She WHIRLS, startled, covering her breasts
          with her arms -- JAKE is sitting in a chair at the Commodore's
          desk, casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth:

                         JAKE
          You missed a spot.

                         ELLA
          The hell,-re- you doing here?

                         JAKE
          Mindin' my own business.
          (snaps out the match)
          Then you decided to take a shower.

                         ELLA
          Why didn't you say anything?

                         JAKE
          Givin' you privacy.
          She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues
          to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored.
          Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a
          bottle of WHISKEY on the table... and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE.

                         ELLA
          . she's pretty.
          (Jake says NOTHING)
          Who was she?
          Jake's quiet. DARK. Intense emotion, intensely suppressed:

                         JAKE
          only thing I know's her name was Alice...

                         (THEN; DISTANT)
          And she's dead.
          Ella looks up at him. INTO him --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         ELLA
          Maybe you loved her.
          Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE:

                         JAKE
          All you women are the same -- Always
          wanna make it about Goddamn "love."

                         ELLA

                         (A BEAT)
          Trust me, Lonergan. I'm not the same.
          There is a force -- a strength about this woman -- that he
          connects with. But remains, true to character, ALOOF:

                         JAKE
          Don't matter.
          She takes a step closer. Soft. Intimate.

                         ELLA
          So what dj= matter?
          Jake just looks at her. Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips,
          the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light...

                         JAKE
          What matters is I find the thing that
          killed her.
          (dark as hell)
          And make it pay.
          And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK... holds up his

                         BRACELET:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Where'd you see this before?
          A beat. Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie.
          But he cuts her off --

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          -- and don't lie to me. You wouldn't've
          asked me if you didn't recognize it.
          Ella tightens. PAIN in her eyes. And Jake REALIZES:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Those things... they the ones who put
          those marks on your back?
          She swallows: a mixture of SHAME that he's found her out... and
          ANGER at what was done to her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         ELLA
          They took my people. Destroyed where I'm
          from.

                         JAKE
          Where's that?

                         ELLA
          North of here. Been trackin' 'em ever
          since, town to town. Best I figure,
          they're hidin' in a mine.
          Jake CONSIDERS all this. Softens a little:

                         JAKE
          Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead
          of throwin' rocks at me --

                         ELLA
          -- what, you would've stuck around?
          Bullshit. I couldn't've turned you away
          from what you had to do, any more than I
          could've stopped these people from going
          after their kin.

                         (BEAT)
          Truth ain't worth a damn, Jake... and
          we're gonna need all the guns we can get.
          Their look HOLDS... until Jake SMIRKS. Likes her style:

                         JAKE
          So that's the only reason you wanted me
          to come with you? Cause of my gun?
          There's a pause... then Ella SMIRKS back:

                         ELLA
          No, not your gun.

                         (BEAT)
          What you do with it.
          Among the many things these two ate feeling -- both separately
          and together -- the one that pops right now is ATTRACTION.
          Confusing as it is for him. The pregnant moment LINGERS...
          Until Happy suddenly starts to GROWWWWL, sensing something
          outside. ANOTHER CRACK OF THUNDER as:

          INT. STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The horses STAMP NERVOUSLY out the window as Greavey and the
          rest of Dolarhyde's men (COBBETT and 4 others) HUDDLE in secret
          conference -- whispers that sound a lot like MUTINY --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         GREAVEY
          What the hell're we doin' here? We
          should be ridin' in the opposite
          direction of those things --

                         COBBETT
          We do that, the old man's likely to shoot
          us himself. Only way outta this is --
          And suddenly. Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS:

                         GREAVEY
          . what's that smell?
          -- as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays... ALL THEY

          FIND IS AN EMPTY TARP FLAPPING AIMLESSLY:

                         COBBETT

                         AW SH--
          LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the ship -- and als4THE ALIEN
          behind them. a coiled mass clinging spiderlike to the ceiling!!!
          Its arm WHIPS out, noosing around Cobbett -- LIFTS HIM off his
          feet -- SLAMS HIM into the ceiling -- TOSSES HIM like a ragdoll:
          The men SHOUT -- a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from the
          alien then it SPRINGS -- SLICING THROUGH TWO MEN AT ONCE --
          GREAVEY and 2 others manage to SCRAMBLE AWAY:

          INT. RIVERBOAT - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS


          JAKE AND ELLA
          HEAR the SCREAMS -- Happy takes off -- they RACE after him --

          DOC AND MEACHAM
          Hear them too -- grabs their PISTOLS -- and Doc, his CANTEEN --
          DQIRHXPE_. 9oWQ n
          Colorado snatches up a WINCHESTER, LOADS IT, throws another one
          to Dolar -- who's suddenly, surprisingly, PROTECTIVE of Emmett:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Get behind me, Boy --
          THE ALIEN SPRINGS INTO THE ROOM -- landing upside down on the
          ceiling. Dolar FIRES at it --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)

          RUN, KID! GIT!
          Emmett SCRAMBLES down a FLOOR HATCH, disappears as Dolar keeps
          FIRING -- but the alien BATS the gun away and LIFTS Dolar UP --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          Paralyzed with FEAR, he EXHALES a terrified GASP and --
          THE CREATURE RECOILS FROM HIS BREATH! HURLS Dolar aside --
          THROUGH THE FIRE -- embers catch CURTAINS and FLAMES SPREAD --
          COLORADO races in, throws a TOMAHAWK -- it PINS the alien's claw
          to the wall, the monster SHRIEKS as Nat draws a PISTOL but --
          The alien SPITS A STICKY RESIN GOB -- it HARDENS, pinning NAT'S
          hand with the pistol to the wall in return. He STRUGGLES as the
          alien ADVANCES --
          BOOM! The Alien's shoulder EXPLODES ORANGE FLUORESCENT BLOOD as
          a GUNSHOT rings out -- it's Dolarhyde, back on his feet aid
          FIRING -- the monster SCREECHES and leaps down, DISAPPEARING
          through the hatch where Emmett fled --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)

          GODDAMMITT!!!
          And the fire's GROWING around the boat --

          INT. CRAWLSPACE - CONTINUOUS

          EMMETT moves FAST on hands-and-knees through a narrow CRAWLSPACE
          -- around a corner here -- another there -- a MAZE --

          SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM -- THE ALIEN -- CRAWLING FAST --
          EMMETT -- reaches another HATCH -- pushes through and OUT:

          INT. RIVERBOAT BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

          -- DROPPING onto the floor -- as we WHIP TO Jake racing in from
          around a corner -- but suddenly: THE ALIEN BURSTS FROM THE HATCH

          BEHIND EMMETT, SWEEPING HIM UP IN ITS CLUTCHES:
          Jake's bracelet OPENS UP into that BLASTER and it's AIMED at The
          Alien but the creature CUPS a hand around Emmett and LIFTS HIM
          off the floor, a TALONED FINGER pressed to the boy's THROAT:
          STANDOFF. ELLA rushes in. The creature sees her -- HISSES --

                         JAKE
          Don't know if you understand me... but
          you hurt that boy and I hurt you.

          CLOSE, EMMETT -- MUFFLED, TEARS LEAKING FROM HIS TERRIFIED EYES:

          Meacham brings his CANTEEN down like a HATCHET, SPRAYING the
          alien with HOLY WATER... but NOTHING happens! And then --
          The Alien STRIKES -- SLAMMING MEACHAM BACK INTO A JUTTING PIECE

          OF IRON, IMPALING HIM --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)

          The Alien SPRINGS through a doorway, TAKING EMMETT WITH IT.
          Ella RUSHES after it as Jake RUNS to Meacham, hanging impaled:

                         MEACHAM
          Go after the boy... then you get our
          people back...

                         JAKE
          Stop talking. DQW! GET YOUR ASS--
          But Meacham GRABS Jake, EYE TO EYE. GASPING:

                         MEACHAM
           Listen up... 'cause I'm not gonna be able
          to say it again --
          (pulls Jake CLOSE)
          God don't care who you were, Son... only
          who you Mg.
          ON JAKE. AFFECTED. With a last RASP, Meacham DIES just as DOC
          races through the growing FLAMES -- REACTS -- no time to mourn --

                         DOC

          JAKE -- WE GOTTA GO M!
          But Jake can't let go -- FURY -- HEARTBREAK -- Doc PULLS HIM
          away -- Jake SNAGS THE CRUCIFIX off Meacham's neck as he's
          forced OUT, leaving Meacham's body to be CONSUMED BY FLAMES --

          EXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - DESERT - NIGHT

          The boat is a BALL OF FIRE in the pouring rain, as what remains
          of our heroes stumble out, COUGHING, devastated... Jake, Doc,
          Dolarhyde, Colorado, Greavey, 2 GUNMEN... and Ella and Happy
          atop a DUNE, following a TRAIL OF FLUORESCENT ORANGE BLOOD
          streaking into the desert. Happy BARKING MADLY. Ella drops to
          a knee, touches the orange blood as it WASHES AWAY in the rain:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         ELLA

          RAIN'S GONNA COVER ITS TRACKS!

                         NAT COLORADO
          That thing... was dead... it was d-ead...
          DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face... VULNERABLE and GUILTY:

                         DOLARHYDE
          I couldn't stop it -- It just... grabbed
          the kid.
          ON JAKE. Rage-filled against the flames... Meacham's CRUCIFIX
          in his hared, as his FIST closes around it. Looks up, HARDCORE:

                         JAKE
          Then we'd better get him back.

                         SMASH TO:

          INT. STALACTITE CAVERN - NIGHT

          STALACTITES loom from the ceiling -- BAM! EMMETT is DROPPED on
          the floor of a sinister cave -- scrambles back from THE ALIEN:

                         EMMETT
          Damn. You are one ugly bastar--
          PSST! The alien spits a RESIN GOB on Emmett's mouth -- PSST
          PSST! More gobs PIN his limbs to the wall. Emmett can't move --
          can't speak -- eyes WIDE and TERRIFIED --
          The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep. Touches
          a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like...
          .. a small RUBIK'S CUBE made of some alien alloy.
          The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and
          starts to SPIN -- as it does, its sides FLIP AND TURN (like a
          Rubik's Cube) -- emitting HIGH-PITCHED SONAR BEEPS:
          This thing's some kind of HOMING BEACON.
          Off Emmett's WIDE, GAPING EYES...

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - SUNRISE

          Our people RIDE FAST against the rising sun, on the hunt for
          Emmett. Colorado REARS his horse, kneels by a trace of ORANGE
          BLOOD on some rocks.

                         NAT COLORADO
          (looks off --)
          West.
          Greavey and the others share a LOOK. E o Turn to Dolar --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         GREAVEY
          Boss, only took one of them things to
          kill four of us. We got no chance here.
          Dolarhyde BURNS -- knowing he's being ABANDONED --

                         DOLARHYDE
          You're a goddamn coward.
          (to the others)
           You work for me, dammit. You're my
          m e 1 1 Qyees.
          And Greavey, finally FREE to speak his mind, says SPITEFULLY:

                         GREAVEY
          Fine line between a coward and a fool.
          The men turn tail and RIDE AWAY. Dolarhyde SHOUTS after them --

                         DOLARHYDE
          You're all FIRED!
          Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife:

                         DOC
          Looks like they finally found something
          to be more scared of than you.
          Dolarhyde feels his world CRUMBLING away man by man...
          Ella trots alongside Jake, who's staring at that DARK CLOUD MASS
          overhead with a bad feeling:

                         JAKE
          Clouds've been moving east since sun-
          up... 'cept that one.
          ON ELLA. We SENSE she knows something, something more she isn't
          saying. SNAPS her reins and they RIDE OFF:

          INT. BOX CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          As the group gallops into a BOX CANYON, Happy starts BARKING
          MADLY -- the horses SLOW --

                         ELLA

                         SOMETHING'S WRON--
          BLAMBLAN1111 GUNSHOTS from above suddenly PEPPER the ground --
          the horses REAR and KICK UP, startled --
          A DOZEN FIGURES ON THE CLIFFS ALL AROUND THEM. Badass OUTLAWS
          with RIFLES aimed at our heroes. One of them CALLS DOWN:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         OUTLAW GUNMAN

          EVERYBODY DRAW YOUR GUNS SLOW AND TOSS

          'EM ON THE GODDAMNED GROUNDI

          SHIT.
          SLOWLY, Jake draws his gun... tosses it. Now the rest of them.
          As they SEE -- TWO RIDERS -- incoming -- from the other end of
          the canyon. Rifles aimed and ready. Happy GROWLS...
          One of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle --

                         OUTLAW
          I say we just shoot 'em and take their--
          But the words catch in his throat as his EYES WIDEN:

                         OUTLAW (CONT'D)
          . Boss?
          Sure enough, they're looking right at (BRONC
          -JAKE. Both outlaws
          and HUNT) lower their guns, hostility replaced by SURPRISE:

                         HUNT
          What the hell you doin' back here,
          Lonergan?
          Oh, Christ. This is JAKE'S gang. ON DOLARHYDE. ELLA.
          COLORADO. All registering it. And JAKE, of course, doesn't
          REMEMBER these men as Bronc dismounts, NERVOUS:

                         BRONC
          Jesus, Boss... Creek's gonna shit when he
          sees you.
          (then; re: the others)
          And who the hell're they?
          ON JAKE. Now does he handle this? Ht:nt rides up next to him,
          SUSPICIOUS, and for reasons yet to be known, UNFRIENDLY --

                         HUNT
          What's the matter, Jake. Cat got your--?
          SMACKI Jake moves LIGHTNING FAST, SLAPS Hunt across the face,
          stopping the question on his tongue -- CATCHES the gun as it
          drops and presses the barrel into Hunt's NECK:

                         JAKE
          Since when're Qy the one asking the
          goddamned questions!?!
          Ella and our people REACT as Jake plays it up, beat defense a
          good OFFENSE. The outlaws are SCARED: this is the Lonergan they
          know. Hunt holds his BLOODY MOUTH:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         HUNT
          Christ, Jake... You broke my tooth

                         JAKE
          Quit whining. Now bring me to the rest
          of the boys, if that meets with your
          goddamn approval.
          Bronc and Hunt nod, mounting up, SHOUTING to the OUTLAWS above:

                         BRONC

          LONERGAN'S BACK. MEET US AT THE CAMP!
          As they RIDE OFF, Dolarhyde looks to Jake and mutters:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Nice company you keep.

                         ELLA
          What the hell're you doing? If we don't
          catch up to that kid, we're never gonna--

                         JAKE
          They called me "Boss." You wanna go
          after these things with five or fifty?
          (off her look)
          Like you said: we can use every gun we
          can get.
          Qh. That actually makes SENSE. But --

                         ELLA
          What exactly're you gonna say to 'em?

                         JAKE

                         (A BEAT)
          Tell you when I figure it out.
          And he SPURS onward, leaving her to follow uneasily --

          INT. STALACTITE CAVERN - DAY


          CLOSE -- RUBIK'S CUBE -- STILL SPINNING MID-AIR AS:
          OUR ALIEN HANGS UPSIDE DOWN from stalactites by four spindly
          limbs. Mid sleep cycle. And inches below its head...
          EMMETT, still webbed to the wall. Unable to move or speak,
          TERRIFIED. As suddenly... the cube DEACTIVATES. And DROPS --
          THE CREATURE'S EYES SNAP OPEN. It SPRINGS from the ceiling as
          FOUR DARK SHAPES blot out light, GLIDING IN...

          MANTRA RAY HOVER SPEEDERS

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          A gang of FOUR MORE ALIENS dismounts. The biggest and STRONGEST
          -- their LEADER -- barks GUTTURAL CLICKS at the alien who
          kidnapped Emmett. Kidnapper explaining as it removes another
          STRANGE DEVICE. The device beams a HOLO-PROJECTION...
          OF ELLA'S FACE! The aliens HISS in furious RECOGNITION.
          JESUS... is this some kind of otherworldly WANTED POSTER?
          PLUMES fan out angrily from the Leader's HUGE, ELONGATED SKULL --
          like an indian headdress! The creature TURNS to Emmett --
          It's the alien who killed Jake's woman! We'll come to know it
          as... THE SLAVER.
          It MOVES OMINOUSLY for Emmett, grasping the HANDLE of something
          that UNCOILS with fluid, frightening speed:
          A WHITE-HOT LASER WHIP. This will be The Slaver's SIGNATURE
          WEAPON. It spirals to its full length, FLASHING out at --
          EMMETT -- MUFFLED SCREAM! But... the whip DOESN'T cut him,
          instead it SLICES THROUGH THE WEBBING that pins the boy to the
          wall. As Emmett FALLS, The Slaver SWEEPS HIM UP -- Emmett
          FLAILS, punching, kicking to no avail -- but then:

                         DOLARHYDE'S FLASK
          Tumbles from Emmett's pocket and SPLASHES WHISKEY on The Slaver
          -- IT.. S[iRIEM WILDLI-Aa THE BOOZE CONTACTS FLESH, SKIN SMOKING!
          EMMETT -- tumbles away. Terror turns to REVELATION as he PULLS
          the webbing from his mouth:

                         EMMETT
          Holy SHIT.
          Another alien LUNGES for the kid but Emmett SPLASHES him with
          the flask -- the alien RECOILS, flesh BUBBLING --
          Emmett whirls -- sees the HOVERBIKES -- JUMPS onto one, twisting
           desperately at the controls --- IiON-DO , ï¿½'T THIS TURNS,__
          WO ?!! Another Alien SCUTTLES in FAST -- Emmett's scrambling
          boots slide into the foot supports, which automatically WHIR
          CLOSED as the bike THROTTLES FORWARD... DECAPITATING THE ALIEN!
          The bike SPINS UNCONTROLLABLY, plasma thrusters SCORCHING WALLS
          and setting two more aliens ABLAZE! The speeder KAMIKAZE
          BOUNCES out of the cavern at 90 MPH, Emmett screaming!
          The Slaver SCREECHES FURIOUSLY as the remaining creatures LEAP
          back on their speeders and GIVE CHASE!

          EXT. GANG ENCAMPMENT - DAY


                         A TARANTULA

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          Climbing onto an old desert stump -- BLAM! It's SHOT OFF by a
          couple DRUNK OUTLAWS, swigging booze from STOLEN WHISKEY CRATES
          piled on a WAGON. We're in an OUTLAW CAMP: roughly 40 fast guns
          and saddle tramps. Tents. Horses. Ample weapons. And right
          now, most of them are GEARING UP to ride out for some reason...
          One of them, CREEK JOHNSON, with a chewed up face like swiss
          cheese, slides a RIFLE into his saddle and shouts to the drunks:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Hey --- ï¿½s 4 Lay off that whiskey and
          saddle up. Flyer's on its way and we
          best damn be sober for it.

          HUNT (O.S.)
          Creek turns; sees HUNT and BRONC crest the hill with the other
          OUTLAWS from the cliffs. ANGRILY:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          'Bout time you got back.
          (re: Hunt's bloody nose)
          What the hell happened to you?!?
          Hunt nods over his shoulder --

                         HUNT
          He did.
          The outlaws part to reveal JAKE, riding in with Ella and the
          rest of our people. Creek's eyes NARROW, NOT happy to see him:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          well, shit.
          It gets very, VERY QUIET. Our people tread warily, knowing
          whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD. He runs the
          gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES. Smart enough to know that CREEK is
          the man in charge. Dismounts:

                         JAKE
          You don't look happy to see me, Creek.
          Creek eyes him. TOUGH. Clearly, HISTORY here:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          We're fixin' to rob us a train in about
          twenty minutes and you come ridin' in
          like nothin' ever happened?

                         (FUCK YOU)
          No. Lonergan. I ain't happy to see you.
          ON JAKE. How to navigate bad blood that he doesn't REMEMBER?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         JAKE
          Well I'm sure you'll get over it.
          Then, pretty much DISMISSING Creek, Jake turns, addresses the
          rest of the men. If he's their boss? Hï¿½ _gQDn&. CT LIR .ï¿½Tâ€¢

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Nice to see you, Boys, but we're not
          going after a train -- We're going after
          something else.
          The men seem... . CONFUSED. Not sure what the hell is GOING ON.

                         BRONC
          But Jake... you-- you said you didn't
          wanna be in charge no more.
          And this is a REVELATION. Jake glances at ELLA -- has to keep
          IMPROVISING to hold his ground:

                         JAKE
          Well, I-- changed my mind. So saddle the
          hell up.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          They're not going anywhere with you.
          Creek's heard enough. Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE:

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          You got some balls on you -- walkin'
          outta here a week ago sayin' what you
          said and doin' what you did and then
          ridin' back in here and givin orders.
          Just who the hell do you think you are?
          The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks
          right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with
          a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT.

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          So. Are you her?

                         ELLA
          Am I who?

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          The whore Jake quit this gang for.
          OH. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place -- Jake's eyes
          SNAP to Ella as they both REALIZE... the men think she's
          " e." Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare:

                         JAKE
          Watch your mouth, Creek.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Or what? These boys are with = now.
          jID in charge. You may be fast, but you
          are goddamned outgunned.
          ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men --

                         JAKE
          That a fact, Boys?
          But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Put your guns on the whore. He so much
          as twitches, blow her brains out her ear.
          AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who
           the men are LOYAL to. But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING:

                         JAKE
          Call her a whore again, that'll be the
          last word you ever say.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          You ain't in no position to make threats,
          asshole. Hunt: take his gun.
          Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls
          the PISTOL from Jake's holster:

                         HUNT
          Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal.
          Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Put him down, Bull.
          And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a
          JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI
          Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD --
          Creek striding over, cock of the walk, LEANS over him:

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          Where the hell's our gold. Jake?
          "Gold?" Jake SPITS BLOOD, defiant:

                         JAKE
          Don't remember.
          Creek NODS to Bull: SMASH! Another devastating BLOW. ON ELLA --
          at GUNPOINT. Wishing she could intervene. DOC too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Well I _dg remember you tellin' us you was
          leavin' us high and dry because you were
          in love... You just left out the part
          about taking half our goddamned haul from
          the Yuma Bank. So I'm gonna ask you one
          last time -- Where. Is. Our. Gold?
          -- WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake so hard he FLIES OFF HIS FEET:

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          Man can't run away from who he ja,
          Lonergan... you really think you could go
          straight just cause you were fool enough
          to fall in love with some woman?
          WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake back into oblivion, and on the HIT we:
          MEMORY FLASECUTi PEACEFUL SILENCE -- two FACES staring at each
          other across a pillow -- Jake and ALICE, naked, in a WHOREHOUSE

                         BEDROOM SOMEWHERE:

                         ALICE
          You sure you wanna give it all up?
          ON JAKE. Clearly TORN. But just as clearly, in LOVE.

                         JAKE
          What about you? Once we're gone, you
          ain't ever comin' back.
          She touches his face so gently. And whispers:

                         ALICE
          You're the first person ever believed I
          was better than this place... so I gotta
          believe in y=.
          (and she KISSES him)
          You're a good man, Jake Lonergan.
          PRESENT: as the words "Good Man" ECHO back to Jake. Stir=g_
          ]1â€ž1n as Creek GRABS Jake's hair and YANKS BACK, rears up a fist:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          You figgered you could steal from us?
          All that gold was yours to take co you
          could go off and start a new life?
          Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another:
          TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY -- Jake and Alice in the cabin -- he
          drops the SADDLEBAG -- it CLINKS to the floor. She's worried:

                         ALICE
          Your boys'ii come after you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JAKE
          (dark, determined)
          Let 'em come.
          BACK TO PRESENT -- as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this
          moment -- what they were saying to each other -- He looks up at
          Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Okay... okay, I remember now...
          ("fuck you" grin)
          Demons stole your gold, Creek. But when
          you get to hell, you can ask for it back.

                         CREEK JOHNSON

                         (TSK'S)
          Okay then. That's the way you wanna do
          this...

                         (TURNS)
          Kill the whore.
          ON THE GANG. As they all cock their guns -- Aimed at Ella --
          This is IT --
          JAKE -- slowly lifts his head, suddenly RAGE-FILLED as --

          HIS WRIST BRACELET ACTIVATES! BLAMMMM11! A SEARING PULSE BLAST

          FIRES, VAPORIZING CREEK JUST BEFORE HE PULLS THE TRIGGER!
          EVERYONE'S FACES. Holy shit. Jake spits on the around between
          the SMOKING BOOTS that formerly belonged to Creek:

                         JAKE
          Told you not to call her that.
          ON JAKE. Pure KILLER. As he turns his weapon on the rest of
          the (awestruck) gang -- through BLOODY TEETH:

                          JAKE (CONT'D)
          You're all riding with me. Any one of
          you decides otherwise? So help me God,
          I'll kill you where you stand.

                         (AND THEN)
          I'm j2acj& and I'M in goddamne.d
          The gang quickly flips: "Absolutely, Jake/ Whatever you say,
          Boss..." Jake turns to the speechless Bull McCade and KICKS HIM
          IN THE BALLS as hard as he can, doubling him over.
          Now he meets eyes with ELLA. She can't help SMIRKING, grateful.
          DOC. Is the only one NOT looking at Jake. His attention drawn
          toward a SOUND coming from the distant DUNES --

                         DOC
          Dios mio.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

          A SPEEDER IS ROARING TOWARD THEM BOUNCING OVER DESERT:

                         DOLARHYDE
          (squints, realizing...)
          Jesus... it's the kid.
          As Emmett ROARS IN, the shocked outlaws SCATTER:

                         EMMETT

          THEY'RE COMING!!!! THEY'RE COMING!!!
          The kid TUMBLES off the speeder as it PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH CAMP,
          kicking up DIRT and UPENDING SUPPLIES. As Emmett scrambles up --

          VROOOM! FOUR MORE SPEEDERS ROAR OVER THE CREST IN PURSUIT OF

          EMMETT! THE ALIENS FROM THE CAVE!

                         JAKE

          EVERYBODY MOOOOVE!!!

          STEEL COLLARS START FLYING, ATTACHED TO ROPING CABLES -- BEFORE

          THE GANG KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING, THEY'RE BEING GRABBED AND

          DRAGGED AWAY!
          Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit
          the flying machines. CROSSFIRE. CONFUSION.

                         THE SLAVER
          His speeder GROWLS to a halt. Dismounting like a killer biker.
          ON JAKE. As he SEES that horrible alien face across the crowd:
          QUICK BIT: Alice dying in his arms. And this same damn THING is
          the one responsible for it. And we're:
          BACK TO PRESENT. Jake's eyes LOCKED on the SLAVER as he says:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          You.

          BUT THE ACTION COMES ROARING BACK AS:
          Outlaws start FIRING at the Slaver, who REACTS in mere
          annoyance. Flicks open a POUCH on his bandolier for what look
          like THUMB TACKS -- throws them and they tan out, PIERCING THE
          NECKS of the outlaws, activating "Blue":
          !NTLY E ZE. TUR an
          The Slaver draws a ROL) that TELESCOPES into a SIX FOOT LANCE --
          KA-TCHING! BARBED ENDS snap out and the alien runs on two
          limbs, then FOUR -- LEOPARD-LIKE for speed -- rises back up and
          SMASH! SHATTERS each man into a million Pieces. Now he uses
          the bladed-ends to SKEWER five more outlaws and turns --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          MEETING JAKE'S EYES IN MUTUAL RECOGNITION -- SCREECHES:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)

                         (TO DOLARHYDE)
          Find cover!!!
          Jake FIRES his pulse blaster, providing cover as DOLAR, DOC,
          EMMETT, and ELLA rush to hide behind the WAGON. The Aliens FIRE
          BACK as LASER CROSSFIRE shreds the camp -- EXPLOSIONS and CHAOS:
          THREE OUTLAWS scramble to form a GATLING CREW. It SPINS to
          life, MOWING DOWN tents as they try to hit the aliens --

                         ANOTHER ALIEN
          Hurls a boomerang-like "SMART WEAPON." It circles past the
          GATLING COWBOYS, BACK into the alien's hand as:

          THE TOP HALVES OFTHE_COWBOYS SLIDE OFF, SEVERED AT THE WAIST,'.
          An EXPLOSION blows one of whiskey crates open on the wagon:

                         EMMETT

          USE THE WHISKEY! IT BURNS EM!

                         ELLA

          -- WHAT?!

                         EMMETT

          LIKE ACID ON THEIR SKIN!!!
          Ella REACTS -- WHAT? As an alien SKITTERS toward her, she grabs
          a bottle and HURLS IT -- it EXPLODES all over the creature! A
          HORRIBLE SCREECH as its skin smokes, thrashing epileptically --

                         ELLA

                         (REVELATION)
          Oh my GOD --

                         DOLARHYDE

          LET'S GO!!!
          Our people ESCAPE for the horses. Doc climbs up on the WAGON
          buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him --
          As ELLA leaps on a horse --

                         THE SLAVER
          Climbs back on his speeder and GUNS FOR HER, firing a STEEL
          COLLAR -- Jake turns -- SEES THIS. Starts RUNNING MADLY:

                         JAKE

          ELLA!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          Too late: KA-CHANK! The collar CLAMPS her neck, RIPPING ELLA
          OFF HER HORSE! The CABLE snaps back and attaches to the
          hovercraft as it ZIPS by, DRAGGING ELLA BACKWARD LIKE A WATER

          SKIER BEHIND A SPEEDBOAT!
          ON JAKE -- FURY -- HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! And there's a LOGIC
          here we'll come to realize, as he KICKS his horse into a gallop:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)

          HYAA!

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS

          ELLA'S DRAGGED BEHIND THE SPEEDER. Hands GRASPING at the
          magnetic collar as it HALF-CHOKES HER, yet keeps her upper body
          SUSPENDED just oft the ground while her heels BOUNCE HARSHLY --

          JAKE ON THE HORSE
          Riding hard -- aims his BLASTER, trying to get a TARGET on the
          CABLE linking Ella's collar to the speeder -- fires -- MISSES!
          The Slaver TILTS VERTICAL to fly through a narrow CANYON
          ENTRANCE as Ella's fingers reach wildly for THE BOWIE KNIFE on
          her belt. She starts CUTTING THE CABLE, trying to FREE HERSELF:
          WHOOSH! The speeder BLASTS out the other side of the canyon,
          Jake still in pursuit but suddenly...

          THE UNION PACIFIC LOCOMOTIVE IS CURVING AROUND A CORNER, RACING
          RIGHT FOR THEM! This is the train Jake's gang was gonna rob!

          INT. UNION PACIFIC EXPRESS CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Two PINKERTONS sit by a SAFE. LOOK UP at an unidentified ROAR --

                         PINKERTON #1
          You hear.that?

                         PINKERTON #2
          How many times I gotta tell you, Leonard.
          No one'd be stupid enough to rob this tr--

          SWWWWWM. IN THE WINDOW BEHIND THEM... THE SPEEDER BLASTS BY.

          GOING AGAINST THE TRAIN, ELLA BOUNCING BEHIND IT.
          When the Pinkertons SNAP around, Ella's GONE... but now they SEE
          JAKE -- ON HORSEBACK -- FLASHING PAST in pursuit!

                          PINKERTON #2 (CONT'D)
          1 stand corrected.
          They DRAW GUNS, running to see what's happening and --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

          EXT. UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - KID AIR AT 80 MPH - CONTINUOUS

          As the speeder SKIMS alongside the train, ELLA keeps struggling
          painfully to CUT HER COLLAR CABLE. Jake FIRES again, MISSES the
          cable but DETONATES THE SIDE OF A TRAIN CAR:

          INT. UNION PACIFIC - TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

          The wall EXPLODES INWARD on the Pinkertons -- hurt, but ALIVE --

          EXT. UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          The speeder's SHAKEN. The Slaver GROWLS as he fights for
          balance. Reaches the TRAIN'S END, skims past the caboose and --

          DAMNIT. THE SLAVER ARCS BACK AROUND IN A WIDE U-TURN, SLOTTING

          IN FOR COVER BEHIND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TMINâ€¢,=_`T1.2AVF.LLING,.J

          THE SAME DIRECTION NOW!

          ELLA'S FLUNG WILDLY BY THE HAIRPIN TURN! SHE DROPS THE KNIFE,

          IT CLATTERS AWAY! HER ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE GONE!

                         JAKE'S POV:
          Through a slot between boxcars, the speeder BLURS in the
          opposite direction. Up ahead comes the CABOOSE. No more TRAIN:
          Thinking FAST, Jake LEAPS off his horse -- CATCHES A LADDER RUNG
          ON THE CABOOSE'. Teeth gritted, starts to CLIMB up onto:

          EXT. TOP OF UNION PACIFIC TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Jake JUMPS from car to car -- over LOGS in a TENDER CAR --
          BLAM BLAM!!! The PINKERTONS are climbing to the roof, WEAPONS
          FIRING -- Jake loses footing, ROLLING off the side --

          EXT. SIDE OF TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          -- but CATCHES another ladder rung and he DANGLES, looks DOWN:

          ELLA IS RIGHT UNDER HIM, DRAGGING BEHIND THE SPEEDER! HE

          REACHES OUT --

                         JAKE

          TAKE MY HAND!
          She GRUNTS WITH EXERTION as their fingers GRAZE each other and
          The Slaver SNAPS AROUND. Hurls a SMART DISC at Jake -- no
          choice, he LETS GO of the LADDER -- HITS the ground PAINFULLY

          THE PINKERTONS RUSH TO THE ROOF EDGE
          -- SXLSKLISH! The disc VIVISECTS THEM THEN CIRCLES BACK AROUND,
          cutting the IRON STRAPS that secure the logs in the tender car --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          THE LOGS START ROLLING OFF THE TOP. CRASHING DOWN ON THE
          SPEEDER. It SPIRALS end-over-end, CRASHING into the desert!
          ON JAKE. He picks himself up, WINCING. Sees the SMOKING WRECK
          in the distance. Starts to limp, then RUN --

          EXT. CRASHED SPEEDER - CONTINUOUS

          Jake APPEARS through the smoke. No sign of The Slaver. Then --
          FALLING ROCKS turns his look upward. Though WOUNDED, the alien
          is SCALING a rock-face. Turns... a look that says "Next time."
          Then in a BLUR, it's GONE. Jake's blaster REVERTS into a
          bracelet. When the smoke clears:
          ELLA is revealed on the ground, thrown from the speeder. Jake
          REACTS -- EQ -- takes her in his arms.
          She desperately tries to SAY SOMETHING... but goes LIMP.

                         JAKE
          Ella...?
          Her head just falls back. Yeah. Hard to swallow, but it's
          true. ELLA'S DEAD. And if this moment ECHOES Jake holding his
          dead wife, well that's just fine. He stares beseechingly as...
          HOOFBEATS. The rest of our people gallop in: Colorado,
          Dolarhyde, Doc and Emmett in the wagon:

                         EMMETT
          Aw no... is she --?
          Jake looks up -- unhinged --

                          NAT COLORADO
           We need to get out of here NOT.

          JAKE NAT COLORADO
          Not gonna leave her here -- L4Re.Xam --
          -- I'M NOT LEAVIN' HER! -- This is Apache territory!
          They catch us, they'll kill u--
          THHHHHHHUNKI The air SCREAMS as an ARROW pierces the ground
          inches from Jake's hand! Suddenly THIRTY MORE -- ALL AROUND
          THEM -- forming an instant circle perimeter as --
          APACHE WARRIORS FLASH DOWNHILL. Dolar dismounts, swings Emmett
          to the ground --

          NAT COLORADO (CONT'D)
          Nobody move.
          Jake and Emmett freeze. The Apaches are ALL AROUND THEM.
          Fierce. BOWS and TOMAHAWKS drawn -- OFF THIS:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          EXT. ARIZONA MOUNTAINS - TWILIGHT

          The sun DIPS behind the mountains... NIGHT FALLS...

          INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON ELLA'S DEAD FACE. Still. Beautiful. FIND JAKE, on
          his knees beside her, hands bound in front of him. An INDIAN
          WOMAN finishes wrapping the body in a shroud and LEAVES.
          Jake is alone. Overwhelmed. Raw. Something rising in him.
          Something he COULDN'T FACE... until this moment:.

                         JAKE
          I remember now.

                         (THEN; SOFTLY)
          I-- I did love her.
          And just saying it, saying those words, brings a swell of
          EMOTION to the surface... but he FIGHTS it. A losing battle, as
          his eyes WELL:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          She was like you. Seemed to think I was
          a good man.
          (finally, voice almost

                         CRACKS)
          But I couldn't save either of you.
          A beat... his bound hands gently touch her face...

          JAKE (CONT' D )
          Where's the good in that?
          His eyes CLOSE. Too much.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Ella.
          And that sits... then suddenly -- JARRINGLY -- THREE MORE BRAVES
          roughly enter, pull Jake up, FORCE HIM out:

          EXT. APACHE ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

          BAN! Our people are THROWN TO THEIR KNEES in a large CIRCLE OF
          APACHES. GUARDED by warriors with tomahawks and -- WHOOSH! A
          PYRE is ignited and if we ever had any doubt about Ella being
          dead, the BRAVES carry her roughly past --

                         JAKE

          HEY! GODDAMMIT DON'T YOU TOUCH--
          -- he's YANKED BACK and held in place as... ELLAIg BODY IS
          THROWN RIGHT INTO THE FLAMES. Jake helplessly watches her BURN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         EMMETT
          Wasn't your fault, Mr. Lonergan.
          Those things... were lookin' for her.
          Had a picture and everything.
          That breaks the spell. Jake looks over --

                         JAKE
          What d'you mean... 'a picture'?

                         EMMETT
          Floatin', like that arrow thing we found
          in its eye.
          Before Jake can makes sense of this, a teepee smoke flap OPENS
          and out steps the tribe's SACHEM. This is GREY WOLF -- dark,
          wrinkled face enhanced by TATTOOS. He takes one look at his
          prisoners and SPEAKS A FEW WORDS OF APACHE.

                         DOC
          What'd he say?

                         COLORADO
          "Kill them. And make it quick."
          Doc is amply freaked. Turns to Jake as FIVE OF THE BRAVES move
          for them, MENACING --

                         DOC
          Now'd be a good time to use your gun
          bracelet, my friend.
          But Jake is VACANT. BROKEN. All the fight seems GONE from him.
          His bracelet DOESN'T MOVE.
          Dolarhyde's grabbed first... PULLED FORWARD by one of the
          braves, raising his TOMAHAWK -- they're really gonna KILL HIM --

                         DOLARRYDE

                         (SUBTITLED)

          SOP. DON'T DO THIS.
          SURPRISED looks from just about everyone in the camp (besides
          Colorado) as we realize Dolarhyde just spoke APA
          ON GREY WOLF -- INTRIGUED as he approaches Dolarhyde:

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          How is it that you speak our language?

                         UOLARHYUE (SUBTITLE)
          Because I'm a damn genius.
          Grey Wolf's fascinated this man has the audacity to be a WISEASS
          given his circumstances. Turns to the Brave with the tomahawk --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Forget about quick. Make him feel it.
          The Brave NODS, RAISES the Tomahawk again, but Dolar interrupts:

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Two hundred head of cattle!
          Grey Wolf holds up his hand, halting the Brave's death blow --

          DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D)
          I'll have two hundred head of cattle u_a
          here in a day's time if you let me go.
          ON GREY WOLF. Considering this.

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          And how do I know you'll come back?
          Dolarhyde nods to Colorado --

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          You can keep my associate here. if I
          don ' t come back, you can kill him.
          Colorado REACTS. He's the only one here who knows what the hell
          these two are saying to each other as Grey Wolf approaches
          Dolar, looks right INTO HIM --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Why should I believe that you even care
          about this man?
          Dolarhyde's eyes flash EMOTION. Quickly bottled. Then:

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Because he's my son.
           Wow. Didn't see that one coming. Grey Wolf levels Colorado
          with those unyielding eyes --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Is this true?
          And Colorado answers in ENGLISH, for the benefit of the others:

                         COLORADO
          Yeah... he's my father.
          REACTIONS. JAKE. EMMETT. DOC. Stunned silence. And so:

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Three hundred head.
          Dolar looks to Colorado, who won't meet his eyes. His FATHER's
          eyes. Turns back to Grey Wolf, HARD --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Two fifty.
          HOLD ON GREY WOLF for a beat. Then --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Cut him loose.
          The Brave does exactly that. Dolar's FREE to go...

                         EMMETT
          Hey! What about =?!?
          ON DOLAR. A FLASH of regret. But it's gone fast.

                         DOLARHYDE
          What about you, kid?
          And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind...
          GONE. And now, it's back to business --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Kill all of them except the half-breed.
          Our people are GRABBED. Jake's yanked forward, PINNED DOWN -- a
          Brave raises a HATCHET to kill Jake, who glares back with
          lunatic eyes. Ready to die. Almost wanting it:

                         JAKE
          What're you waiting for, asshole? DO IT.
          And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH:

          FWOOM! THE PYRE SUDDENLY BILLOWS, TURNING FROM ORANGE TO GREEN

          TO WHITE -- EVERYONE BACKS AWAY AS --

          ELLA EMERGES FROM THE PYRE. WRAPPED IN A CAUL OF FIRE AND LIGHTI
          Except she isn't exactly Ella. She's a HUMANOID, incredibly
          close to us in physical appearance, her features acutely
          feminine, yet... ALJM.
          PANDEMONIUM. The Apache kneel in prostration, DROPPING weapons
          as flames DISSIPATE off Ella's backlit form. Her skin RETURNS
          to human flesh-tone. Hair too. When she finally STOPS, she
          looks like the ELLA we've come to know and love. STANDS there:

                         ELLA
          . what... happened?
          ON JAKE. Holy. SHIT. Everyone else equally STUNNED.

                         EMMETT
          You... died.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Ella looks around. Fifty dumbstruck faces staring at her.

                         ELLA

                         (QUIETLY; CAUGHT)
          . oh.
          OFF ELLA, who's got a helluva lot to explain --

          INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT

          A deerskin shirt slips down over Ella's naked body.' A dark
          breechcloth is tied. She TURNS to us.: beautiful as ever.

          EXT. TEEPEE - NIGHT

          Ella emerges to find... JAKE. Standing outside.the teepee.
          HARD. And for a long moment, nothing is said. Until she takes
          a step TOWARD him:

                         ELLA
          If I'd told you on the boat, you never
          would'a trusted me --
          -- but he takes a step BACK. If he's relieved she's alive, he
          isn't showing it:

                         JAKE
          Did you hear what I said?

                         ELLA
          .. What?

                         JAKE
          When you were playin' possum. Did you
          hear what I mid?
          He's angry. Yes, even embarrassed. And because of it,
          something has SHUT DOWN in him again. That killer look is back.

                         ELLA
          No. I was mendin'.

                         (BEAT)
          It's like sleep.
          His eyes narrow, trying to understand:

                         JAKE
          How's it you look like one of us?

                         ELLA
          I can look like whatever I want to.

                         JAKE
          So you can't die?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         ELLA
          Sure I can. If my heart stops beating...
          just like you.

          .JAKE
          You're nothin' like me, Ella. You're
          one'a them.
          we can see that hurt her. But she deserved it, too. So
          desperately wants to reach him...

                         ELLA
          I'm not, Jake. I'm from a different
          place.
          He isn't sure what that means. Can he even trust her? Either
          way, she has ANSWER;. Darkly:

                         JAKE
          The one that took you.

                         (BEAT)
          It killed her.
          That LANDS on her. Knowing and painful.

                         ELLA
          They call him The Slaver. He's the one,
          gave me the scars. Broke me. And made
          me watch... while he killed my family
          too.
          Even with his guard up... Jake can't help but be STRUCK. As the
          sound of HOWLING WIND takes us to:

          EXT. BOX CANYON - RIM - NIGHT

          A SANDSTORM... through which a GHOSTLY FIGURE materializes...
          THE SLAVER. Moving with angry purpose toward the CANYON BLUFF.
          As he looks down into it, we hear the SOUNDS of MACHINERY below.
          But we DO__QT.YET_ REVEAL what it_ is__ he sees.
          He stalks down, LEAVING FRAME -- as we HOLD on the field of

          TWINKLING STARS ---

          ELLA (V.0.)
          For every drop of light in the sky,
          there's another world. Filled with
          life...

          EXT. APACHE CAMP - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

          Ella's in front of the campfire, surrounded by EVERYONE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         ELLA
          Our race was first to map the stars...
          that's why they came for us. Took our
          planet, piece by piece. Slaughtered
          anyone who fought hack. Ones who
          survived were turned into slaves.
          Trackers.
          She says this meeting the eyes of GREY WOLF. There's immediate
          SIMPATICO here: a story the Indians could be telling.

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          They brought me aboard one of their scout
          ships -- a ship with only one purpose: to
          find other planets like mine. Planets
          they can take... people they can enslave.
          As the terrible gravity of all this HITS everyone, JAKE is first
          to understand...

                         JAKE
          X lead 'em here.
          Ella swallows. Wracked with GUILT.

                         EMMETT
          Well damn, lady, thanks a 1.

                         ELLA
          I never wanted this.
          (an EMOTIONAL beat)
          But they got... ways. Of making you do
          things.
          Her eyes are HAUNTED with memory. The inference is some kind of
          TORTURE. She pushes it away -- staying strong:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Been tryin' to make it right... tried to
          blow the ship to hell by burnin' up all
          their fuel, then escaped down here.

                         (BEAT)
          'Cept it didn't work... damn thing
          survived.

                         JAKE
          Where is it.
          Jake's determined -- he's got his OWN agenda. Ella looks up to
          that OMINOUS CLOUD. Those BLUE LIGHT FLASHES ripple within:

                         ELLA
          Hiding in that cloud. Way I figure,
          they'll find enough fuel to leave by
          tomorrow, midday. Then they'll bring
          back the others.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         DOC
          "others"?

                         ELLA
          The whole fleet. They'll take what they
          need. Everyone on this planet. Anything
          too weak to survive... they'll toss.
          Like that cow.
          Tomorrow. Midday. Hi noon. This is bad, bad news.

                         NAT COLORADO
          What'd you mean, they're looking for
          "fuel"...?
          And before Ella can answer, Jake already GETS IT:

                         JAKE
          Gold. That's why they're in a mine.

                         ELLA
          (NODS, solemn)
          . wherever it is, that's where you
          escaped from -- and it's the only way
          back up to the ship.

                         (STEPS CLOSER)
          Even with your memory wiped, your
          instincts kicked in --

                         (HIS BRACELET:)
          That's how it works, Jake, the bracelet
          reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it
          reacts. Somehow you took it off one of
          'em... don't you remember any of it?
          ON JAKE. Deeply STIRRED. As he looks down at the BRACELET and:
          MEMORY FLASBCUTSI REPLAY POV as we're HELD DOWN in that CAVE
          the TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes
          One of the ALIENS starts to activate the probe -- it begins to
          FLASH STEADILY -- HYPNOTICALLY -- PUvTNG OUR MIND --
          But our arm manages to BREAK FREE -- a BLADE hidden in our
          sleeve -- WE SLASH OFF THE. ALIEN'S HAND -- GRAB THE BRACELET off
          its severed limb -- it COILS around our wrist and ACTIVATES:

          us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          That STRANGE ROCK FORMATION HIGH ABOVE on the edge of a CANYON --
          the STONE TOWER pointing to heaven --
          JAKE IN PRESENT: The sequencing is COMPLETE for him now:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          I remember seeing a tower... made of
          stone... on the rim of a canyon...
          Upon hearing that, Grey Wolf suddenly speaks in animated
          gestures, pointing North. Colorado REACTS:

                         ELLA
          What? What's he sayin'?!?
          Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE:

                         COLORADO
          That rock you're talkin' about... he-
          knows where it is.

          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - NIGHT

          The Slaver ENTERS the gloom of an UNDERGROUND CAVERN. Two
          ALIENS melt from the dark to greet him with frightening HISSES.
          SENTRIES. We HOLD on the walls as something GLITTERS: GOLD.

          INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - SOMEWHERE

          CLOSE ON SHERIFF TAGGART'S REFLECTION IN MURKY WATER. As we
          TILT UP to reveal him hanging UPSIDE DOWN. Eyes flutter open.
          He's seen better days. Dazed. Turns his head slightly...

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          You... all right...?
          DRIFTING over to see MARIA. Gravity PULLING her hair downward.
          Groggy. Mostly SCARED:

                         MARIA

                         (BRAVE FACE)
          . Fantastic. You?

          CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS, ROTATING 180 DEGREES, TO REVEAL THEY'RE
          STUCK TO THE CEILING OVER A WATER GROTTO. The whole town of
          Absolution is here... a hundred others from the now-cratered
          town of Winfield's Landing, feet embedded in the ORANGE RESIN.
          Suddenly, PERCY DOLARHYDE sees a TERRIFYING SHADOW spread across
          the wall -- what looks like a HUGE, COILING SNAKE:

                         PERCY DOLARHYDE

          H-- HEY!!! THE HELL'S THA--?!
          -- but what comes around the corner is a LONG METAL TENTACLE:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          A SCANNING MECHANISM on its tip shoots out a blue triangular
          beam -- itemizing specimens -- SELECTING ONE: SHERIFF TAGGART.
          Mechanized TALONS open up -- Taggart SCREAMS as he's PLUCKED
          from the ceiling like an apple from a TREE:

          DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE

          KYLE!!!!
          ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE -- swinging
          our men across the cavern where we reveal...
          . the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE.
          Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating
          table. As they thrash, RESTRAINING CLAMPS enfold their skulls.
          An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr. them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_
          seeing! This is what haRpened to him before he escaRe !
          WORKER-BEE ALIENS adjusts the device over their eyes -- INSTANT
          X-RAYS read their retinas -- HYPNOTIC -- as the men grow DOCILE
          and LIMP despite their fight and -- FLASHFLASHTLASHI
          The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS. Catatonic stares.
          Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT
          CAPSULES. METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their
          throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID.
          This is the same blue goo -- a protective gel -- that housed the
          COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert.
          More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS.
          We see containment holds filled with BLEATING COWS and REARING
          HORSES... all going through a similar cocooning process.
          All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp
          behind the cocoons. The craft HUMS to life, undergear
          retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel...

          EXT. CANYON RIM - DANN

          Our people ride up a rocky slope with a few Apaches. Grey Wolf
          looks around and SPEAKS, Colorado translates:

                         NAT COLORADO
          This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe.
          As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER. Dismounts:

                         JAKE
          That's it.
          As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that
          MACHINERY. Everyone dips low, peering over to see...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          What looks a whole lot like a CAVALRY FORT in the canyon below,
          amid a network of trenches and underground tunnels. Except this
          fortress is made of some kind of ALIEN ALLOY, glowing impossibly
          bright as its steel surface reflects the rising sun.
          DRILLING MACHINES are chewing deep into the earth, mining for

          GOLD -- THESE ARE THE SAME DRILLS THAT LANDED IN OUR OPENING.
          Massive receptacles are FILLED with HUGE CHUNKS.
          ALIENS move in and out, working, as if from an ant hive.

                         DOC
          Holy Jesus. Like a damn fort.
          Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes:

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          The Kiowa... they were taken too.
          Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a
          CHROME LOTUS... and WHOOSH! The SHUTTLE TRANSPORT flies out of
          the canyon, RISING into the dawn sky...

                         ELLA
          Transports. Way they get people and gold
          back and forth to the ship.

                         DOC
          Place is crawling with those things.
          We'll never even get close.
          Grey Wolf SPEAKS --

                         NAT COLORADO
          He says there's a back way in... The Twin
          Rivers run underneath this whole canyon.
          Limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple
          miles East. Lead right down there.
          Jake looks to the SKY. DARK. DETERMINED.

                         JAKE
          The Slaver... he's up in that big cloud?
          Ella nods, HARD. Off their SHARED DETERMINATION, our SCORE
          rises. A DRUM CADENCE that suggests a MISSION starting to form:

          EXT. APACHE CAMP - DAY

          DOC. Skeptical, eyes narrow -- staring at Jake and Ella --
          surrounded by our team and the Apaches back at the APACHE CAMP:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         DOC
          Just so I got this straight... three of
          those things just kicked the shit out of
          your entire gang, took our whole town,
          and now you two're gonna ride right into
          that fort, try to hijack one'a those--
          He pauses on the word --

                         ELLA
          "Transports."

                         DOC

          Spaceshp.

                         DOC
          Then bring it down here and get everybody
          off alive? That's your big plan?
          Jake and Ella share a LOOK. Simply:

                         JAKE
          Yup.

                         DOC
          And just how do you figure on getting in
          there in the first place?

                         JAKE
          Poke a hornet's nest... they swarm
          at'cha.

                         ELLA
          You gotta draw 'em out. Buy us a
          distraction.
          A long beat of incredulous, do-you-believe-this-shit STARES:

                         DOC
          You want us to storm that fort? Against
          those things? With less than fifty men?
          It's suicide.

                         EMMETT
          It ain't, it's been done! I read at
          school how Ethan Allen and his Green
          Mountain Boys took Fort Ticonderoga, they
          weren't but a small garrison and they
          were outgunned --

                         ELLA
          We need all of you to make a stand.
          Together. It's the only way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         NAT COLORADO
          Make a stand with what?
          Jake turns to the WAGON they rode from Jake's gang camp -- the
          WHISKEY CRATES. Sweeps up a bottle:

                         JAKE
          This.
          An impossible mission. Sure death. Yet for the first time...
          they have an ADVANTAGE. Emmett cuts the moment with a BIG GRIN:

                         EMMETT
          Hell, yeah. Let's squish some bugs.
          Grey Wolf CHUCKLES, murmurs. Jake looks to Nat for translation:

                         JAKE
          Somethin' funny?

                         NAT COLORADO
          Yeah... that you whites finally know what
          it feels like to face extinction. Now
          that we're on the same side, he says we
          can all die together.

                         (THEN)
          They're with us.
          The LOOK holds between them --

                         JAKE
          Guess that means you're not waitin' for
          your dad to come back.
          Colorado's face CLOUDS. Years of ANGER and RESENTMENT:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Been Woodrow Dolarhyde's son my whole
          life... first time he ever copped to it
          was to save his own ass.
          (not without emotion)
          He's not comin' back.
          And as Colorado TURNS away, the PERCUSSION finds another GEAR --

          MONTAGE -- OUR CLAN PREPARES FOR BATTLE:
          Pieces of CLOTH are RIPPED, stuffed inside the WHISKEY BOTTLES.

          MOLOTOV COCKTAILS...
          Emmett works with Apaches and their KIDS, roping WOOD together
          to build LADDERS and CATAPULTS...
          WAR PAINT is applied to faces in DARK STREAKS...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          Jake slips on his coat. Sees Emmett lead a horse to mount up
          with his BOW and ARROW QUIVER:

                         JAKE
          Not you, Kid.

                         EMMETT
          Aw, hell, we been through this. Ya can't
          stop me.
          Jake draws his gun, SPINS it in his palm, aims at Emmett's FOOT:

                         JAKE
          I can shoot you in the foot.

                         EMMETT
          Bu111i11SHIT.
          Jake SIGHS -- bluff called. Holsters the gun and takes a
          knee... but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment,
          he GRABS Emmett by the collar, pulls him CLOSE:

                         JAKE
          You told me your daddy's all you got
          left. Want me to save his ass?
          Then park yours right there on the
          ground, you little shit. Got me?
          Emmett's nailed. ANGRY, but knows he's gotta stay.

                         EMMETT
          Yeah. I gotcha.
          Jake releases him. Happy moves to Ella but she TSKS:

                         ELLA
          Stay with the kid, Happy.
          The dog WHINES but complies, moving next to Emmett. Jake climbs
          on his horse. Looks back to the boy -- now he Ia tender:

                         JAKE
          I'll get your father back. Bastard still
          owes me fifty dollars.
          The hint of a SMIRK... long enough for Emmett to SMIRK BACK.
          Ella, Doc, and Colorado mount Â»p too, along with a 10-MAN APACHE
          WAR PARTY. Jake meets eyes with GREY WOLF:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          You'll be ready?
          Grey Wolf NODS. Some part of the PLAN we have yet to learn.
          And now Jake starts to trot off, Ella beside him. This plays
          just between the two of them:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         ELLA
          That's a nice thing... what you said to
          the boy. I didn't know better, I'd say
          you got yourself a sweet side.
          She smiles. But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious:

                         JAKE
          There's nothin' sweet about me. I told
          that kid what he needed to hear so he
          wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care
          about is killin' that thing.
          And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head:

                         ELLA
          I don't believe that.

                         JAKE
          Well believe it. I was playing a part.
          (straight at her)
          Just like you were.
          He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead. HOLD ON ELLA... who finally
          follows as they all ride out and MUSIC SOARS:

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - CONTINUOUS


          JAKE, ELLA, COLORADO, DOC AND THE APACHE WARRIORS RIDE LIKE HELL

          TOWARD THEIR FATE, SLAMMING RIGHT INTO LENS -- AND WE MATCH TO:

          EXT. DOLARHYDE'S RANCH - DAY

          THUNDERING HOOVES -- but it's DOLARHYDE on his horse. REARS
          near the SERVANTS QUARTERS -- moving FAST toward a small hut:
          A HATCHET is embedded in a wood pile. Dolarhyde YANKS it out.

          INT. SERVANTS' QUARTERS - DAY

          The APACHE WOMAN we saw in the drawn-and-quartered scene earlier
          is washing clothes on a basin board. She turns as --
          Dolarhyde ENTERS. A menacing figure with a blade in the
          doorway. She stands, ALERT -- in SUBTITLED APACHE:

          THE WOMAN (SUBTITLE)
          What are you doing?
          Without response, he levels the axe and SLAMS it down on the
          FLOORBOARDS. Wood chips SPRAY until a GASH is opened. Dolar
          REACHES in... pulling out a CANVAS BAG. A few COINS spill
          out... COLD. He picks them up -- looks at the woman:

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Need it to save Nat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          And now her worry becomes FEAR; English now:

                         THE WOMAN
          Is he okay?

                         DOLARHYDE
          He's gonna be.
          A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde
          veneer starts to CRACK... just a hint... as the woman MOVES to
          him... and TOUCHES his face.
          And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S
          MOTHER. Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE.

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          I won't let anything happen to him,
          Jenny.

                         THE WOMAN

                         (SOFTLY)
          Come back to me.
          With that, he's GONE with the gold. Leaving her full of DREAD.

          EXT. TWIN RIVER FALLS - CAVERN ENTRANCE - DAY

          A CASCADING WATERFALL flows over rock face into the TWIN RIVERS.
          The water curtain covers a CAVERN ENTRANCE. The back way in.
          Jake, Ella, Doc, Colorado and the Apaches cross slippery rocks
          and push through the water...

          INT. LIMESTONE CAVERN - CONTINUOUS

          Behind the curtain, they shake off the wet and remove TORCHES
          from waterproof buffalo-hide pouches. FIRELIGHT as our team
          creeps along in a column. TENSE. Jake glances at Colorado:

                         JAKE
          You and Percy're brothers, huh?

                         NAT COLORADO
          ... half.

                         JAKE
          So... your momma and Dolarhyde---

                         NAT COLORADO
          We friends now? Last I checked, you shot

          Want it back?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Colorado GRUMBLES, pushes ahead of Jake...

          EXT. FORT HUACHUCA - MORNING

          A BUZZARD picks at the EAR of a DEAD GANG MEMBER. More birds
          scavenge the dismembered remains of JAKE'S CREW as the rest of
          its LIVING MEMBERS -- roughly 30 -- tend wounds and get ready to
          move on. One of them looks up...
          .. and sees an INCOMING RIDER on the horizon:

                         OUTLAW

          BRONC!
          BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of
          the gang... until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG. As
          he comes closer -- they realize it's DOLARHYDE:

                         HUNT
          One of them fellas Jake was ridin' with!
          Dolarhyde rides into camp, REARING in front of 30 guns

                         BRONC
          The hell you want?

                         DOLARHYDE
          It's about what you want.
          He reaches into his pocket and tosses Bronc a GOLD COIN:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Lonergan stole your gold. That's a taste
          of what I got -- more'n you've ever seen.
          It's all yours if you help me get my boy
          back.
          The men trade LOOKS. Bronc eyes the coin. Alight with greed:

                         BRONC
          Who's got your boy?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Well, there's the rub.

                         (BEAT)
          I got two.

          Our team has travelled far into the bowels of the cavern. Jake
          STOPS, torchlight reflecting the GOLD in the cavern walls.
          Doc cracks off a piece. POCKETS it. Shrugs:

          They SNEAK on down the narrow shaft til they're funneled into...

          THE WATER GROTTO
          Where our TOWNSPEOPLE were hanging. Now, GONE. Around the
          corner, the sound of ENGINES POWERING UP...
          A TRANSPORT. A dozen WORKER-BEE ALIENS try to corral the HORSES
          from the pen -- cruelly jabbing the animals with ALIEN CATTLE
          PRODS. The mares REAR and WHINNY.

                         JAKE
          We're never gonna get close to that ship.
          Silently. a DRIPPING. GLISTENING SHAPE rises un from the WATER
          behind them. Swaying like a COBRA ready to strike:
          Our people TURN... the TUBE ALIEN snatches one of the Apaches,
          SWALLOWING HIM in its thorny snout! The indian SCREAMS --

                         JAKE
          Lights a WHISKEY MOLOTOV, hurls it at the CREATURE: BOOM! It
          KEENS, BURNING, SPITTING OUT the Apache. ALERTED, the dozen
          aliens by the transport SWARM at our heroes!

          C g_that shuttle.
          Colorado readies his TOMAHAWK -- Jake meets his eyes:

                         JAKE
          Knew there was a good reason I didn't
          kill you.

          Just thinkin' the same thing.
          The men trade FATEFUL LOOKS... then the Indians HURL MOLOTOVS at
          the charging horde: KAAA-BOOM! Aliens TWIST and SCREAM --
          The Apaches STRIKE FEARLESSLY -- but the aliens quickly RECOVER
          and SHAKE THEM OFF, tearing most of them to SHREDS.
          The horses BREAK FREE and crash madly through the cavern --
          And this is the DISTRACTION Jake and Ella need to make their run,
          for the transport -- up the loading ramp:

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - MINI CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

          Ella SLAMS a switch and the ramp DRAWS UP. Jake FREEZES:
          COCOONS hang all around, filled with motionless HUMAN BEINGS.

          She slaps open an ENGINEERING HATCH, drops down a LADDER. He
          takes a last awful look and SLIDES down after her --

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

          -- the ladder funnels into the COCKPIT. Ella starts TAPPING the
          console and HOLO-DISPLAYS appear, Alien text, rotating
          graphics. She slides into a SEAT --

                         ELLA
          Strap in. dammit!!!

                         JAKE
          Into what?!?
          Ella JAMS a lever forward and the shuttle RISES. JAKE grabs
          WEBBING that must be some type of SEATBELT, feeling the
          sensation of ELLQU as:

          INT. CAVERN TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

          Ella pilots the ship UPWARD, thrusters belching a WAKE OF FIRE

          Colorado PULLS Doc up onto the horse's bare back -- no easy task
          with Doc's 300 POUNDS. The remaining Apaches (5) commandeer
          horses and GALLOP HARD down the tunnel --
          Two aliens jump on MANTA-SPEEDERS in pursuit!

          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - DAY


          THE TRANSPORT SHUTTLE KAMIKAZES THROUGH BI-SECTING TUNNELS:
          Jake has NEVER moved this fast, BARELY avoiding walls as Ella
          expertly pilots the ship. LEFT -- RIGHT -- SIDEWAYS -- up
          ahead, DIM LIGHT spills from a FISSURE leading above ground:

                         ELLA
          Hold on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          She cranks back and the ship PITCHES upward --

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - OVER THE CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          The shuttle BURSTS OUT into the canyon and skates the rim. Jake
          fights the G-FORCES and teeth-rattling TURBULENCE as --
          The craft keeps spiralling UP UP toward... THE OMINOUS CLOUD.
          As we come closer, an IMPOSSIBLY BLUE GLOW blinds us:

          EXT. UPPER CLOUD LAYER - CONTINUOUS

          The shuttle BLASTS through the upper cloud layer, to reveal...

          THE ALIEN SCOUT
          -SHIP. ENORMOUS AND THREATENING, like a BLACK METAL CLAW. Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye
          of a hurricane.
          ON ELLA. Like ice down her spine... as we drift back to JAKE.
          Trying to find a word to DESCRIBE this thing. Finally:

                         JAKE
          Sheee-it.

          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

          The rest of our heroes GALLOP FAST out the criss-crossing
          tunnels -- KA-CHINNNG! Apaches are CLAMPED WITH STEEL COLLARS
          and YANKED off their horses as the SPEEDERS roar in from behind!
          Colorado VEERS toward a LIGHT as Doc ignites a molotov and they:

          INT. ALIEN FORT - CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          GALLOP Out into daylight, rigb-t_through the CENTER of the fort --
          Doc THROWS his molotov and BOOM!!! Aliens go FLYING, on fire!
          Doc throws another MOLOTOV, clearing a path for Colorado to RIDE
          HARD for the fort's 30 FT. STEEL ENTRY GATES... which start
           SWINGING CLOSED to trap them!
          But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow
          opening as it THUNDERS CLOSED. Now the aliens are pissed off:

          EXT. ALIEN FORT - CONTINUOUS

          They start spilling over the fort walls in pursuit. A few mount
          SPEEDERS and launch as our guys ride DOWN THE CANYON TRENCH:

          ,INT. CANYON TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

          Colorado and Doc ZIG-ZAG around CURVES -- like mice navigatinga
          maze, so the speeders can't get a clear shot:

                         DOC
          They're gaining on us!

                         NAT COLORADO
          That's the point!
          And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS...
          BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN
          from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade
          CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING!
          A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES
          RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH!
          An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking
          WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows. Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY!
          The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets
          it FLY -- WHOOSH! It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO
          FLAMES, the speeder CORKSCREWS into another one, both EXPLODING:

                         EMMETT

          YEAHHHHH!!!

                         THE ALIENS
          Caught OFF-GUARD with NO WM TO TURN AROUND as from the OPPOSITE
          END of the canyon, a BELLOWING WAR WHOOP:

          GREY WOLF AND HIS 40 APACHES CHARGE IN. A MOVING HUMAN WALL
          CRASH! The Apaches HURTLE into the flank of aliens. LASERS are

          The Apache leader spurs his horse onward, leading men toward the

          EXT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - ABOVE THE CLOUDS - CONTINUOUS

          -- PLASMA FIRE of the shuttle's burners as it ROARS toward the
          ALIEN SHIP... a SPECK against the BEHEMOTH:

          INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          The shuttle sweeps past the command center's polarized window,
          where... THE SLAVER watches with EVIL EYES.
          He's on the UPPER LEVEL of a TWO-TIER COMMAND CENTER. A DOZEN
          ALIENS operate holo-consoles. Readying the ship to leave.

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - SAME

          Ella settles down on a GLOWING DOCKING COLLAR. With the two
          ships CONNECTED, the DISPLAY flashes a DEPARTURE ALERT:

          As they spill into the LOADING BAY, a CLANG reverberates:
          THE AIRLOCK DOOR -- AT THEIRFEyT
          The first EXPLOSIVE BOLT shoots off. Ella jams her SHOTGUN into
          a sheath on her back, presses herself flat:

                         ELLA
          Hug the wall.
          Jake does that beside her as the next bolt PINGS out --

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          When they come at us, aim for their
          heads. Only way to kill 'em for sure.

                         JAKE
          I'll aim just fine.
          THE LAST BOLT FIRES and the airlock door SHOOTS OFF:

          A MULTI- D HYDRAULIC "GRABBER" RISES INTO THE MECHANICAL

          LIMBS SWINGING AROUND INCHES FROM THEIR FACES!

                         JAKE (CONT'D)

          The manipulator arms SCOOP UP COCOONS, pulling them DOWN the

          She JUMPS through the airlock -- Jake has no time to think:

          he sees ASSAULTS HIS MIND. We RISE UP UP UP, Ella and Jake
          growing SMALLER in what we now reveal is a MASSIVE HANGAR where:
          AUTOMATED -ARMS PLANT RECENT ARRIVALS INTO A VERITABLE FOREST of
          PEOPLE AND ANIMALS. Level after level, THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS
          OF COCOONS are suspended from branch-like limbs.
          Jake picks himself up, looking around the massive hangar in AWE.

          overhead, flashing a WIDE CONICAL LASER that inventories cocoons
          like the machine in the underground cave. As they CROUCH:

          We can't let that thing see us or they'll
          know we're here.
          She turns -- hits buttons on a console -- a door SLIDES UP
          leading to a series of CORRIDORS. She starts to MOVE --

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          This'll take us to the bridge --
          But Jake doesn't follow. STARES at her --

          Then I'm not goin' with you.
          And now she HARDENS --

                         ELLA
          You got any idea how big this ship is?
          No ray you'll ever find him alone. Be
          like findin' a needle in a--
          -- SLAM!! Jake interrupts her by aiming at the LASER SCANNER
          and FIRING HIS BLASTER, blowing it apart. The scanner eye
          CRASHES to the floor, flaming. A KLAXON rings --

          I ain't gonna find him. He's gonna find
          me.

                         ELLA'S FURIOUS:

                         ELLA
          Thanks for the head start.
          She turns and RUNS. Jake moves to that scanner eye on the
          floor, walks right up to it and STARES into the shattered IRIS:

                         JAKE
          Alright, you sonofabitch... come and get
          me.

          INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          JAKE'S FACE APPEARS AS A THERMAL HEAT SOURCE -- fritzing as he
          stares into the scanner. ALARMS scream.
          THE SLAVER fills with RAGE. And RECOGNITION.
          Aliens begin grabbing WEAPONS but The Slaver SHRIEKS for them to

          I need more bandages now!/ You: lint and
          splint that leg!

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          We're losing ranks ! ! !
           And then, out of nowhere... the BANG BANG BANG of 30 pistols
          fills the air as --
          DOLARHYDE RIDES IN WITH JAKE'S GANG! A renewed SURGE of energy
          as cowboys join Indians to fortify their ranks:

                         NAT COLORADO
          You came back!

                         DOLARHYDE
          Told you: I take care of my kin.
          Colorado knows that's as close to "I love you" as he'll ever
          get. But the UPSWING is short-lived as:
          A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE. It splits
          open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES -- pieces
          hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming:
          THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH. TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to
          life, firing STRANGE STEEL BALL BEARINGS in every direction.
          CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers! One
          LODGES in a GANG MEMBER beside DOC -- he FLAILS:

                         GANG MEMBER

          HELP ME!!! GET IT OFF!
          A RED SPRING-LOADED PIN depresses in the ball's center: KA-BOOM!

          SEARING WHITE LIGHT TURNS THE OFFICER TOAASH -- AN ALIEN
          GRENADE! Doc goes FLYING from the kickback, landing near:
          GREY WOLF -- FWWWWTWHCK!!! Another claw-ball CLAMPS into the
          Apache's SHOULDER -- he SHOUTS, struggles to pull it out --

                         DOC

          DON'T. STOP, DAMMIT!!!!
          The RED PIN starts to depress -- pOC LUNGES, JAMS HIS FINGER
          RETJff&H_THE PIN AND BLASTING CAP. Now he's stopped it from
          exploding, but if he pulls his finger out... HE DIES TOO.
          DOC and GREY WOLF lock eyes. Their fates suddenly ENTWINED as --

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - TURBOLIFT - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

          Bars of light move rhythmically across Jake's face -- BURNING
          with determination -- as he travels up in the turbolift. It
          slows to a STOP. The door cycles open and --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          -- the STRANGEST THING happens. DESERT SAND billows in a gust
          of ventilated air. SAND?! Jake emerges, blocking his eyes:

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - JUNKPILE CARGO HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

          -- the sand swirls and eddies. Visibility reduced to ZERO. As
          Jake pushes through, the air clears a little...
          His eyes WIDEN. Trying to make SENSE of what he sees:
          Remember all those BUILDINGS that were pulled up into the
          tornado when Absolution was attacked? And that CRATER they
          found that used to be "Winfield's Landing"? It-'-s all-HE
          in a junkwle hangar. Building pieces. False front
          facades. Debris piled on top of each other, TILTED AND TWISTED
          AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES. And the desert sand that was sucked up
          along with it all.
          A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage.
          Weapon ready, Jake moves past part of A BROTHEL. Jutting
          fragments of a HORSE CORRAL. A CREAKING SALOON SIGN swings like
          a pendulum, CLANKS EERILY.
          A STEAM PIPE EXPLODES STEAM. Jake WHIRLS -- and like demons...
          5 ALIENS emerge. Slowly. Fanning out, taking positions as...
          THE SLAVER steps out of the smoke, squarely facing Jake. aAd_h@--
          is holding ELLA hostage. WRIST BLASTER pressed to her throat.
          Jake and Ella LOCK EYES. She's terrified, but staying STRONG.
          His hand LINGERS at his hip, blaster ready.

                         JAKE
          Drop the woman. We both know this ain't
          about her.
          But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck.
          Almost GRINNING. And Jake MEETS the look --

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          She says you're as bad as they come.
          Jake curls back the fingers on both hands, CRACKING knuckles:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say
          the same about me.
          A pipe SPEWS STEAM -- UNNERVINGLY LOUD. Then STOPS.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Could'a had your boys kill me five times
          over, instead you rolled out the red
          carpet... so let's get it over with.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          The Slaver HISSES ANGRILY at the challenge. PUSHES Ella roughly
          off to one of his GANG, who keeps a blaster pressed to her side.
          Vow ' O right the a ter of the "town" junkpile.
          THE SLAVER -- his hand at his side, twitching.
          JAKE -- his hand is still.

          A PIPE SPRAYS STEAM AGAIN, SCREAMINGLY LOUD AND --
          Everyone DRAWS! But Jake's INSANELY FAST as he drops to a knee
          and FIRES gunsmoke-style -- BLAM SLAM! The Slaver's HIT and --
          ELLA -- WRENCHES her captor's arm backward and he fires USELESS
          ROUNDS into the air -- she takes a HIT in the leg as Jake SHOOTS
          the captor with a SHOT to the temple --
          Jake GRABS and PULLS Ella to safety behind a SHREDDED STORE
          FRONT, taking cover -- lasers PUNCHING through the building
          walls -- Ella spots an ALIEN lunging around a corner:

                         ELLA

          BEHIND YOU!!!
          Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet.

                         JAKE
          Stay down.
          Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS

          THEM ALL DOWN WITH PERFECT AIM.
          The REACTOR is hit in the crossfire and the ship RESPONDS with a
          turbine HOWL.
          Corpses litter the floor... all except for The Slaver. A trail
          of FLUORESCENT BLOOD leads around the corner...
          Jake WHIRLS to Ella -- her leg wounded --

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          -- you alright?
          In PAIN, she snatches one of those SMART DISCS off a dead alien:

                         ELLA
          Reactor's hit. if I don't get this ship
          on the ground soon, we're all dead...
          (tries to STAND, WINCES)
          Get me over to that turbolift.
          He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her
          to the elevator --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Put me inside.
          He does. She sees his eyes go back to The Slaver's BLOOD TRAIL:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          I can manage the rest without you.
          (tough... but with

                         COMPASSION)
          Go do what you came up here to do.
          He looks at her. At the blood. At the unstable REACTOR.
          And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE:

                         JAKE
          Goddamnit.
          -- he gets INTO THE ELEVATOR with her. She SLAMS the control
          pad, doors CLOSE -- they start rocketing upward. She half-grins
          as her eyes hold on him. And within them... trust. AND FAITH.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Stop smiling.

          EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD - OUTSIDE ALIEN FORT - CONTINUOUS

          As the FORT SIEGE continues, DOLARHYDE and COLORADO gallop back
          and forth between their men:

                         DOLARHYDE

          DON'T BREAK RANKS! HOLD YOUR LINES

          GODDAMIT! WE CAN TAKE THIS FOR--
          -- KATHWAM! An EXPLOSION throws them off their horses.
          Colorado picks up his father and they start RUNNING LOW under
          stray beams of PLASMA FIRE, reaching Doc and Grey Wolf:

          THE FOUR MEN -- PINNED BEHIND THE ROCK EMBANKMENT:
          Doc's finger is still STUCK in that ALIEN GRENADE, clamped to
          the bleeding Apache's shoulder:

          DOL.ARHYDE (CONT'D)
          The hell iz that?
          Grey Wolf MOANS in pain. Doc SHOUTS to Dolar:

                         DOC
          Tell him to hold still! If I have this
          thing figured right, long as t keep my
          finger under the red pin we won't blow
          up!

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          What's he saying?:

          He says we're all gonna die.

                         COLORADO
          We need to pull it out of his shoulder!

                         DOLARHYDE
          I'm not pullin' anything!

                         (RE: DOC)
          He's the damn doctor!
          ZZZZZZAM! MORE people are CUT DOWN by the Alien GRENADE CANNON
          -- the BLOWBACK nearly KNOCKS the grenade out of Doe's hand --

                         DOC

          SHIT!
          Dolarhyde gets an IDEA. HARDENS. Looks Doc right in the eye:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Alright, listen -- you slide your finger
          from under that pin, I'll slip mine in
          and hold it in place. Then you pull it
          out and I'll throw it.
          Doc NODS fearfully. Dolar carefully SLIPS his finger under the
          pin as Doc SLIPS it out. PHEW. Now Doc takes hold of the
          grenade itself, nods "ready" to pull it out. Grey Wolf braces

                         FOR PAIN:

          -- your wife. Maria. We had an
          arrangement. I left your saloon alone
          and she paid me off.
          ON DOC. Reeling, now REALLY confused --

          She stole from the people in your morgue.
          Gold teeth, trinkets, pocket watches --
          It LANDS on Doc: that's why he fond the watch under their bed.

                         DOC

          (and then -- )
          Wait. You hate me. Why're you telling
          me this?
          With GENUINE REMORSE:

                         DOLARHYDE
          May not get another chance --

                         (THEN)
          -- and I still hate ya.
          A MOMENT. Forgiveness and atonement.

          WILL YOU GET ON WITH IT?111

          DOC AND DOLARHYDE
          One... two... three!
          And Doc RIPS the grenade from Grey Wolf's shoulder -- he HOWLS,
          CLAMPS tearing out of his flesh. But they did it!
          As more EXPLOSIONS decimate men, Dolarhyde PULLS the grenade out
          of Doc's hands, still holding his finger under the FIRING PIN --

                         DOC

                         WHAT'RE YOU--
          Dolarhyde looks at Colorado:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Tell your mother I love her.
          With that, he CHARGES into the swirling chaos

                         NAT COLORADO

          WAIT!
          -- but BOOM! Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion -- through
          the debris, he sees his father running toward...

                         THE SUPERCANNON

          Dolarhyde HURLS the grenade -- BOOM!!! IT DETONATES IN A

          A CRY OF VICTORY as the humans STORM THROUGH! Aliens hurtle
          back in DISORDER --

          The small ALIEN BRIDGE CREW scrambles to control the damaged
          ship. The WHIR of the lift arriving, doors OPEN and --
          WHOOSH! The SMART WEAPON blurs out of the elevator, SLICING
          HALF A DOZEN ALIENS IN HALF -- circles back around to ELLA, who
          skillfully catches it as she RUN/LIMPS from the lift with JAKE --
          LASER FIRE IGNITES THE BRIDGE as he makes QUICK WORK of the rest
          and Ella mans a console, getting to work --

                         ELLA
          We're going down fast.
          She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN -- The
          BATTLEFIELD. Sets coordinates, vectoring the ship that way:
          A WHIR as a SECOND TURBOLIFT arrives... AND THE SLAVER STEPS
          QQT. Wounded, and very PISSED OFF. Jake says to Ella:

                         JAKE
          No matter what.
          Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a
          catwalk, CRASHING into conduits and GUNKY WATER below.
          Jake staggers up but The Slaver is HUGE -- SLAMS Jake back into
          the water. PINS A FOOT on his blaster arm -- CRUSHING IT.
          Jake HOWLS as The Slaver presses a series of those HIEROGLYPH
          MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET -- the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK
          CODE -- and KA-CHING! The bracelet POPS OF.E.
          The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water. Draws his LASER WHIP
          -- WHUP-SNAP! The white-hot tip LASHES JAKE'S BACK, ripping his
          shirt and BURN-SCARRING HIS BACK!
          Jake SCREAMS in agony as The Slaver WHIPS HIM MERCILESSLY --

          Another LASER WHIP SNAP and Jake seems DONE. Now The Slaver
          LIFTS Jake from the water, CRUSHING his wind-pipe.
          Jake FLAILS, REACHING for something BELOW FRAME... finally GRABS
          and STABS it into The Slaver's side. The Alien ROARS in pain
          and looks down to see --

          ONE OF HIS OWN "ICE TACKS" FROM HIS BANDOLIER EMBEDDED IN HIS

          SIDE. IT STARTS TO GLOW BLUE WITH A HIGH-PITCH WHINE:

                         JAKE
          Go to hell.

          THE SLAVER'S ROAR OF DEFEAT IS CUT SHORT AS THE MOTHERFUCKER

          Jake FALLS into the seat beside Ella, straps in. Fighting the
          controls, she SEES THE WHIP MARKS on his back. It TEARS her
          heart open. And because this might be the end... she ADMITS:

                         ELLA
          I lied.

                         JAKE

                         ELLA
          No, I heard what you said when I was
          layin' there...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          JAKE. Taken aback. LAID BARE. As she says:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          You are a good man. At least... to me.
          The ground GROWS BIGGER out the window. Her HAND reaches over
          for his. JAKE'S HAND clasps hers and --

          EXT. BADLANDS - THE BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS


          THE SHIP PLUNGES INTO THE CANYON AND CLEAR THROUGH THE ALIEN

          FORT, RIPPING IT INTO TIDAL-WAVE MOUNDS OF SHRAPNEL... CHEWS UP

          A HALF-MILE BEFORE SLOWLY COMING TO A FINAL, WRENCHING... STOP.
          The frame is WHITE with dust and SUNSHINE. As from the ether
          comes...
          EMMETT, HAPPY, and DOC, with GREY WOLF's arm slung over his
          shoulder. Among other faces, White and Apache... all of them
          PROUD WARRIORS. Staring in awe at:

          THE CRASHED ALIEN SHIP. DUG DEEP INTO THE CANYON FLOOR.
          Something starts to rain down. Looks at first like glitter...
          until we realize it's GOLD DUST.
          From an OPENING in the Scout Ship, the sound of THUNDERING
          HOOVES as... ALL THE ANIMALS STAMPEDE OUT. Then, slowly...
          HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE emerge, dazed -- their minds slowly WAKING
          UP. White and Kiowa-Apache ABDUCTEES.
          DOC RUSHES IN, searching faces -- no -- no -- no -- n--
          THERE she is, his BELOVED MARIA, stumbling weakly toward him as
          tears runs down her cheek. He EMBRACES her madly, kissing every
          inch of her face as...
          EMMETT pushes through the crowd, sees SHERIFF TAGGART --

                         EMMETT

          PAW!!!! PAW!!!!
          The kid GRABS his father and holds him for dear life, as Taggart
          stares back in a daze --

                         EMMETT (CONT'D)
          It's me -- it's Emmett.
          And somewhere in there, RECOGNITION comes to the Sheriff's
          eyes... Emmett SMILES and throws his arms around his father
          again as --

          THE TOWNSFOLK OF ABSOLUTION AND THE APACHES FIND EACH OTHER.
          Families, lovers, friends... reunited.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         COLORADO
          Moving through the FALLEN BODIES toward the lifeless form of
          Dolarhyde, his FATHER. Eyes welling, he drops to his knees...

          A VOICE (O.S.)
          Nat?
          Colorado turns -- it's PERCY. Confused. Like waking from a
          dream. Sees his father on the ground...

                         PERCY
          What... happened?
          And all Colorado can say is...

                         NAT COLORADO
          He's dead.
          That HANGS there. Percy blinks. And then --

                         PERCY
          Who's gettin' the ranch?
          ON COLORADO. At first, words that don't compute. Then PURE
          BLIND RAGE takes hold and his FISTS FLY, PUNCHING PERCY:

          NAT COLORADO PERCY

          YOU SONOFABITCH! HE JUST STOP! NAT, STOP!!!

          SAVED YOUR WORTHLESS LITTLE

          LIFE!

          DOLARHYDE (O.S.)

          HEY!
          Colorado WHIRLS -- DOLARHYDE IS STAGGERING TO HIS FEET, ALIVE!

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          No one's gettin' my ranch.
          Stunned, Colorado GRINS. Percy spits blood, points accusingly --

                         PERCY
          Paw, he--
          Dolarhyde SMACKS Percy across the face:

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          OW!!! What'd you do that for?

                         UOLARHYUE
          For being an ungrateful little bastard.
          Now shake your brother's hand and thank
          him for saving your ass, cause it's more
          than you ever would'a done bjM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          Chastened, Percy glowers at Colorado. Grudgingly reaches out a
          hand. So does Nat. As they SHAKE --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          That's better.

                         JAKE
          Staggers through the crowd. And sees ELLA. Thgy did it. But
          she still looks TROUBLED. Staring out at the vast desert...

                         JAKE
          . what is it?

                         ELLA
          We didn't get all of 'em. Some ran oft.
          That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon.
          HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note...
          We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until
          Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd...

                         FADE TO:

          EXT. TOWN OF ABSOLUTION - DAY

          A glorious sight: Absolution in REBIRTH -- FLUSH from all that
          GOLD. Storefronts brightly painted, the streets ALIVE.
          We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two
          APACHE KIDS. Suddenly, DOLARHYDE, COLORADO and their gang ride
          in. SHERIFF TAGGART emerges from his office with DEPUTY WADE:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

          EMMETT! GET OVER HERE!!!

                         EMMETT
          -- what? What'd I dQ?

          SHERIFF TAGGART EMMETT
          Get outta the road before
          you're run down! If your (overlapping)
          momma saw y-- -- "saw me playin' in the
          street she'd roll over in her
          grave and shoot lightnin'
          bolts outta her eyes," I know,
          I know!
          He runs off. Taggart SMIRKS:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Kid's got a mouth on him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Well, Kyle, considering he saved your
          life, guess you'll just have to grin'n
          bear it.
          Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Woodrow.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Kyle.
          Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Go_ _on.
          Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's this?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Claims to the land 50 miles west of here.
          I've signed it over to the township of
          Absolution.
          (off Taggart's LOOK)
          Considering I'm a businessman, I figure
          expansion's in both our interests. Needs
          the Sheriff's signature to be official.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Fifty miles west of here is where the
          goldmine is, Woodrow.

                         DOLARHYDE

                         (A BEAT)
          That so.
          With surprise, Taggart studies the paper. SMILES:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's this about twenty percent going to
          the Apaches?
          Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened
          rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Figure the only way not to piss 'em off
          is to buy 'em.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Since when'd you worry about pissin'
          anyone off?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Just sign it, Goddamnit.
          With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and
          flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow,
          but I know you'd just be insulted.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Damn right.
          Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE
          UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of
          being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where:

          INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          DOC AND MARIA burst through a door, tearing passionately at each
          other's CLOTHES -- Maria MOANS as Doc kisses her neck:

                         DOC MARIA
          SHH! The workers will hear
          us!!! Let them hear!
          As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under
          his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH.

                         DOC
          What is this?

                         MARIA
          Look at the inscription.
          He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON... POR
          SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY:

                         DOC
          This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch...

                         MARIA
          Shut up and kiss me.
          She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME --

          EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

          A hand unties a HORSE from its tether bar -- it's JAKE. Saddle
          bags packed. A BARK turns him around... HAPPY. Yipping for
          Jake to FOLLOW. He GRINS. As MUSIC begins to RISE -- HOPEFUL:

          EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

          In a LONG SHOT -- the distant SILHOUETTES of Happy BOUNDING
          through the shallow TWIN RIVERS, Jake following on horseback...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          EXT. RIM OF CANYON - DAY

          As Jake approaches, APACHE SENTRIES emerge from rocks to keep
          outsiders away. Jake TIPS his hat and they nod, let him pass.
          He nears the bluff where ELLA, GREY WOLF, and the rest of the
          Apaches finish laying DYNAMITE DET CORD that trails down into
          the canyon. Ella hears Happy BARKING -- turns to see her dog
          with Jake. She smiles as he rides up, dismounts:

                         ELLA
          Second damn time that dog ran off on me.

                         JAKE
          Second time he brought me to you.
          Happy's tail wags. The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS. And
          it seems freighted with everything. Finally, he breaks it --
          glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite,
          and the remnants of the ALIEN SHIP and FORTRESS below.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Looks like you got everything set.
          Ella eyes Jake's horse, loaded with GEAR. Looks up, clearly

                         DISAPPOINTED:

                         ELLA
          Where you headed?

                         JAKE

                         (A BEAT)
          Got some messes to clean up.
          But she looks at him. fEADI.NG liim. wryly:

                         ELLA
          Messes.

                         JAKE
          ... Yep.
          (then; off her look)
          What.
          She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:

                         ELLA
          I think you're ridin' off cause you're
          just scared of what'll happen if you
          stay.
          An INFERENCE here. Ella's going BOLD. Jake swings off his
          horse, lands beside her. Now. Almost CURIOUS:

                         JAKE
          And what's gonna happen?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          She steps CLOSER to him... INTIMATE:

                         ELLA
          You know.
          A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS...
          But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't
          quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:

                         JAKE
          If I stay... it's not gonna be good for
          anybody, Ella.
          A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he
          slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:

                         ELLA
          Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird
          noises at night. Cattle mutilations.
          Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down
          there. Give it a look-see.

                         JAKE
          (his eyes narrow)
          What's 'phenomena'?

                         ELLA
          Big storms in places that don't get big
          storms.
          ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED,
          though he plays it down:

                         JAKE
          You goin' down there yourself?

                         ELLA
          Why? You worried about me?
          You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--

                         JAKE
          No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself
          just fine.
          (then; tips his hat)
          Be seein' you around.

                         ELLA
          goodbye, Jake.
          He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and
          trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't
          be an idiot." Jake glances over --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         JAKE
          Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt.

          (BARK, BARK)
          Go on, GET.
          He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE.
          Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his
          chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end...
          But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around.
          TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap
          between them.
          Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best
          effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Abilene happens to be on my way.
          He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO
          THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms
          around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Stop smiling, Goddammit.
          He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye
          look to Grey Wolf, who NODS. Signals his men and FUSES ARE LIT:
          The DYNAMITE FUSES ssssssnake down the mountain -- reaching the
          canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF
          DYNAMITE have been placed... and as FUSE MEETS EXPLOSIVE:
          ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The
          THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear. They turn back to see...

          THE TWIN RIVERS GEYSERING UP INTO THE CANYON. COVERING ALL

          EVIDENCE OF THE ALIEN SHIP AND 'Q T.
          Ella folds her arms TIGHTER around Jake, her heart full. With a
          nod of private affirmation, he spurs the horse with a HYAI
          As the canyon behind them fills with rushing water, Jake and
          Ella ride hard into the fiery sunset...
          Away from the past, toward a future full of promise.

          FADE OUT.
