</b><b>          
</b>                                                           Emil Cioran
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. FOREST - DAWN
</b><b>          
</b>          Bare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white
          like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.
<b>          
</b>          STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a
          creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A
          LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.
<b>          
</b>          A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as
          the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and
          rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.
<b>          
</b>          It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the
          forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces
          across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:
<b>          
</b>          A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare.
          Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in
          his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.
<b>          
</b>          As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:
<b>          
</b><b>          P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING
</b><b>          
</b>          About thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW,
          DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.
<b>          
</b><b>          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES
</b><b>          
</b>          The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked
          onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.
<b>          
</b>          THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More
          cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.
<b>          
</b>          ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled
          tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs
          and bracken. A "ghillie suit" of the kind used by snipers.
<b>          
</b>          THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a
          grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks
          around again, checking its surroundings for predators.
<b>          
</b>          THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering
          him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the
          familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.
<b>          
</b>          THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the
          watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An
          interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?
<b>          
</b>          Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass,
          nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  2.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing
          and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.
<b>          
</b>          THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing
          him to us for the first time.
<b>          
</b>          He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater
          with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work
          boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.
<b>          
</b>          Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a
          DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT
          with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.
<b>          
</b>          Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT
          hanging from a frayed twine cord.
<b>          
</b>          His name is ELI.
<b>          
</b>          He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches
          beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood
          from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,
          falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT
          FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.
<b>          
</b>          Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the
          ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the
          writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.
<b>          
</b>          He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow.
          He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath.
          Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.
<b>          
</b>          For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat
          and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie
          suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.
<b>          
</b>          A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to
          its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old
          SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.
<b>          
</b>          He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on
          his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK
          SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured
          asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    3.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both
          directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned-
          out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it.
<b>          
</b>          The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch.
          Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a
          MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.
<b>          
</b>          Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle
          but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually
          wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.
<b>          
</b>          They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.
<b>          
</b>          He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he
          walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn
          loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in
          no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.
<b>          
</b>          The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now
          through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.
<b>          
</b>          The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no
          color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light
          leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.
<b>          
</b>          CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of
          a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise
          from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED
          AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.
<b>          
</b>          Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on
          appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on
          the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.
<b>          
</b>          After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down
          the other fork, away from the city.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Little more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli
          walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris.
          Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.
<b>          
</b>          He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty
          shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even
          look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.
<b>          
</b>          Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old-
          fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    4.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>                    ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR
</b><b>          
</b>          He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings
          open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from
          the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been
          cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the
          floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.
<b>          
</b>          Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword
          idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.
<b>          
</b>          As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe
          box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off
          hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.
<b>          
</b>          He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head
          grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          On the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint,
          broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.
<b>          
</b>          Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish,
          overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting
          sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,
          revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun
          unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.
<b>          
</b>          Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.
          Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
          largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.
<b>          
</b><b>          KITCHEN
</b><b>          
</b>          Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in
          the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.
<b>          
</b>          He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small
          ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at
          it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.
<b>          
</b>          Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.
          Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick
          enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  5.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          BEDROOM
</b><b>          
</b>          A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have
          been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves
          toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.
<b>          
</b>          No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN
          HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.
<b>          
</b>          Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old
          pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal
          ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.
<b>          
</b>          He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and
          shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards
          his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.
<b>          
</b>          He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the
          new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.
<b>          
</b><b>          LATER
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat
          over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he
          watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking
          it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.
<b>          
</b>          He clasps his hands together in prayer.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI

                    with this bountiful feast.
<b>          
</b>          He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so,
          we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like
          John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.
<b>

                    Thank you for bringing me this far.
                    I know my long journey's end is
                    near. I ask now only for the
                    strength and the courage to
                    complete the task that you in your
                    infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
                    upon me over all men. I won't let
                    you down. Amen.
<b>          
</b>          He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off
          a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great
          relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT
          emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli
          offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.
<b>          
</b><b>          SUNDOWN
</b><b>          
</b>          The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's
          broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a
          SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.
<b>          
</b>          He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an
          OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-
          eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.
<b>          
</b>          Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the
          beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.
<b>          
</b>          He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading
          sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.
<b>          
</b><b>          MANY PAGES LATER
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.
          Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.
<b>          
</b>          A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to
          a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli
          reaches into his pocket and produces:
<b>          
</b>          AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together
          with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery
          cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.
<b>          
</b>          The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.
          Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.
<b>          
</b>          THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,
          as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by
          the music to another world, a world far from this one.
<b>          
</b><b>          MORNING
</b><b>          
</b>          Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the
          exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.
<b>          
</b>          The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,
          he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.
          Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.
<b>          
</b>          He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.
          All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  7.

<b>          
</b>          The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears
          into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING
</b><b>          
</b>          The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard.
<b>          
</b>          He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on
          his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead
          trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.
<b>          
</b>          The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a
          world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road
          reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY".
<b>          
</b>          Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli
          arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in
          filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.
<b>          
</b>          The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a
          roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of
          food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.
<b>          
</b>          She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers
          from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified.
<b>          
</b><b>                              YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                    Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here,
                    take anything you want. You want
                    some food? Take it.
<b>          
</b>          She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli
          stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to
          read behind the mirrored goggles.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    I'm not going to hurt you.

</b><b>                              YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                    That's what the last guys said.
<b>          
</b>          Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled
          contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Here.

</b><b>                                                                    8.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.
<b>          
</b><b>                              YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                    Could you help me? The wheel came
                    off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I
                    could get it out of the ditch. But
                    I can't.
<b>          
</b>          Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just
          inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.
<b>          
</b>          He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned,
          revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg,
          showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.
<b>          
</b>          He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the
          cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert.
<b>          
</b>          Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched,
          waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They
          exchange anxious looks.
<b>          
</b>          ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    One good thing about no soap any
                    more. You can smell the road agents
                    a mile off.
<b>          
</b>          The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits
          EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple
          of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's.
<b>          
</b>          The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he
          passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER
</b>                    Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?
<b>          
</b>          He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap.
<b>          
</b>          Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding
          in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.
<b>

</b><b>                              ELI

<b>          
</b>          The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within
          striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten.
<b>

                    get it off real easy after we've
                    hacked your fucking arms off.
<b>          
</b>          Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft,
          even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    It's real important you boys listen

                    him. See, I'm under his protection.
                    You stand in my way, you stand in
                    his. And he will cut you down with

                    I am his faithful instrument.
<b>          
</b>          BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and
          then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously.

</b>                    All right, I had just about enough
                    of this shit...
<b>          
</b>          He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack.
<b>          
</b>          If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn
          his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and
          drips onto the asphalt.
<b>          
</b>          Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's
          shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The
          SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood.
<b>          
</b>          Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump
          where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER
</b>                    What... you just... he just cut my
                    fucking hand off! My fucking hand!
<b>          
</b>          Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto
          the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to
          the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER
</b>                    What you standin' around for? Kiss
                    him!
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT #3

<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    He's in shock. He means "kill him".
<b>          
</b>          A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI
          ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing.
<b>          
</b>          Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But
          it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    11.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE
          ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.
<b>          
</b>          The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards
          away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.
<b>          
</b><b>                               ELI
</b>                    I told you you wouldn't be getting
                    that back.
<b>          
</b>          Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down
          on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a
          moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER

</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    My name is Eli.
<b>          
</b>          And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword.
<b>          
</b>          He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing.
          She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next.
<b>          
</b>          He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the
          shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches
          incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Take it and go on your way. And
                    don't fall in with men like these
                    again. No good can come.
<b>          
</b>          She looks at him, puzzled.
<b>          
</b><b>                              YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                    Why are you doing this?
<b>          
</b>          Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches
          beside them and begins searching their bodies.
<b>          
</b>          He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo
          lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.
<b>          
</b><b>          LATER
</b><b>          
</b>          The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered
          with dirt. The best burial they are going to get.
<b>          
</b>          Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks
          quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                   12.

                    among us for the forgiveness of
                    sins.
<b>          
</b>          The young woman stands a few yards away, watching him,
          transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI

<b>          
</b>          He turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman.
<b>          
</b><b>                              YOUNG WOMAN

<b>          
</b>          He doesn't even turn back to look at her.

</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    No.
<b>          
</b>          He walks on, into the horizon.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a
          long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up.
<b>          
</b>          He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the
          overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out
          from where the roadway has been severed.
<b>          
</b>          Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the
          wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 13.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS
          PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.
<b>          
</b>          Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he
          FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes
          cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:
<b>          
</b>          TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything
          from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but
          apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.
<b>          
</b>          The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as
          the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's
          rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.
<b>          
</b>          Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time
          much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.
<b>          
</b>          FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on
          the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try
          desperately to steer the barrow off the road.
<b>          
</b>          The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount.
          Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for
          it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.
<b>          
</b>          The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers
          swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.
<b>          
</b>          The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
          from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.
<b>          
</b>          Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for
          his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path. It ain't your concern. Stay
                    on the path.
<b>          
</b>          Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene,
          but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and
          waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And
          then finally, suddenly, is silenced.
<b>          
</b>          Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and
          bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the
          wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt.
<b>          
</b>          They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we
          don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel.
          They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
          direction they came, dust pluming in their wake.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 14.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into
          the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. He signs
          a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
          under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ROAD FORK - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road
          forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops.
<b>          
</b>          The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other
          fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon.
<b>          
</b>          A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No
          words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF
          FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town.
<b>          
</b>          Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his
          pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs.
<b>          
</b>          He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          A primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like
          structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded
          plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world.
<b>          
</b>          HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many
          wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun.
<b>          
</b>          Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he
          braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner,
          entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
          once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely
          intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt
          street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.
<b>          
</b>          It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through
          earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.
<b>          
</b>          It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an
          old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America,
          but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An
          unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 15.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of
          the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town,
          badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.
<b>          
</b>          Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH,
          hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    You got an engineer or a fuelman
                    around here?
<b>          
</b>          The blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions
          toward a storefront at the far end of the street.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Thanks.
<b>          
</b>          Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a
          STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely
          fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of
          a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun.
<b>          
</b>          As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents
          take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping.
<b>          
</b>          Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's
          face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a
          PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped
          together at the waist, each man leading the one behind.
<b>          
</b>          Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND.
          They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry
          picks, shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG.
<b>          
</b>          Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like
          cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a
          stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHAIN GANG BOSS
</b>                    Come on, move it!
<b>          
</b>          The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by. Eli doesn't
          return the look, just continues crossing the street as the
          blind are herded away. Headed toward a wooden building with a
          pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          Whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST-
          APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods.
          Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.
<b>          
</b>          An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings
          of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  16.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque
          STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the
          remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.
<b>          
</b>          Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its
          reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.
<b>          
</b>          Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the
          counter for something.
<b>          
</b>          Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training
          a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          The engineer's hands tremble, his finger tight on the
          trigger. This man needs to be talked down carefully.

<b>          
</b>          Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced
          downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of
          ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock.

<b>          
</b>          The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a
          little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun.

</b>          The engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his pack
          and pulls out the car battery. When he sees it, he gasps.

</b>          This once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn
          out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the
          stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place.
<b>          
</b>          Looking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most
          prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an
          OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE
          MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it.
<b>          
</b>          The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of
          someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but
          has no taste whatsoever.
<b>          
</b>          A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind
          the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK.
<b>          
</b>          The book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title

          few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and
          unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well-
          groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth.
<b>          
</b>          He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches,
          everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he
          looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE.

</b><b>          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          A LARGE CROWD OF TOWNSFOLK - several hundred strong - has
          assembled outside the Palladium theater. AN ARMED CREW OF
          CARNEGIE'S GOONS keeps watch over the crowd.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie stands on a BALCONY above the theater marquee. He
          treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a
          MICROPHONE connected to an old PA SYSTEM that carries his
          words to the far reaches of the crowd.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    I want you all to remember how far
                    we've come together. And how far we
                    still can go, if only we believe.
                    When I brought us here to this
                    oasis - this promised land - we
                    knew there would be hardships. Knew
                    there would be sacrifices. But we
                    also knew that we were creating for
                    ourselves a world where we could be
                    safe from the horrors of the
                    forsaken lands beyond our borders.
<b>          
</b>          The crowd listens intently, hanging on Carnegie's every word.
          He is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker - his
          cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us
          of a TELEVISION EVANGELIST.

</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    And I want you all to remember
                    above all that it is not the water
                    with which we have been blessed
                    that is the true lifeblood of this
                    town... but faith.
<b>          
</b>          This sends a MURMUR OF DISCONTENT through the crowd. Many
          don't like where they suspect this may be going. Carnegie
          senses this and dials up his rhetoric - delivering it now
          with the fire-brand passion of an old-time baptist preacher.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          The crowd is divided. Many return the "Hallelujah" with
          varying levels of conviction. Others are not convinced. But
          Carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    And mark me, the ultimate
                    validation of that faith is coming!
                    The sacred Word of Our Lord that
                    formed the world before and will
                    reform it once again is coming to
                    this town to bring it succor, bring
                    it nourishment, bring it new life!
                    For the Almighty Himself has spoken
                    unto me and promised it!
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's
          almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his
          words. His apparently unshakable belief is infectious.

                    road of the faithful just a little
                    longer. And to do that, we must
                    give just a little more.

<b>          
</b>          This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the
          crowd - this news has not been received well at all. Some
          still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.

</b><b>                              CARNEGIE

                    that road is a greater glory,
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
<b>          
</b>          A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward, pushing through the
          crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie.

</b>          Carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently SILENCE THE

<b>          
</b>          Carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among
          themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard.
<b>          
</b>          As the assembled townsfolk disperse, FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar
          into town and pull up outside the Palladium.

</b>          What was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the
          rest of the theater, been largely gutted. But it's still
          impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase
          leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc.
          FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls.

</b>          He lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.

</b>          He puts his hands on her lustfully. It's clear she's not in
          the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. More out of
          a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion.

          and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.

</b>          The original customers have now been joined by the four
          bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and
          pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar.
<b>          
</b>          Eli enters. All eyes are on him immediately, regarding him
          with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar.
<b>          
</b>          The BARTENDER approaches, looks him up and down. Suspicious.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BARTENDER

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli raises his hand as before. Holds it outstretched, steady.

</b><b>                              BARTENDER
</b>                    What'll it be?
<b>          
</b>          Eli places the canteen on the bar.
<b>

</b><b>                              BARTENDER
</b>                    That's the good stuff. Gotta eat
                    into my own ration to sell it - so
                    I don't sell it cheap.
<b>          
</b>          Eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar. The bartender
          takes it and looks it over. Not particularly impressed.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BARTENDER
</b>                    That'll get you maybe half-way.
<b>          
</b>          The bartender spies Eli's silver Saint Christopher pendant.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BARTENDER
</b>                    What about that?
<b>          
</b>          Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for
          sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur
          pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.

</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    That's the best I got.
<b>          
</b>          The bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat
          leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts
          with suspicion and HISSES at Eli.
<b>          
</b>          Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the
          biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this.
<b>          
</b>          Satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along
          with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.

</b><b>                              BARTENDER

<b>          
</b>          A TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back. No older than 16 or 17.
          Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair
          tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's
          clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman.
<b>          
</b>          The bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara
          along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 30.

<b>          
</b>          Solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up
          and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued.
          There's something about him she can't put her finger on...
<b>          
</b>          He doesn't look back at her. She turns and exits.

          guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH
          RAZOR WIRE. TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets.
<b>          
</b>          One of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the
          front of the line. He punches two holes in her ration card
          and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure.
<b>          
</b>          Inside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging
          from the earth. Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes a
          few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak
          trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen.

          large over him. Hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting
          a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers.
<b>          
</b>          Solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking Eli's
          canteen away into the back room.

</b>          The bartender looks at Hog nervously.

</b><b>                              BARTENDER

</b>          Blink. Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing
          more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in
          his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          The other bikers stand and approach, the OTHER CUSTOMERS
          following suit. Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him.

<b>          
</b>          It's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases
          his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath.
<b>          
</b>          Eli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and
          other patrons have moved to block his exit.

<b>          
</b>          Eli sighs, looks down at the floor. He's been pushed one time
          too many today. For the first time, we see anger in his face.

</b>          He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead.

</b>          Carnegie is on the landing, training his rifle down at Eli.
          Alongside him, FIVE GUNMEN do the same. They've got him cold.

</b>                    This is Redridge. He's kind of my
                    right-hand man around here.
<b>          
</b>          Redridge - one of the two men who chased Eli into the room -
          steps forward. He regards Eli with a distrustful eye.
<b>

</b><b>          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - DUSK
</b><b>          
</b>          Redridge opens the door and ushers Eli inside.
<b>          
</b>          It's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom,
          less well-appointed than Carnegie's own. A threadbare rug.
          Bed with relatively clean sheets. A sink for washing.
<b>          
</b><b>                              REDRIDGE
</b>                    Enjoy your stay. There'll be
                    someone outside your room all
                    night. If you need anything.
<b>          
</b>          Redridge smirks and closes the door, leaving Eli alone. Eli
          paces across the room. Finally sits down on the creaky old
          bed. Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here.
<b>          
</b>          He unshoulders his pack, sets it down. Lies down on the bed.
          It's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back.
<b>          
</b>          A KNOCK at the door. Eli gets quickly to his feet.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Hello?
<b>          
</b>          The door opens and CLAUDIA enters. Carrying a metal tub of
          water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    I have this for you. Water for
                    washing and some food.
<b>          
</b>          Eli just stands there. Totally unfamiliar with this kind of
          situation, it's been too long. She smiles, embarrassed.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    Well... are you going to take it?
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Oh. Thank you.
<b>          
</b>          He takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 41.

<b>          
</b>          We get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with this
          kind of polite interaction as Eli. But she likes it.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    It'll be dark soon.
<b>          
</b>          She strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. The
          room is lit by its flickering glow.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA

<b>          
</b>          As she turns for the door:
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA

</b><b>                              ELI

                    Haven't had one of those in a
                    while. Not a real one, leastways.
<b>          
</b>          Claudia smiles. Neither has she.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    He found me in the outland. I was
                    sixteen, my family had been...
                    well, they were gone. There was
                    just me and my baby.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    You had a baby?

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    I'd met some men on the road. Bad
                    men. They...
<b>          
</b>          BEAT. She trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory.
          Eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    It's all right.

</b><b>                                                                  42.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    I was on the road for a year after
                    that. I couldn't feed myself, let
                    alone my little girl. And then Bill
                    found us and he promised he'd take
                    care of us. He told me he was going
                    to make a place where we could be
                    safe. And he did. He did all that.
                    He built this whole town. He kept
                    us safe. And he raised that child
                    like she was his own. He's been so
                    good to both of us. He saved us,
                    really.
<b>          
</b>          There's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As though
          there is more to the story than she is telling.
<b>          
</b>          Eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    You want to eat some?
<b>          
</b>          She smiles and sits. Eli sits across from her.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    When did you go blind? In the war?
                    You get caught in a flash?
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    No, I was born this way. I think
                    I'm lucky like that.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Lucky?
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    It's not like I ever knew what I'm
                    missing. I was already used to
                    being like this by the time... by
                    the time it all happened. So I got
                    around pretty good even when I was
                    on my own. And now it's easy. I
                    know every creaky old floorboard in
                    here, and it's not like I ever go
                    any place else. Bill would never
                    allow it. He worries about me so
                    much.
<b>          
</b>          Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped.
          Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    I should go. He'll be wondering
                    where I am.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 43.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    Thank you. I enjoyed our

</b><b>                                ELI
</b>                    So did I.
<b>          
</b>          Eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-room
          mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    You took your time in there. How
                    long does it take to deliver a
                    plate of food and some water?
<b>          
</b>          A subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    He wanted to talk.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    Nothing really. He asked me what it
                    was like to be blind.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    He tell you anything about him?

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    No. I don't think he likes to talk
                    about himself much.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    Yeah, I got that.
<b>          
</b>          Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    I don't think he's going to change
                    his mind by morning. I don't think
                    he's going to stay.

</b><b>                              CARNEGIE

                    who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't
                    seem like the type to go changing
                    it once it's set.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA

                    others. You won't be able to smooth-
                    talk him and wrap him around your

<b>          
</b>          Carnegie sighs, tiring of this.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    She's a grown woman now, Claudia.
                    Sooner or later you're going to
                    have to accept that. She has to
                    earn her keep around here, same as

                    Some people's gift is more evident
                    than others. Solara's sure as hell

                    and give her a place where she can
                    live without fear! Without me you'd

          through Claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.

</b><b>          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

</b>          Dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the
          oil lamp. Eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old
          leather-bound book from his backpack.
<b>          
</b>          Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides
          the book inside his shirt.

<b>          
</b>          The door opens to reveal Solara. Looking very different than
          she did before. Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer
          dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. Stunning.
<b>          
</b>          Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at
          least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. Far
          too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.

</b>          She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. Very

</b><b>                              SOLARA

          down the oil lamp. A darker, more seductive lighting scheme.

<b>          
</b>          She sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. Her light
          cotton dress revealing in all the right places. The
          silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the
          oil lamp. No red-blooded man on earth could resist her.

          buttons of his shirt.

</b>          She is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And
          then she seems a little insulted.

</b><b>                              SOLARA

</b>          Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves
          to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye.

          teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl.

</b>          Eli thinks about this. Dredging through old, old memories.

</b>          For the first time we see that it's a KING JAMES BIBLE. An
          embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover.

          finds the passage he's looking for.

</b><b>          
</b>          Carnegie races across the landing, toward the ARMED GUARD
          posted outside Eli's bedroom. The guard steps aside as
          Carnegie flings the door open and barges inside.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>

          WIDE OPEN, the curtains fluttering gently in the breeze.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          His hands shaking, the engineer disconnects Eli's battery
          from the generator and places it on the counter.
<b>          
</b>          Eli stands on the other side of the counter with his SHOTGUN
          TRAINED RIGHT AT THE MAN'S HEAD. He takes the battery from
          him and stuffs it into his backpack.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Redridge emerges onto the street behind him.

          EMERGES ONTO THE STREET, shotgun still in his hand.
<b>          
</b>          EVERYBODY FREEZES. Like a wild west stand-off. Redridge's
          fingers play over the butt of the pistol on his hip.
<b>          
</b>          BEAT as time hangs perfectly still for a second... and then
<b>          ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
</b><b>          
</b>          Redridge draws and FIRES, SHATTERING A PARKING METER just
          inches from Eli and showering quarters all over the sidewalk.
<b>          
</b>          Eli rushes along the sidewalk, RETURNING FIRE. The shot wings
          Redridge in the shoulder. He goes down, wounded.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie dives for cover as FOUR MORE GUNMEN rush from the
          theater. Carnegie waves frantically in Eli's direction.

</b>          They spot Eli sprinting away and rush off in pursuit.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie gets to his feet and storms back inside the theater.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          when they hear the door slam open behind them.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie stands in the doorway, glaring at them.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          LOCAL RESIDENTS scream and rush to and fro in panic as Eli
          darts along the boardwalk.
<b>          
</b>          CARNEGIE'S GUNMEN pursue, firing their rifles wildly on the
          run. The bullets splinter wood, pierce barrels and crates,
          narrowly missing Eli as he dashes, keeping his head down.
<b>          
</b>          Eli aims the shotgun and FIRES without even looking. The shot
          HITS A GUNMAN SQUARE IN THE CHEST, dropping him to the dirt.
<b>          
</b>          Eli hits the deck, diving for cover behind a JUNKPILE as more
          gunfire ricochets all around him. He takes a moment to
          collect himself, reloads the shotgun.
<b>          
</b>          The three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily.
<b>          
</b>          Eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to the
          sky and offers up a silent prayer. Then emerges from around
          the junkpile back into the street. All three gunmen OPEN
          FIRE, their bullets whipping past on either side of him.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 61.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          In one swift motion Eli raises the shotgun and FIRES. Three
          shots in quick succession. And then there is silence. Smoke
          wisps from the shotgun's sawn-off barrel.
<b>          
</b>          The three gunmen LIE DEAD IN THE STREET. One hit square in
          the chest. The other two each have maybe one half of their
          heads remaining.
<b>          
</b>          Eli looks around. He's right at the end of the main road, the
          perimeter where the town meets the open desert. He's free.
<b>          
</b>          And then, A GIRL'S SCREAM. Distant but unmistakable.
<b>          
</b>          Eli whips around. In the upstairs window of the theater,
          Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall. Barking
          angrily at her, shaking her.
<b>          
</b>          Eli looks at the road. Then up at the theater. Then back to
          the road again.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI

                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path.
<b>          
</b>          But he sounds less resolute now than before. Until today this
          was always a simple decision for him to make. But now...

<b>          
</b>          He marches back toward the theater, stepping over the fallen
          bodies of the gunmen, re-loading his shotgun as he goes.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          Redridge finally manages to clamber back up to his feet,
          wincing as he clutches his painful shoulder wound.
<b>          
</b>          He looks up just in time to see Eli coming right at him.
          Without breaking stride, he COLD-COCKS Redridge in the jaw
          with the shotgun, sending him back to the deck, out cold.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

</b>          Eli kicks the door wide open, finds Carnegie holding Solara
          against the wall. She sobs, terrified. Eli levels the shotgun
          at Carnegie's head.
<b>

          a PISTOL from his belt that we never even knew he had.

                    word of God to these poor
                    unfortunates here. To shine its
                    light upon them and give them
                    something in this wretched world
                    that they could believe in.
                    Something to live for! It's why I
                    built this town, did you know that?
                    All we've been missing is the word
                    to show us the way. And now, praise
                    the Lord, you've brought it to us.

                    shot off a hundred rounds at him
                    and he didn't get hit once. I never

                    into a nation. It will help me
                    build a new world. In my image.

                    to hear what's inside of it.
                    They'll follow me anywhere just to

</b><b>          
</b>          Solara wanders the road. She's tired. The sun beats down
          mercilessly. Nothing but desolation and wasteland all around.
<b>          
</b>          She comes to a FORK IN THE ROAD. Stops at the junction,
          unsure. Was this here before? She doesn't remember.

</b>          She alternates her finger between the two paths. Eeny-meeny-

</b><b>          
</b>          Solara comes upon an abandoned CHEVRON STATION. She doesn't
          remember passing this. Looks back up and down the road.
<b>          
</b><b>                              SOLARA
</b>                    Where the hell am I?
<b>          
</b>          There's a RUSTED CAR parked at one of the pumps. Like every
          other car we've seen, stripped of its tires and engine.
<b>          
</b>          She walks around to the driver's side. A PETRIFIED FEMALE
          BODY lies on the ground, half-in, half-out of the car.
<b>          
</b>          Solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils, horrified.
<b>          
</b>          In the dead woman's hand is a dusty bottle of MINERAL WATER.
          Solara hesitates. Not wanting to get closer. But so thirsty.
<b>          
</b>          She braces herself, grimacing, and tries to take the bottle,
          but the dead woman's hand is closed tight around it. She
          pulls harder and wrenches it free. In the process she falls
          on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  71.

</b><b>          
</b>          In the other woman's arm, she has a SKELETAL BABY cradled to
          her bosom. It seems to be staring right at Solara.
<b>          
</b>          Solara SCREAMS and frantically shuffles backward away from
          it. Gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt.
<b>          
</b>          She stops by the station shop and rests against the wall,
          hyperventilating, heart pounding. Trying to get it together.
<b>          
</b>          She inspects the water in the bottle. It looks clean.
          Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip.
<b>          
</b>          She SPITS IT BACK OUT, coughing. It's rank. Undrinkable.

</b><b>          INT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - FOOD COURT - DAY

</b>          Solara enters. Gloomy inside. Comprehensively looted. Empty
          shelves coated in thick sheets of dust.
<b>          
</b>          She moves further in, searching for something, anything. But
          the place has been gutted. There's nothing. She checks the
          wall of dead refrigerators. Shattered glass, all empty.
<b>          
</b>          She's never known desolation and emptiness like this. It's
          beginning to scare her. She wheels around in a panic.

<b>          
</b>          A FEMALE FIGURE is hunched by the side of the road about
          fifty yards up ahead. Hard to see what she's doing from here.

<b>          
</b>          The woman has her back to Solara. She's on her knees,
          muttering to herself. Gathering objects up from the road.
<b>          
</b>          As Solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling
          with an UPTURNED SHOPPING CART. Stuck in a roadside ditch,
          its contents spilled out next to a few BRACKEN BUSHES.
<b>

</b>          The woman looks around, sees Solara standing nearby. She's
          shocked to see that it's a girl.

<b>          
</b>          The woman seems anxious to get rid of her. Tries to indicate
          the threat silently with her eyes, but Solara doesn't get it.

          the   road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way.

<b>          
</b>          Solara is reviled by the man. He's filthy, his stench
          overpowering. One eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. He
          licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.

</b>          He unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles.
<b>          
</b>          We hear a sound. It's hard to place. Something like a THHUP.
<b>          
</b>          The brigand leader is frozen in shock. His face goes pale,
          the blood draining from it. The two bandits holding Solara
          look at their leader in dismay. Staring down at his crotch.
<b>          
</b>          A quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down.
<b>          
</b>          There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down
          there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood
          streams down his thighs. A real horror show.
<b>          
</b>          He staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down
          at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends.
<b>          
</b>          The two other brigands release Solara and whip around,
          scanning the horizon. They see nothing. One of them has a
          RIFLE. He unslings it and aims it frantically around.
<b>          
</b>          Then they both see it. Coming right at them. The most
          terrifying thing either has ever seen.
<b>          
</b>          ELI, WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD, OUT OF THE SUN. His
          silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. An avenging angel.
<b>          
</b>          He pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit
          trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger.
<b>          
</b>          Eli SHOOTS. The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO
          THE RIFLE BARREL. The feathers at the end of the shaft
          plugging the muzzle tight.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  74.

          HANDS CLEAN OFF. He falls to the ground, screaming.
<b>          
</b>          Eli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws his
          sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. The
          two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch.
<b>          
</b>          BEAT. The knife brigand hesitates, trembling. And then RUSHES
          ELI WITH THE KNIFE. Eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the
          sword. So quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all.
<b>          
</b>          The knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. His
          hand goes limp and drops the knife.

</b>          And then his HEAD FALLS BACKWARD like a Pez dispenser. Almost
          completely decapitated, but not quite. Blood fountains from
          the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt.
<b>          
</b>          Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded
          on the ground, but still breathing. He stands over their
          fallen bodies. They stare back up at him, helpless.
<b>          
</b>          He crouches down between them in the dust.

</b>          The brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.

<b>          
</b>          He plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him
          off. Pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean.
<b>          
</b>          He turns to the other man, raising his sword.

<b>

          quietly. The life ebbing from him with each moment.

</b>          A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS fires up. Full beam right at us.
<b>          
</b>          A VEHICLE roars out of the darkness onto the street. Heavily
          modified with plate armor and turret-mounted weapons. But its
          original form still recognizable underneath.
<b>          
</b>          It's a HONDA ODYSSEY minivan. Once the #1 choice of soccer

</b>          Another minivan roars from the garage behind it. A DODGE
          GRAND CARAVAN, similarly customized and armed to the teeth.
<b>          
</b>          THREE MORE CARS follow. As eclectic an assortment as you

</b><b>          EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Late afternoon. The sun hangs low on the horizon. We're far
          from the road. Nothing but scrub brush and a few PRAIRIE DOG
          BURROWS dotted around.
<b>          
</b>          A PRAIRIE DOG pops its head up, scans the horizon. Sniffing
          the air, whiskers twitching... and is SKEWERED BY AN ARROW.
<b>          
</b>          Thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears
          to COME ALIVE. And then we realize it is Eli's GHILLIE SUIT,
          camouflaging both he and Solara beneath it.
<b>          
</b>          Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead
          prairie dog. Solara just stands there, appalled.

<b>          
</b>          When she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding the

          flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit.
<b>          
</b>          Eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out
          clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes down

<b>          
</b>          Eli carves off a piece of meat. Juicy and succulent. He bites
          into it, teasing Solara by making a show of how good it
          tastes. He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder.
<b>          
</b>          Solara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved.

          She reaches out and tears off a piece. Sniffs at it, takes a
          small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. Eli smiles.
<b>          
</b>          As she eats, she gestures toward Eli's Saint Christopher.

</b><b>                              ELI

<b>          
</b>          Eli smiles and shakes his head.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Christopher was a man who lived a
                    long time ago. He wanted to be a
                    good man, he wanted to help people.
                    So he would stand by a river that
                    had no bridge and carry people
                    across. He was a big strong man and
                    there was no one he couldn't carry.
<b>          
</b>          Solara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Then one day a young child came to
                    the river and asked to be carried
                    across. Christopher tried to carry
                    him but he was too heavy. He was
                    just a small boy but he was heavier
                    than any man he had ever carried.
                    The boy explained that he was the
                    son of God, and that he was so
                    heavy because he bore all the sins
                    of the world. After that,
                    Christopher was able to carry him
                    across and when they got to the
                    other side the boy baptized him in
                    the river. And that's how he became
                    a saint. Later on, he was known as
                    the patron saint of travelers.

                    special interest in them.

</b><b>          
</b>          The fire down to its last embers. Eli sleeps next to his
          pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His hat
          and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword.
<b>          
</b>          Solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep after
          all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and so
          impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.

<b>          
</b>          No response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his
          side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty.
<b>          
</b>          She goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing,
          stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel,
          hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop.
<b>          
</b>          It's a RECTANGULAR PLASTIC BADGE. The red, white and blue
          colors faded and worn. It reads:

<b>          
</b>          Whatever she's looking for is not here. She turns her
          attention to the backpack. Slowly, carefully, opens it up.

          shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a little
          scary to Solara.

<b>          
</b>          He's very forceful. She nods, a little afraid of him.

<b>          
</b>          Eli releases her wrist. Takes the pack from her and closes it
          up. Pulls it closer to him and lies back down.

          She just lies there, watching him.

</b><b>          
</b>          The sun rises out of the east. And out of the sun comes the
          FLEET OF ARMORED VEHICLES. Racing side-by-side down the road.
<b>          
</b>          The lead vehicle comes to a halt. A door opens and Redridge
          gets out. MORE ARMED MEN emerge from the other vehicles and
          follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside.
<b>          
</b>          The DEAD BRIGANDS are splayed out in the dirt where Eli slew

</b><b>          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          On the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. Almost
          every building burned or reduced to rubble.
<b>          
</b>          Except for one SMALL HOUSE. The building is damaged and worn
          but in mostly decent condition. It stands out among its
          surroundings for being the only structure still intact.
<b>          
</b>          The windows are BARRED. The outer structure fortified with
          SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups. The whole plot
          surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE.
<b>          
</b>          Eli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby.

</b>          They approach the house cautiously. Arrive at the perimeter
          fence. There's a gate held in place by a PADLOCK.
<b>          
</b>          Eli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the
          padlock free. Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK.
<b>          
</b>          They move inside, up the garden path. Though the soil in the
          yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. WEEDS
          arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers.
<b>

</b>          Eli steps forward, his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING
          STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet.
          Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND. He looks down.

<b>          
</b>          A ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at
          their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR. Eli
          drops his shotgun to the ground.
<b>          
</b>          They hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze.
<b>          
</b>          The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal...
<b>          
</b>          AN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat
          bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses. They
          look like the couple from Grant Wood's "American Gothic."
<b>          
</b>          Instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN
          which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          They step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully.
          The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli's
          shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.

</b>          The woman glares at him. The husband reluctantly accedes and
          moves to the concealed trap apparatus. Releases the rope,
          dropping Eli and Solara to the ground in a heap.
<b>          
</b>          The old woman helps them to their feet. They shake off the
          noose from their ankles.

<b>          
</b>          Eli and Solara exchange a look. What the hell is this?

</b><b>          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          It's like something out of the world before. The interior is
          almost perfectly preserved. Chintzy couches. A mahogany
          table. A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal.
<b>          
</b>          Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and
          looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment.
<b>          
</b>          George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them
          inhospitably. The shotgun resting across his lap.
<b>          
</b>          Martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a
          tea pot and old china cups. Cracked and faded, but intact.
          She places the tray on the coffee table and sits.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MARTHA

                    or biscuits for the tea. They ran
                    out some time ago.
<b>          
</b>          She lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. But it's not
          tea, only water. Somewhat murky water. Eli and Solara stare
          at the cups, unsure. Martha gestures toward them.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MARTHA

<b>          
</b>          They raise their cups and take a sip. Martha watches eagerly.
          It's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as
          civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests.

          gunmen exchange worried looks.

<b>          
</b>          Redridge raises his hand to silence him. Looks up as an
          UPSTAIRS WINDOW slides open.
<b>          
</b>          A CLOTH PACKAGE is tossed from the window. It lands in the
          dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from Redridge.
<b>          
</b>          Cautiously, he approaches. The package is wrapped in cloth
          and tied up with twine. It looks like Eli's bible.
<b>          
</b>          He picks it up and tugs at the twine, untying it. Folds away
          the cloth wrapping. Looks for a moment in puzzlement at the
          object, at the words written on the front of it.

<b>          
</b>          He dives across the trunk of the Explorer into cover as THE

          lightweight Mini Cooper takes the main brunt and EXPLODES,
          cartwheeling through the air, a burning wreck.
<b>          
</b>          Redridge looks around. Three men lie dead already. Flaming
          wreckage all around him. Suddenly, it's a war zone.
<b>          
</b>          MACHINE-GUN FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE HOUSE, peppering the

          example, the others follow. A HAIL OF BULLETS CRISS-CROSS
          BACK AND FORTH. The house's faded paint facade is shredded.

<b>          
</b>          Redridge races between the vehicles, ducking from gunfire
          until he makes it to the back of the Dodge Caravan. Pops the

<b>          
</b>          He sets it on his shoulder, rests on the trunk to steady his
          aim. And FIRES. The rocket screams toward its target, tearing
          through the chain fence and TEARING AN ENTIRE CORNER FROM THE
          HOUSE in a fiery explosion.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

</b>          Filled with smoke. The sounds of COUGHING.
<b>          
</b>          Dazed, George pushes his way through the smoke, waving his

</b><b>          
</b>          Then the anger returns. He gets up and turns, consumed now by
          a wild fury. Firing with rage over the torn brick wall. He
          CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD, killing him.
<b>

</b>          Redridge jumps into the driver's seat of the minivan, turns
          the key in the ignition. Jams the accelerator down with the

          a stop.
<b>          
</b>          More dust and debris, more coughing. Eli tries to get up, but
          winces in pain. Puts his hand to his side, it comes back WET
          WITH BLOOD. A bad wound. He covers it with his coat, stands
          and moves through the smoke.

</b>          Eli still has a half-dozen guns trained on him. He turns and

</b>          A tear runs down Solara's cheek as she watches him walk away.
<b>          
</b>          Redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the

<b>          
</b>          She watches as Eli moves away down the road, getting smaller
          and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon.

</b>          And then she LUNGES VIOLENTLY FORWARD. Clawing and biting at
          the driver, who struggles to fight her off. His hands come
          off the wheel and the car FISHTAILS WILDLY.

</b>          Solara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking
          wreckage of the besieged house. She runs from the vehicle to
          where ELI'S SWORD lies in the dirt and grabs it up.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

</b>          Eventually, she sees him. At first just a dot on the horizon.
          But unmistakably Eli. By now, she'd know him anywhere.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly the engine SPLUTTERS. She checks the fuel gauge; the
          needle deep in the red. She pounds the wheel in frustration.
<b>          
</b><b>                                SOLARA
</b>                    No... No!

</b>          The car grinds to a halt, dead. She flings open the door and
          leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after Eli on foot.
<b>          
</b>          ON ELI. As always, his pace steady and slow. The sun directly
          ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. Headed always west.
<b>          
</b>          Solara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back.

</b>          He doesn't stop or look back. Just keeps on walking.

<b>          
</b>          She continues walking alongside him. Trying to process this.
          This kind of compassion is totally foreign to her.
<b>          
</b>          She holds out the sword, offering it to Eli by way of
          atonement.

</b>          Eli seems appreciative that she would think to return it to

          retail neighborhoods. Gutted and dead, like every place else.
<b>          
</b>          But something is different here. Things are greener. Tufts of
          grass here and there. They attract Solara's attention.

          best to hide his pain from Solara. She notices anyway.

          follow it uphill, finally reaching its crest, where they stop
          and take in the view before them.
<b>          
</b>          THE PACIFIC OCEAN. Straddled by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - the
          once-great structure has partially collapsed from decades of
          neglect and disrepair. The span sags and hangs low over the
          ocean, the asphalt cracked and ruptured.
<b>          
</b>          On the other side of the bay, SAN FRANCISCO - or the little
          that remains of it. The city has been almost TOTALLY
          DESTROYED - entire areas reduced to rubble, the few buildings
          still standing looking on the verge of collapse.
<b>

          keeps on moving, still clutching his side.

          Ground Zero, but a hundred times the scale. Horrifying.
<b>          
</b>          They pass by the wreckage of a HOTEL, nothing but the lobby
          still standing. A HILTON sign protruding from the rubble.
<b>          
</b>          Eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick, poking around
          ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot. He steps carefully.

          blasted skyscrapers - she's never seen anything like it.
<b>          
</b>          The buildings loom over her like giant tombstones. It scares
          her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world.

                    of the deep. And the spirit of God
                    was hovering over the face of the
                    waters. Verse three. And God said,
                    "Let there be light," and there was
                    light.

</b><b>          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
</b><b>          
</b>          Carnegie sits at his desk, still in shock. Eli's bible sits
          open on the desk before him.
<b>          
</b><b>          A BRAILLE BIBLE.

</b>          Claudia is ushered in by a guard.

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    What's wrong?
<b>          
</b>          He rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    You told me once that you know how
                    to read this. This blind language.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    Well, a long time ago, when I was a
                    little girl...
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    You're going to read it for me.
                    Every word. And I'm going to write
                    it down. Start at the beginning.
<b>          
</b>          As Carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen, Claudia
          opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised
          lettering.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                111.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          For a moment there is a glimmer of recognition... a faint
          smile... but then it fades as Carnegie turns back to her,
          eagerly clutching the writing materials.
<b>          
</b><b>                               CLAUDIA
</b>                    I'm sorry. It's been so long. I
                    don't remember. I don't remember
                    any of it.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie is aghast. BEAT as the anger swells within him,
          threatening to explode...
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    God fucking dammit!
<b>          
</b>          He swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of
          Claudia's hands. He grabs it up and tries to rip it in two,
          but it's too thick to tear. Red-faced with rage, he tosses it
          out over the box balcony. It lands somewhere in the dark
          auditorium below, between the rows of gutted theater seats.
<b>          
</b>          As he paces angrily back past Claudia:
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA

</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    Just go. Just get out of my sight.
<b>          
</b>          He slumps in his chair, exhausted and furious. Claudia sadly
          turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Some considerable time later. Great stacks of paper have been
          filled with Lombardi's handwriting.
<b>          
</b>          Lombardi's pen races across the paper, struggling to keep up
          with Eli's recitation.
<b>          
</b>          Solara is curled up on a nearby bench, asleep. Eli's coat
          covering her to keep her warm.
<b>          
</b>          Eli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite.
          He looks paler now than ever. Close to death.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI (V.O.)

</b><b>          
</b>          The prison yard shrouded in the dim light just before dawn.
<b>          
</b>          Solara crosses the yard. She looks more mature somehow.
          Determined and strong. She carries with her ELI'S SWORD - and
          something else, tucked under her arm.

</b>          She stops in a nondescript corner of the yard.
<b>          
</b>          At her feet is a SHALLOW MOUND OF DIRT. At the head of the
          mound, a SIMPLE TOMBSTONE.

</b>          She kneels and places a SINGLE FLOWER on the grave.

</b>          Lit only by the pale moonlight, barely enough to see by.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie sleeps soundly in bed. Next to him lies Claudia,
          wide awake. She checks that Carnegie is sound asleep, careful
          not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits.

</b>          Claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness, searching

<b>          
</b>          She finds Eli's bible in some litter strewn on the floor.

</b>          Sitting in the darkness, Claudia opens the book and runs her
          fingers across the braille, reading. And though we can barely
          see in the dim light, we see the smile on her face. The joy.

<b>          
</b>          It's a NEW BIBLE. Crudely typeset from Lombardi's original
          transcription and printed on the prison press.
<b>          
</b>          She opens it up and begins to read a passage from the bible
          over Eli's grave. We don't hear what she says.
<b>          
</b>          As Solara finishes her reading and closes the bible, LOMBARDI
          appears behind her.

</b>          The great iron gates grind open. Solara emerges from inside
          the prison, steps out onto the island rock.
<b>          
</b>          She is dressed in a flak jacket, combat pants and boots.
          Eli's old pack across her back. Hair tied in a neat pony
