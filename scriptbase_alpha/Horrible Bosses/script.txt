        FADE IN:
                         
          1 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 1
                         
           Looking incredibly weary, NICK WATERS, 30's, enters his
           apartment in his business suit. He stumbles into --
                         
                         
          2 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 2
                         
           He drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens
           his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man. PAN
           OVER TO the alarm clock which reads "1:23 AM."
                         
           MATCH CUT TO:
                         
                         
          3 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 3
                         
           The alarm clock now reads "4:59 AM." It switches to
           "5:00" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off. Nick sits up in
           bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself
           out of bed. He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the
           saddest, deadest houseplant in history.
                         
                         
          4 INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 4
                         
           Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy
           leftover containers and crusty condiments. The orange
           juice container he grabs is empty.
                         
                          NICK
           Damn.
                         
           He opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple
           boxes of "Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon!" He
           pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed
           photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD
           WOMAN on the cheek. The frame reads: "I Y Grandma!"
           Nick sighs sadly.
                         
                         
          5 INT. NICK'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER 5
                         
           Nick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a
           fork. He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes
           his mouth with it.
                         
                         
          6 INT. NICK'S SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER 6
                         
           Nick showers while simultaneously brushing his teeth and
           shaving. He loses track and brushes his face with the
           toothbrush.
           2.
                         
                         
          7 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 7
                         
           Nick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers
           and closet. Clearly, no laundry has been done in a
           while.
                         
                         
          8 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 8
                         
           Nick hurriedly buttons his shirt, tucks it in and begins
           tying his tie as the elevator reaches the lobby.
                         
                         
          9 INT. NICK'S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER 9
                         
           As he drives to work, he dials a number and transfers it
           to speakerphone.
                         
           JENNA (V.O.)
                          (GROGGY)
           Hello?
                         
                          NICK
                          (CHEERY)
           Hey, Jenna, it's Nick.
                         
           JENNA (V.O.)
           It's five-thirty in the morning,
           Nick.
                         
                          NICK
           Yeah, sorry. This is like the
           only time I have to make any
           personal calls. I just wanted to
           see if you felt like going out
           again because I had a great time
           with you on our last date.
                         
           JENNA (V.O.)
           Our last date was two weeks ago.
           You haven't called me since.
                         
                          NICK
           I know and that's my bad. I've
           been swamped at work --
                         
           JENNA (V.O.)
           Yeah, I remember. Work was all
           you talked about when we went out.
                         
                          NICK
           Right. Well, I'm up for a
           promotion which will give me a lot
           more free time --

           JENNA (V.O.)
           Listen, I'm actually seeing
           someone. And even if I weren't,
           the last thing I need is some
           career-obsessed guy complaining
           about work all the time. See you
           around, Nick.
                         
           She hangs up.
                         
                         
          10 EXT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES - SHORT TIME LATER 10
                         
           A soulless four-story building in a drab office park.
           Nick exits his car and runs full-speed to the entrance.
                         
                         
          11 INT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 11
                         
           Nick bursts through the doors and looks at his watch. It
           reads "6:02." He looks up at a security camera with a
           flashing red light, indicating he is on tape.
                         
                          NICK
           Fuck!

          12 INT. NICK'S CUBICLE - LATER 12
                         
           Nick sits at his desk inputting information from a large
           PILE of documents into a spreadsheet on his computer.
           The clock on his computer turns to "8:00 AM."
                         
           HARKEN (O.S.)
           Nick.
                         
           Nick jumps, startled. He turns to see his boss, DAVE
           HARKEN, 40's, standing behind him.
                         
                          NICK
           Yes?

           of the lobby security camera footage on a television.
           The time code at the bottom of the screen reads "6:02."
           We see Nick looking up at the camera and silently
           mouthing the word "Fuck!" The image freezes and we PULL
           BACK to see Harken holding the remote. Nick stands
           across from him.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Here's my concern, Nick. You're a
           punctual guy. You understand the
           importance of getting to work on
           time. So that leaves me to wonder
           if there isn't something wrong
           with the internal clock in our
           security system. What do you
           think?
                         
                          NICK
           I don't know, Mr. Harken. I might
           have been a minute late.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Two minutes according to this. So
           either you're a liar -- which I
           know you're not -- or our system
           is off by a full minute. And if
           that's the case, I have no choice
           but to dismiss Thomas, our
           longtime security coordinator.
                         
                          NICK
           Okay, I might have been two
           minutes late.
                         
           There's an uncomfortable beat. Then --
                         
                          HARKEN
           So you did lie.
                         
                          NICK
           No, I --
                         
           Harken picks up the phone.

           Thomas. I'm letting him go.

           (hangs up phone)
           Trust is everything in this
           office, my friend. I know you've
           been working your tail off for
           that promotion, but if I can't
           trust you, how can I make you
           Senior VP of Sales?
                         
                          NICK

           A car pulls up outside the modest building.

           STACY, cute, 30's, is dropping off DALE STEVENS, 30's,
           who wears the scrubs of a dental hygienist.
                         
                          STACY
           Boy, I have to get used to driving
           with this heavy ring on. I keep
           swerving to the left.
                         
                          DALE
           Aww. You really like it?

           They kiss. Dale exits the car.

           Stacy drives off. Dale steels himself for what lies
           ahead, then goes inside.
                         
                         
          21 INT. DENTAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 21
                         
           Dale enters the waiting room, passing a few PATIENTS. He
           grabs a mask and goggles from a supply room, then heads
                          INTO --

           Dale finds his boss, DR. JULIA HARRIS, 30's, sexy but
           with something a little off, hovering over a patient, MR.
           ANDERTON, 50's. Dale seems visibly uneasy.
                         
                          JULIA
           All right, Mr. Anderton, I'm going
           to give you the nitrous now and
           your root canal will be over
           before you know it.
                          (TO DALE)
           Dale? Please.
                         
           Dale turns the valve on the tank and soon Mr. Anderton's
           eyes roll back in his head. Julia shuts the door, picks
           up a drill and begins boring into the patient's molar.
                         
                          JULIA

           How are you today, Dale?

           Dale sighs and looks down at the unconscious Mr.
           Anderton. This obviously isn't the first time Julia has
           spoken this way.

           She lifts the patient's limp hand and cups it over her
           breast.

           Come on. You're way too good-
           looking to be a UPS girl. What
           are you, a model? An actress?
           What's gonna happen when I open
           this box? Is something going to
           jump out at me?

                          KURT
           Because I want to be able to tell
           my friends that I took out the
           hottest UPS girl in America. Come
           on, what do you say?
                         
           She considers this briefly, then scribbles her number on
           a Post-it note.

           She heads off. Kurt opens his DATEBOOK and scribbles
           "UPS Girl" in the Tuesday slot. We see every night of
           the week is filled with appointments with other women:
           "Barnes & Noble girl," "Lauren? Laura?," "Blonde Chick"
           and so on.

           That sounds a lot more innocent

           Walk with me, Kurt.
                         
           The two of them head toward the exit.

           I wanted to talk to you about --
                         
                          KURT
           Last quarter's profits? I ran the
           numbers. We're down by 11 percent
           year-to-year.
                         
                          JACK
           It's this damn recession. What
           about cost-cutting measures?
                         
                          KURT

           No way. These people have worked
           their asses off for me. There's
           no reason they should suffer.
                         
           Kurt looks at his boss with admiration. There's a lot of
           love between these two.
                         
                          KURT
           There's also the issue of our
           hazardous waste disposal. We're
           paying a lot right now and the
           Bolivians have come back with a
           very good offer.
                         
                          JACK
           You know why it's good? Because
           they'll dump our chemicals in
           rivers, pollute water supplies and
           hurt people. I've spent my life
           building this company.

           As they pass the unisex rest room, they see MARGIE, 30s
           and clearly pregnant, looking uncomfortable as she waits
           to get in.

           After a long beat, the door opens and out steps BOBBY
           PELLIT, late-20s, weasely-looking, sniffing a bit too
           much and rubbing his nose repeatedly. There's something
           unnaturally energetic about him.

           It's all yours, Margie.
                         
           Margie quickly slips into the rest room and shuts the

           The only thing I'd take a lesson

           you do it yourself. So, I'm going

           between my office and what
           would've been the Senior VP's to
           create a single, enormous office.
           However, as a cost-cutting
           measure, I will only be taking 85%
           of the additional salary I'm

           was Jack's office.
                         
                          KURT

           You're three hours late. What's
           the deal?
                         
                          KURT
           I was at your father's funeral.
                         
                          PELLIT
           Maybe that excuse would've flown
           when my dad was here, but I'm in
           charge now.
                         
                          KURT
           That excuse wouldn't have made any
           sense when your dad was here.

           Kurt enters. He notices that the "Jack Pellit" nameplate
           has been partially taped over with the name "Bobby"
           scribbled in magic marker.

           Sit.
                         
           Kurt sits. Bobby quickly slips a small mirror and rolled
           up dollar bill into a drawer. Kurt sees Bobby has tossed
           most of Jack's mementos, achievement awards and photos
           with luminaries in the trash.
                         
                          PELLIT
           I've been looking over the books.
           You're the accountant. Tell me
           why this company is in the
           crapper.
                         
                          KURT
           It's not in the crapper. It's a
           recession. But we're still
           profitable.
                         
                          PELLIT
           Bullshit. Look, I know you and my
           dad were pals. Frankly, I always
           thought it was weird and gay and I
           never understood why my dad
           thought you were so great. But it
           doesn't matter now because he's in
           the ground and I'm your boss. And
           there's gonna be some changes
           around here. First of all...
           (pointing to a
                          BALANCE SHEET)
           What is this `EnviroTech Waste
           Management' shit that we're paying
           so much for?
                         
                          KURT
           Your father made the decision to
           pay a little more to dispose of
           our chemical waste responsibly.
                         
                          PELLIT
           Yeah, fuck that. We've got an
           offer from Bolivia to dump the
           stuff for a third the cost.
                         
                          KURT
           But that would endanger thousands

           Look, Bobby, your dad told me very
           clearly he'd die before he'd save
           money by hurting people.

           Kurt's eyes narrow. He reaches into the trash can and
           grabs one of Jack's discarded ACHIEVEMENT TROPHIES and
           PLUNGES its pointy end deep into Pellit's chest, impaling
           him in his chair.

           I want you to fire the fat people.
           They're slow and lazy and they

                          PELLIT
           No shit. You think when I was a
           kid I dreamed of running a fucking
           chemical company? No. I dreamed
           of retiring. Of being fed
           tropical fruit on a beach by a
           model while she blows me. And as
           soon as I squeeze all the profit
           out of this place, that's exactly
           what I'm gonna do. So here's the
           deal. You either fire the fatty

           last, he gathers his resolve and crosses to Hank's desk.
           From a RESPECTFUL DISTANCE we watch as Kurt breaks the
           news to Hank who reacts with sad resignation.
                         
           Kurt turns to see Pellit standing directly beside him.

           learned that Kurt has fired our
           dear friend Hank here. I want you
           to know that I am as surprised and

           If it's bullshit, Dale, then how
           come we all want to do it so much?
                         
           They reach the corner where they part ways.
                         
                          DALE
           I don't want to do it. And when
           you sober up neither will you.
           We're not killing anyone.
                         
           Dale heads off.

           free dental work. And you know

           Dale, there's nothing you could do
           that would be taking advantage of
           me. Nothing.

           Stacy groans softly. Dale pushes Julia away.

           I knew you only brought her in

           Kurt and Dale wait in the car outside of Nick's office.
                         
                          KURT
           We're outside. You ready for a
           little recon?
                         
                          NICK
           Yeah. I just need to get Harken
           to let me leave early.
                         
                          KURT
           What's the difference? He's not
           going to be your boss much longer.
                         
                          NICK
                          (WHISPERING)
           If I get fired before we kill
           Harken, this'll all have been for
           nothing. I'll just be an out-of-
           work murderer.
                          (THEN)
           I'll be down in three minutes.
                         
           He hangs up then peers over his cubicle wall to see
           Harken talking to another EMPLOYEE nearby. Nick takes a
           breath, leans over his garbage pail and sticks a
           Commtronix pen down his throat. At the sound of Nick's
           loud WRETCHING, Harken looks over to see him puking into
           the trash pail.
                         
                          HARKEN
           What in God's name...?!

                          (WEAKLY)
           Sorry, sir. I've been fighting
           this bug all day. I'll just get
           back to work --
                         
           Nick wipes his mouth and turns pathetically back to his
           desk.
                         
                          HARKEN
           No. Go home. I don't want you
           getting everyone else sick.
                         
                          NICK
           Oh, okay. Thank you, Mr. Harken.
                         
           Nick grabs his jacket and moves to go.

           Have it on my desk at six AM.
                         
           Nick barely conceals his contempt as he picks up the
           stack of papers and heads out.

           Kurt's car pulls up slowly and parks. Kurt, Dale and
           Nick slump down in their seats.

           Okay, boys, as soon as Pellit
           makes a move, we tail him. It is
           on now.

           They watch the house with steely determination.

           The guys are bored out of their minds, barely awake.
           Dale nibbles on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a
           plastic bag.
                         
                          KURT
           Ugghhhhh, I can't believe how much

                          DALE
           I don't get it. On TV,
           surveillance always looks so
           great. They've got their cups of
           coffee. Their sunflower seeds.
           They talk about their lives.

           And then, right when they reveal
           something really intimate, the
           perp appears and they spring into
           action.
                         
           A long, silent pause as they watch the house...
                         
                          NICK
           Are we even sure he's home?

           Let's go check it out.
                         
           They get out of the car. Dale pockets his sandwich.

           The three guys creep around Pellit's patio, peeking in
           doors and windows. Finally:
                         
                          NICK
           I don't see him.
                         
           Kurt is about to try a window when Dale stops him.
                         
                          DALE
           What are you doing?
                         
                          KURT
           We're not gonna get intel standing
           on his lawn. We have to go in.
                         
                          DALE
           What about fingerprints? We don't
           have gloves.
                         
                          KURT
           Here, do this.
                         
           Kurt pulls his shirt sleeves down over his hands. Dale
           does the same. Nick, who wears a T-shirt, tucks his
           hands inside the bottom of the shirt. With some
           difficulty, Kurt slides open the window.
                         
                          KURT
           Here we go.
                         
           The three of them manage to wriggle through the window.
           It's not graceful: Dale's foot gets caught on the sill,
           causing him to tumble on top of Nick and Kurt. At last,
           all three are inside.

           Dale, keep an eye out. Let us

           Got it. Wait, I don't know what
           he looks like.
                         
                          NICK
           It doesn't matter. Just tell us

           Got it.
                         
           They take in Pellit's living room. There's a leather
           sofa, a 60-inch plasma and enormous speakers. On the
           wall are framed Ed Hardy posters depicting dragons and
           half-naked girls.
                         
                          KURT
           Wow. This guy's a bigger

                          NICK
           Okay, let's split up. Look for

                          NICK
           I don't know. I guess we'll know
           it when we see it.
                         
           Kurt heads upstairs while Dale and Nick look around the
           living room.

           Nick looks over to see Dale holding in his sleeve-covered
           hands an open wooden box filled with white powder.
                         
                          NICK

           floor, sending a cascade of cocaine all over the rug.
                         
                          NICK

           He kneels and begins trying to scoop up the coke in his
           hands. It's an impossible task.

           Dale is still on his knees, scooping up coke, as Nick

           Struggling with his hands in his T-shirt, Nick vacuums up
           the cocaine from the rug. When he's finished, he pops
           open the vacuum's waste receptacle and dumps the contents
           back in the wooden box.

           increasingly red.
                         
                          DALE
           Get your what?
                         
           With one hand Harken grabs his throat and with the other
           he looks at the plastic bag he's holding.

           Huh? Oh, yeah. It was a peanut
           butter sandwich.
                         
           Harken collapses to his knees. His face is turning blue
           now. Dale quickly steps out of the car.
                         
                          DALE

           Harken yanks up the right leg of his jogging pants
           revealing an EPI-PEN strapped to his ankle. He reaches
           for it, but Dale moves faster.
                         
                          DALE
           What do I do with this? Should I

           Okay, hold on! I got this.
                         
           Dale takes the cap off the epi-pen, raises his arm and
           jams the needle into Harken's chest. Harken lets out a
           grunt.

           Nick ZOOMS away from the curb.

           Nick's car SPEEDS through a red light at an intersection.
           A TRAFFIC CAMERA FLASHES as it snaps Nick's photo and
           license plate.

           With trembling hands, Nick and Dale take deep gulps of
           their drinks. Kurt hurries in, looking disheveled. The
           ensuing conversation is conducted in tense whispers.
                         
                          KURT
           Okay, let's all stay calm and
           figure this out.

           I don't know. I mean, afterwards,
           it was kind of hard to imagine
           killing her.
                         
           Nick and Dale turn to him, quizzically.

           Kurt's car is parked across the street.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           At first I was surveilling her
           just like I was supposed to...

           Kurt watches through her bedroom window as Julia
           undresses sexily.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           Then she started deliberately
           undressing in front of the window.
           With the lights on. She must've
           known I was there.
                         
           As Julia removes her bra, we see Kurt's face pressed
           against his car window, his breath fogging it up.

           Julia enters her bedroom with a tray of food. She wears
           a skimpy kimono-style robe. She sits on her bed and
           unwraps a Popsicle.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           Then she made herself a little
           snack. A Popsicle...
                         
           We see Julia eat the Popsicle as suggestively as humanly
           possible. Then she picks up a banana and peels it.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           ... then a banana....
                         
           Julia eases the whole banana into her mouth. Then she
           picks up a hot dog.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           ... and finally a hot dog. I
           mean, three penis-shaped foods
           cannot be coincidence. And in
           that weird order? That's not a
           proper meal.

           So you took that as an invitation
           to fuck her?
                         
           Julia opens her front door, stares straight at Kurt and
           beckons him inside with one finger. She walks back
           inside, leaving the door wide open.
                         
           KURT (V.O.)
           No. I took her invitation to fuck
           her as an invitation to fuck her.

           Kurt opens his car door so quickly he tumbles out
           headfirst, planting his face on the street. He jumps up,
           but one ankle is tangled in the seatbelt. He finally
           extricates himself and hurries to the house as fast as he
           can.

           Let me ask you something,

           knew who the shooter was and was
           willing to hand you that perp on a
           platter. Would he be entitled to
           some sort of immunity for that
           information?
                         
           Both Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him.

           No. But he would be entitled to
           some sort of jail time. Because
           if he knew who the shooter was and
           didn't tell us, that would be

           We see Mrs. Harken is intrigued. Just then, the front
           door opens and Harken enters. The lights come on.

           Surprise!
                         
           A jittery Harken nearly jumps out of his skin as the
           crowd starts singing "Happy Birthday." Mrs. Harken takes
           Harken's arm.
                         
           MRS. HARKEN

           He heads off to his study, leaving his confused wife.
           She notices Kurt, standing at the buffet, staring at her.
           He smiles and winks. Mrs. Harken gives him a little
           wave.

           What the -- ?!
                         
           As his leg bleeds, Harken wipes the gun off with his
           shirt, then suddenly tosses it to Dale.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Catch.
                         
           Startled, Dale catches the pistol with shaking hands.

           Now I can tell the cops that when
           I discovered you three killed
           Pellit, you tried to kill me to
           shut me up.
                         
                          KURT
           That's crazy!
                         
           Down the street, two squad cars turn the corner and speed
           toward them. Dale looks down at the gun in his hand and
           drops it.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Is it? Because I don't see a
           shred of evidence proving that I
           killed Pellit. It's like I've
           always told you, Nick. Life is a
           marathon and you can't win a
           marathon without putting a few
           Band-Aids on your nipples.
                         
           Nick deflates. The three guys realize Harken's won.
           Then, from the car's open window they hear:
                         
           ON STAR REP (V.O.)
           Did I mention that this
           conversation is being recorded?
                         
           Kurt, Nick and Dale exchange a look of shock and relief.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Who said that?

           My name is Atmanand!
                         
           Harken's face falls. He looks around nervously as the
           police cars come to a halt.
                         
                          HARKEN
           You can't -- this isn't --
                         
           And with that, Harken BOLTS AWAY as fast as his injured
           leg will take him. It's not very fast. The guys watch
           him for a beat as they share a joyful, exhausted moment
           together.

           This is for you, Gam Gam.
                         
           Nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in SLOW
           MOTION, violently TACKLES Harken to the pavement. Harken
           goes down hard, his face SLAMMING against the asphalt.
                         
           As the COPS hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of
           Harken's neck, pinning him.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Get the fuck off me!
                         
           Kurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure.

           Kurt enters and looks over at what was Pellit's office.
           He smiles when he sees Margie, the pregnant employee, now
           running the company. He heads over.

           Kurt, I know you were a favorite
           of Jack's. He was willing to
           overlook your inappropriate
           behavior with female clients and
           service people. But you should be
           aware, I'm not Jack. And I have
           very little tolerance for the
           mistreatment of women. So
           consider this your first strike.

           Kurt opens his mouth to say something but thinks better
           of it. He stands up and slumps out. Life as he knew it
           at Pellit Chemicals is clearly over.

           you're going to pay for. And then
           I'm going to come back to a rape-
           free workplace. Because if you so
           much as look at my ass, I'll have
           yours locked up.
                         
           With a bounce in his step, Dale strides out of the room.
           There's an awkward beat with Kenny and Julia.
                         
                          KENNY
           I don't suppose you could take a
           look at this molar --
                         
                          JULIA
                          (SCREAMING)
           OUT! GET OUT!
                         
           Kenny scampers out, pulling up his pants as he goes.
                         
                         
          139 INT. NICK'S OFFICE (FORMERLY HARKEN'S) - DAY 139
                         
           Nick is in his new office as a young employee, CARTER,
           20's, pops his head in.
                         
                          CARTER
           You wanted to see me, Mr. Waters?
                          (CONTINUED)
           119.
                         139 CONTINUED: 139
                         
                          NICK
           Hi, Carter. Just wanted to check
           if you had a chance to finish
           those regional sales projections
           yet?
                         
                          CARTER
           Oh, I think I may need another
           day.
                         
                          NICK
           Okay. I was hoping to give them
           to the marketing guys today, but I
           can hold them off.
                          (FRIENDLY)
           In the future, it'd be great if
           you could tell me if you're going
           to miss a deadline.
                         
           Carter's eyes narrow. All at once, he rushes at Nick,
           grabs him by the throat and HURLS him THROUGH THE PLATE
           GLASS WINDOW, shattering it.
                         
                         
          140 EXT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES - CONTINUOUS ACTION 140
                         
           Nick plummets forty feet and lands with a SICKENING
           CRUNCH directly onto his own car. Just behind him we see
           a parking plaque that reads "Nick Waters, Senior VP of
           Sales."
                         
           SMASH CUT TO:
                         
                         
          141 SAME SCENE (REALITY) 141
                         
           Carter stands opposite Nick as before.
                         
                          CARTER
           Sure. No problem, Mr. Waters.
                         
                          NICK
           Thanks, buddy.
                         
           Nick smiles and closes the door behind Carter. He
           settles into his comfy chair and puts his feet up on the
           desk.
                         
                          NICK
           It's good to be the boss.
                         
           CUT TO BLACK.
                         
                         
                          THE END
