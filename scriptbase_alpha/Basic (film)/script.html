<b>               FIRST DRAFT
</b><b>             MARCH 27, 2000
</b><b>
</b><b>OVER BLACK:
</b>The sound of HELICOPTER ROTORS slicing through the air.
<b>                      STYLES (O.S.)
</b>          Jesus, God. . .
<b>FADE IN ON:
</b>An ARMY HELICOPTER as it soars over the thick LOUISIANA BAYOU.
Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below has been
ripped to shreds. The kind of damage that can only be done
by nature.
<b>SUPERIMPOSE:, FEBRUARY 2 - 0630 HOURS - 32 KILOMETERS NORTH
</b><b>OF FORT MCKINLEY, LOUISIANA
</b><b>INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE
</b>Sitting next to the PILOT is COLONEL WILLIAM STYLES. Mid-
40's, normally gruff, but completely cowed by the damage
below. The PILOT, unfazed.
<b>                      PILOT
</b>          Hurricane Beth, huh? Had    an ex-wife
          named Beth, this is pretty   much par
          for the course. This area    got the
          worst of it, I hope these   guys are
          all intact-
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          That's enough, Lieutenant.
SOMEONE'S P.O.V. - RUNNING through the underbrush - ducking
branches, pushing through bushes, splashing through streams.
LABORED BREATHING wheezes over the sound track. We're headed
for a CLEARING...
<b>INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE
</b>The Pilot pushes his stick forward, descending to tree level.
<b>                      PILOT
</b>          Coming up on the pick-up.
<b>EXT. CLEARING -- DAWN
</b>TWO MEN emerge from the underbrush at a run. The BIGGER MAN
carrying the wounded SMALLER MAN over his shoulder. Both in
ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy, and bloody.
The Bigger Man lowers the Smaller Man to the ground and
unshoulders his M-16. Face panicked.
The sound of the HELICOPTER approaching...
<b>
</b><b>                                                            2.
</b><b>INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE
</b>
The unmistakable SOUND OF GUNFIRE from below.

<b>                      PILOT
</b>          Holy shit, that's live fire!

As the Helicopter comes over the clearing, Styles and the
Pilot squint down through the windscreen to see the Two Men,
huddled together as BULLET HITS kick up DUST around them!

<b>                      STYLES
</b>          Who's shooting at them-

The Bigger Man raising his own his weapon and RETURNING FIRE.
The Smaller Man frantically waving the Helicopter down...

<b>                         PILOT
</b>          I can't see-

Below, the Bigger Man still shooting and then he lowers his
rifle and there's only SILENCE. No return fire.

And then Styles sees why. A THIRD MAN. Lying by the
treeline. Chest torn open by gunfire. Obviously dead. His
clothes - the same fatigues the first two men are wearing.

<b>                      STYLES
</b>          That was one of their own, he just
          Shot one of their own men-

<b>                      PILOT
</b>          Who was trying to shoot them-

<b>                      STYLES
</b>          Get us on the ground!

<b>EXT. CLEARING -- SUNRISE
</b>
As the Helicopter comes in for a landing, the Bigger Man
kneels next to the Smaller Man, who bleeds from a bullet
wound to the arm.  His face, pale, sweating. The Bigger Man
wipes the Smaller Man's brow and speaks softly and seriously.

<b>                      BIGGER MAN
</b>          Are you ready for this?

The Smaller Man nods.

<b>INT. ROADHOUSE -- MORNING
</b>
A full on shit-kicking dive.     Nearly empty, given the hour.
A TELEVISION plays the morning    news over the bar.  Only two
inhabitants - one a BARTENDER,    the other the lone CUSTOMER,
smoking and picking at a plate    of criminally runny eggs.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           3.
</b><b>                      HARDY
</b>          Tell the truth, Vic. You made these
          with a blender, right?
He grins and we get our first good look at
TOM HARDY - Three day stubble, dark rings around his eyes,
but a with strong jaw and steady voice. Not your average
barfly. Somebody who maybe used to be somebody.
<b>                      BARTENDER
</b>          Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't
          make no damn difference to me.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          You know that was like a quadruple
          negative?
The Bartender takes the plate away from him.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Can I at least have a drink?
<b>                      BARTENDER
</b>          It's ten thirty in the morning.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Yeah, if you've slept.
<b>                      BARTENDER
</b>          You know the law - no liquor before
          noon. Could lose my license.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Don't you mean "don't need no liquor
          license not taken away from me"?
The Bartender smiles.
<b>                      BARTENDER
</b>          Hurricane kept you up, too?
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Yeah, and I could've used the sleep.
          I'm supposed to meet people here
          tonight, try and get some work going.
He stops, his attention suddenly on the TV.    A NEWSCASTER:
<b>                      NEWSCASTER
</b>          ...is expected to announce the grand
          jury indictments in the Guissepe
          Torres police corruption case as
          early as tomorrow afternoon.
          Speculations abound that up to ten
          former homicide detectives could be
          named in the proceedings-
<b>
</b><b>                                                           4.
</b>The Bartender turns the TV off hastily.   Embarrassed:
<b>                      BARTENDER
</b>          Sorry.
Hardy just looks away. The Bartender puts an empty glass
down and fills it to the lip with bourbon.
Hardy nods a "thank you" and reaches for the glass when the
PAGER on his hip goes off. He checks the number.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Bill Styles...
<b>                      BARTENDER
</b>          Who?
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Old friend. Haven't talked to him
          in- 911. Can I use your phone?
The Bartender hands him a cordless and Hardy dials.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Hey, Bill, it's Tom. Long time no.
          . . whoa, whoa, slow down. Yeah...
          yeah, of course I'll come. An hour.
He hangs up and hands the phone back to the Bartender.
<b>                      BARTENDER
</b>          What was that?
Hardy, obviously shaken by the call.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          I gotta go out to McKinley.
<b>EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MORNING
</b>Establishing. A sprawling five square mile compound nestled
in the Louisiana backwoods. Also damaged by the Hurricane.
HELICOPTERS loaded with emergency supplies land and take
off, REPAIR CREWS work feverishly on damaged buildings, all
while CADET PLATOONS complete morning drills around them.
This is still a boot camp after all.
<b>SUPERIMPOSE: 1130 HOURS - FORT MCKINLEY BASIC TRAINING CENTER
</b><b>EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MAIN GATE -- MORNING
</b>Styles stands waiting nervously just beyond the CHECKPOINT
with WARRANT OFFICER JULIA OSBORNE - early 30's, attractive,
close cropped hair and icy eyes. In the middle of protesting.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          5.
</b><b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          This is totally unnecessary-
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          He asked to see a policeman, we're
          getting him a policeman .
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          But this guy you called, he's not
          even Army-
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          He's former Army and the best I've
          ever seen in a room. Besides, he
          knows the territory, we did Basic
          together here.
              (off her look)
          You've had three hours with Dunbar
          and haven't gotten a peep, we need
          to take a different tack.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          He's not Army, it's not official-
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          Then it's unofficial.
He takes a hit from an ASTHMA INHALER, as a '71 PONTIAC GTO
drives through the gate and pulls up. Hardy emerges.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>              (re: his appearance)
          Doesn't get any unofficialer than
          that...
The two old friends embrace.
<b>                         HARDY
</b>          How are you?
<b>                       STYLES
</b>          Been better.
              (pause)
          I read about what's been happening
          With you... I should have called-
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          What kind of trouble are you in?
Styles looks at the ground.      Momentarily flustered.
<b>                         HARDY
</b>          That bad?
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          Would I have called you if it wasn't?
          If there was any other way-
<b>
</b><b>                                                       6.
</b><b>                      HARDY
</b>          Tell me what I can do.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          You can get us some answers.
Hardy takes off his sunglasses, noticing her.
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne,
          The closest thing we have to an in-
          House investigator.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          And here you are going out of house.
          How's that make you feel, Jules?
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Hostile and uncooperative.
<b>                       HARDY
</b>          Fantastic.   You want to tell me what's
          going on?
<b>INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS MORNING
</b>Hardy follows Styles and Osborne. They pass SOLDIERS

          trot out to the press to talk about
          the kinder, gentler military. He

</b>          No, the problem is one's dead, one's

          my parents did it for years.
Dunbar grabs the donut, wolfing it down.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Want another one?
No response.    Osborne looks to her watch - it's been a minute.

Dunbar turns away, no longer interested.   Hardy continues:
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          I used to be, but that's beside the
          point. Who I am doesn't really

          You understand that, right?
No response.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Now, I don't know if you did what
          you did in self defense and frankly
          I don't really care. I'm just doing
          a favor for Colonel Styles because
          he wants to know if anyone else who's
          still out there is in need of
          assistance. To be honest with you,
          though, I don't care about that

          Batting averages, ERA's, I   got
          statistics in my brain, I   don't know
          how I remember them. It's    freaky.

Dunbar, completely confused.

             getting a pipe rammed into your balls

</b>          Some.

As Dunbar begins to talk, we FLASHBACK...

<b>EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO

Row upon row of freshly shaven headed CADETS stand at
attention. Their first day of boot camp.

<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          First day was when I met Pike.    Sarge
          hated him from the beginning.

A man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines.

Two ivory handled pistols on his hips. His lifeless cobalt
blue eyes take in the Cadets. This is SERGEANT WEST.

<b>                      WEST
</b>          You motherfuckers have just made the

          little virgin sister and I will not
          allow anyone or anything that is not
          up to my standards near her pretty
          little virgin cooze, do you understand
          me - give me a sir, yes, sir!

<b>                      THE CADETS
</b>          Sir, yes, sir!
<b>
</b><b>                                                         17.

          You ever hear of a training accident -
          Give me a sir, yes, sir!
<b>                      THE CADETS
</b>          Sir, yes, sir!
<b>                      WEST
</b>          In my time I have killed sixteen men
          for the good of my country, sixteen
          men whose entrance into this Army I
          could not condone, as it would weaken
          the fabric of this nation's defense!
          This base suffers an average of three
          training accidents a year, unfortunate
          incidents that I will not hesitate
          to repeat if you cross me, understand -
          Give me a sir, yes, sir!
<b>                      THE CADETS

<b>                      WEST
</b>          So forget what you've seen on Sixty
          fucking Minutes about the kinder,
          gentler military - you will either
          succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
He walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row.   PIKE.
<b>                      WEST
</b>          My power here is absolute, isn't
          that right, nigger?
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Sir, yes, sir!
West hauls off and SLAPS Pike across the face!
<b>                      WEST
</b>          I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where
          we string greasy coon necks up from

          us you have a problem with that?
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Sir, no, sir!
West grabs Pike by the neck, CHOKING HIM. The others Cadets
GASP. Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so
great. He reaches up automatically to try and save himself...
<b>
</b><b>                                                          18.

</b>          What the fuck is this? You lay a
          hand on me while I'm trying to do my
          duty and rid the world of you?
He KICKS PIKE IN THE BALLS and releases him. Pike goes fetal
on the ground, VOMITING, as West stands over him, screaming.
<b>                      WEST
</b>          Get the fuck up, you're still in
          formation, get the fuck up!
Pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes.
<b>                       WEST
</b>          What the fuck have you done to that
          uniform, take it off, take it off,
          take it off!
Pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough.    West slaps him
again and tears the man's shirt off.
<b>                      WEST
</b>          Get those fucking pants off, I want
          you buck ass naked, you don't deserve
          to wear these beautiful United States
          Army issue clothes!
Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED.
West turns and spies Dunbar in the line.
<b>                      WEST
</b>          Cadet, what's your name!
<b>                      DUNBAR

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Sir, yes, sir!
West draws one of his PISTOLS and gives it to him.

</b>          Dunbar you are to stand here and
          guard this nigger for the next twenty-

          physicals!
The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one
of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike.
One with a gun, the other naked.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          Fifteen guys quit that day.    But not
          Pike.
<b>EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
</b>The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          Time went on and the Sarge started
          singling people out.
One of the Cadets, a small man named ANDERSON, falls from
the log. Screaming, West dives into the pit and pulls
Anderson out, knocking him on the head with a pistol.
<b>EXT. TARMAC -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- AFTERNOON
</b>Anderson stands naked, his arms straining to hold up,TWO
PAINT CANS perpendicular to his body as West berates him.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          He'd zero in on a fella and ride him
          till he quit.
<b>EXT. MAIN GATE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT
</b>Anderson, now in civilian clothes, gets into a TAXI.   Quit.
<b>EXT. FIRING RANGE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
</b>West, screaming at a weasely looking cadet named CHILDS.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          Those who wouldn't quit, he'd put in
          what he called Section Eight.
<b>INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT
</b>A horribly dilapidated quarters. Four cadets, Dunbar, Pike,
Childs, and MUELLER sleep in rickety bunks.

</b>          Washout rejects, guys he said were ,
          "dumbfucks too stupid to know they
          were dead". He separated us from

<b>EXT. PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
</b>The Cadet Corps, mustered. West zeroes in on NUNEZ (the
"dead one"), whose t-shirt has a spot on it.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          Fellas lived in daily fear of being
          Sectioned and with good reason, too.
West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over
towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          They figured we were the boys who'd
          meet with a "training accident" .
Nunez takes a place among them.   Looking absolutely terrified.
<b>INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
</b>Osborne leans forward.
<b>                       OSBORNE

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit.
          Making it through was kind of an
          honor. Some of the other guys on
          the base told us that if you could
          hack Section Eight, Command would
          consider you at the top of the class.
<b>                      HARDY

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          That first night with Pike. I made
          the mistake of letting him sit down
          at around 0300.
<b>                      OSBORNE

          ones West weeded out.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          There were six of us...
<b>EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE.-- ONE WEEK AGO -- EVENING
</b>The six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the
rain. We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them. First
up is MUELLER a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good
          ol' boy type. One of those "his
          Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull
          Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was
          gonna take away his scatter gun" .
          He idolized West.
Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace.
Next to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big
          fella from New Mexico. After he got
          Sectioned he just followed Mueller
          around like a lap dog. He wasn't
          mean like Mueller, though, didn't
          have it in him.
Next to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          But Childs did. Didn't talk to
          anyone, but you got this feeling
          something was wrong with him, like
          real wrong. Type of guy you felt
          uncomfortable going to sleep near.
Behind Childs runs Pike.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          Pike I told you about. He took the
          brunt of it from Mueller and West.
          Once they found it out he was a
          convict they were merciless.
<b>                      (MORE)

</b><b>                                                           22.

</b>          He'd been busted for Auto Theft,
          judge gave him the option of jailor
          the Army. He made the wrong choice.
Next to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side.   Kendall
is short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was
          a smart guy, we got along okay.
          Pike and I tried to help him, but...
Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West
smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          He was sickly. Had that shaking
          thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
<b>                       OSBORNE (V.O.)
</b>          Epilepsy.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          Yeah. Spent half his time in the
          infirmary. Only reason he enlisted
          was his father. West didn't section
          him till last week.
<b>INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

</b>          Yeah.   And that's all I'm saying.
Hardy leans back in his chair.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          You smoke, Ray?
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          This is one of those interrogation
          tricks, isn't it? You don't give me
          a cigarette till I tell you more.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          No, actually, I just left mine in
          the car and was hoping you had some.
Dunbar studies him for a moment and then pulls a pack of
Dorals from his pocket and puts them on the table.
<b>                       HARDY
</b>          My brand.   Must be my lucky day.

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Let me ask you one thing. You seem
          like a good guy, Ray. You carried
          Kendall wounded to the pickup. So
          what I don't get is what you did to
          make Nunez want to kill you?
Dunbar just looks at the ground. A KNOCK at the door.    Hardy
and Osborne turn to see an M.P. stick his head in.

<b>EXT. ARMY JEEP (MOVING) -- MORNING
</b>Hardy and Osborne sit in the back of the open car as it
rumbles across the grounds, headed towards the Base Hospital.
They sit in silence until:
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Why'd you join the army?
Osborne looks at him, annoyed.
<b>                      OSBORNE

Hardy doesn't respond, instead looking out as they pass the

FLASHCUT TO - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. A bunch of young Cadets,
Hardy and Styles among them, doing forced push-ups by the

<b>INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- KENDALL'S ROOM -- DAY
</b>Kendall lies in a bed, a network of tubes in his arm.   He is
awake but pale, still weak. He studies his visitors.

</b>          Coast Guard, special detective detail.
          We feel this incident may have put

Kendall's laugh turns into a cough.   Placing Hardy.

Kendall nods.
<b>                      HARDY

Kendall hesitates, then nods again.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Feel free to elaborate .
Kendall takes a breath and begins, all trace of bravado gone.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          My father is a powerful man. Over
          the years he's used that power to
          protect me, in one form or another,
          from certain... unpleasantries.

          I am a homosexual.
<b>                      HARDY

<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          He is not, shall we say, wild about
          the idea. He has asked me on numerous
          occasions to be more discreet about
          my proclivities, and I have done my
          best to oblige him. However, in the
          last four weeks, I began a
          relationship with another cadet.
          What do you think of that?
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          I think you just blew "Don't Ask,

<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          The Sergeant discovered this
          relationship and wanted me expelled.
          My father interceded, so instead,
          West Sectioned me and made sure every
          other cadet knew that I was gay.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          He couldn't kick you out so he wanted

<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          He wanted more than that.

<b>                      KENDALL (V.O.)
</b>          It was the regular Tuesday night

          hour and then wake us up, drag us
          out to the bayou, and work us all
          night, separate from the others.

behind him. The others, getting ready, all except Kendall.
Dunbar comes over and puts a hand on his shoulder.

          Childs could tell I wasn't right.

<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          Just safety your shit and get behind
          me, okay? I'll take care of this.

Kendall nods and lets Childs walk ahead. Staring at Childs'
back as they move on. On Kendall's face, thinking...

<b>                      KENDALL (V.O.)
</b>          Maybe it was a trick. Maybe this
          was when they'd get me, when I felt
          safest.

CLOSE. ON KENDALL'S FINGER - Clicking off the safety again.
Moving towards the trigger...

</b><b>                         KENDALL (V.O.)
</b>            But if I struck first and took out
            Childs, then maybe I could make it
            out alive...
Kendall raises the rifle.    Sights Childs' back.      A moment
of utter silence and then...
<b>INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

            scared at all. But I was...
                (long pause)
            Enough to almost kill him.
<b>                        HARDY

<b>                          KENDALL

<b>                             OSBORNE

No reply.   Hardy smiles, understanding.
<b>                        HARDY
</b>            Because Childs is the one who shot
            you.
Osborne looks up, surprised.           Kendall nods.
<b>                        KENDALL
</b>            But that came later.
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
</b>As Kendall safeties his rifle and lowers it... The SOUND of
a tremendous EXPLOSION comes from their right! Kendall and
Childs knocked off their feet as the sky momentarily LIGHTS
UP with the blast as a MAN SCREAMS!
<b>                             CHILDS
</b>            Over there!
Childs points to the right, where the dim shine of PHOSPHOROUS
can be seen through the trees. He drags Kendall to his feet
and the two take off running towards it.
Kendall panting and scared, ducking branches and leaping
ditches as the two sprint towards the dying glow.
<b>                             CHILDS

<b>                        CHILDS
</b><b>          GET DOWN!
</b>They hit the deck, face down in mud. It takes them a second
to realize the shots are not directed at them.

</b>          Fuck, what the fuck is going on-

</b>          What do we do?
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
He trails off. The gunfire and screaming have stopped.
Silence now, save for the wind and rain.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Don't want to go-
<b>                        CHILDS
</b>          Fine.
Childs rises and heads towards where the sounds were.
Kendall, lying in the rain and mud, shivering.    Alone.   After
a moment he gets up and follows.
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED,-- LAST NIGHT
</b>The SCORCHED GROUND and TREES smolder under the rainfall.
Kendall finds Childs, standing down by the creek.
Something lies by his feet.
<b>                        KENDALL
</b>          What's-
He stops, seeing.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Oh, Jesus.. .
WEST. Literally spread out on the ground, dead. Eyes open,
face half blackened, he has been ripped in two at the torso.
A horrifying sight. Kendall stumbles back from it.

<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          This isn't our area.   Whose area is
          This-
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          Can anybody hear me!
Childs pivots at the sound of Mueller coming over the ridge.
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          Hey, I-
              (seeing it)

<b>                      CHILDS

Mueller raises his rifle at the weeping Kendall.
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          You killed him you fucking faggot-
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          We found him like this! Kendall was
          with me the whole- Listen to me!
Mueller, finally seeming to understand.    Lowering the gun.
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          Jesus, Jesus fucking Christ...
Muttering to himself, walking in circles.
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          Where's Pike?
No response.
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          Mueller, where's Pike?
Mueller looks up.
<b>                      MUELLER

</b><b>                                                        37.

Mueller comes at him, screaming:

</b>          Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot,
          You just shut the FUCK UP-
<b>                        CHILDS
</b><b>          HEY!
</b>Mueller stops, eyes crazed. Childs looks to the sky, which
is becoming worse by the second.
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          We have to get out of this.    To find
          the cabin.
He helps Kendall to his feet.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          What about Pike?
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          Maybe he'll be there.    Either way,
          we have to go.
Kendall nods, slowly.   The two start up the hill.
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          Shouldn't we- I mean, we shouldn't
          just leave him here.
He points down to West's body.    Childs looks at it.
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          You can carry him if you want.
He and Kendall continue on. Mueller lingers a moment longer
and then turns, following them up the hill.
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
</b>Kendall, Childs, and Mueller make their way through the bush.
The WIND and RAIN have conspired into a FULL BLOWN HURRICANE.
The three men are practically stumbling now, leaning in
against it to stay on their feet. Kendall spies something
through the maelstrom. It looks like WET WOOD. He points:
<b>                        KENDALL
</b>          There!
THE CABIN -- Wooden, one story, and large, it resembles a
solidly built shack. It is being thrashed by the storm.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          38.
</b>The trio stumble towards the front door...
<b>INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
</b>Obviously abandoned. Bare of any furniture save for two
wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace.
DUNBAR and NUNEZ shout in surprise as the three men
practically collapse into the cabin. Dunbar runs to bolt
the door against the elements as Nunez helps them up.
<b>                      NUNEZ
</b>          What happened to you-
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          What happened to you?
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          We finished the course and came here,
          Then heard an explosion-

          Where's Pike?
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          We don't know. West is dead.
Silence. Dunbar and Nunez stare at him.    Mueller jerks a
hand towards Kendall and Childs.
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          They found him. Poor fucker was
          Practically blown in half-

</b>          Poor fucker my ass...

</b>          What about you, wandering around

</b>          Yeah and he doesn't know when-
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          I remember now, it was before the

</b><b>                                                         39.

</b>          I'm about two seconds away from seeing
          If fairies really can fly-
<b>                      NUNEZ
</b>          What about Pike?
Mueller stops, as the others turn towards the big man.
Silence. They realize what the question means.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          He wouldn't kill anybody. . .
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict.
          You know how much he hated West-
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          I hated West, Childs hated West,
          everyone with a goddamn brain hated
          West but that doesn't mean we killed
          him!
<b>                      NUNEZ
</b>          What if it wasn't one of us?    What
          if it was a local-
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          He was blown up by a phosphorous
          grenade, they don't exactly sell
          those at 7-11.
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          Look, here are the facts - Roberto
          was with Dunbar, Queen Kendall was
          with Childs, and Pike's the only one
          not here. He did it!
The others nod, becoming convinced.
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          He is the only one unaccounted for.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Maybe he's dead too.    Maybe you killed
          Them both, Mueller-
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Shut up.
              (to Mueller)
          Let me see your grenades.
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          Why?
<b>
</b><b>                                                             40.
</b><b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          We were each given three so whoever
          killed West will be missing one.
Mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades.
<b>                          MUELLER
</b>          See?   Three.     Now can we please-
He stops. Hearing a SOUND outside.        Through the wind and
rain, FOOTSTEPS on the porch.
They all turn to the door.       Waiting...
The DOOR SWINGS OPEN.. Pike.       Covered in BLOOD.
<b>                          PIKE
</b>          Hey, guys.
They stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks
over to the empty FIREPLACE. Finally:
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Whose blood is that, Jay?       West's.
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Any kindling for afire?
He looks around for kindling.       A beat.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          What do you mean, West's?
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          I mean I killed him.
              (pause)
          Isn't that what we all wanted?
<b>INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
</b><b>                      HARDY
</b>          He admitted it.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Right in front of us. Mueller went
          after him but we held him back.
          Pike surrendered and volunteered to
          be tied up. So we roped him to a
          chair and tried to ride out the storm.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Why would he just surrender?
Kendall turns to her and smiles.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Because he had a plan.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        41.

</b>Pike, tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look
for, food in the KITCHEN. Alone, Kendall walks past Pike:

</b>          Hey, Kendall, talk to you for a sec?
Kendall looks around - there seems no harm in it.
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          You hated West as much as I did.
          I'm not saying what I did was right,
          but you can't tell me you're not
          glad the motherfucker's dead.
Kendall says nothing. Pike looks around, makes sure no one
is listening and then whispers:
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          The thing is, we've got a real

          The press'll crucify you and your
          father. His career will be over and
          it'll be your fault. But we do this

On Kendall, thinking about it.    A beat.
<b>                        KENOALL

</b>          Mueller.    He's as bad as West and we
          both know   it. Now I can't do it,
          cause I'm   tied up, but we get the
          others to   go along-
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Don't think I want to hear this-
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Someone else can do the deed, it
          doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez
          too, he's got a tendency to follow
          Mueller, but the rest of us can come
          out ahead - the guys who took out

Kendall stares at him.   Disgusted.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          You're sick, Pike.
He turns and walks away.   Pike watches him go.

</b>          Later on I.saw him talking to Dunbar.
          They had been close. I was in another
          room when it happened.
<b>INT. CABIN -- KITCHEN LAST NIGHT
</b>Kendall, looking through the empty cabinets for food when
A GUNSHOT -- From the living room. As Kendall bolts towards
the noise, the air is filled with the sounds of SCREAMING
and SHOOTING! He pushes through the door...
<b>INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHT
</b>Kendall, coming through the door as we SLO-MO...
Mueller, sprawled out on the floor, dead... Pike, tied to
the chair, bullethole in his forehead... Nunez, wounded,
stumbling out the front door into the hurricane...
And a badly wounded Childs, pistol out, TURNING towards the
SOUND OF THE DOOR and FIRING...
Kendall's arm, HIT with a SLUG, and he starts to go down...
FREEZE-FRAME -- On Kendall's form, falling.
<b>                      KENDALL (V.O.)
</b>          I don't think he meant to do it. It
          was just reflex - he'd already been
          gutshot. I must have passed out
          cause next thing I knew...
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- DAWN
</b>The sounds of RUNNING  and HEAVY BREATHING. Kendall's eyes
flutter open. He's on   Dunbar's back, being carried through
the woods. The sound   of GUNFIRE and a TREE BRANCH SHATTERS
next to them. Someone   is chasing them. Trying to kill them.
Nunez.

from behind and we can now hear ROTOR BLADES APPROACHING...

</b>           Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
<b>                       KENDALL
</b>           Because he'd shot Mueller.
<b>                       OSBORNE
</b>           But you didn't see it, right?
<b>                       KENDALL
</b>           Like I said, I was in the kitchen.
           When I came out, Mueller and Pike
           were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit
           and Dunbar was gone.
<b>                       HARDY
</b>           Why did he come back for you?
<b>                       KENDALL
</b>           I honestly don't know. Maybe to
           have someone to cover for him. And
           I wish I could, but there's no doubt
           in my mind he killed those men.
Silence.   Kendall's got nothing more to say.
<b>                       HARDY
</b>           Okay. I think that's it.     He rises
           and walks to the door.
<b>                        KENDALL

Hardy turns back.

<b>EXT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAY
</b>
Hardy and Osborne stand before the Colonel, filling him in.

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Pike killed West, Dunbar killed
          Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.

<b>                      STYLES
</b>          Who killed Pike?

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Someone must have got a shot off.
          He wasn't exactly a moving target.

Styles turns to Osborne.

<b>                      STYLES
</b>          What do you think?

<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          It's too neat.

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          "Too neat." How long have you been
          an investigator?

<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          I don't think that has anything to
          do with-

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          That means under a year. Let me
          explain what ten years of police
          work has taught me - murder is basic.
          There are no conspiracies, no grand
          mysteries, and no evil puppet masters
          behind it all, pulling the strings;
          murder is shitty people doing a shitty
          thing to other shitty people - it
          doesn't always make sense but it's
          always neat. Dunbar's our guy.

Osborne struggles to put it into words.

<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          I just... He came back for Kendall.
          I don't think he's capable of murder.

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.

Osborne turns, making her case to Styles.
<b>
</b><b>                                                 45.
</b><b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Look, all we've got is what Kendall
          says, and he didn't actually witness
          any deaths except Nunez. He found
          West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but
          just their bodies - he didn't see
          any crime committed.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Well, I'm sure if he'd known this
          was all going to happen he'd have
          Tried harder to witness it for you-
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          West's body isn't in the creek bed.
They stop arguing, turning to look at him.
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          We've already been over the terrain
          twice. Nothing.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          There was a hurricane, Bill, the
          wind probably moved it.

          'to include the endzone in Giants
          Stadium and the trunk of my car-
<b>                      STYLES

          proof. We need a confession.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          From Dunbar? I hate to break this
          to you, but I don't think he's gonna
          be all that psyched to put himself
          in for the death penalty.

<b>                      HARDY

          testify and that'll be enough.

Hardy leans across the table.

</b>          Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you

</b>          Didn't shoot West-

Dunbar stares at him.

</b>          You think you know everything, don't
          you? You haven't even scratched the

Hardy leans across the table, looks Dunbar dead in the eye.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          I know enough to know you got two
          choices - you can sign a confession,

          the rest of your life in a military
          prison, or you can tell us to fuck
          off, in which case you'll probably
          get the gas chamber.
              (smiling)
          Am I scratching your surface yet?
Dunbar stares at him for a moment and then LAUNCHES HIMSELF
at Hardy, SCREAMING. Tackles him to the floor, CHOKING HIM...
Osborne, pulling her sidearm, and PISTOL WHIPPING Dunbar in
the head! Dunbar goes sprawling off Hardy as M.P.'s rush
into the room, RESTRAINING him.
Hardy gets up, gasping, and stumbles to the door.
<b>                         OSBORNE

But he's already gone.
<b>INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY

and massaging his neck. Osborne, runninq to catch up.

Hardy whirls on her.

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Pike came back.

<b>INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
</b>
Pike, staggering in through the door. The others get up
from where they are sitting - it's been awhile since they
arrived. Pike shouts at Mueller:

<b>                      PIKE
</b>          What the fuck happened to you-

<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          What the fuck happened to you? One
          minute you're next to me and the
          next you're gone and the sky lights
          up like fucking Christmas-

<b>
</b><b>                                                            53.
</b><b>                       PIKE
</b>           Wandering through a hurricane trying
           to find this place. It's gettin'
           bad out there-
               (looking around)
           Where's West?
<b>                       CHILDS
</b>           Yeah, right. . .
<b>                        DUNBAR
</b>           Shut up.
               (to Pike)
           West's dead.
A beat.
<b>                       PIKE
</b>           What?
Silence.   All of them staring at Pike.
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           Where have you been, Jay?
Pike, suddenly understanding.      Fear creeping into his face.
<b>                       PIKE
</b>           Oh, no. . . no, fuck that-
He moves to the door, but. . .
<b>                       NUNEZ
</b>           Hey!
Nunez, with his PISTOL out.      Trained on Pike.
<b>                       PIKE
</b>           Roberto, what the fuck?
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           We just want to check your pack-

</b>           Why?
<b>                       MUELLER
</b>           Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade
           first-
<b>                       PIKE
</b>           Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone
           turns up dead, you just look for the
           Darkest face in the crowd-

</b><b>                                                         54.

</b>            Do I?
The CLICK as Nunez pulls back the pistol's hammer.
<b>                        NUNEZ
</b>            Let him check your pack.
Pike stares at them and then throws his pack down, angrily.
Dunbar goes to it, opens it, and reaches in. Pulls his hand
out. Only TWO GRENADES. Looks at Pike. Sadly.
<b>                          DUNBAR
</b>            Tie him up.
<b>INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
</b>Later. The fury of the storm has increased. Kendall, Childs,
Nunez, and Mueller, in the KITCHEN looking for food.
<b>IN THE LIVING ROOM
</b>Pike, tied to the chair. Dunbar sitting in a corner,
listening to the hurricane rage outside. Pike watches him.
<b>                        PIKE
</b>            Just like the first day, huh?    You
            standing guard on me.
A CREAKING as the cabin SHIFTS on it's foundation.   Dunbar
looks up at the roof, scared. It holds.
<b>                        PIKE
</b>            This place ain't gonna hold much
            longer.
Dunbar doesn't reply. Still staring nervously at the roof.
Pike looks to make sure the others out of earshot, then:
<b>                        PIKE
</b>            You and me are friends, right?
No reply.
<b>                          PIKE
</b>            Right?
<b>                          DUNBAR
</b>            Yeah...
Pike takes a deep breath.
<b>                        PIKE
</b>            You gotta untie me.
                (off Dunbar's look)
            I didn't do this thing, Ray.
<b>
</b><b>                                                    55.

</b>          Maybe, but that don't make me a killer-
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          You're the only one missing a grenade.
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Which anyone coulda taken out of my
          gear on the chopper. Were you
          watching your pack on the ride in?
Dunbar starts to get up.
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Ray, this is my life    here. I ain't
          gonna pretend I'm not    happy West is
          gone, but you know I    couldn't have
          done this. It's not     in me.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          If not you, then who?
<b>                         PIKE
</b>          Mueller.
<b>                         DUNBAR
</b>          Oh, come on-
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          We're sweeping our area and suddenly
          he's gone. Couple minutes later,
          phosphorous grenade pops off about a
          third of a click away-
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          That's exactly what he says about
          you.
<b>                       PIKE
</b>          Who you gonna trust, Ray?    Him or
          your friend?
Dunbar stares at him.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          You hated West, Mueller loved him-
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX
          Scam, Mueller was in on it-
<b>                         DUNBAR
</b>          Bullshit.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          56.

</b>          Why?
<b>                       PIKE
</b>          Just look.   Little pocket.
Dunbar walks over to Pike's pack and unzips it.    Checks the
little pocket. Pulls out a VIAL and a SYRINGE.
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Combat grade morphine.    Mueller sold
          it to me. .
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          You're lying-
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Pull up my sleeve.    Right arm.
Dunbar does to reveal a cluster of TRACK MARKS.
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          That look like a lie to you? I been
          using solid for the last eight weeks.
Dunbar sits down.   Not knowing what to say.
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          After that first night on the parade
          Grounds with you, I was bad -
          Exposure, malnutrition, the works.
          I needed something to keep me from
          crashing. Mueller found me.
<b>INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO
</b>Empty except for Pike. He sits, nude, curled up on the tile,
as the nozzles blast STEAMING WATER down onto his shivering
form. FOOTSTEPS approaching. Mueller. He leans down next
to Pike, speaking to him. Kindly.
<b>                      PIKE (V.O.)
</b>          He said he knew guy who had an in at
          the PX, could hook me up. This is
          before I knew what a dick he was.
As Mueller produces a SYRINGE from his pocket...
<b>INT. BASE PX -- BACKROOM -- SIX WEEKS AGO
</b>A covert meeting among stacks of supplies. Childs stands
with Mueller, talking to a gaunt Pike. Behind Pike are a
group of other SICKLY LOOKING CADETS, all jonesing.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        57.

</b>           Later on Childs got assigned there,
           started running the shit out to every
           cadet who needed it. But I was our
           class's first customer.. .
Pike hands the smiling Mueller a WAD OF CASH...
<b>INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
</b>Dunbar staring open mouthed at Pike.    Shocked.
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           Why... why didn't you tell me?
<b>                        PIKE
</b>           Becoming a morphine addict during
           Basic ain't exactly something you
           want to broadcast. Only Mueller and
           Childs know.
A beat.   Dunbar gets to his feet.
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           That still doesn't mean you didn't
           kill him.

</b>           You saw West, right?   How was he
           killed?
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           Full clip to the body-
<b>                       PIKE
</b>           From up close or far away?
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           His chest was hamburger-
<b>                       PIKE
</b>           That's close range. You go full
           auto on a guy from close range, you're
           gonna be swimming in blood. Look at
           my uniform. Nothing.
Dunbar looks.   Not a speck of blood on it.
<b>                       PIKE
</b>           And where's Mueller's? When I came
           in, he was only wearing a t-shirt.
Dunbar looks over to fireplace, where ashes are smoldering...
FLASHCUT TO - When Dunbar first entered the Cabin: Mueller,
standing there in a T-SHIRT, a FIRE burning in the hearth.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           58.

</b>          Way I figure it, West must have found
          out about their little business and
          was gonna bust them, so they decided
          to get rid of him first...
<b>                         DUNBAR
</b>              (softly)
          They?
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Mueller and Childs. One of them
          must've taken the grenade from my
          pack on the chopper...
<b>INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
</b>The Sectioners sit, stonefaced, staring out the window.
CLOSE ON - Mueller's hand as it snakes into Pike's pack and
extracts a phosphorous grenade.
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
</b>Mueller and Pike, twenty feet apart, scouring the brush for
targets. Mueller looks to Pike and then slips away...
<b>                      PIKE (V.O.)
</b>          Then Mueller ditches me during the
          exercise and heads for the creek.
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED,-- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
</b>Mueller stands on the hill and pulls the grenades pin, tossing
it down the embankment. ..
<b>                      PIKE (V.O.)
</b>          He blows the grenade to frame me and
          gets West to come running... .
The grenade BLOWS, setting the entire area AGLOW...
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
</b>Kendall and Childs, turning towards the sound...
Note: Each shot of Kendall and Childs in this sequence should
correspond exactly to Kendall's Flashback.
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- NIGHT
</b>West emerges from the bush at a sprint.
<b>                      WEST
</b>          What the fuck is going on?!
Mueller runs down the embankment toward him.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          59.

</b>          Don't know, sir, I-
Six feet away from West, Mueller suddenly raises his rifle
and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
</b>Kendall and Childs, running in the direction of the grenade...
<b>                       PIKE
</b>          Childs' job is easy, he only has to
          delay Kendall long enough for Mueller
          to get away.
Suddenly MACHINE GUNFIRE shatters the night!
<b>                      CHILDS
</b><b>          GET DOWN!
</b>He tackles Kendall into the mud.
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
</b>Mueller, smoking rifle in hand, uniform covered in blood
stands over WEST'S DEAD BODY. He turns and runs off INTO
THE BRUSH. A moment later, Childs and Kendall come into
view at the top of the embankment...
<b>                      PIKE (V.O.)
</b>          Now all Mueller has to do is get rid
          of the evidence...
<b>INT. CABIN -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
</b>Mueller, still covered in blood, enters the dark cabin. He
strips of his shirt and throws it in the fireplace. Striking
a match, igniting the bloody rag... .
<b>                      PIKE (V.O.)
</b>          And wait for everyone else to arrive.
Mueller, watching the evidence burn...
<b>INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

The sound of WOOD SNAPPING. Pike stares up at the roof.
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          There's no time to think, Ray, we

          court martial will take six minutes.
          It's either me or them, Ray, and you

The cabin SHIFTS again.     Dunbar stares at him.
<b>                       PIKE

Dunbar doesn't move.
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Untie me, Ray.
A long beat.   The two men stare at each other.
And then Dunbar pulls his knife from his boot and leans down
to cut Pike's bonds.
<b>                      PIKE

He looks to the open kitchen door where Mueller stands.
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          Guys, get out here!
The others enter the room. Dunbar, kneeling there, knife
inches away from severing Pike's ropes.
<b>                      PIKE

Childs motions to Dunbar.

He's serious.    Dunbar moves away from Pike.

The others begin to look at Mueller with new eyes.

          What about him, huh? Maybe he offed
          the Sarge and changed shirts, brought
          an extra one in his pack. Y'ever

The hurricane, reaching FEVER PITCH outside as WATER begins
leaking in through the roof.

</b>          Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place
          you under military arrest for the
          Murder of Sergeant Nathan West-
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          The fuck are you talking about-
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          You are to be stripped of all weapons
          And placed under guard-
<b>                         MUELLER
</b>          Bullshit-
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Until we return to base, and
          ballistics can match your weapon to
          the slugs in Sergeant West's body-
<b>                         MUELLER
</b>          Shut up!
Mueller pulls his SIDEARM and POINTS IT AT PIKE.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Mueller, what the fuck-
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Don't do this-
Pike, EYES LOCKED with Mueller.    Continuing:
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          A test will no doubt link you to the
          Killing-
<b>                         DUNBAR
</b>          Put it down!
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          Tell him to shut up-
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          -failure to comply with this arrest
          is a court martialable offense in
          and of itself-
<b>
</b><b>                                                             63.
</b><b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Pike, please-
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          Although that won't matter much when
          Coupled with the murder charge-
<b>                      MUELLER
</b><b>          SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FUCKING NIGGER-
</b>Pike leans forward.
<b>                      PIKE
</b>          You stupid white trash motherfucker,
          I saw you do it-
And Mueller FIRES.
Pike's head SNAPS BACK.
The gunshot, DEAFENING.    Then, for an eternity, SILENCE.
Nobody moves.   Nobody breathes.   As if time has stopped.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Oh.. . my God...
Mueller lowers his arm, the pistol clattering to the floor.
His face, as shocked as the others.
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          He wouldn't... stop talking...
He takes a step forward towards Pike.    A hole in the middle
of the black man's forehead.
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>              (softly)
          So you killed him?
<b>                        MUELLER
</b><b>          I. . .
</b>Almost mechanically, Dunbar begins to reach for his own gun...
The unmistakable sound of a two rifles' magazines being RACKED
simultaneously. Dunbar turns to see Childs and Nunez, their
M-16's in hand. Levelled at him.
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          Get that hand away.
Dunbar does.    Looks to Nunez.
<b>                        DUNBAR
</b>          You too?
<b>
</b><b>                                                           64.
</b><b>                      CHILDS
</b>          We can still come out of this okay.
          Pike got free, he got a gun, he came
          after us. That's the story.
Mueller collapses on the ground.   Head in hands.
<b>                      MUELLER
</b>          West was one thing, but this-
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          Shut up, Mueller.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          You framed-him...
<b>                      CHILDS
</b>          None of that matters now. We got
          two dead bodies and a story that
          explains them. You're either with
          us, or against us - which is it?
Dunbar and Kendall, looking at each other. It's clear what
the wrong answer will mean. A long beat, until
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Okay-
He is cut off as the WIND outside ROARS - the HURRICANE
mounting to it's FULL FORCE - and the WINDOWS BLOW INWARDS,
showering Childs, Mueller, and Nunez with glass!
Dunbar's hand flies to his pistol, PULLING IT...
Mueller, SCREAMING, trying to claw the glass from his EYES...
Childs, seeing Dunbar move, PULLS THE TRIGGER. .. .
And the cabin is filled with the THUNDER OF GUNFIRE as Kendall
goes down, clutching his ARM...
DUNBAR FIRES, hitting Childs directly in the chest...
Childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of
bullets PUNCHING INTO MUELLER who jerks like a marionette...
Nunez, drawing a bead on Dunbar, about to shoot, when...
A great CRESCENDO of WOOD SPLINTERING and SUPPORTS BUCKLING
overtakes them and the CABIN'S ROOF COMES DOWN ON THEIR HEADS.
<b>EXT. DEMOLISHED CABIN -- FIRST LIGHT
</b>Hours later. The rain has lessened and the Hurricane has
begun to lift as Dunbar pulls himself from the debris.
Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        65.
</b>Kendall.   Half conscious, his arm, bloody.
Dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun
begins to peak through the clouds overhead.
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- SUNRISE
</b>Dunbar, carrying Kendall towards the clearing when GUNFIRE
comes from behind. He turns to look...
Nunez. The only other survivor from the Cabin. A hundred
yards back, rifle in hand, coming after them with a vengeance.
Dunbar, sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels
and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a
<b>HELICOPTER OVERHEAD
</b><b>                       DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>           And then I killed the last of them.
FLASHCUT TO - Nunez, chest blown open, going down...
<b>INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
</b>And we're back to the interrogation. Dunbar, stubbing out a
cigarette and looking up at Hardy and Osborne.
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           Can I have some coffee?
Osborne blinks, like a trance has been broken.
<b>                       OSBORNE
</b>           Yeah... yeah, sure.
She goes over to the machine and pours a cup.
<b>                       HARDY
</b>           You shot Childs and Nunez.
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           They would have killed us both. You
           want me to write a confession, I'll
           write a confession.
<b>                       HARDY
</b>           You saved Kendall's life-
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           But not Pike's.
Osborne hands him the coffee.
<b>                       OSBORNE
</b>           Why didn't you tell us all this in
           the first place?
<b>
</b><b>                                                         66.
</b><b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Would you have believed me?
Their faces say "no".   Osborne spreads a MAP out on the table.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Where's the cabin?
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Don't know on a map. West told us
          it was there, we just found it.
          Maybe the hurricane took it away.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Raymond, for you to have any chance
          of coming out of this, we need to
          locate the other bodies and examine
          them to corroborate your testimony.
          Otherwise this is just another story-
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for
          college money. I didn't ask for any
          of this - I tried to do the right
          thing out there and people got killed.
          You say finding those bodies'll help
          me, then go find them. I don't want
          to die.
<b>EXT. FOR MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY
</b>Hardy and Osborne, walking and talking.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Talk it through: Childs, Mueller,
          and Nunez know they're going out on
          the regular Tuesday Night drill,
          hurricane or ho hurricane, so they
          plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          And they're smart about it. They
          know when you commit a crime you
          know is going to be investigated,
          you need a fall guy and for that to
          work, you have to have a witness.
<b>                        OSBORNE
</b>          Dunbar.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Exactly, someone who's not involved,
          who's word can't be questioned. You
          only let them see what you want them
          to see, you make them believe, so
          when the time comes, they've totally
          bought into your version of events.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        67.
</b><b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          They believe the innocent are guilty
          and the guilty are innocent.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          And if they're asked, that's what
          they'll tell the, world.
<b>                       OSBORNE
</b>          So it's a good plan but it goes wrong;
          Mueller flips out and shoots their
          fall guy, which means they have to
          bring Dunbar and Kendall into the
          Cover story-
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Kendall maybe would have agreed, but
          The hurricane buttfucks the cabin-
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Buttfucks the cabin?
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          And all hell breaks loose. A lot of
          Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys
          and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall
          out from under a house, does the
          Senator's son try and get us to put
          his savior in the gas chamber?
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          That bugs you too?
<b>                        OSBORNE
</b>          Little bit.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Let's go talk to Bill...
<b>INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAY
</b>Hardy and Osborne stand in front of an agitated Styles. He
tries to take a hit off his asthma inhaler and gets nothing.
Frustrated, he tosses it away.
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          Fucking asthma... This whole thing's
          driving it nuts.
A beat.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          What I said before-
<b>
</b><b>                                                             68.
</b><b>                      STYLES
</b>          Was dead right. You think Dunbar's
          on the level?
<b>                        HARDY
</b>          Yeah.
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          Does Osborne agree?
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Yes, sir, I do.
Hardy lays a piece of paper on Styles' desk.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Dunbar's confession. It should be
          enough to get you out of trouble.
Styles looks at it and then slowly up to Hardy.
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          You want Kendall, don't you?
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You
          don't do that if you're not involved.
Hardy nods, agreeing.   Styles stares at them.
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          You both know if you do this, if you
          go after a Senator's son and you're
          wrong... it's not just me in the hot
          seat anymore.
<b>                        OSBORNE
</b>          We know.
<b>                      STYLES
</b>              (to Hardy)
          I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
<b>                        HARDY
</b>          We know.
Styles nods and looks to his desk.      Almost to himself:
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          You don't get to be a Colonel without
          compromising. Without getting out
          of the way of the bigger dogs. You
          politic, play it safe, think of the
          career first. And when things get
          dirty, you just look the other way...
He looks back up at Hardy.      His eyes, steeled.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          69.
</b><b>                      STYLES
</b>          Four of my men are dead. You think
          Kendall had something to do with it,
          then you go get the son of a bitch.

<b>INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
</b>
Kendall lies in his bed, looking worse than before.   Hardy
and Osborne enter.

<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Pike never confessed.

<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          We've been making progress, I see.

Osborne looks to her watch.   Kendall notices.

<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Running out of time, are we? Tick-
          Tock, tick-tock, how long till your
          witnesses fly the coop?

<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Fifty minutes.

<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Not much time to solve the crime.
          Tell me, detective, how did it feel
          taking blood money from Guissepe
          Torres? Did it weigh on your
          conscience or did you just not think
          about it?

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          You tried to pin three stone murders
          on Dunbar-

<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          How many murders did you cover up?
          One? Five? Maybe an even ten.

<b>                      HARDY
</b>              (to Osborne)
          Can I go to jail for punching a guy
          who's been shot?

Kendall begins coughing.

<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          I think they're giving me the wrong
          medicine. This isn't a very good
          Hospital, you know-

Hardy sighs and goes to the sink to get him some water.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        70.
</b><b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Epileptic attacks are murder on your
          system. Rattle your internal organs
          like a paint mixer.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          My heart weeps.
He returns with a GLASS OF WATER and hands it to Kendall.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Pike never confessed.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          No, but it got you interested, didn't
          it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray
          to tell you terribly sordid tales
          about drugs and creek beds and dead
          little sergeants who stuck their
          noses where they didn't belong.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Is it the truth?
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          There's that word again.
              (smiling)
          As I told you, I wasn't in the room
          when everyone started shooting.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Dunbar says you were.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Then he's mistaken. You know, I
          really don't think my father would
          approve of this line of questioning-
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Why did you tell us he shot everybody,
          Levi? You put him in for three
          murders, the man saved your life-
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          So I should stay silent about his
          misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran
          in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller
          were dead, and Dunbar was running
          out the door with the smoking gun-
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Dunbar was running out the door?
          Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was
          confused, because I thought you said
          Nunez was running out the door.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           71.
</b><b>                       KENDALL
</b>          No.   I said Dunbar.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Huh. You know, I really thought you
          said Nunez. I thought you said
          "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta
          check the tape on that.
              (off Kendall's look)
          Oh, yeah we taped the last interview.
          This one too. Cause it'd be a real
          break for us to catch you in a lie.
Silence. They wait for Kendall's reaction. He looks
momentarily flustered by this... and then he smiles.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          I believe your next line is "What
          are you trying to hide?"
<b>                       HARDY
</b>          Well?
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Sorry to disappoint. I'm on
          painkillers for the injury - they
          cloud the mind. You're right, it
          was Nunez. Any more questions?
Hardy doesn't know what to say.   That was his ace card.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Don't get me wrong, Mueller and Childs
          were quite the pair, the type of
          guys you didn't feel comfortable
          going to sleep around. Completely
          capable of murder. But as I said, I
          didn't hear the exchange before the
          shooting. I wasn't in the room.
Osborne furrows her brow at this as Hardy continues.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Dunbar will testify that you were.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          Then we'll leave it up to the courts -
          His word against mine. What does
          his father do again? Steelworker?
              (smiling)
          Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice
          will be served. In any case, my
          father will definitely want to talk
          to you about all these questions,
          these accusations on his son. He's
          quite protective.

          asking questions, killing time, until
          the transport arrives and whisks you
          away to where Senator Daddy can
          protect you. You think you're just

</b>          It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going
          to find those bodies and when we do,
          I'm going to make sure one of them

</b>          See, I just take your gun to the
          morgue and fire it into one of their
          skulls; then I call every newspaper
          in the country with the story about
          how Senator Kendall's gay son went
          nuts on a training mission-

<b>                      KENDALL

           throw you to the wolves, and unlike
           you I'm gonna get away with it,

She finishes, breathing hard. Kendall, totally cowed. Hardy,
trying to suppress a smile. Osborne rises for the door.

</b>           Dunbar's telling the truth.
<b>                       OSBORNE

</b>           We did get our stories straight, but
           not because we killed anyone.
               (pause)
           It was because I threatened him.
<b>                        HARDY

Osborne holds up the microrecorder and starts the tape again.
<b>                       OSBORNE
</b>           Who killed Sergeant West?
Kendall stares at the recorder.   A long pause.

</b>           Who, Levi-
<b>                        KENDALL

He pauses, taking a shaky sip of water.
<b>                      KENDALL
</b>          I was in on the PX thing. He and
          Mueller and me, we were making
          thousands. West found out. Childs
          said we were just gonna scare him -
          Use my Dad's clout. I had this whole
          speech prepared about how if he ratted
          us, his career was over. We met him
          in the creek bed but before I said
          anything...
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT
</b>West stands in front of Childs and Kendall, facing them.
Kendall opens his mouth to speak, but Childs steps forward
and raises his rifle, FIRING...
<b>INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
</b><b>                      KENDALL
</b>          I swear, I didn't know he was gonna
          do it. After, he told me we were
          gonna pin it on Pike, one of our
          biggest customers.

</b>          Nobody'd believe the word of a black

Childs gives Kendall a look that says "Stay quiet".
<b>                      KENDALL (V.O.)
</b>          He told me I'd better keep quiet, or
          I'd end up the same as West.
Pan over to Dunbar, who binds his friend, sadly.
<b>                      KENDALL (V.O.)
</b>          Dunbar didn't know anything about
          any of it. Everything he told you

<b>
</b><b>                                                       76.

</b>Dunbar pulls Kendall from the cabin's wreckage. As Kendall
begins to talk to him, Dunbar's eyes widen in shock. ..
<b>                      KENDALL (V.O.)
</b>          I told him what had really happened
          to West. Told him to keep quiet
          about it or I'd destroy him. Because
          if it came out that I was involved
          with the whole PX scam, my father
          would be finished.
<b>INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
</b><b>                      KENDALL
</b>          I scared Dunbar into silence.  He's

          time. We got here, you came to  see
          me... I didn't know if I could trust
          him with that kind of secret-
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          So you framed him. The same way
          Childs was going to frame Pike.
Kendall nods.   Crying a little.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Little advice, Levi, next time you
          frame a guy, pick someone who can't
          defend themselves.
Kendall says nothing.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          What happened with Nunez?
<b>                      KENDALL

hesitates before firing, not wanting to...

</b>          Do it!
Dunbar's rifle ERUPTS...

</b>          That's how you do good cop/bad cop.
Hardy smiles and gets up.   Walking slowly to Kendall's bed.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Childs did it, huh?
Kendall nods, still a little teary.
<b>                      HARDY

</b>          But you can't prove it! You can't
          prove anything until we find the
          bodies!
Kendall, crying harder now, beginning to shake.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          You lied to us, Levi, you're going
          to the gas chamber unless you tell

And then. His mouth SLAMS SHUT. Teeth cracking together
over and over again like a metronome on speed, and his body
JERKS HORRIBLY, going horizontal, SHAKING VIOLENTLY!

Osborne, leaping to her feet.

<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Get something between his teeth!

Hardy grabs a fork from the bedside table and tries to shove
it into Kendall's chattering mouth. His teeth, CLAMPING
DOWN on the metal and Hardy's hand, drawing blood.

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Shit!

The Nurse bursts into the room.

<b>                      NURSE
</b>          What is-

<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          He's an epileptic!

The Nurse runs to the bed, pushing Hardy aside. As more
MEDICAL PERSONNEL runs into the room, they usher Hardy and
Osborne to the door.

<b>                      DOCTOR

Osborne tries to move to him, but the Doctor blocks her path.

<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          He's trying to say something-

<b>                      DOCTOR

<b>                      KENDALL

clarity in his eyes.

</b>           Fuh-Fucking Pike.
And relapses into ANOTHER FIT as SECURITY GUARDS drag Hardy
and Osborne from the room.
<b>INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- WAITING ROOM -- DAY
</b>Later.   Hardy and Osborne sit in silence, eyes downcast.
Waiting. Hardy pulls his last cigarette from the pack, lights
it, crumples the pack and tosses it into a garbage can.
<b>                       HARDY

<b>                       HARDY
</b>           No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate
           him. For what he did to Dunbar.
           For fucking over the little guy.
<b>                       OSBORNE

Hardy looks up at her and nods.
<b>                       OSBORNE
</b>           You wanted to break him.

<b>                        OSBORNE
</b>           So did I.
She looks back to the floor. Hardy takes a drag from the
cigarette, and then tosses that away too.
The door opens and Styles walks into the room.    Somber.

          I guess it was about one man framing

Hardy and Osborne stare at him.    Shocked
A beat.

          Sorry, detectives.     Time's up.
As the M.P.'s grab Hardy, dragging him away. Osborne, trying
to stop them. Dunbar, climbing the stairs onto the plane...
Osborne pulls her SIDEARM, levelling it at him as Hardy yells:
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          James Randall Pike, COME ON DOWN!
Dunbar stops at the hatchway. Slowly turning back to them.
Seeing the gun. The M.P.'s release Hardy. Nobody moves.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Let's go have a talk.
<b>INT. COFFEE ROOM -- EVENING
</b>Hardy and Osborne roughly lead Dunbar into the room, the JAG
Lawyer trailing behind, shouting:
<b>                      JAG LAWYER
</b>          This is your entire career here-
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Fuck off.
She slams the door and BARRICADES it.    Turns to Hardy.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           85.

</b>          Right back where we started.

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          You want to talk about baseball now?

Hardy practically throws Dunbar into a chair.

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          No more games, right, Pike?    It was
          you who West singled out...

FLASHCUT TO - WEST on the parade grounds, now strangling
DUNBAR on the first day...

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          You who got hooked by Mueller's

a syringe...

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          You who did it all.

Hardy steps forward and RIPS OPEN Dunbar's right sleeve,
revealing the TRACK MARKS.

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          You wanted revenge on West, revenge
          on them all, so you killed them.

<b>INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
</b>
Dunbar standing in the Cabin; Mueller, Childs, and Pike,
dead at his feet.

<b>                      HARDY (V.O.)
</b>          But that wasn't enough. You needed
          a new identity, because no one was
          going to believe James Randall Pike,
          convicted felon, had acted so nobly
          in the face of danger - you needed a
          name people could trust, one that
          hadn't been to jail, one that hadn't
          publicly been West's bitch boy.

He stares down at the bodies in the cabin, his eyes focusing
on the black man's uniform. The name on it reads - "DUNBAR".

As he reaches for it...
<b>
</b><b>                                                        86.

</b><b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          You kept Kendall alive to corroborate
          your story and he did it all they
          way up to the end. You even gave
          him his own motive in case we decided
          to burn him, too.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Can't do that now, though, can you?
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          You walked into the army a convicted
          felon with a sentence of five years
          in a uniform and were going walk out
          eight weeks later with a different
          name, a clean record, and an honorable
          discharge - a guy who did "everything
          he could" to save his friends.
Dunbar looks at them.   One to the other.   Slowly.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Is that what I did, now? And of
          course, you can prove all of it.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          We can prove that you're not Ray
          Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet
          is a court-martial in and of itself-
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar?
          Was I ever told to state my name
          rank and serial number for the record?
          No. You assumed who I was, because
          I was wearing this uniform. Don't
          believe me?
He reaches under the table and rips out the HIDDEN MICROPHONE.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Check your tapes.
Hardy and Osborne exchange an uneasy glance.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          We don't need the tapes-
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Oh, you don't? What else do you
          have on me? You haven't found any
          bodies yet, have you?
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          We've found all of them.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       87.
</b>Dunbar chuckles at the bluff.

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Ohhhh, I don't think so...

<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          How do you know that?

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Just a guess. Maybe they're not
          where they're supposed to be. Maybe
          somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -
          no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still
          plays as self defense. Face it
          detectives ... you have nothing.

Hardy, knowing he's right. In a flash he reaches down PULLS
OSBORNE'S GUN and grabs Dunbar, SLAMMING him up against the
wall, pressing the weapon TO HIS TEMPLE!

<b>                      HARDY

          Pike annoys someone so much he gets
          shot in the head-

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Please, please don't-

A POUNDING on the locked door.    Hardy ignores it.

<b>                      HARDY

room! Styles and the JAG Lawyer behind, taking in the scene.
<b>                      STYLES

Hardy releases Dunbar, who slides to the floor, gasping.

</b>The JAG Lawyer glowers as the M.P.'s stand down.   Dunbar
tries to pull himself together. To Hardy:
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          You're right. I was the one he
          singled out. Beat me morning, noon,
          and night, ran me ragged. When
          Mueller found me, I was gone. He
          gave me a little taste...

</b>          That was his game, see? Ride the

</b>          Every nine weeks, a new class of
          cadets, new potential customers.
          The amount of money involved over
          that period of time... this was some
          high stakes shit.
He takes a deep breath, looking at them.
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Dunbar moved his through the kitchen.
          I worked in the motor pool and hooked
          all the mechanics. By the time the
          hurricane hit, we were all in. Some
          using, some pushing, some both. But
          then something happened. West heard
          one of us was about to talk, to blow
          his whole operation. He figured
          he'd made enough money, had enough
          of the army, maybe it was time to
          disappear. But first he was gonna
          teach us one last thing.
<b>INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- LAST NIGHT
</b>West, entering the,barracks, shouting the cadets awake.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          The Tuesday Night drill was the
          perfect cover. The hurricane made
          it even better.
<b>EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT
</b>The cadets, climbing aboard the chopper.
<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          He put us on the chopper and flew us
          to his cabin. And then he told us.
<b>INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
</b>The six men stand in rigid formation, eyes on West.
<b>                      WEST
</b>          Gentlemen! It has come to my
          attention that there is a traitor in
          our midst. Someone who was going to
          break the code of fraternal
          brotherhood that I have endeavored
          to create in all of you. Perhaps
          that failure is mine. But we take
          care of our own. And this traitor
          must be made to pay.
He walks down the line of the six men, eyeing each of them.
Finally stopping at one. Putting a hand on his shoulder.

<b>                         WEST
</b>             Run.
<b>                         NUNEZ
</b>             Sir, I wasn't-
<b>                         WEST
</b>             I know you were. Cadet  Mueller found
             the letter you'd written to the
             Colonel in your locker.  You were
             going to betray us all.  Now, run.
He points to the door. The hurricane, RAGING outside.   Nunez
looks to the others, then the door, and understands.
He takes off running out the door.       Gone.
West walks over to a table covered with a tarp. Pulls the
cloth aside to reveal M-16's, PISTOLS, and GRENADES.
<b>                         WEST
</b>             Now we'll see whose training's paid
             off the most. You are to hunt Cadet
             Nunez down and bring his body back
             to me. If you fail and he escapes,
             we all go down together.
The remaining five cadets, understanding there is no place
for friendship or kindness here. This is life and death.
They walk to the table and gear up.
<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
</b>Lightning, thunder, and rain as Nunez runs unarmed through
the thick brush.
SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM - The other five fan out, rifles up,
following his trail, ready to kill.
<b>                         DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>             It was insanity. We were hunting a
             man down to kill him.
<b>ON MUELLER
</b>Making his way down embankment, M-l6 out, ready for anything.
From behind him, MOVEMENT...
<b>                         DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>             He got Mueller first.
Nunez TACKLES HIM at full speed, feet SLIPPING on the wet
hill, and the two TUMBLE head first into a GULLY. Punching,
kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                 92.
</b>Nunez, CHOKING Mueller as he strains to reach his gun...
<b>                          MUELLER
</b>            Roberto...
With a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK.        Mueller lies still.
<b>                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>            He took his gun. Used it on Childs.
Nunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs
fires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's
rifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks.
<b>                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>            I can't imagine what it was like.
            Having your friends try to kill you...
Nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard.          In
agony over what he's just had to do.
<b>                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>            But you do what you have to survive.
Closing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood
from his hands and climbs out of the gully.
<b>ELSEWHERE
</b>PIKE, creeping through the foliage. Trying to listen for
sounds of movement through the storm. His eyes narrow as he
hears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE...
The bullet hits his forehead dead center.        He crumples.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away.
Lowering his rifle.      He climbs down.
<b>                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>            Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple
            minutes later.
<b>TIME CUT TO:
</b>Dunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form. They gaze
down at the uniform emblazoned with the name "DUNBAR".
<b>                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>            It came to me in a split second.
            Change clothes, change identities.
            If James Pike gets discharged he
            goes right back to jail. But if I
            was Dunbar, I could walk away from
            all this with a new life. But then...
As he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           93.
</b>KENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm. Dunbar raises his rifle
to find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him.
<b>YELLING OVER THE HURRICANE:
</b><b>                          NUNEZ
</b>           Put it down!
A Mexican stand-off.   The rain continues to fall.
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           I just want to go!
Nunez shakes his head.
<b>                       NUNEZ
</b>           You were gonna kill me, Pike!    Thought
           you were my friend!
Dunbar, torn. He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't
surrender either.
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           I have to get Kendall to a hospital!
<b>                       NUNEZ
</b>           He was gonna kill me too!
Silence.   The two men still facing each other.
<b>                       NUNEZ {CONT'D)
</b>           I snapped Mueller's neck! He was my
           best friend and I had to snap his
           neck because he was gonna shoot me
           for drugs! For West!
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           We don't have to do this! You go
           that way, I'll go this way!
Nunez laughs.
<b>                       NUNEZ
</b>           You'll shoot me in the back!
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           You killed three people!    Isn't that
           enough for one night?
More silence.   Neither moves.    The sky above, a maelstrom.
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           I don't want to die out here, Roberto!
           Do you?
Nunez, staring at him.     Deciding.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              94.
</b><b>                      NUNEZ
</b>          If you even twitch...
Dunbar nods.
Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him.
And then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of
Nunez...
West.
Staring down at him from behind some brush.       Watching.
Nunez, slowly backing away. He pauses as his foot catches
on a fallen branch. Looks away from Dunbar for a split second
to step over it...
West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on. . . "
<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Forgive me. ..
And Dunbar FIRES.
Nunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the
gunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in
agony. West walks down.
<b>                      WEST
</b>          Congratulations, Cadet Pike.      You
          get the gold star.
Dunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain.
<b>                        DUN BAR
</b>          Fuck you.
West smiles.   Tilts his head to Kendall.
<b>                      WEST
</b>          You'd best get him out of here.
          Don't worry about the bodies, they'll
          be taken care of.
Dunbar doesn't move.
<b>                      WEST
</b>          This is where we part ways, Cadet.
          You tell them I died out here, or
          I'll come back for you. Tell them
          one of the others did me. Mueller,
          Childs, I don't care who. You and
          Kendall, you tell them a story.
              (smiling)
          You can tell a story, can't you?
Dunbar doesn't reply.   West laughs and flips him a salute.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         95.
</b><b>                       WEST
</b>          Dismissed.

And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.   Giving
Dunbar a clear shot at his back.

Dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot
the old man...

But he can't.   West disappears into the bayou.

A GROAN from the ground. Kendall. Dunbar's reverie broken,
he leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...

<b>INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING
</b>
Dunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished. Hardy, Osborne,
Styles, and the JAG Lawyer gaping at what he has just said.

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all.
          He came after us with a vengeance.
              (to Styles)
          You know the rest.

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          And the bodies?

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          You won't find them. Won't find
          West, either. He's too good.

<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          No bodies, no West...

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          No death certificates.    No crime.

<b>                      DUNBAR
</b>          Just four people MIA.    Silence.

The JAG Lawyer steps forward.

<b>                      JAG LAWYER
</b>          You'll testify to this, the
          corruption, the drug scam?

Dunbar says nothing.

<b>                      JAG LAWYER
</b>          We can cut a deal for you on the
          Nunez killing.

<b>                      DUNBAR

</b><b>                       JAG LAWYER
</b>           If you're telling the truth, the PX

<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           All the proof you need will be when
           West comes back and puts a bullet in
           my brain. But I'll do it. I'm a
           dead man, anyway. Like Kendall.
               (looking at Hardy)
           We both should have died out there
           with our brothers. I know that now.
Silence.   The JAG Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone.
<b>                       JAG LAWYER
</b>           I'll take him now if you don't mind.
Hardy nods. Dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door.
Turning back to Hardy.
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           Tell me, detective.   Did you get
           what you wanted?
Hardy shakes his head, sadly.
<b>                       HARDY
</b>           Not even close.
They leave.   Styles walks over to Hardy.
<b>                       STYLES
</b>           Tom-
Hardy holds up a hand, cutting him off. Styles nods,
understanding, and leaves, closing the door behind him.
Hardy and Osborne stand there.   Not speaking.    It's done.
<b>INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OFFICER'S CLUB -- NIGHT
</b>Several hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar,
drunk and alone. Out of place, the only one not in uniform.
Osborne walks in, locates Hardy, and strides over to the
bar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. Her face, stoic.
<b>                       OSBORNE
</b>           We need to talk-
<b>                       HARDY
</b>           Seven.
He takes a slug of his drink.
<b>                       OSBORNE
</b>           What?
<b>
</b><b>                                                       97.

He chuckles.
<b>                     HARDY {CONT'D)
</b>          Seven. That's the answer to Kendall's
          question. How many? Seven.
Osborne looks at him.    Realizing what he's saying.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          This isn't the time-

<b>                         HARDY

He pours himself another drink.
<b>                         HARDY
</b>          Thing about    taking money is, you
          don't have    to do anything.  You just

Osborne stares at him.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Seven unsolved murders. And you

He takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.
<b>                      OSBORNE

He motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne
takes his hand, stopping him.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          And because you're a good man, I
          know you'll do the right thing.
Hardy looks at her, questioning.   Osborne takes a deep breath.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Pike never made it to D.C.. Somebody
          took him off the plane before it

<b>                        OSBORNE
</b>          Nobody saw.    But I don't think so.
She puts the papers on the bar.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          These are the requisitions from the

          of them - Pike was telling the truth.
          Look who signed the other half.
She taps the bottom of the paper. Hardy, not wanting to
believe it. He looks up at her, pained.
<b>                      HARDY

<b>INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- NIGHT
</b>Styles, finishing his paperwork. He rises and turns off his

leave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the doorway.
<b>                      HARDY

          Nunez up and then disappear. But it
          got messy and people got killed. So
          you called your old pal Tom Hardy,
          figuring if worse came to worse,
          he'd cover for you.
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          You're drunk-
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          I'm not going to cover for you, Bill.
          Not for this.
Styles, realizing what Hardy's talking about.
<b>                       STYLES
</b>          Look-
He begins to move from behind his desk.
<b>
</b><b>                                                   100.
</b><b>                      HARDY
</b>          Stay where you are.

<b>                       STYLES
</b>          Or what?   You've gone round the bend-

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          West had a partner. Someone who
          knew how to get things done.

Hardy throws the papers onto Styles' desk.

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          What I can't understand is why you
          signed these. If you'd just let
          West take care of the paperwork, no
          one would have known, but you got
          careless. So when Pike finally told
          the truth you had to get rid of him,
          too.

<b>                      STYLES
</b>          That's preposterous-

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Toxicology report came back.
          Kendall's attack was caused by a
          drug known as anephadrine, maybe
          you've heard of it. It's for
          asthmatics. If an epileptic takes
          enough, it kills them. I checked
          with the nurses at the hospital -
          you're the only other person who
          visited Kendall.

<b>                      STYLES
</b>          Wanted to see if he was okay-

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          You poisoned him, Bill. You heard
          our interrogation, you knew he was
          ready to crack, so you killed him,
          just like Pike.

<b>                      STYLES
</b>          I'm not even going to dignify that-

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          No!  You will stand there and you
          will listen! What happened to you,
          Bill?  You were the one who joined
          up to do good in the world. You
          were the one who believed in it-
<b>
</b><b>                                                      101.
</b><b>                      STYLES
</b>          You want to get into a finger pointing
          contest about character? The army
          kicked you out for drugs, the cops
          fired you for taking bribes from a
          mobster, and you think you can stand
          there and lecture me on codes of
          conduct? There's only one criminal
          standing in this room and it's you.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Not for long.
He walks towards the desk.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          No more witnesses. West's a ghost.
          But it doesn't matter because we
          have your signature, the hospital
          log, and Kendall's toxicology report.
          And that'll be enough.

</b>          You're crazy-

</b>          You can't duck this, Bill. I may
          have done every goddamn thing in my
          life wrong but I won't let this
          happen.
<b>                      STYLES
</b>          For the last time, I have no idea

</b>              (squinting)
          Get your hands away from the desk!
In the darkness we see Styles MOVE SUDDENLY...
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Osborne, gun!
Hardy DIVES to the floor - Osborne in the doorway, PISTOL
raised, FIRES TWO SHOTS! Muzzle flare lighting the room for
a split second as Styles is BLOWN BACK against the wall!
Hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the LIGHT. Styles lies
slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest. Dead.
Osborne lowers her weapon, shaking.
Hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open. Inside
it sits an IVORY HANDLED PISTOL. Fully loaded, safety off.
It's presence tells them everything they need to know.

Hardy nods and then turns to look down at Styles' body.
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Now it's over.
<b>EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- NIGHT
</b>The aftermath. Flashing blue and red lights from parked
Military Police vehicles illuminate the grounds as M.P. 'S
string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the
building, securing the site for investigation.
Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar. Standing by his
GTO, watching as several M.P.'s finish questioning Osborne.
When she's done she spies Hardy and walks over to him.
<b>                      OSBORNE

</b>          Nah.

Osborne smiles.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          A word of advice about women - that

<b>                      HARDY
</b>          I should probably write that down.
<b>                      OSBORNE
</b>          Yeah. .
Hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her.
<b>                      OSBORNE

<b>
</b><b>                                                      103.

A beat.

</b>            Yeah. But he was a lot of other
            things, too. Thanks.
She nods.   An awkward moment.      Finally:
<b>                        HARDY
</b>            I'll see you.
He turns away.   Walking towards his car.
<b>                          OSBORNE
</b>            Hey, Hardy!
He turns back. She walks up and holds something out to him.
A ten dollar bill.
<b>                        OSBORNE
</b>            I owe you this.
He looks down at the money.
<b>                        HARDY
</b>            You saved my life tonight. Keep it.
                (pause)
            Actually, don't keep it, I need the
            money.
He takes the bill and Osborne laughs. He climbs into his
car and starts it. Grinning at her through the open window.
<b>                        HARDY
</b>            You're one of the good ones, Osborne.
            Don't sweat the details.
He puts the GTO in gear and drives off. She watches him go,
then looks down at his card. Smiling. Maybe she will call.
<b>INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</b>A bottle of Scotch at her side, Osborne slips a tape marked
"BASIC TRAINING INTRO - SGT. N. WEST" into her VCR. Settles
back to watch it. West's face fills the screen.

</b>Osborne, drinking and watching.
<b>                      WEST

<b>EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT
</b>24 hours ago. The hurricane rages. A HAND pulls the PIN on
a phosphorous grenade and CHUCKS IT.
It blows, frying brush and nothing more.
West comes over the hill, running to investigate. He stops
at what he sees. Nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed,
SURROUNDED by the other Section Eight Cadets. A prisoner.
<b>                      WEST

West doesn't move. Kendall walks over and DISARMS West,
pushing him into the circle next to the terrified Nunez.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        105.

<b>                      WEST
</b>          Fuck that. You little pissers really
          think you can throw a scare into me?
Dunbar raises his rifle and SHOOTS NUNEZ. He goes down,
twitches once and lies still. Dead. West looks at Dunbar.

And with that, Tom Hardy emerges from the brush carrying, a
COMBAT KNIFE. West's eyes sparkle with recognition.
<b>                      WEST
</b>          Didn't I kick your ass out for this

          try and stick me-
Moving faster than   West thought imaginable, Hardy moves and
the knife FLASHES,   CUTTING WEST OPEN stem to sternum. Hardy
grips the older man   by the shoulders, lowering him to the
ground as he dies.    Whispering in his ear:
<b>                      HARDY
</b>          Stem to sternum. You taught me well,

</b>          You think you could explain all this

<b>                      HARDY (V.O.)
</b>          I wouldn't know where to start.

<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
</b>          You haven't found any bodies yet,
          have you...

As Hardy and Dunbar push through the doors into the bar...

<b>                      HARDY (V.O.)
</b><b>          WHERE ARE THEY?
</b>
<b>INT. ROADHOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
A table of FOUR MEN look up as Hardy and Dunbar enter.

Mueller, Childs, Pike, and the Motor Pool DUTY SERGEANT.
All drinking beer, having a grand old time.

<b>                      STYLES (V.O.)
</b>          Habeas Corpus - you have to have a
          body to have a crime.

Hardy and Dunbar smile and go to join them.

<b>INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- PRESENT NIGHT
</b>
As the taped West concludes his speech.

<b>                       WEST
</b>          Thank you.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          110.
</b>The screen cuts to STATIC. Osborne turns off the TV,
extinguishing the last source of light. OVER THE DARKNESS:
<b>                       WEST (V.O.)
</b>           You can tell a story, can't you?
<b>EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
</b>Silence.   We slowly move towards Hardy's parked GTO...
<b>                       HARDY (V.O.)
</b>           Murder is basic.
Focusing on the TRUNK...
<b>                       HARDY (V.O.)
</b>           There are no conspiracies, no grand
           mysteries, no evil puppet masters
           behind it all, pulling the strings.
<b>INT. GTO TRUNK -- NIGHT
</b>WEST'S BODY, stuffed into the trunk of Hardy's car.
<b>                       HARDY
</b>           Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
<b>EXT. CLEARING -- THIS MORNING
</b>Dunbar lays the wounded Kendall down as the Helicopter
carrying Styles comes in for a landing. Dunbar wipes the
sweat from Kendall's brow and asks him seriously:
<b>                       DUNBAR
</b>           Are you ready for this?
