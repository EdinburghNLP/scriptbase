          EXT. PITTSBURGH, PA - TWILIGHT
                         
          A beautiful blue-collar city approaching nightfall. Bridges.
          Rivers. Churches. The working class poetry of the `Burgh.
                         
                         
          EXT. ST. MARY'S CHURCH - SAME
                         
          PADDY CONLON (60) exits the doors of a run-down church
          holding a 12-STEP BOOK. He is followed by a cluster of other
          PEOPLE in the program and says his goodbyes.
                         
                         
          EXT./INT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD/`75 OLDS - LATER
                         
          Paddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and
          drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He
          listens to "MOBY DICK" on tape as the last piece of daylight
          bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view,
          Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue-
          collar neighborhood high above the city.
                         
                         
          EXT. HOUSE - SAME
                         
          TOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the
          stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter
          coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a
          brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops
          a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the
          approaching night.
                         
                         
          EXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off
          the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he
          approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his
          eyes.
                         
                          PADDY
           Tommy?
                         
          Tommy gives a drunken, crooked smile.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           What're you doing here?
                         
                          TOMMY
           I was just passing through. Figured
           why not have a belt with the old
           man.
           2.
                         
                         
          Father and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a
          long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           She looks good.
                         
                          PADDY
           (patting car hood)
           Yeah, she's hanging in there.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Well, you always did take good care
           of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of
           priorities.
                         
          Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the
          stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a
          fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Got a little something for ya. Mom
           always said never go anywhere empty
           handed.
                         
                          PADDY
           She did. But that's not for me
           anymore, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           What? You change brands?
                         
          Paddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not
          drinking? What gives?
                         
                          PADDY
           C'mon, let's go inside.
                         
          Paddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a
          confused Tommy follows.

          INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is
          clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s. Tommy
          stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place
          in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I like what you've done with the
           place.
           3.
                         
                         
           PADDY (O.S.)
           Appreciate that.
                         
          The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes
          off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He
          glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca
          lounge chair.
                         
                          TOMMY
           There's not much of a woman's touch
           around here.
                         
           PADDY (O.S.)
           No more women for me, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl
           who can take a punch nowadays.
                         
          Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a
          series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks
          into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old
          wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous.
                         
                          PADDY
           Here you go.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in
           14 years and you're not gonna have
           a drink with him?
                         
                          PADDY
           I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming
           up on a thousand days.
                         
                          TOMMY
           C'mon, just one drink.
                         
                          PADDY
           No.
                         
          Tommy shrugs. Takes another pull from his bottle and turns
          back to the photos. He takes them in.

          Tommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a
          mall photography studio, of a MAN AND WOMAN (late 20s) POSING
          WITH A YOUNG GIRL (2). The man looks like the second boy in
          the other photos. His brother BRENDAN.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
                          (OFF PICTURE)
           He's a school teacher down in
           Philly.
                         
          Tommy's face registers surprise.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Remember Tess? They've got two
           beautiful little girls.
                         
          Tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of
          the woman. Obviously his MOTHER. He puts it down, glances at
          the bible, then stares hard at Paddy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           So you found God, huh? That's
           awesome. Mom kept calling for him,
           but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus
           was down at the mill forgiving all
           the drunks. Who knew?
                         
          Paddy sips his coffee. Says nothing. Tommy keeps pressing.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           So, you gonna ask about her, or you
           just gonna sit there all sober?
                         
                          PADDY
           I know.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Oh, you know? What do you know? Do
           you know it wasn't enough just to
           drive west to get away from you?
           When we hit the water we drove
           north, too.
                         
                          PADDY
           When I got sober I hired a man to
           find you.
           5.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
           (taking a swig)
           Is that one of the 12 steps? Or
           does a guy like you get 24?
                         
                          PADDY
           Just the 12.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Did your guy tell you what you
           needed to know?
                         
                          PADDY
           Just that your mother died in
           Tacoma. And you were in the
           Marines. That was all. That was
           enough.
                         
                          TOMMY
           That's too bad. You could've gotten
           some good details.
                         
          Tommy plops himself into a recliner. Glances at the coffee
          table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits. CRIME AND
          PUNISHMENT. THE SUN ALSO RISES. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO.
          MOBY DICK.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           You could've heard about her
           coughing up blood in a shit box
           with no heat. Having me rub her
           down with holy water, because she
           didn't have no insurance. All the
           while waiting for your pal Jesus to
           save her. Did your man tell you
           that?
                         
                          PADDY
           I'm sorry, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           It's good to know you're sorry,
           Pop. Goes a long way.
                         
          Paddy chokes up. Tommy looks at him. Closes his eyes.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           I think I liked you better when you
           were a drunk.
                         
          An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who
          is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his
          eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out.
           6.
                         
                         
          Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of
          Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. He watches his son.
          Relieved and heartbroken at the same time.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
                         
          A chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class
          home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run
          about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some
          whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces
          painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY.
                         
          TESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like
          a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA.
          She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a
          lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up.
                         
          THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA LENS: TWO GIRLS, EMILY (5), WHO WEARS A
          BIRTHDAY GIRL CROWN, AND ROSIE (3), MIMIC THE MAKE-UP WOMAN
          AND APPLY MASCARA AND BLUSH TO BRENDAN.
                         
                          TESS
           What's going on here?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Well, I'm not sure, but I think
           Daddy is now a princess.
                         
          Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here"
          expression.
                         
                          TESS
           Em, you want to open your presents?
                         
          The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents."
          Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with
          gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around.
                         
          Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to
          the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered
          in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           (off pink box)
           This an awfully big box.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's her birthday.
                         
          Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't
          look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift
          with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera.

                          (TEASING)
           I know, but that's why you call it
           a budget. You set it, and you don't
           budge.
                         
          Brendan smiles in his make-up. Kisses his wife.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          The remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the
          lawn. Tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to
          her MOM and the kids, who play on the swing set.
                         
          She walks toward the garage and enters to find Brendan
          pressing free weights on an old bench.
                         
                         
          INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Brendan continues to lift as Tess rushes in and tosses a bag
          of garbage in the bin. A deep CUT, hidden earlier by the make-
          up, is visible on his cheek.
                         
                          TESS
           Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying
           goodbye to the girls. She's gotta
           get on the road. They've been fed.
           They just need a bath.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm on it.
                         
                          TESS
           Can you get them down at a
           reasonable time tonight? They're
           exhausted.
                         
          Brendan kisses Tess. Looks at her outfit.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Where's the rest of that skirt?
                         
                          TESS
           Babe.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Listen, if any guys give you a
           hassle in that joint tonight you
           give me a call, okay?
           8.
                         
                         
                          TESS
           (off his cut)
           Yeah. Just like you gave me a call
           when those Temple frat boys decided
           to smash up your face.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I told you, most nights I sit on
           the stool and grade papers, but
           every now and then I need some
           action.
                         
                          TESS
           Alright, well wait up for me
           tonight. I'll see what I can do
           about that.
                         
          Tess smiles flirtatiously and and heads for the car.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Promises, promises.

          A big, old-school warehouse, where a handful of GUYS whale
          away at MMA punching dummies and roll around on sweat-
          saturated mats. Sun slants through a dirty, industrial
          skylight. A no frills kind of gym.
                         
          Behind the front counter, FENROY (20s) rolls hand wraps and
          watches ESPN's "MMA LIVE" on a laptop.

           And we return here on MMA Live, Jon
           Anik alongside billionaire fight
           promoter J.J. Riley. The Tapout
           crew is also here. Punk and Skrape
           are in the building. Now J.J., what
           led to this project that is
           redefining Mixed Martial Arts here
           in the States?
                         
           J.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN)
           Well, Mixed Martial Arts is a sport
           that I've always been incredibly
           passionate about. As for where the
           idea for Sparta came from, I've
           always kind of dug the Grand Prix
           format, so I tracked these guys
           down to help me out.

          As Fenroy watches them talk about the upcoming Sparta
          tournament, Tommy walks into the gym, surveys the room with
          curiosity, and approaches the front desk.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Fitzy still own this?

           Don't know no Fitzy. Colt Boyd owns
           this gym.
                         
          Fenroy goes back to his computer. Tommy stands there. Notices
          a Sparta POSTER on the wall reading: "THE WAR ON THE SHORE.

          Fenroy grabs a pencil and an index card and puts them on the

          INT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
                         
          Brendan stands in a classroom, surrounded by high school
          STUDENTS wearing safety goggles and raising cain. A block of
          wood sits wedged in a vice, and a student, TITO, stands over
          it with a Louisville slugger in his hands as his classmates
          CHEER him on.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in
           this too, OK? Listen up. So we have
           a body at rest, and you have the
           bat which needs--
                         
                          TITO
           Acceleration.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Acceleration, right. If you have
           enough acceleration, you have might
           have a chance to break the body at
           rest. OK. Go ahead.
                         
          Brendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face,
          watches as Tito brings the bat down on the wood. As it CRACKS
          in half, the other students cheer wildly. Tito smiles and
          leans the bat against a blackboard with "NEWTON'S 2nd LAW OF
          MOTION" printed on it.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           There we go. Alright Tito, well
           done. Remind not to mess with you.
           Sit down everybody. Dial it down.
                         
                         
          As Tito high-fives his way back through the group, things
          settle down and the kids take their seats.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           So, have we got it?
                         
          A room full of affirmatives, with the cocky voice of NASH, a
          skinny white kid in a Flyers jersey, standing out.
                         
                          NASH
           Force equals mass times
           acceleration. We got it.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Alright. The third law--
                         
          A black student, STEPHON, looks up from his desk.
           11.
                         
                         
                          STEPHON
           How many laws this dude got?
                         
                          BRENDAN
                          (LAUGHING)
           The dude? The dude has three.
           Newton the dude says that for every
           action, there's an equal and
           opposite reaction.
                         
          Brendan looks toward the classroom door, where two red-and-
          white clad CHEERLEADERS are peering in, then walks over to
          KC, a blonde cheerleader seated in his class. She is working
          a Blackberry and doesn't notice him approaching.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           For example, if KC does not stop
           the action of sending texts in
           class...
                         
          Brendan stands directly in front of her desk. She quickly
          shoves the Blackberry under a stack of books.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           ...and tell her posse outside to
           beat it...
                         
          He turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the
          window.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           ...then my reaction might be to
           send her down to Principal Zito's
           office. Thus setting our world back
           in proper balance.
                         
                          KC
           Mr. C, I put it away.
                         
          The class busts on KC as Brendan walks back to his desk and
          sits on top of it. It's clear from the vibe in the room that
          he's a very popular teacher. Then the BELL rings.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Alright, before you go, I have your
           tests from last week.
                         
                         
          INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY
                         
          Fenroy sits at the front desk and looks at his computer.
          Watches "MMA LIVE" and another feature on the big upcoming
          Sparta tournament.
           12.
                         
                         
          Tommy, wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats, works a bag
          and eyeballs an ENTOURAGE that surrounds a ring. Inside, a
          heavily-muscled FIGHTER with a mohawk, MAD DOG GRIMES (30s),
          is putting a beating on his SPARRING PARTNER. The obsequious
          nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is
          somebody important.
                         
          In the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning
          back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get
          up. COLT BOYD (40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands
          as Mad Dog laughs.
                         
                          MAD DOG
           Where do you find these girls?
                         
          Colt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter.
          Glances at Mad Dog.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           We got a tournament coming up. You
           gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh?
                          (TO FENROY)
           Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call
           that Puerto Rican kid, the one that
           fights outa the Bottoms. If he's
           here in 20 minutes, he gets 200
           bucks.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yo, I'll fight him.
                         
          Colt turns around and looks at Tommy. As does Mad Dog, who
          smiles down at him from inside the ring.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Do me a favor guy, go back to your
           bag. We don't need anybody else
           getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk.
                         
          Tommy walks back to his bag. Mad Dog smiles. Looks at Tommy's
          outfit.
                         
                          MAD DOG
           Yo Rock, what happened? You leave
           Mick and Paulie at home today?
                         
          Tommy stops. Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches.
                         
                          FENROY

           Then go through the list. Get me
           Joe Bones.
                         
                          TOMMY
                          (TO COLT)
           All I'm saying is if you need
           somebody to help you, I'm happy to
           keep your boy warm for you.
                         
          Colt looks at Mad Dog. What do you think? The Mohawked
          fighter looks at Tommy. Shrugs. It's his funeral.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           You ever fought before?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yeah.
                         
          Colt studies Tommy. Sees he's serious. Gives in.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
                          (TO FENROY)
           This guy sign a waiver?
                         
                          FENROY
           All good.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           What's your name?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Tommy.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           You get tuned up in here, it's on
           you, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Sure, no problem.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Come on in.
                         
          Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring. Mad Dog's entourage
          starts whispering amongst themselves. Snickering at what lays
          in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped
          out of the ring.
                         
          A TRAINER tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some MMA gloves.
          He slips them on, then at the sound of a BUZZER he starts
          moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and
          then starts circling him. Tommy nails him with a front kick
          to the chest. Grimes staggers back and shakes it off.
           14.
                         
                         
                          MAD DOG
           Gonna be a hero? Alright.
                         
          He crouches down, gets serious. He throws a right. Blocked. A
          leg kick. Blocked. Tommy snaps his head with a jab. Then he
          does it again. And again. Then he DECKS HIM with a hard
          right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his
          entourage and Colt Boyd.
                         
          Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring.
          Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing
          and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls
          it down, and launches knee after knee into his face.
                         
          Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll,
          striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls
          out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action. As Colt
          Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against
          the ropes and blasts away.
                         
          Tommy continues to pound. It's a full-fledged beating going
          on in there. Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left
          hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, UNCONSCIOUS.
                         
          SILENCE in the gym. What the hell just happened here? The
          entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold. Colt
          Boyd looks on in disbelief as Tommy walks across the ring and
          approaches him.
                         
                          TOMMY
           You owe me two hundred bucks.
                         
                         
          INT. FIRST UNION BANK - DAY
                         
          Brendan sits in a chair across from loan officer DAN TAYLOR
          (40s). They're mid-meeting and going over documents.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           This is the new appraisal figure,
           and this is how it effects the
           monthly. As you can see, that puts
           you upside down on your mortgage.
           That's the problem. It's the
           country that did the assessment,
           not the bank. So, the numbers are
           what they are, Mr. Conlon.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Brendan.
           15.
                         
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           The numbers are what they are,
           Brendan. I mean, you're a Math
           teacher, you can appreciate that.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I teach Physics.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Physics. OK. But the bank has got
           to go by the new appraisal figures.
           According to these figures, you're
           upside down on your mortgage--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You said that three times already.
           I get that. But I'm asking you if
           there's something else you can do.
           Not the bank, you. Can you shift
           things around, restructure--
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Well, you've already refinanced
           twice.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Because you advised us to do that.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           I presented you with that option.
           It was your choice.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm also showing you netted a
           substantial payout with the refi.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           We had that conversation. I was
           paying medical bills. Is that in
           your file?
                         
          Taylor looks at Brendan. Takes him a second to remember.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Oh, right. Sorry. Your
           daughter's...kidney?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Heart.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Heart, right.
           (off stack of files on desk)
           Lot of stories.
           16.
                         
                         
          Brendan glares at him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           So my option is I've got no
           options? You're not even gonna try
           to help me?
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           I am trying, Brendan. Look, I can
           get you 90 days to get even--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           90 days is not enough. My wife and
           I have three jobs between us and
           that doesn't cut it. So, what do
           you suggest?
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Let me ask you a question: have you
           considered bankruptcy? It's a
           viable option. There's no shame in
           it these days.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's not how I do things.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Well, then you're looking at
           foreclosure.
                         
          Brendan gets up and storms out of the office.

          Paddy sits in front of the TV and watches an old VIDEO TAPE
          of a wrestling tournament. The bottom of the screen reads:
          1994 PA STATE WRESTLING FINALS. CONLON VS. SPEERY.

           ...the prodigy has yet to yield a

           Say what you will about the methods
           of the former Marine, but he's led
           his son to six straight junior
           Olympic titles, and now just
           moments away from a high school
           state championship. And there it
           is! Wow!

          As Paddy watches, the DOORBELL RINGS. He makes his way to the
          door as the tape continues to play.
                         
           ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
           Tommy told me that he's chasing the
           record of Theogenes, apparently a
           mythical Greek fighter said to be
           unbeaten in over 1400 bouts...
                         
          Paddy opens the door to find Colt Boyd standing on the stoop.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for
           Tommy Riordan.
                         
          Paddy registers the name "Riordan."
                         
                          PADDY
           Who?
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd.
                         
                          PADDY
           What business you got with Tommy?
           18.

           None yet. That's why I'm here. I
           manage fighters.
                         
          Colt looks at Paddy. Jams his hands in his pockets. He's
          obviously waiting for an invite inside. It doesn't come.
                         
           COLT BOYD (CONT'D)
           Tommy's been working out at my gym.
           He put a beating on the number one
           middleweight contender in the world
           today. I want to know more about
           the guy. Maybe help him out. I have
           a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.
                         
                          PADDY
           Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything
           you want to know about Tommy, you
           gotta ask him yourself.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           I'm just looking for some general
           information here.
                         
                          PADDY
           Like I said, anything you want to

           yourself.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Look, I don't mean to interrupt
           your night. He put this address
           down when he signed up at the gym.
                         
                          PADDY
           He doesn't live here.

           Please welcome "Irish" Brendan
           Conlon!
                         
                         A
                         
          Lo and behold, there's a shirtless Brendan standing in the
          corner of the ring wearing a pair of shorts. On his right
          shoulder, an elaborate TATTOO of the CONLON FAMILY CREST.
                         
                          ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
           This bout is scheduled for three
           five-minute rounds, and when the
           action begins your referee is Mr.
           Rick Fike.
                         
          The REFEREE enters the ring and stands between Brendan and
          Mike Moore.
           20.
                         
                         
                          REFEREE
           Fighters to the center! I want you
           to obey my commands at all times.
           If you have no questions, touch
           gloves, back up, and wait for my
           signal. Come out fighting!
                         
          Brendan reaches out to touch gloves with Mike Moore, but his
          opponent snubs him and storms back to his corner. He means
          business. Brendan, looking less sure of himself, retreats to
          his corner.
                         
                          REFEREE (CONT'D)
           Fighters, are you ready? Let's go!
                         
          The bikers raise hell as the BELL sounds. Moore comes out
          bombing. Brendan dodges a couple of wild haymakers, then gets
          caught in the side of the head with a right hand. He stumbles
          back into the ropes and Moore presses into him, swatting at
          him with his huge hands.
                         
          Brendan absorbs the blows, ducks down, grabs Moore by the
          legs, lifts him, and dumps him on the mat with a resounding
          THUD. Obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching
          skills, Brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts
          raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face
          and body.
                         
          It's a full on ass-whooping going on in there until finally,
          mercifully, the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture
          of CHEERS from the crowd and BOOS from the bikers.
                         
          A winded Brendan walks to his corner, touches the side of his
          head, wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts, and climbs
          out of the ring, where a PROMOTER approaches.
                         
                          PROMOTER
           Nice fight. Two more wins and you
           take home the bacon.
                         
                         
          INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The bedroom door opens and Brendan creeps through the room
          and into the bathroom.
                         
                         
          INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - BATHROOM - SAME
                         
          It's dark, except for the moonlight glowing through the
          window. An exhausted Brendan takes off his shirt and begins
          washing his badly SWOLLEN FACE. Then the door opens, and Tess
          shuffles in.
           21.
                         
                         
                          TESS
                          (SLEEPY)
           Hey babe. How was work?
                         
          Brendan doesn't answer. Tess slowly wakes up. As she does,
          she gets a look at his face.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           Oh my God. What happened? You said
           it was going to be a slow night.
                         
          Tess studies his face. Brendan looks at her. Reaches into his
          pocket and hands her $500 in cash.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm not bouncing at a club.
                         
                          TESS
           What do you mean you're not
           bouncing?
                         
          She looks at him. Looks at the money. Puts it together.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           You've been lying to me?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I went in to apply. They were only
           paying nine bucks an hour. Then I
           saw a sign for this other thing.
                         
          Tess can't believe what she's hearing.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           They're putting us out of the house
           in three months, we're running out
                          OF OPTIONS--
                         
                          TESS
                          (FURIOUS)
           Then they'll put us out of the
           house in three months. I'd rather
           go back to the old apartment than
           see you in the back of an ambulance
           again.
                          (BEAT)
           I thought we agreed that we weren't
           going to raise our children in
           a family where their father gets
           beat up for a living.
           22.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           We're not giving up the house. This
           is our home. We're not going
                          BACKWARDS
                         
          Tess reaches up and touches his battered face. Calms herself
          down. Embraces her husband.
                         
                          TESS
           We'll figure it out. But this is
           what we're not going back to.
                         
                         
          EXT. TRACKSIDE DINER - MORNING
                         
          A steady rain tumbles down over an old-school diner in the
          shadow of the railroad tracks.
                         
                         
          INT. DINER - SAME
                         
          Paddy sits in a booth and takes a sip of coffee. Judging by
          the spent sugar packets and the half-eaten club sandwich,
          he's been there a while.
                         
          The front door swings open and Tommy enters wearing his watch
          cap and sweats. He makes his way over to the booth and plops
          himself down. It's clear something's on his mind but he
          doesn't say anything. Finally, Paddy engages him.
                         
                          PADDY
           You wanted to talk?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yeah.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm gonna start fighting.
                         
                          PADDY
           That right?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Don't play babe in the woods with
           me. I know that guy from the gym
           came to see you.
                         
                          PADDY
           Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him
           anything, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           We wouldn't be sitting here now if
           you did.
           23.
                         
                         
          Tommy grabs a fry off Paddy's plate.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Alright. Look. There's this
           tournament. A big tournament. Top
           sixteen middleweights in the world.
           Single elimination. Winner take all
           for a lot of money. I'm gonna do
           that. But if I'm doin' it, then I'm
           gonna need a trainer. Now that much
           you were good at.
           (off Paddy grinning)
           No, no, no. This doesn't mean
           anything.
                         
          Paddy tries to tether it down, but he's happy. Tommy looks at
          him sternly.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           I'm serious. We train. That's it. I
           don't wanna hear a word about
           anything but training, you
           understand? You wanna tell your war
           stories, you can take `em down to
           the VFW. You can take `em to a
           meeting, or church, or wherever the
           hell it is you go nowadays.
                         
                          PADDY
           What about Colt Boyd?
                         
                          TOMMY
           What about him? I told him I don't
           train with people I don't know.
                         
                          PADDY
           Ah, the devil you know.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Excuse me?
                         
                          PADDY
           The devil you know is better than
           the devil you don't.
                         
          Tommy looks at him. Grins for the first time.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Chasing Theogenes. It'll be kinda
           like old times.
           24.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
                          (ANGRY)
           I just told you, this doesn't mean
           anything. You get that through your
           skull right now or I'm walking.
                         
          Paddy calmly sips his coffee, then leans in on Tommy with a
          stern look. The old lion's got a few teeth left.
                         
                          PADDY
           Alright. Alright. But you get
           something through your skull, too.
           You called me. So don't go
           threatening to walk every five
           minutes. And since this is about
           training, you dump whatever it is
           you need to dump as far as those
           pills are concerned. I don't want
           to see `em.
                         
          Tommy gives him a hard look, but the old man doesn't shy
          away.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           In fact, hand `em over right now.
                          (BEAT)
           I know they're on you, Tommy. You
           sounded like a goddamn maraca
           coming through the door.
                         
          Tommy considers, then reaches into his pocket and slides two
          bottles across the table.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           That's not gonna do.
                          (SHAKING BOTTLES)
           When you came through that door it
           was chhh-chhh-chhh.
           (holding up 3 fingers)
           Three.
                         
          Tommy looks at him. Fishes another bottle out of his pocket
          and flips it on the table.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           (off French fries)
           And another thing, you don't eat
           crap like this. This is for losers
           and old men.
                          (BEAT)
           And we're gonna have to bunk up. If
           we're gonna do this right, you
           gotta stay at the house.
                          (MORE)
           25.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           I watch your diet, we follow the
           old regimen. You copy?
                         
          The two men stare at each other. Tommy looks furious, but he
          doesn't get up. A silent, tenuous agreement is reached.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Copy.
                         
                         
          INT. CENTRAL HIGH HALLWAY - MORNING
                         
          Brendan, his face BRUISED badly from the night before, walks
          down the hallway toward his classroom. STUDENTS watch him as
          he passes and whisper.
                         
                         
          INT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - SAME
                         
          The class is filled with the kind of BUZZING that can only
          rise off a major rumor. Tito, Nash, KC, and Stephon discuss.
                         
                          TITO
           My brother said he was at the strip
           club and saw Mr. C fighting MMA---
                         
                          NASH
           What's MMA?
                         
                          STEPHON
           Mixed Martial Arts. Like, different
           styles of fighting.
                         
                          KC
           Your brother's a liar.
                         
          Brendan enters the room. The kids look at him. Holy shit.
          It's true.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Take your seats.
                         
          Brendan puts his bag down on his desk and faces the class. He
          is not amused by the murmuring in there.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Now, please.
                         
          The kids pipe down. Then Tito speaks up.

           Yo, Mr. C. My brother was at the
           titty bar last night and said you
           was choking brothers out. What's
           up? Is it true?
                         
                          STEPHON
           Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really
           work on some fools or something?
                         
                          KC
           You have to tell us.
                         
          Before Brendan can answer, he sees PRINCIPAL JOE ZITO (50s)
          gesturing to him through the window of the classroom. Zito
          taps his watch and points. Come see me after class.
                         
                         
          INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S OFFICE - LATER
                         
          Zito, puffy faced, hair getting thinner by the hour, hangs up
          his phone as Brendan pokes his head in. Zito waves him in.
          Eyeballs the marks on his face.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Are you being literal or
           figurative? Because literally it
           looks bad. And figuratively it
           looks even worse. The
           superintendent's coming by in a few
           minutes. So gimme a little help
           here, Brendan. Can you explain to
           me what the hell you were doing?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I need the money, Joe.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Yeah, but we can't have this. This
           isn't moonlighting at Applebee's
           for Christ's sake.
                         
          Zito stands up and runs his hands across his head.
                         
           JOE ZITO (CONT'D)
           Shit, Brendan. Leaving everything
           else aside, which we can't, are you
           out of your mind? You're gonna get
           yourself killed. I mean, you're a
           goddamn teacher.

           You've got no business in the ring
           with those animals.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Actually, I used to be one of those
           animals.
                         
          Zito looks at Brendan. Puzzled.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I fought for a living.
                          (BEAT)
           Guess I forgot to put that down on
           my application.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Yeah, I guess you did.
                         
          Zito sits back down.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just--
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Listen, the school district's not
           going to tolerate school teachers
           cockfighting in strip clubs.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It was the parking lot of a strip
           club.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Wherever it was, you can't be doing
           it, alright? I mean this is a
           serious--shit, he's here.
                         
          Zito sees the SUPERINTENDENT enter the foyer outside his
          office. He's looking none too pleased.
                         
           JOE ZITO (CONT'D)
           This is a serious problem.

                          BRENDAN
           What are we gonna do?
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           You say yes, sir. And you say no,
           sir. And you say it'll never happen
           again, sir. And then we just pray
           to God he's in a good mood.

          Brendan and Joe stand up. Zito can't tether down a slight
          grin.

          INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - KID'S PLAYROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Brendan sits in a miniature playroom off the kid's bedroom,
          putting glue on the leg of a TOY PIANO. Tess enters the
          bedroom, where the girls sleep, and leans into the playroom.
          They speak in whispers.
                         
                          TESS
           What are you doing?
                         
                          BRENDAN
                          (OFF PIANO)
           The girls have an important piano
           recital in the morning. Got an
           equipment malfunction.
                          (BEAT)
           How'd it go?
                         
                          TESS
           They're gonna review your case at
           the end of the semester, but until
           then you're suspended without pay.
           Joe gave me the number of his
           attorney.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           How the hell are we gonna pay for
           an attorney?
                         
          Tess crouches down and enters the tiny room. She sits on the
          floor.
                         
                          TESS
           He talked to me for free. As a
           favor to Joe.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That was nice.

                          TESS
           He said there's no precedent for
           this. You'll be back by next
           semester.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Next semester?
                         
          Tess sighs. They sit in silence. There are no easy solutions.
          Finally, Brendan speaks up.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Look, Tess. They have these smoker
           fights all over. There's one in
           Lancaster next week. There's two in
           Dover the week after. Wilmington.
           Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us
           afloat.
                         
                          TESS
           You're gonna put yourself through
           this over and over, for five
           hundred bucks a pop?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Some of them pay a little more than
           that.
                          (BEAT)
           I would have had to bounce for a

           hours last night.
                         
          Brendan looks at his wife.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           And these guys, they're not real
           fighters. They're just guys who
           have seen too much UFC on TV. If
           you have a better solution, I'm all
           ears.
                         
          Tess sits quietly. Knows they have limited options.
                         
                          TESS
           What are we gonna tell the girls?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It'll be fine. I'll just leave the
           house as usual, except now I'll be
           going to the gym.
                         
          They look at each other. No choice. This is the plan.

          Paddy climbs the stairs with a POSTER BOARD tucked under his
          arm and a cup of coffee in his hands. He enters Tommy's room,
          which is also a monument to the past. Old wrestling TROPHIES,
          Steelers' posters, and an EMPTY SECOND BED that obviously
          once belonged to Brendan.

           doodle-doo.
                         
          Paddy places the cup of coffee on the night stand as Tommy
          stirs, then sits on the empty bed and unrolls the poster.
          It's yellowed with age and covered with a boy's handwriting.

           can fill me in on how close you got
           to that record.
                         
          Tommy says nothing. Not a nostalgic bone in his body. The
          dreams on that poster are long gone.

           Yeah, I'll tell ya something. You
           can take that thing back to where
           you found it. And you can leave the
           coffee in the pot. I can pour that
           myself. I can wake myself up, too.
                         
          Paddy's stung but covers it amiably.

           AV, I need to see the tape!
                         
                          AV
           What tape?
                         
                          BRADFORD
           The tape.
                         
          AV drops his cards, rushes to his bunk, pulls out a steel
          container loaded with VIDEOTAPES and sifts through it. They
          are labeled by day and month. AV finds what he's looking for,
          loads it into the camera, and hits PLAY.
                         
                         
          ON VIDEO SCREEN: A CHAOTIC FIRE FIGHT IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT.
          MUZZLE FLASHES. TRACER LIGHTS. MAYHEM. THE CAMERA FOCUSES ON
          A FLIPPED TANK, HALF OF IT SUBMERGED IN WATER. A MARINE, HEAD
          SHAVED BUT ALMOST CERTAINLY TOMMY, SUDDENLY APPEARS AND
          CLIMBS ON TOP OF THE TANK, REACHING FOR THE HATCH.
                         
                          BRADFORD
           Freeze.
                         
          AV holds the "Pause" button down as Bradford looks at the
          screen in disbelief. It's definitely Tommy.
                         
                          BRADFORD (CONT'D)
           That's him. That's him.
                         
                         
          INT. CAMPANA FIGHTING SYSTEM - DAY
                         
          In a top MMA gym, FRANK CAMPANA (40s) works in a ring with
          Brazilian superstar MARCO SANTOS (20s) and other FIGHTERS.
          The sound of CLASSICAL MUSIC fills the air.
                         
                          FRANK
           Let the music sink in to you. This
           is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe.
                         
          As Frank teaches, Brendan walks in the door. The great
          trainer notices him and walks over.
           33.
                         
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Do I know you? I think I know you.
                         
          They embrace warmly.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Long time, brother.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Liking the place, Frank.
                         
                          FRANK
           Thank you, brother.
           (off Brazilian fighter)
           You see this beast? Marco Santos?
           I'm training him for Sparta.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Amazing, man.
                         
                          FRANK
           Come on back.
                         
          The two head for the offices at the back of the gym.
                         
                         
          INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They walk into an office filled with PHOTOS of Frank in his
          fighting days. He was obviously somebody. The walls are also
          adorned with SPARTA posters. Frank reaches into a mini-
          fridge, pulling out a couple bottles of Vitamin water. He
          hands one to Brendan and motions for him to sit down.
                         
                          FRANK
           You look good, brother. How're the
           girls?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Good. Good. I had another little
           one. Rosie.
                         
                          FRANK
           I know. Johnny C. told me she was
           in the hospital for a bit. I was
           gonna call, but then time went by.
           I don't know. I'm a piece of shit.
           I should have called.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's alright.
                         
                          FRANK
           No, Brendan. I'm sorry.
           34.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's all good. She's good now.
                         
          Frank looks at his old friend. Smiles warmly.
                         
                          FRANK
           It's great to see you, man. So
           everything's going good?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Yeah. Well, I've got a little
           problem. The guys at the bank want
           to take my house away. That's kind
           of why I came to see you, actually.
                         
          Frank considers what he's hearing.
                         
                          FRANK
           I've got most of my dough tied up
           in this joint, but how much do you
           need?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I didn't come here for a loan,
           Frank.
                          (BEAT)
           I was hoping you'd train me.
                         
                          FRANK
           Train you for what?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I want to get back in the cage.
                         
          Frank starts smiling. Leans back in his seat. Then he sees
          Brendan is not smiling with him.
                         
                          FRANK
           You're serious?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I just won an event the other
           night.
                         
                          FRANK
           Ah, you won an event.
           (off bruised face)
           That's what this is. Let me guess,
           it was in a parking lot. DJ from
           the local radio station. Couple of
           ring card girls you wouldn't bang
           on a dare. Am I right?
                         
          Brendan smiles.
           35.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Ish.
                         
                          FRANK
           Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But
           why would I train you? When you
           were in shape and on the right side
           of 30 you were barely a .500
           fighter. You never listened to me.
           You never listened to anyone. These
           guys are animals. I mean, you're a
           teacher, right? What're you gonna
           do? You're gonna come down here for
           a couple days a week after
           detention? You're gonna skip out of
           the girl's volleyball game early?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I've got loads of time. Time's not
           an issue. The parking lot thing
           kinda got me suspended. I need to
           keep working the smokers.
                         
                          FRANK
           Tess know about this?
           (off Brendan's nod)
           Yeah? `Cause the last time you
           fought, I got read the riot act
           sitting in a hospital waiting room.
           You remember that?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           No. I was unconscious.
                         
          The two friends share a laugh.
                         
                          FRANK
           She's not gonna come down here with
           the two puppies, screaming at
           Frank?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's not gonna happen. Come on.
           Whattya say, Frank?
                         
                          FRANK
           What do I say? What am I gonna say
           to you? No? I mean, all my time is
           wrapped up with Marco. You come
           down, I'll throw you in the
           rotation, you spar with these guys,
           no problem. But I can't promise you
           much more than that, Brendan.
           36.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's all I need.
                         
          Brendan stands up. Shakes Frank's hand.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I appreciate it.
                         
                          FRANK
           Let me know when you're coming
           down.
                         
                          BRENDAN
                          (WALKING AWAY)
           Well, I'm just gonna go get my
           stuff from the car.
                         
                          FRANK
           Now?
                         
          Brendan puts his dukes up and smiles as Frank shakes his
          head.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Brendan pulls into the driveway of his modest home, gets out
          of his Camry, and looks to the street, where Paddy stands
          outside his Olds, leaning on the passenger door.
                         
          Brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes. He's
          clearly not happy to see Paddy, who stands there,
          uncomfortable and heavy hearted in the light of the street
          lamp.
                         
                          PADDY
           Hey, Brendan. It's me, Pop.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           What're you doing here?
                         
                          PADDY
           I have some news for you.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Something wrong with your hands?
                         
          Paddy shakes his head, unsure what he means.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           If there's nothing wrong with your
           hands then there's no reason for
           you not to phone. That's the deal.
           37.
                         
                         
                          PADDY
           Yeah, I forgot--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.
                         
          Paddy holds his hands out, palms down.
                         
                          PADDY
           Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my
           hands so steady? Have you?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm going inside.
                         
                          PADDY
           I've got a thousand days. A
           thousand days sober today.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Well, that's great, Pop. But it
           doesn't change anything.
                         
                          PADDY
           What do you mean it doesn't change
           anything? Have a heart, Brendan.
                         
          Paddy's words set Brendan off. A side of him we haven't seen
          before emerges. He approaches his father fiercely.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You listen to me. You take your
           have-a-heart bullshit and you run
           it down the road. Run it out on
           someone who doesn't know you like I
           do.
                         
                          PADDY
           C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we
           could break bread. Open some lines
           of communication.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You got two lines of communication,
           the telephone and the post office.
           Just because you decide it's a
           special day, it doesn't make it one
           for me. I got a wife and kids
           inside and they're waiting for me,
           so I don't have time for whatever
           this is.
           38.
                         
                         
                          PADDY
           I know you got a wife and kids in
           there. I got a grand-daughter I
           haven't seen in three years and
           another I haven't even ever met.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do
           you remember having anything to do
           with that?
                         
          Paddy nods. Casts his eyes down in shame.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           That shit you pulled. Never again.
           And all the shit I saw growing up?
           That doesn't happen here.
                         
          Brendan looks at the reformed Paddy, a measure of sympathy on
          his face. Then he heads for the house.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Take care of yourself.
                         
          As he's halfway through the yard, Paddy calls out.
                         
                          PADDY
           Tommy's back.
                         
          Brendan stops in his tracks. He turns and looks at his Dad.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           He's in the `Burgh.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Tommy's in Pittsburgh?
                         
                          PADDY
           He came to see me.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           He came to see you?
                         
                          PADDY
           He's over at the house. We're doing
           a little training at Fitzy's.
           Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's
           anymore.
                         
          Brendan walks closer. Incredulous.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You and Tommy are training
           together?
           39.
                         
                         
          Paddy nods.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Tommy Conlon.
                         
                          PADDY
           Riordan. He's using your mother's
           maiden name now.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I know what her name is.
                         
                          PADDY
           I thought you'd want to know he's
           back. That's why I drove all the
           way over here.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I thought you came to break bread
           over a thousand days?
                         
                          PADDY
           That too.
                         
          Brendan looks at him. Considers.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Did he say if he wants to see me?
                         
                          PADDY
           He doesn't say much. He's just not
           that happy kid he was.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Wow, look at you. Mister inside
           man.
                         
          Paddy frowns.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           You and Tommy training together
           like nothing ever happened. This is
           unbelievable. Now I know what
           you're really doing here.
                         
                          PADDY
           What's that?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You came to gloat.
                         
                          PADDY
           I did not come to gloat. I came to
           get my son back.
           40.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Well, there you go. You got your
           son back.
                         
                          PADDY
           I'm talking about you, Bren--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You got your son back.
                         
          Brendan starts to walk away, then turns around again.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           You know, part of the reason I
           stuck around was `cause I thought
           I'd finally get you all to myself.
           But you didn't have any interest in
           training me. Tommy was the one.
                         
                          PADDY
           Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean,
           you know. I'm sorry.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Forget it. You were always a front
           runner. You never had any interest
           in underdogs. But I was your son.
                         
                          PADDY
           You are my son.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Am I?
                         
                          PADDY
           Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you
           to find just a little space in your
           heart to forgive me.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I
           do not trust you. Tell Tommy this
           is where I am if he wants to see
           me.
                         
                          PADDY
           Alright. But they're not different
           things. You've gotta trust to
                          FORGIVE--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Goodnight, Pop.
           41.
                         
                         
          Paddy looks toward the house, where Emily, Rosie, and Tess
          stand at the door. Paddy waves.
                         
                          PADDY
           My God, is that Emily? Boy, she's
           grown, Brendan. Is that Rosie?
                         
          Brendan keeps walking. Opens his door to step inside.
                         
                          ROSIE
           Daddy, who is that?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Just some nice old man.
                         
          Brendan closes the door, leaving the heartbroken Paddy alone
          in the yard.

           Huge news breaking here at ESPN.
           Koba is coming to America and will
           fight at Sparta. Universally
           considered to be the greatest pound
           for pound fighter that ever lived,
           the mighty, mythical Russian has
           never fought on U.S. soil in his
           legendary career...
                         
          Mad Dog Grimes trains furiously under the watchful eye of
          Colt Boyd. When Colt sees Tommy approaching, he turns his
          attention away from Mad Dog.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Tommy? Got some news for ya. I got
           you into Sparta. Took some doing,
           but I made it happen..
           (off no reaction from Tommy)
           Thank you and 10 percent is
           customary.

          Tommy heads up the stairs toward the locker room without
          acknowledging Colt, though he does allow a small smile to
          crease his lips.

          and begins dumping change into an old pay phone on the wall.

          but tired Mexican girl, watches a grainy TV with a six-year-
          old BOY and a four-year-old GIRL as the phone RINGS. The
          table it sits on has a FRAMED PICTURE of Tommy and another
          MARINE on it, their arms around each other in the Iraqi
          desert.

           OK. You know me, Tommy.
                          (BEAT)
           I was getting really worried about
           you.
                         
                          TOMMY

           every day.

           You know, Pilar, I haven't
           forgotten for one minute what I
           promised you. What I promised
           Manny. I've got an opportunity
           coming up to help you guys out. To
           take care of you guys.
                         
                          PILAR
           Whatever you can do, Tommy. I know
           Manny would really appreciate it.
           You worry too much. It's OK. We're
           hanging in there.

           JON ANIK (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)
           J.J., we've never seen this kind of
           Grand Prix tournament in the
           country before. Tell us, why the
           unique format?
                         
           J.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN)
           Well, Jon, you know as well as
           anyone that in Mixed Martial Arts,
           anyone can beat anyone on a given
           night...

          Brendan takes steady blows from an OPPONENT in another
          smoker, then turns the tables, slams his man down, and chokes
          him out. His skills are improving.
                         
           J.J. RILEY (V.O.)
           ...but with this type of format,

          In an expansive and grim scrap yard along the river bank,
          Tommy somehow manages to lift and flip old long-haul rig
          tires. They're roughly the size of hot tubs. His strength is

          Tommy runs across the bridge as Paddy follows behind in the

          ON TV SCREEN: JON ANIK AND FIGHTER/ANALYST RASHAD EVANS
          DISCUSS KOBA.
                         
           JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)
           Only five weeks left `til Sparta
           and the hype continues for the War
           on the Shore. Fourth of July
           weekend in Atlantic City and you
           know what that means: the great
           Koba, bringing his act stateside.
           Let me ask you about the other
           guys. What are they thinking
           entering a winner take all
           tournament against a guy that
           seemingly can't be beat?
                         
           RASHOD EVANS (ON SCREEN)
           They're thinking five million
           dollars, and five million dollars
           is a lot of money, but they've
           gotta remember one thing: they're
           going against Koba. Mission
           impossible. Game over. Go home.
                         
          Tess comes back down the stairs and looks at the screen,
          concern on her face.
                         
          ON TV SCREEN: THE MIGHTY KOBA TATTOOS AN OPPONENT WITH A
          VICIOUS STRIKE TO THE HEAD. THE FIGHTER FALLS FLAT ON HIS
          BACK AND IS FINISHED OFF IN NO TIME. BRUTAL. "FROM RUSSIA

          Frank lets himself into the gym at the crack of dawn. Finds
          Brendan already there, training alone with ferocity and
          listening to classical music.

           JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)
           The `Pittsburgh Beatdown' has
           become one of the most watched
           videos on YouTube this year. Now
           joining us via satellite is the
           victim of the infamous incident,
           Mad Dog Grimes. Mad Dog, what is
           your response to all the hoopla
           surrounding the video and Tommy
           Riordan?
                         
           MAD DOG (ON SCREEN)
           This guy's a nobody. It was just a
           sparring session. It is what it is,
           and he's gonna pay for it next
           month in Atlantic City.

          Tommy and Mad Dog work out, each jumping rope at blinding
          speed. They eyeball each other, the hate increasing.

           FRANK (V.O.)
           You've gotta relax and stay calm in
           there. The cage is your home. You
           set the pace.

          Brendan and Marco grapple. They're evenly matched. Frank
          looks on, impressed by Brendan.
                         
           FRANK (V.O.)
           You set the rhythm. Feel the
           Beethoven. Be smarter than him.
           More patient. Wait for him to make
           a mistake. And when he does, that's
           your moment.
                         
          Brendan turns Marco and gets him in a knee bar. Marco has
          nowhere to go and is forced to TAP. Frank jumps in the ring,
          all smiles, and slaps Brendan on the chest.
                         
                          FRANK
           No he did not tap you! Physics
           teacher! That's the best in the
           world there, son.

          A sorely dejected Frank walks through an underground parking
          garage with Brendan.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite?
                         
                          FRANK
           Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta
           call the boys and break the news.
           I'll call you tomorrow.
                         
          Frank heads off through the lot. Brendan reaches his car,
          stops, considers. Calls out to Frank while jogging toward
          him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a
           great time. And it's too bad about
           Marco. But what about me?
                         
          Brendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he
          begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco.
                         
                          FRANK
           You talking about Sparta? Brendan,
           please. You got a better chance of
           starting a boy band. I'll talk to
           you tomorrow.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's a grand prix tournament. Which
           means anything can happen. You know
           that as well as I do.
                         
          Frank looks at him. Sees how serious Brendan is.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           They'll have to kill me to get me
           out of that cage.
                         
                          FRANK
           That's what I'm afraid of.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Frank, I need this. You're real
           tight with those guys. You call
           them, they'll listen to you.
           49.
                         
                         
                          FRANK
           You realize what you're asking me
           to do here, Brendan? We go down to
           AC and you get tapped out in five
           seconds, how does that benefit
           either one of us?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's not gonna happen.
                         
                          FRANK
           Not gonna happen. Wish I had a
           nickel for every time I heard that.

                          (SMILING)
           It's not gonna happen.
                         
          Frank breaks. Smiles. How can he say no?
                         
                          FRANK
           I'll make a call.
                         
          Brendan grins and walks back toward his car.
                         
                          BRENDAN

          Brendan pulls a garbage bin down to the curb as Tess walks
          out of the house talking on a cordless PHONE.
                         
           TESS (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, the girls are good. They're
           good. Yeah, you should. You've been
           spending so much time with Brendan
           these days it's like you're part of
           the family or something. Yeah, he's
           right here.
           (handing phone to Brendan)
           It's your boyfriend.
                         
           BRENDAN (INTO PHONE)
           Hey Frank.
                          (BEAT)
           That's unbelievable. I can't thank
           you enough. I don't know what to
           say. Alright, listen, I've gotta
           call you back. Alright, bye.
                         
          Brendan hangs up the phone. Looks at Tess.
           50.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I'm in. I'm going.
                         
          A look of serious concern crosses Tess's face. She puts her
          hands on her hips.
                         
                          TESS
           Really? So that's your decision?
           You decided? `Cause I really
           enjoyed that conversation we just
           had about making that decision
           together.
                         
          Brendan doesn't say anything. Knows she's right. And that
          he's about to get laid into.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           You told me you were gonna fight
           guys that watched too much UFC. I
           saw that Koba dude on TV, and he's
           the guy they're watching.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's a lot of money, Tess.
                         
                          TESS
           I don't give a shit about the
           money, Brendan. I told you that.
           We're gonna end up cashing in your
           life insurance policy before we
           pick up that prize money.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You don't think I can do it.
                         
                          TESS
           I think you can get killed.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm not gonna get killed.
                         
                          TESS
           Fine, you're not going to get
           killed. But can you promise me
           you're not going to get hurt?
           You're not gonna end up in the
           hospital? You're not gonna end up
           paralyzed? We'll have no prize
           money. No house. Payments for
                          HOSPITAL BILLS--

                          BRENDAN
           Tess, I can promise you this: if I
           don't try, they're gonna take the
           house. How's that for a promise?
                         
          No response from Tess, who has tears in her eyes.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd
           really love it if you'd be with me
           on this.
                         
          Tess looks at her husband. Wants to support him, but can't.
                         
                          TESS
           I'm not gonna watch you fight
           again. I'm not.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.
                         
          Tess starts walking back toward the house. She marches up the
          lawn without turning back, leaving Brendan, alone, in front
          of his house. He looks at the toys strewn across the yard.
          Surveys the neighborhood. He's going to Sparta.

          EXT. ATLANTIC CITY - DAY
                         
          Sunlight pours down on the crowded beaches, hotels, and
          boardwalks of AC. Thousands of PEOPLE jam the outside of the
          majestic Boardwalk Hall. It seems as if everyone on earth is
          in town.

          BILLBOARDS heralding the arrival of the SPARTA tournament are
          everywhere. Ceremonial Fourth of July banners hang, cars jam
          Ocean Avenue, early FIREWORKS pop. The buzz is electric. The
          greatest show on earth has hit the shore.

          EXT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
                         
          LIMOUSINES pull up in front of the Boardwalk Hall rotunda as
          "Mad Dog" Grimes, Orlando "Midnight" Le, Karl "The Dane"
          Kruller, and other fighters make their way down a long red
          carpet swarming with FANS.
                         
          In the middle of it all is J.J. Riley, greeting press and
          guests and running the show as the Tapout crew, Colt Boyd,
          and others mill about and talk shop. Announcers BRYAN CALLEN
          (40s) and SAM SHERIDAN (30s) corral J.J. for an interview.

           J.J., you've made a fortune with
           your hedge funds, yet you turned
           your back on Wall Street and
           dedicated your life to making
           Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this
           tournament so important to you?
                         
           J.J. RILEY
           Growing up, we all wanted to know
           who the toughest kid in the
           neighborhood was, right? I wanna
           know who the toughest man on the
           planet is. That's why I put this
           together, that's what all these
           people are here to see, and come
           Saturday night, that's what we're
           gonna find out.
                         
                          SHERIDAN
           Thank you, J.J. And here's
           something fans never thought they'd
           see: Koba is here! The legend
           arriving to fight on U.S. soil for
           the very first time...
                         
          The great and mighty KOBA emerges from a white stretch limo,
          trailed by his ENTOURAGE of tough-looking RUSSIANS.
          FLASHBULBS pop. REPORTERS swarm. It looks like a movie
          premiere out there and Koba's the star.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDWALK HALL LOBBY - SAME
                         
          As WORKERS set up for the press conference and camera crews
          stake out their territory, Tommy and Paddy hug the corner of
          the room and wait. Not in their element at all. Moments
          later, Brendan comes walking through the doors.
                         
          As he moves through the crowded room, Brendan and Tommy make
          eye contact.
           53.
                         
                         
          They haven't seen each other in 14 years, and judging by the
          looks on their faces they certainly didn't expect to see each
          other today. Paddy is just as shocked.
                         
          Brendan begins to inch toward Tommy, but is intercepted by
          Frank, who was caught up in the media storm outside.
                         
                          FRANK
           Hey. Where'd you go? You can't
           leave me like that. They wanna talk
           to you, not me.
                         
          Brendan looks past Frank. Tommy has risen and headed toward
          the exit, trailed by Paddy, who calls after him.

          The sun descends over the boardwalks and hotels of Atlantic
          City, and sinks into the sea.
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME
                         
          Paddy sits on a couch thumbing through a Sparta program and
          looks proudly at a PICTURE of Brendan. He listen to "Moby
          Dick" on his headphones as a TV plays in the foreground.

           Amtrack was upside down. Water was
           coming in from everywhere. The
           water pressure was too much. We
           couldn't get the back hatch open.

           We were all drowning, man. It was a
           death trap.
                         
          Tommy walks into the room from the door of an adjoining suite
          and stares at the TV.
                         
           BRADFORD (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)
           I couldn't have had more than
           another minute. Suddenly the back
           ramp gets ripped off, and there he
           was. Before I could get out and
           thank him, he was gone. He just
           vanished like a ghost.
                         
          Paddy is dumbfounded and looks at Tommy, who glances at him
          and back at the TV before heading toward the door.
                         
                          TOMMY

          EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
                         
          Brendan walks on the beach as the waves of the Atlantic Ocean
          lap at the shoreline. Boats bob on the water. Stray bottle
          rockets trace through the night sky.
                         
          In the distance, the NEON LIGHTS of an amusement park flash
          and zip. Behind Brendan, the big casinos loom, advertisements
          for Sparta filling their BILLBOARDS.
                         
          Brendan continues walking, then spots Tommy coming toward
          him. The brothers make eye contact. Stop. Then approach each
          other warily.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Been looking all over for you.
           How's it going?
                         
                          TOMMY
           It's going.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I was thinking maybe we could grab
           a coffee.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I don't drink coffee. Whattya want?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You don't want to go sit down
           somewhere?
                         
                          TOMMY
           I'm good right here.
           56.
                         
                         
          Brendan looks at Tommy. Sees how rigid he is. A long silence.
          Finally Brendan cuts right to it.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to
           know I was never gonna see you guys
           again?
                         
                          TOMMY
           You were briefed. You had the
           information. You chose the old man
           and the girl.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           She wasn't some girl. I married
           her. She's my wife.
                         
          Brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent
          Christmas PHOTO of Tess, Emily, and Rosie from his wallet.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           (handing Tommy the picture)
           That's Tess. And that's Emily and
           Rosie. They're your nieces, Tommy.
                         
          Tommy glances at the photo impasssively and hands it back.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Don't know `em.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I know you don't know them. Of
           course you don't know them.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Why am I looking at pictures of
           people I don't know?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Because that's my family.
                         
                          TOMMY
           And who are you exactly?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm your brother, man.
                         
                          TOMMY
           You were in the Corps?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           What?
           57.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
           I said I didn't know you were in
           the Corps.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I wasn't in the Corps.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Then you ain't no brother to me. My
           brother was in the Corps.
                         
          With that, Tommy walks briskly away from Brendan and up the
          beach. His brother runs after him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old
           kid. What the hell did I know?
                         
                          TOMMY
           I don't know what you know. Why
           don't you go ask your girlfriend
           about it?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it?
           I stay with Tess and I never get to
           see you guys again? Not a single
           phone call? Nothing?
                         
          No response from Tommy. He's a wall.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           God, man, I don't understand this.
           You won't forgive me, but you'll
           forgive Pop?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Shit. He's just some old vet I
           train with. He means nothing to me.
           From what I hear he means nothing
           to you, either, so you got balls
           talking about forgiveness.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's got nothing to do with
           forgiveness. I've got a family to
           protect. Everything I do is for
           them.
                         
          Tommy smirks. Walks away again.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           But I forgave Pop. Just like I
           forgave you and Mom.
           58.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
                          (TURNING AROUND)
           You forgave us?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Yeah.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I'm not surprised you made the
           tournament, Brendan. You got some
           stones.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I fell in love, Tommy. What the
           hell was I supposed to do?
                         
                          TOMMY
           You were supposed to stick to the
           plan. You were supposed to come
           with us. Mom needed you. I needed
           you. You were my big brother and
           you bailed on me.
                         
          The words hit Brendan hard.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Hey, I'm glad you stayed and
           everything worked out for you,
           Brendan. See, you leave, you get
           the opposite. You leave, you get to
           bury people.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You're not the only one who
           suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know
           she was sick. I never even got the
           chance to say goodbye to my own
           mother. You had no right to keep
           that from me! That was not your
           decision to make!
                         
                          TOMMY
           You know what? You walk around with
           your pictures in your wallet and
           you're all, I forgive you, I
           forgive Pop. I forgive everyone.
           But you know what? You're full of
           shit.
                         
          Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing
          on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for
          a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war.
           59.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Are we done, Brendan? Are we
           finished?
                         
          Tommy and Brendan look at each other with burning intensity.
          Too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say.
          Finally, Tommy turns and walks on down the beach.
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL HIGH, PHILADELPHIA - DAY

          Nash, Tito, and KC wait outside the Principal's office. It's
          quiet and aside from one SECRETARY, there's no one around.
          After a moment, Stephon comes walking in, and they all stand
          up and head into the Principal's office.

                          JOE ZITO

          All four of them laugh nervously. Working their way up to
          something.

           Let me get this straight. You want
           to use the auditorium to watch a
           suspended teacher engage in the
           activity he was suspended for? Am I
           hearing this correctly?

           Yeah. We'll get the whole school to
           sign it.
                         
                          NASH

           Look, I appreciate that you guys
           love your teacher. I really do. But
           there is nothing I can do for you.
                         
          Zito turns and heads back to his desk. The kids, dejected,
          leave the office and walk off down the hallway.

          The Goodyear BLIMP, "SPARTA IS HERE" blinking on it, floats
          over Atlantic City. FIREWORKS explode majestically above
          Boardwalk Hall and fall into the sea, where hundreds of boats
          bob, televisions tuned to Sparta visible from many of them.
                         
          THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE cram the beach and boardwalk, crane their
          necks toward the sky, and watch the stunning pyrotechnics. In
          the streets, limos line up on Ocean Avenue. Even from a
          distance, the excitement and energy are palpable.

           create, quite simply, the biggest
           Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in
           history.

           Five million dollars, Bryan. Five
           million dollars. J.J. Riley put his
           money where his mouth is and put up
           the biggest purse this sport has
           ever seen.

           It's unprecedented, Sam. As is the

           It looks as though the moment of
           truth has arrived, because here
           comes Tommy Riordan.

          sweep over nearly 15,000 SCREAMING FANS, not one of them
          sitting.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Tommy Riordan's captured the
           media's attention, but the question
           still remains: who is this guy? And
           more importantly, can he compete in
           this talent pool? Can he win?
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           I wish I knew, Bryan. I wish I knew
           who he was, and I've gotta say the
           fact that I don't know is strange.
           In an internet age where there are
           no secrets, this guy is a complete
           mystery. I can't find out anything
           about him. Tommy Riordan is
           officially Google proof.
                         
          Tommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and
          focused look on his face. He seems to want nothing to do with
          Paddy. Training is over. It's time to fight.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           You gotta love this guy, Sam. No
           walk out music, no sponsors, no
           interviews. He skipped out on the
           press conference. Wouldn't have his
           picture take for the program. He's
           breaking every rule!

           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           The only reason that Tommy is even
           in this tournament is because of a
           video showing him beating up Mad
           Dog Grimes in the gym.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           But the reason a lot of his fans
           are in the stands is because of
           another video, which is even more
           stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes
           video. Let me describe it for you
           folks for the few who haven't seen
           it, and I don't know anyone who
           hasn't, but Tommy Riordan ripped
           the door off a tank in the heat of
           battle, saving lives in the
           process, and then walked away
           without claiming a medal. He ripped
           the door off a tank!
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Tommy Riordan is a genuine war
           hero, I'm not taking anything away
           from the guy. He's a very, very
           tough guy, Bryan, but the tank
           don't hit back. We've seen YouTube
           sensations fail on the big stage
           before.
                         
          Tommy stands outside the cage and has Vaseline applied to his
          face. He looks like he's ready to murder someone.

           Tommy Riordan definitely has his
           hands full in his first opponent,
           Francisco Barbosa. Barbosa is
           nothing to scoff at.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Yeah, he's the real deal. Very
           tough guy. Very high caliber
           fighter. Tommy Riordan came out of
           nowhere, and I imagine he's going
           to disappear just as quickly.

          Tommy and Barbosa face to face as JOSH ROSENTHAL instructs.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, you've been given your
           instructions. I expect a clean
           fight. Obey my commands at all
           times. Defend yourselves at all
           times. Touch gloves, go back, let's
           do this.
                         
          In the crowd, two sections of MARINES in full dress uniforms
          wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible
          for Tommy, who returns to his corner. Paddy attempts to give
          him some advice, but Tommy is not listening.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           We're about to get the big answer
           to the big question: is Tommy
           Riordan for real? And here we go!
                         
          The bell rings. DING! And Tommy comes out fast and hard.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Barbosa's gonna be looking for a
           take down.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Definitely gonna be looking for a
           take down.
                         
          There will not be a take down. Tommy ducks a blow, then
          levels Barbosa with a massive and brutal LEFT HOOK. The
          Brazilian's head snaps sideways, his MOUTHPIECE goes flying,
          and he does a face plant on to the canvas. It's over.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Barbosa is down! Barbosa has been
           knocked out! Tommy Riordan is most
           definitely for real!
                         
          As the crowd erupts and Josh Rosenthal waves to Barbosa's
          corner to get a medic in there, Tommy marches out of the cage
          without waiting for an official announcement.
           65.
                         
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           And now he's walking out of the
           cage! He's leaving the cage! There
           goes another rule out the window!

          Fenroy and the boys fired up. They can't believe the
          ferocious knockout they've just witnessed.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Francisco Barbosa is out cold, and
           he is out of this tournament,
           Bryan.
                         
                         
          INT. BRENDAN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME
                         
          The official pokes his head into the locker room where Frank
          and a nervous Brendan sit alone.
                         
                          OFFICIAL
           Show time.
                         
          On the TV monitor, Tommy's annihilating knockout of Francisco
          Barbosa plays. Then, in the distance, the strains of
          CLASSICAL MUSIC can be heard. Brendan looks at Frank, who
          smiles and puts his hands on Brendan's shoulders.
                         
                          FRANK
           You can do this.
                         
          He grabs the nervous Brendan's head between his hands.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I want to hear you say it.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I can do this.
                         
                          FRANK
           Then let's go do this.

          BUZZING in the crowd. Another fight close at hand.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           J.J. Riley had less than 48 hours
           to fill Marco Santos' spot, and he
           basically had to rely on the word
           of Frank Campana.
           66.
                         
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           And he chose Brendan Conlon, which
           quite frankly is something I just
           don't understand.
                         
          Brendan and Frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena,
          where Paddy is waiting, his All Access pass around his neck.
          Brendan notices the old man as he approaches.
                         
                          PADDY
           Go get `em, son.
                         
          Brendan barely acknowledges Paddy and keeps walking. Frank
          looks at Brendan with a "Who the hell is that?" expression.
          As they approach the dark lights of the arena, Beethoven
          continues to BOOM out over the loud speakers.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           I can understand coming out to no
           music, by why in the world would
           you choose classical music for your
           entrance?
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           This is Beethoven, Bryan. This is
           Ode to Joy.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           My apologies, Mr. Renaissance man.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           You want to talk about renaissance
           men, you gotta talk about Frank
           Campana. Very unorthodox trainer,
           and one of the best in the game.
           He's well known for using classical
           music to train his fighters to
           remain calm, to remain patient, and
           to remain composed under pressure.
                         
          Brendan and Frank make their way through the crowd and toward
          cageside, where Bryan Callen reaches beneath his seat.
                         
                          CALLEN
           Classical music is about as fitting
           to this setting as Brendan Conlon
           is to this tournament. In fact, let
           me show you something.
                         
          Callen holds up a plastic bag with water and a GOLDFISH
          inside.
           67.
                         
                         
                          CALLEN (CONT'D)
           This is Brendan Conlon. He's a
           feeder fish, and he's about to get
           dropped into a shark tank.
                         
          Brendan gets greased up, then climbs into the cage.
                         
                          SHERIDAN
           C'mon, give the guy a break. At
           least we've seen him fight before.
           He was in the UFC. We remember him.
                         
                          CALLEN
           I remember him, too. I remember him
           being very unmemorable.

          folding laundry. The TV in front of her is off, but she
          glances at it anyway. In front of her sits a CELL PHONE. She
          glances at it repeatedly.

          "MIDNIGHT" LE climbs in, shoulders bulging and abs shredded.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Midnight Le getting ready to climb
           into the cage and go to work.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           When the brackets were announced,
           Midnight thought he'd be going up
           against Marco Santos. He's gotta be
           thrilled to be seeing Brendan
           Conlon standing across from him.
                         
          Brendan stands in the corner and looks at the massive
          Midnight Le. Frank smiles at him.
                         
                          FRANK
           You asked for it.
                         
          Brendan grins and looks out at the rabid crowd.
           68.
                         
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Brendan retired from fighting some
           years ago, he's actually a high
           school Physics teacher now, and
           Midnight had some fun with that at
           the press conference.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He said he was gonna give the
           teacher a serious lesson, and that
           getting killed was no way to spend
           a summer vacation.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal waves the two fighters into the center of the
          cage for instructions.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Alright, gentleman, you've been
           given your instructions, I expect a
           clean fight. Obey my commands at
           all times. Defend yourselves at all
           times. Touch gloves, go back, let's
           do this.
                         
          The fighters head to their corners and wait for the bell.
                         
                          FRANK
           Have some fun, baby.
                         
          At the sound of the bell, "Midnight" Le comes out hard and
          strong. He repeatedly KICKS Brendan in the leg and batters
          him with STRIKES. His power is overwhelming Brendan.

           This can't last much longer. This

          Midnight Le takes Brendan to the ground. Brendan tries to
          escape, but turns his back, allowing Midnight to sink in a
          rear naked CHOKE. He puts the strangle hold on Brendan and
          squeezes his neck with his enormous biceps.

          Brendan is on the verge of going unconscious, but he refuses
          to tap out. Then the HORN blows ending the round. The crowd
          can't believe Brendan hung in there, and neither can Midnight
          Le, who slams the canvas in frustration.
                         
          As Midnight walks back toward his angry TRAINER, who expected
          him to finish Brendan early, the teacher heads toward a

          across the cage at Midnight Le, who glares at Brendan.

          be gaining confidence. From cageside, Frank HOLLERS words of
          encouragement as the battle continues.
                         
          Back and forth they go. Midnight rocks Brendan with a right
          hand. Brendan recovers and fires back. Then Midnight shoots
          in for a take down, but Brendan dodges him, reverses
          position, and suddenly takes a shocked Midnight down to the
          ground. The crowd is on its collective feet.

          Brendan locks up Midnight's shoulder. Applies pressure. The
          bigger fighter struggles to get free, but he seems to be
          trapped. From cageside, Frank screams, instructing Brendan on
          how to finish the move.

           He dominated the fight the entire

          Tommy climbs into the cage. A Mexican fighter, DIEGO SANTANA
          (20s), is waiting for him. Josh Rosenthal points at both men.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?
           Let's go to war!
                         
          The bell RINGS and Tommy goes right after Santana and starts
          administering a beating. He bullies him into the cage and
          starts raining BLOWS all over him.

          before he kills him. Once again, Tommy marches straight out

          The arena is on its collective feet CHANTING "Tommy! Tommy!
          Tommy!" As Paddy looks on and Tommy disappears into the
          darkness of the tunnel, the sound of cheering fades.

          INT. CASINO FLOOR - SAME
                         
          A CLEANING WOMAN vacuums as an elevator door DINGS and opens.
          Out comes Paddy. The casino is nearly empty, the only sounds
          coming from the tinny RINGING of a handful of slot machines.
                         
          From a distance, Paddy spots Tommy sitting at the far end of
          a bank of Triple 7 American Glory slot machines, mechanically
          feeding the slot from a tray full of silver and pulling the
          lever with a thousand-yard stare. Paddy approaches Tommy, who
          doesn't acknowledge him.
                         
                          PADDY
           Can't sleep, huh?
                         
          Tommy feeds the machine and pulls. Says nothing. Paddy sits
          down in front of a slot machine next to Tommy.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           I know that other thing's bothering
           the hell out of you, but I'm proud
           of you. What you did for that kid
           in the tank? That was really
           something.
                         
                          TOMMY
           How about deserting my unit? Is
           that really something, too? Yeah. I
           was on my way outta country when I
           came across those guys. What was I
           supposed to do, let `em drown?
                         
                          PADDY
           No.
                          (BEAT)
           What'd you do?

           What'd I do? I took off.
                         
          Paddy starts putting things together.
                         
                          PADDY
           That's why you go by Riordan.
           That's why the press can't find
           your service records.
                         
          Tommy doesn't respond.

                          TOMMY
           That is none of your business.
                         
                          PADDY
           Come on, kiddo. I've been there.
           I've done it. I've seen it. You can
           trust me. I'll understand.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Spare me the compassionate father
           routine, Pop. The suit don't fit.
                         
                          PADDY
           I'm really trying here, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           You're trying? Now? Where were you
           when it mattered? I needed this guy
           back when I was a kid. I don't need
           you now. It's too late now.
           Everything's already happened. You
           and Brendan don't seem to
           understand that. Let me explain
           something to you: the only thing I
           have in common with Brendan Conlon
           is that we have absolutely no use
           for you.
                         
          Paddy's shaken. He can't fathom the anger in Tommy, yet he
          knows he's responsible. It's written all over him. Tears well
          up in his eyes. They seem to make Tommy madder.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Look at you. Yeah, I was right. I
           think I liked you better when you
           were a drunk. At least you had some
           balls then. Not like now. Tip
           toeing around like some beggar with
           your cup out. Take it somewhere
           else, old man.
                         
          Tommy reaches down and picks up a plastic CUP made for
          holding coins and dips it into his tray, filling it with
          QUARTERS.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           In fact, you know what? Here's a
           cup. Why don't you take this and go
           buy some more of your shitty tapes?

                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Go back to the room and listen to
           some more fish stories no one gives
           a shit about. Go on, get outta
           here.
                          (BEAT)
           Get the fuck outta here!
                         
          Tommy whips the bucket toward his father, splashing COINS
          into his face. A stunned Paddy, tears streaming down his
          face, walks off. A handful of late-night GAMBLERS look at
          Tommy, who stares angrily ahead and bounces a quarter off his
          slot machine as his destroyed father limps away.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME
                         
          Paddy staggers about in pajama bottoms and a stained V-neck,
          clutching his Walkman and a bottle of WHISKEY. "Moby Dick"
          plays from ear phones that are half on his head and half off.
          LIQUOR BOTTLES are strewn everywhere. He has obviously fallen
          off the wagon. Hard.
                         
                          PADDY
           God pity `em! All shall perish
           except me! You bastards! Stop the
           ship, you bastards!
                         
          He staggers around the room, giving a fragmented soliloquy to
          no audience.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Ishmael! God pity `em! Stop the
           ship! Please stop the ship!
           Somebody help `em!
                         
          Suddenly the adjoining door swings open. Tommy, hair
          disheveled, looks in and sees Paddy's state. The old man
          thrusts his hand up in the air and screams at Tommy.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Ahab! You Godless sonofabitch!
                         
          Paddy staggers over and gets in Tommy's face, his own face
          blotched and contorted. The old Paddy Conlon revealed. The
          monster from the past.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           You stop the ship, you Godless
           sonofabitch!
           81.
                         
                         
          There's no anger in Tommy. He simply walks toward the old man
          and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand. As he struggles
          to take it, the Walkman falls to the ground. Faint dialogue
          is heard coming from the earphones.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Captain. Oh captain. Stop the ship.
           For the love of God. We're lost.
                         
          The old man is running out of steam. He begins WEEPING.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Please stop the ship.
                         
          Paddy wobbles, tears streaming down his face. Tommy looks at
          him. The first time we've seen anything resembling compassion
          on that relentless face of his. He HUGS his father and pries
          the whiskey bottle from his hand
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           We're lost. We're all lost, Tommy.
           We'll never make it back.
                         
          Tommy pulls his father back on to the bed. Puts his arms
          around his chest and tries to quiet the old man. It's a
          tender moment, and it seems as if Tommy is only able to
          relate to the brutal, former version of the father he knew.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
                          (MUMBLING)
           I always loved you. You know that,
           don't you Tommy? I always loved
           you. You and your brother. My two
           boys.
                         
          Tommy continues to hold his father as sunlight streams into
          the room. The end of a very long night.
                         
                         
          EXT. BOARDWALK HALL - NIGHT
                         
          A bigger, even more bombastic FIREWORKS display than before
          explodes over Atlantic City. If it's possible, the CROWDS on
          the beach and boardwalk have swelled. It seems as if the
          entire east coast has descended on AC.
                         
          Outside Boardwalk Hall, the giant electronic BILLBOARD has a
          new motif. Koba still swings mightily from the side of a
          ferris wheel, but now Tommy, in a camouflage superhero
          outfit, flies right toward him. On a collision course.
                         
          Mad Dog Grimes holds on to Tommy's cape, trying to slow him
          down, and below the three of them, in miniature, is Brendan
          holding a sling shot.

           revenge ever since the day Tommy
           Riordan walked into his gym in
           Pittsburgh and turned his life
           upside down.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           It's been a very long, very
           miserable few months for Mad Dog to
           say the least.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME
                         
          Mad Dog and Tommy in a STARE DOWN as Josh Rosenthal attempts
          to give them instructions. Unless Mad Dog's mother is in the
          building, every single person in the Boardwalk Hall is
          rooting for Tommy.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Mad Dog mocking Tommy with a
           camouflage motif for his mohawk
           tonight and the Marines are really
           letting Mad Dog have it.
                         
          The Marines hoot and holler at Mad Dog as Josh Rosenthal goes
          over his instructions with the two fighters.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Alright gentlemen, you've been
           given your instructions. I expect a
           clean fight. Obey my commands at
           all times. Defend yourselves at all
           times. Touch gloves, go back, let's
           do this.
                         
          In the center of the cage, Mad Dog is practically spitting in
          Tommy's face. Tommy's eyelids droop. He could not be less
          intimidated.
           84.
                         
                         
                          MAD DOG
           It's not gonna happen again.
                         
          Callen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to
          their corners. The anticipation in the arena is incredible.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Mad Dog predicted an early
           knockout. Said he was gonna knock
           Tommy out with one punch.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Let's see what Tommy has to say
           about that.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal looks at Tommy and Mad Dog.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?
           Let's go to war!
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           And they are off!
                         
          Tommy goes after Mad Dog like it's the last night on earth.
          What Tommy did to him at Colt's Gym was an exercise in
          restraint compared to what's happening in that cage.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Tommy tackles him and he's on top!
           He's raining blows!
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Someone has to stop this.
                         
          Mad Dog is on his back and being pounded on. Tommy's rage is
          shocking, even by his own brutal standards. From cageside,
          Colt Boyd SCREAMS at Josh Rosenthal.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Stop it! Stop the fight!
                         
          It's such a savage beating, so malicious, that Rosenthal has
          to climb on Tommy's back to get him off of Mad Dog. If his
          mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him
          now. Beaten to an absolute pulp.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           That's the fastest knockout I think
           I've ever seen.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
           He is not moving.
           85.
                         
                         
          Tommy marches out of the cage and past Colt Boyd, Punkass,
          and SkySkrape, who can't believe what they just witnessed.
          Neither can anyone else at Boardwalk Hall. In the cage, a
          MEDIC tends to Mad Dog.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           I'll tell you what: you do that to
           someone on the street and they'd
           lock you up and throw away the key!
           Break out the yellow tape, Sam.
           Tommy's walking away from the cage
           like he's leaving a crime scene.
                         
                         
          EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN, PHILADELPHIA - LATER
                         
          "ODE TO JOY" is heard coming from distant speakers as ROWS OF
          CARS line up at the entrance and pull into the lot.
                         
          Pull back to reveal an enormous, old drive-in movie theater
          packed with a RAUCOUS CROWD. On the gigantic MOVIE SCREEN,
          Brendan makes his way through the arena and into the cage. As
          he does, CHEERS erupt in the parking lot. Stephon, Nash, KC,
          Tito, and some of the other students from Brendan's class
          root him on. They came up with a pretty good Plan B.
                         
          As the kids get fired up for the fight, they're joined by a
          familiar face that emerges from the crowd. Joe Zito. Tito
          shakes his hand. Smacks Stephon. Look who's here.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
                         
          Brendan climbs into the cage to a major OVATION from the
          crowd. They're completely on his side now.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Brendan Conlon came into this
           tournament as a 1000 to 1 underdog,
           and now here he is in the final
           four. The crowd's showing their
           appreciation. They're giving him
           quite the reception.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He's getting a huge reception. I
           mean, this guy shocked everybody
           last night.
                         
          Brendan stands in the corner. Frank leans over the railing of
          the cage and smiles at him.
           86.
                         
                         
                          FRANK
           You've got a visitor. Second row,
           10 o'clock.
                         
          Buzzing in the arena. The lights about to go down for the
          entrance of Koba. Before they do, Brendan looks up to see a
          familiar face at cageside. Tess. He can't believe his eyes.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           You alright with that?
                         
          Brendan looks at his wife. She smiles broadly. Mouths the
          words "I love you." Brendan grins. Kisses his glove and
          presses it against the cage. As he does, the lights go out
          inside the arena and ominous RUSSIAN MUSIC BLARES.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           And here comes the great Russian
           Koba.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Koba is so intimidating. His
           reputation is larger than life.
                         
          The crowd strains to get a look at the legend as he makes his
          way toward the cage. Brendan watches. So does Frank. Tess
          takes a quick glance at Koba, then looks away. She can't bear
          it.
                         
                          FRANK
           I want you to look right at him
           when he comes in here. Don't take
           your eyes off him.
                         
          Brendan nods, then looks at Tess. Drawing strength. Frank
          leans over the railing and taps fists with his fighter.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I'm proud of you brother. This is
           your cage.
                         
          Finally, the creepy music subsides, and the great Russian
          climbs into the cage. He's massive, and the crowd stares at
          him like an exotic animal.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal calls Brendan and Koba to the center of the
          cage. The Russian looks at Brendan with the cold,
          dispassionate eyes of a killer. Brendan does his best to hold
          his gaze.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Alright, gentlemen, you've been
           given your instructions. I expect a
           clean fight.
                          (MORE)
           87.
                         
           JOSH ROSENTHAL (CONT'D)
           Obey my commands at all times.
           Defend yourselves at all times.
           Touch gloves, go back, let's do
           this.
                         
          Brendan retreats to his corner. Takes a deep breath.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Should I be nervous for Brendan?
           `Cause I am. I want to stop the
           fight before it even begins.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?
           Let's go to war!
                         
          Koba comes straight at Brendan. His speed and strength are
          astonishing.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Now the question is, how long can
           Brendan Conlon stay alive?
                         
          Franks screams at Brendan to keep his distance. Tess watches
          through her fingers. And Koba keeps coming, snapping
          Brendan's head back with a jab and bludgeoning him with an
          uppercut to the chin. The Russian is doing whatever he wants
          to Brendan. He slices him up with strikes. Bruises his legs
          with kicks. Works him against the fence. Power slams him.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Koba just pounding on Brendan
           Conlon! He's pounding on him like a
           side of beef!
                         
                         
          EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME
                         
          Thousands of people staring at the drive-in screen and you
          can hear a pin drop. They're aghast. Zito can hardly look. KC
          buries her head in Nash's chest.
                         
          ON MOVIE SCREEN: THE SLAUGHTER CONTINUES. HOW BRENDAN IS
          TAKING IT IS ANYONE'S GUESS.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
                         
          Koba gets Brendan in a BEAR HUG, lifts him off the ground,
          carries him into the center of the ring like a sack of
          laundry, and body SLAMS him on his back.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Koba's got him in the air. Oh no!
           88.
                         
                         
          As Frank screams for Brendan to remain calm, a mortified Tess
          watches. Mercifully, the HORN sounds, and Brendan survives
          the round. He barely makes it back to his corner.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Frank Campana has to think
           seriously about stopping this.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Seriously, Sam. How much abuse can
           one man take?
                         
          The minutes passes in no time. It's time to go again.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Let's go to war!
                         
          Koba comes right after Brendan, and it's soon more of the
          same. Power slams. Brutal strikes. Brendan's face is carved
          up and battered. He tries to go for a take down, but Koba
          snuffs it, then lifts Brendan off the mat again and carries
          him through the air. Frank screams, but there's nothing he
          can do. Brendan is brutally SLAMMED into the ground.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Uh oh, Brendan's going for ride!
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           That one shook the entire building!
                         
          As Brendan writhes on the ground, Koba grabs him and slings
          him against the fence like it's nothing. Brendan flies
          through the air and RATTLES against the cage. Then Koba
          climbs on top of him and starts whaling away. Tess can't even
          watch it. Once again, just as Rosenthal is about to stop the
          fight, the HORN sounds.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Everyone has gotta be concerned
           about Brendan Conlon's bravery
           getting him into trouble here.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           His bravery can get him killed,
           Sam. He's got nothing more to
           prove. He's already lasted two
           rounds against Koba, which is more
           than anyone else can say. You
           wonder what's keeping this guy up.
                         
          Brendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool.
          Frank enters the cage. His usual positive attitude is gone.
          He comes at Brendan with aggression instead.
           89.
                         
                         
                          FRANK
           Sit down. Breathe.
           (grabbing Brendan's face)
           Look at me! Look at me! Why are we
           here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are
           we here to win this fight? You tell
           me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw
           in the towel right now. We'll get
           Tess and we will go home. You don't
           knock him out, you lose the fight.
           Understand me? You don't knock him
           out, you don't have a home.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank takes his cue to leave,
          but not before giving Brendan one last look. It's now or
          never. Brendan looks across the cage at Koba. Steels himself.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Let's go to war!
                         
          Brendan comes out and meets Koba in the center of the cage,
          but the Russian resumes his supremacy.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Conlon somehow answering the bell
           for round three, but Koba's all
           over him again.
                         
          Koba roughs the battered Brendan up some more, but then
          Brendan starts responding. Throws a couple effective leg
          kicks. A decent punch or two.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)

           are signs of life in Brendan
           Conlon. He's starting to mix it up!

           Koba's got him caught in an iron
           vice, squeezing for all it's worth
           and trying to choke the teacher
           out.
                         
          Frank screams at Brendan to stay calm. To wait for his
          moment. Koba continues to squeeze. Brendan's face turns more
          and more red. Finally, he grabs Koba's shorts, musters up all
          the strength he has left, and TOSSES the Russian on his back,
          freeing himself from the choke in the process.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He just launched Koba! Can you
           believe this? Conlon just shook off
           a guillotine!
                         
          Brendan jumps on Koba and attempts his own choke.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Conlon's staying after him! He's
           squeezing him! The tables have
           turned, and the boy scout is
           squeezing the bear!
                         
          Koba shakes off Brendan's submission attempt and stands.
          Brendan stands with him and they exchange a vicious round of
          blows. Brendan's giving as good as he's getting.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Conlon standing and trading with

           CALLEN (V.O.)
           This is a fight! We've got
           ourselves a fight!
                         
          Brendan snaps Koba's head back with a left, but the Russian
          responds with a combination. Brendan stumbles backwards, and
          Koba grabs him and tries to take him down. Brendan throws a
          left ELBOW that connects with Koba's temple. The Russian is
          momentarily STUNNED, long enough for Brendan to take him to
          the ground and wrap his arms around Koba's KNEE.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Conlon going for a knee bar! He's

           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           He's deep on that knee bar!
                         
          Brendan wrenches his body for all it's worth. Frank pounds on
          the apron of the cage.

          The Russian tries to squirm away, but he can't. His face is
          contorted in PAIN. The cageside OFFICIAL indicates there's
          only 10 seconds left in the fight.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)

           for all it's worth! He's putting
           everything he has in it, and Koba
           is screaming in pain!
                         
          Four. Three. Koba struggles. Grimaces in agony. Brendan keeps
          wrenching his knee. Two. He can't take it. One. He TAPS!

           A surprising turn in the story of
           Iraq War hero Tommy Riordan. CNN
           has learned that Riordan's true
           identity is that of Marine Staff
           Sergeant Thomas Conlon, who went
           AWOL from his unit earlier this
           year following the friendly fire
           death of his brother-in-arms,
           Sergeant Manny Fernandez.
           Fernandez' wife, Pilar Fernandez,
           spoke with me in an exclusive
           interview moments ago.
                         
          Riley and the others look at one another. They can't believe

          screams at Brendan to stay calm, but Tommy is all over him,
          POUNDING on him with savage intensity. As bad as the other
          fights were for Brendan, this one is worse.

          Tommy continues to batter Brendan, then he swoops in, picks
          him up, and SLAMS his big brother into the ground. Then he
          does it again. And again. And again.
                         
          Brendan, the wind knocked out of him, is on his back, trying
          to protect himself from Tommy, who mounts him and starts
          blasting away with a BLUR of lefts and rights. The only thing
          that saves Brendan is the HORN. Which Tommy ignores, blasting
          his brother with a brutal CHEAP SHOT to the jaw well after
          the round had ended.

           C'mon, Josh!
                         
          Brendan lays on the ground as Josh Rosenthal pulls Tommy off
          him and admonishes him for the cheap shot. Tommy stares at
          Brendan. You want more?
                         
          Frank runs into the cage with the stool and Brendan limps
          over to him and sits down. Brendan stares at Tommy, who paces
          in his corner like a caged animal.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)

           Beethoven. He's coming hard, just
           like we planned. I want you to
           angle out, hit, and move.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Angle out, hit, and move.
                         
                          FRANK
           Good. Breathe. Relax. He's not your
           brother, right? He's just a guy
           who's in the way.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. It's time. Frank glares at
          him as he picks up the stool.

          Tess sits uncomfortably in her chair. Her husband's face is a
          mess. In front of her, Callen and Sheridan commiserate. J.J.,
          the TapouT crew, and Colt Boyd look on. The electricity in
          the crowd is greater than ever. They want a champion.

          The Marines in the crowd are all on their feet, screaming for
          Tommy to end it. The chant starts up again. 15,000 strong.
          "Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!" Frank tries to instruct Brendan, but
          he can't hear him, and he's too overwhelmed.
                         
          Tommy presses Brendan against the cage and does the same
          thing Koba did. He lifts him off the ground, carries him on a
          dead run, and body SLAMS him so hard the cage shakes. Then
          Tommy mounts him and starts pounding away again.
                         
          The HORN sounds ending the round, but this time it's Brendan
          who pops up and pushes Tommy. Tommy shoves him back.
          Rosenthal has to separate them as the crowd roars its
          approval.

          Again, Tommy is on top of Brendan, trying to ground and pound
          him into submission. Frank, leaning on the apron nearby,
          screams at Brendan.
                         
                          FRANK
           Switch! Switch!
                         
          Tommy tries to pound Brendan out, but Brendan latches on to
          Tommy's arm, wraps his legs around him, and REVERSES
          position, just as he did with Midnight, the Dane, and Koba.
          Tommy is in deep trouble. Brendan pushes him face down on the
          canvas and cranks his shoulder. There's no escape.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Oh my God, that's a deep omoplata!
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He's doing it again! Conlon's doing
           it again! This is going to be over!
                         
          Brendan applies intense pressure. Tommy's shoulder is
          contorted, WRENCHED backwards, and his face is a mask of
          pain. Tommy's in agony, but he won't give in.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Tap, Tommy!
                         
          Tommy SHRIEKS like an animal, but still won't quit. In fact,
          he elbows Brendan in the face in defiance. Brendan in turn
          cranks the shoulder even more. It's at the breaking point.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Tap!
                         
          The shoulder twists. Twists. And then, audible only to Tommy
          and Brendan, CRACK. Dislocated. Then the HORN ending the
          round.
           99.
                         
                         
          Brendan, worried he hurt his brother, leans over to see if
          Tommy's alright, but Tommy, like a wounded animal, leaps up
          and grabs Brendan around the throat with his one good arm. He
          shoves him all the way across the cage and into the fence,
          and it takes Rosenthal and Frank to separate them.

          Tommy, flap down, tears of pain pouring down his face, stands
          defiantly in his corner. In the other corner, Frank attends
          Brendan. In the crowd, Tess covers her mouth. She can't
          believe what Tommy allowed to happen to him.
                         
          Frank puts the stool down and gives Brendan some water.
          Brendan's face is wracked with guilt and concern over his
          brother.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I popped his shoulder.
                         
                          FRANK
           Relax, breathe.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I heard it tear.
                         
                          FRANK
           You popped his shoulder? Good. I
           want you to pop his other shoulder.
                         
          This is not what Brendan wants to hear. He looks over to Josh
          Rosenthal.
                         
                          BRENDAN

          Frank snaps. Grabs Brendan by the face.
                         
                          FRANK
           Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You
           got two rounds left! You need both
           rounds! Go in there, kick him in
           the head, take him down, and finish
           him!
                         
          Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank exits the cage. The wounded
          Tommy stands in his corner, his ruined left arm hanging low.
          Brendan makes eye contact with him.
                         
                          BRENDAN

          The BELL sounds. Round Four begins. Tommy throws useless
          right jabs. He's one handed and has no chance. Brendan stays
          away from him, not wanting to hurt his brother.
                         
                          BRENDAN

          Frank screams at Brendan from cageside to take the wounded
          Tommy out, but Brendan is reluctant.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)

           have to do this.
                         
          Tommy and Brendan circle each other. Tommy throwing rights
          and wincing in agony at any movement. Brendan stares at him.
          Everything about him says "Quit, Tommy." But Tommy won't.

          Brendan continues to circle and not engage. Frank is livid.
          He knows he'll lose the fight on the judges' scorecards if he
          doesn't do something.
                         
                          FRANK
           Finish him! You finish him!
                         
          Tommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at Brendan. Finally,
          with no choice, Brendan fires back. He batters the
          defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him,
          blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince
          in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it.
                         
          Brendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him
          to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the
          face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes
          pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls
          Brendan away.

          Brendan heads back to his stool as Tommy leans against the
          cage in agony. The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are
          glazed over. It's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet.
                         
          From near cageside, Paddy looks to the corner and makes eye
          contact with Brendan. They exchange a small look of
          understanding. A NOD. They both know what needs to be done.

          In the crowd, the "Tommy" CHANT begins in earnest. In fact,
          it may be louder than ever. Having done the impossible and
          carried on with one arm, Tommy is more superhuman and heroic
          than ever before. But his face tells another story. Soaked in
          pain and anguish. All his stoic walls crumbling down.

          INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME
                         
          Brendan SLAMS Tommy to the ground. His face is contorted in
          merciless pain. Brendan slips his forearm under Tommy's neck
          and squeezes. Tommy struggles, but he's got one arm and
          there's NO ESCAPE. His face getting red from lack of oxygen.
                         
          As an anguished Tess and a shaken Paddy look on, Brendan
          CHOKES his brother. As he does, he pleads with him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry!
                         
          Tommy continues to struggle.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Tap, Tommy! Tap!
                         
          Tears pour down Tommy's face. Brendan is crushing his wind
          pipe. Tommy's eyes bulge.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I love you, Tommy! I love you!
                         
          Tommy, about to pass out, no more air to breathe, slowly
          opens his left hand, looks at Brendan, and TAPS his shoulder
          on the Conlon family crest. Finally submitting.

          Frank makes eye contact with the jubilant Tess. Indicates she
          should meet them in the locker room. Meanwhile, people pour
          into the cage. Frank pushes them aside, keeping them away
          from Brendan and Tommy, who remain on the ground, exhausted.
          Tommy to begins to WEEP.

          Tommy buries his head in Brendan's chest. A torrent of
          sobbing gushes from him, years of pain pouring out in heavy
          bursts. From the crowd, Paddy stares into the cage and
          watches as Brendan comforts his little brother, then helps
          him to his feet.
                         
          Callen, Sheridan, and J.J. Riley make their way inside for
          the post-fight interview, cameras trailing behind them. With
          Frank continuing to run interference, Brendan pushes through
          the crush of people, arm around Tommy, and exits the cage.
                         
          The crowd parts for Tommy and Brendan. Paddy watches them, a
          tear in his eye. He's overwhelmed by the sight of his two
          boys together again.
                         
          As the noise from the arena fades, the brothers walk through
          the wild crowd and continue on through the tunnel, arm in
          arm...
