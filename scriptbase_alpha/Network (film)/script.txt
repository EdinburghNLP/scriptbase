FADE IN:
1.     BLACK SCREEN

          NARRATOR
     This story is about Howard Beale
     who was the network news anchorman on
     UBS-TV --

A BANK OF FOUR COLOR TELEVISION ON MONITORS

It is 7:14 P.M., Monday, September 22, 1975, and we are
watching the network news programs on CBS, NBC, ABC and
UBS-TV, the network of our story.  The AUDIO is OFF;
and head shots of WALTER CRONKITE, JOHN CHANCELLOR,
HOWARD K. SMITH and HARRY REASONER, and of course,
the anchorman of our network, HOWARD BEALE, silently
flit and flicker across the four television screens,
interspersed with the news of the day -- President
Ford's new Energy Program, a hearing on Patty Hearst's
bail, truce violations in Beirut, busing trouble in
Boston....  NARRATION continues OVER --

          NARRATOR
     -- in his time, Howard Beale had
     been a mandarin of television, the
     grand old man of news, with a HUT
     rating of 16 and a 28 audience
     share --

CAMERA MOVES IN to isolate HOWARD BEALE, who is
everything an anchorman should be -- 58 years old
silver-haired, magisterial, dignified to the point of
divinity.  NARRATION continues OVER --

          NARRATOR
     -- in 1969, however, he fell to a
     22 share, and, by 1972, he was
     down to a 15 share.  In 1973, his
     wife died, and he was left a
     childless widower with an 8 rating
     and a 12 share.  He became morose
     and isolated, began to drink
     heavily, and, on September 22,
     1975, he was fired, effective in
     two weeks.  The news was broken to
     him by Max Schumacher --


2.     EXT. 5TH AVE. SOUTH OF 57TH STREET - NIGHT

11:30 P.M.  The area is deserted except for a few
STROLLERS window-shopping the department stores.
And way down near 55th Street, TWO roaring drunk middle-
aged men, HOWARD BEALE and MAX SCHUMACHER, reeling
along and hooting it up.  NARRATION continues OVER --

          NARRATOR
     -- who was president of the News
     Division at UBS and an old friend.
     The two men got properly pissed --

CLOSER SHOT of HOWARD and MAX (who is a craggy,
lumbering, rough-hewn, 51-year-old man), thoroughly
plastered and on a drunken laughing jag --

          HOWARD
          (clutching the corner
          mailbox to keep from
          falling)
     When was this?

          MAX
     1951 --

          HOWARD
     I was at CBS with Ed Murrow in
     1951.  Didn't you join Murrow
     in 1951? --

          MAX
     Must've been 1950 then.  I was at
     NBC.  Morning News.  Associate
     producer.  I was a kid, twenty-six
     years old.  Anyway, they were
     building the lower level on the
     George Washington Bridge, and we
     were doing a remote there.  Except
     nobody told me! --

For some reason, this knocks them out.  HOWARD, wheezing
with suppressed laughter, clutches the mailbox.  MAX has
to shout to get the rest of the story out --

          MAX
     -- ten after seven in the morning -- I
     get a call -- "Where the hell are
     you? -- You're supposed to be on the
     George Washington Bridge!" -- I jump
     out of bed -- throw my raincoat
     over my pajamas -- run down the
     stairs -- I get out in the street --
     I flag a cab -- I jump in -- I say:
     "Take me to the middle of the George
     Washington Bridge!" --

It's too much again.  The TWO MEN dissolve into silent
wheezing spasms of laughter --

          MAX
          (tears streaming down
          his cheeks)
     -- the driver turns around --
     he says -- don't do it, buddy --
          (so weak now he can
          barely talk)
     -- he says -- you're a young man --
     you got your whole life ahead
     of you --

He can't go on.  He stomps around on the sidewalk.
HOWARD clutches the mailbox.


3.     INT. A BAR - 3:00 A.M.

Any bar.  Mostly empty.  MAX and HOWARD in a booth,
so sodden drunk they are sober --

          HOWARD
     I'm going to kill myself --

          MAX
     Oh, shit, Howard --

          HOWARD
     I'm going to blow my brains out
     right on the air, right in the
     middle of the seven o'clock news.

          MAX
     You'll get a hell of a rating,
     I'll tell you that, a fifty
     share easy --

          HOWARD
     You think so?

          MAX
     We could make a series out of it.
     Suicide of the Week. Hell, why
     limit ourselves? Execution of the
     Week -- the Madame Defarge Show!
     Every Sunday night, bring your
     knitting and watch somebody get
     guillotined, hung, electrocuted,
     gassed.  For a logo, we'll have
     some brute with a black hood over
     his head.  Think of the spin-offs
     -- Rape of the Week --

          HOWARD
          (beginning to get
          caught up in the idea)
     Terrorist of the Week?

          MAX
     Beautiful!

          HOWARD
     How about Coliseum '74? Every
     week we throw some Christians
     to the lions! --

          MAX
     Fantastic! The Death Hour!  I
     love it!  Suicides, assassinations,
     mad bombers, Mafia hitmen, murder
     in the barbershop, human sacrifices
     in witches' covens, automobile
     smashups.  The Death Hour!  A
     great Sunday night show for the
     whole family. We'll wipe fucking
     Disney right off the air --

They snigger and snort.  HOWARD lays his head down on
the booth's table and verges on sleep --


4.     INT. HOWARD'S BEDROOM - 4:30 A.M. - DARK

HOWARD, fully clothed, sprawled asleep on his still-
covered bed in the dark bedroom.  Suddenly, he sits bolt
upright, SCREAMING out against unseen terrors --


5.     INT. HOWARD'S APARTMENT HOUSE - LANDING OUTSIDE HIS
DOOR - 8:00 A.M. - TUESDAY, SEPT. 24

-- as HOWARD'S HOUSEKEEPER, a middle-aged lady, lets
herself into


INT. HOWARD'S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE FOYER

The HOUSEKEEPER, unbuttoning her coat, is greeted by
the sound of a raucous clock ALARM, relentlessly
BUZZING O.S.  She crosses the --


INT. LIVING ROOM

--  and opens the blinds letting in an eruption of
daylight. The shrill BUZZING getting louder, she
proceeds into the --


INT. BACK FOYER

--  where she pauses to look into the bedroom, the door
being ajar; the BUZZING is coming from here --

HOUSEKEEPER'S P.O.V -- HOWARD BEALE,

still wearing the clothes he wore last night, curled
in a position of fetal helplessness on the floor in
the far corner of the room --

          HOUSEKEEPER
          (after a moment)
     Are you all right, Mr. Beale?

          HOWARD
          (opens one eye)
     I'm fine, thank you, Mrs.
     Merryman --

With some effort, he contrives to get to his feet as
the HOUSEKEEPER crosses to the alarm clock and turns
it off --


6.     CREDITS AND MUSIC ERUPT ONTO THE SCREEN

TITLE:
          "N E T W O R K"

UNDER AND INTERSPERSED WITH CREDITS, a montage of
scenes, occasionally audible, on this seemingly
routine day --


7.     INT. HOWARD BEALE'S OFFICE - 5TH FLOOR - 9:20 A.M.

A small, unpretentious office, cluttered with books,
magazines, periodicals, photographs and awards on the
walls, various mementos here and there.  HOWARD
(necktied and in shirtsleeves), behind his desk,
rattling away his copy for that evening's broadcast
on his typewriter -- pauses to pour himself a quick
shot of Scotch --


8.     INT. THE NIGHTLY NEWS ROOM - ROOM 517 - 10:30 A.M.

The common room off which Howard's office debouches.  A
large room compactly filled with the desks of producers,
associate producers, head writer and writers, production
assistants, etc.  The walls are festooned like bulletin
boards with sheaves of newspaper pages and cutouts and
reams of wire releases (there are two wire machines in a
corner).  Large blowups of HOWARD BEALE are prominently
displayed.  There are small, shelved libraries of books,
directories and magazines here and there.  And the
ever-present bank of four television monitors; and,
Since it is 10:30 A.M., Tuesday, September 23, 1975,
and, since the AUDIO is OFF, the screens silently
flicker with whatever was on that day at that time.
HOWARD comes out of his office, crosses through the
general HUM of informal industry, an occasional
TYPEWRITER CLACKING, a more than occasional phone
ringing, as the Nightly News Room PERSONNEL, all in
their 20's and 30's, move, MURMUR, confer about their
businesses.  HOWARD BEALE makes for a ledge of reference
books to check out some fact.  He spread the reference
book out on an unoccupied desk.  SOMEONE in b.g. tells
him he's wanted on the phone.  He nods, takes the call
at the desk he is at.  Throughout, he belts away at his
glass of booze --


9.     INT. OFFICE OF THE EXEC. PRODUCER OF UBS - NETWORK NEWS -
UBS BUILDING - 5TH FLOOR - 1:00 P.M. - TUESDAY

Another smallish office debouching off the main room
like Howard's, absolutely jammed with nine PEOPLE, a
couple of them standing, the others sitting wherever
they can.  The executive producer, HARRY HUNTER (early
40's), is behind the desk.  HOWARD BEALE sits on the
small, Finnish modern couch, flanked by an ASSOCIATE
PRODUCER and a MAN from the Graphics Department.  Aside
from BEALE and HUNTER, everybody else is in their 20's
or early 30's, and, with the same exceptions, they're
all casually dressed.  This is the daily run-down
meeting at which the schedule for that evening's
broadcast is roughed out, and it sounds something like
this --

          HOWARD
          (reaching for the bottle of
          booze on HUNTER'S desk to
          refill his glass)
     -- let's do the Lennon deportation
     at the end of three --

          HARRY HUNTER
     That strong enough to bump?

          HOWARD
          (sipping his booze)
     In one then, I'll do a lead on
     Sarah Jane Moore to Mayberry in
     San Francisco --

          ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
     The film I saw was the Chief
     of Detectives --

          GRAPHICS MAN
     I think we got maybe ten seconds
     on the shooting itself --

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
     The whole thing is one-twenty-five --

          HOWARD
     What does that come out?

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
     About four-fifty --

          ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
     Are we using Squeaky Fromme?

          HARRY HUNTER
     Let's do that in two -- Squeaky --
     Ford at the airport - bump.  Now.
     we using a map going into San
     Francisco?

          GRAPHICS MAN
     I prefer a news-pix --

HOWARD pours himself another shot of booze and sips it --

          HOWARD
     What've we got left?

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
     Gun control, Patty Hearst affidavit,
     guerillas in Chad, OPEC in Vienna --


10.   INT. 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - UBS BUILDING - 6:28 P.14. -
TUESDAY

LOOKING INTO the small network-news make-up room where
HOWARD BEALE is standing, Kleenex tucked into his shirt
collar, getting a few last whisks from the MAKE-UP
LADY.  Finished, HOWARD pulls the Kleenex from his
collar, takes a last sip from a glass of booze on the
make-up shelf, gathers his papers and exits, turns and
enters --

11.   INT. NETWORK NEWS STUDIO - 4TH FLOOR.

Typical Newsroom studio -- cameras, cables, wall
maps, flats and propping, etc.  HOWARD nods, smiles to
various PERSONNEL -- CAMERAMEN, ASSISTANT DIRECTORS,
ASSOCIATE PRODUCERS -- as he makes his way to his desk
facing Camera One.  He sits, prepares his papers, looks
up to the control room, nods --

MUSIC ABRUPTLY OUT:

END OF CREDITS:


12.   INT. CONTROL ROOM - 4th FLOOR

The clock wall reads:  6:30.  Typical control room.  A
room-length double bank of television monitors including
two color monitor screens, the show monitor and the
pre-set monitor.  Before this array of TV screens sits
the DIRECTOR, flanked on his left by the PRODUCTION
ASSISTANT (GIRL) who stop-watches the show, and on his
right by the TECHNICAL DIRECTOR who operates a special
board of buttons and knobs.  (On the TECHNICAL
DIRECTOR's right sits the LIGHTING DIRECTOR).  At the
moment, the show monitor has the network's Washington
correspondent, JACK SNOWDEN, doing a follow-up on the
attempted assassination of President Ford in San
Francisco --

          SNOWDEN (ON MONITOR)
     -- the first attempt on President
     Ford's life was eighteen days ago --
     and again yesterday in San Francisco --

          DIRECTOR
          (murmuring into his mike)
     -- Lou, kick that little thing shut
     on ground level --

          SNOWDEN (ON MONITOR)
     -- In spite of two attempts --

The show monitor screen has switched over to show film
of President Ford arriving at the San Francisco airport --

          SNOWDEN (V.O. ON MONITOR)
     -- Mr. Ford says he will not become --

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          (murmurs)
     -- forty seconds --

          DIRECTOR
          (murmurs into mike)
     -- twenty seconds to one --

          DIRECTOR
     -- one --

HOWARD BEALE'S image suddenly flips on-screen --

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
     -- thirty seconds to commercial freeze --

          DIRECTOR
     -- head roll --

          TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
     -- rolling--

The DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL DIRECTOR turn in their seats
to join HARRY HUNTER and his SECRETARY in a brief
gossip --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     Ladies and gentlemen, I would
     like at this moment to announce
     that I will be retiring from
     this program in two weeks' time
     because of poor ratings --

The DIRECTOR has whispered something to HARRY HUNTER'S
SECRETARY which occasions sniggers from the SECRETARY
and from HARRY HUNTER.  The TECHNICAL DIRECTOR stands to
get in on the joke --

          ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
          (to DIRECTOR)
     --  what'd you say? --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     -- and since this show was the
     only thing I had going for me
     in my life, I have decided to
     kill myself --

HARRY HUNTER'S SECRETARY murmurs something which causes
HARRY HUNTER to burst into laughter --

          ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
          (to the DIRECTOR)
     -- so what'd she say? --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     -- I'll tell you what I'm going
     to do.  I'm going to blow my brains
     out right on this program a week
     from today --

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          (frowning and very puzzled
          indeed by this diversion
          from the script)
     -- ten seconds to commercial --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     -- so tune in next Tuesday.  That'll
     give the public relations people a
     week to promote the show, and we
     ought to get a hell of a rating
     with that, a fifty share easy --

A bewildered PRODUCTION ASSISTANT nudges the DIRECTOR,
who wheels back to his mike --

          DIRECTOR
          (into mike)
     -- and --

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          (to the DIRECTOR)
     Listen, did you hear that? --

          DIRECTOR
     Take VTA.

The monitor screen erupts into a commercial for cat
food.

          AUDIO MAN
          (leaning in from his
          glassed-in cubicle)
     What was that about?

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          (to the DIRECTOR)
     Howard just said he was going to
     blow his brains out next Tuesday.

          DIRECTOR
     What're you talking about?

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
     Didn't you hear him?  He just said --

          HARRY HUNTER
     What's wrong now?

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
     Howard just said he was going to
     kill himself next Tuesday.

          HARRY HUNTER
     What do you mean Howard just
     said he was going to kill himself
     next Tuesday?

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          (nervously riffling through
          her script)
     He was supposed to do a tag on
     Ron Nesson and into commercial --

          AUDIO MAN
          (from his doorway)
     He said tune in next Tuesday, I'm
     going to shoot myself --

Everybody's attention is now on the double bank of
black-and-white monitor screens showing various parts
of the studio, all of which show agitated behavior.
Several of the screens show HOWARD at his desk in
vehement discussion with a clearly startled FLOOR
MANAGER with headset and no less startled ASSOCIATE

PRODUCER --

          DIRECTOR
          (on mike to FLOOR MANAGER)
     What the hell's going on?

On the pre-set monitor screen, the FLOOR MANAGER
with headset looks up --

          FLOOR MANAGER (ON SCREEN)
          (voice booming into
          the control room)
     I don't know.  He just said he
     was going to blow his brains out --

          DIRECTOR
          (into mike)
     What the hell's this all about,
     Howard?

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
          (shouting at the floor
          PERSONNEL gathering
          around him)
     Will you get the hell out of here?
     We'll be back on air in a couple
     of seconds!

          DIRECTOR
          (roaring into the mike)
     What the fuck's going on, Howard?

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     I can't hear you --

          DIRECTOR

          (bawling at the AUDIO MAN)
     Put the studio mike on!

          AUDIO MAN
     We're back on in eleven seconds --

          SLOCUM (on floor)
     They want to know what the fuck is
     going on, Howard.

          HOWARD (on monitor)
     I can't hear you.

          DIRECTOR
          (bawling at the Audio man)
     Put the studio mike on!

          AUDIO MAN
     We're back on in eleven seconds.

          ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
     Harry, I think we better get him off --

          HARRY HUNTER
          (roaring at the Audio Man)
     Turn his mike off!

          AUDIO MAN
          (now back in the control room)
     What the hell's going on?

          HARRY HUNTER
          (raging)
     Turn the fucking sound off, you stupid
     son of a bitch!  This is going out live!

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
          (stop-watching)
     Three -- two -- one --

          DIRECTOR
     Take 2 --

At which point, the TECHNICAL DIRECTOR pushes a button;
the jangling cat food commercial flips off the show
monitor to be instantly replaced by a scene of gathering
bedlam around HOWARD'S desk.  The AUDIO MAN flees in
panic back to the cubicle to turn off the audio but not
before HARRY HUNTER and the DIRECTOR going out live to
67 affiliates can be heard booming:

          HARRY HUNTER
     Chrissakes! Black it out! This is
     going out live to sixty-seven fucking
     affiliates ! Shit!

          DIRECTOR
     This is the dumbest thing I ever saw! --


13.   INT. MAX SCHUMACHER'S OFFICE - FIFTH FLOOR - ROOM 509

MAX SCHUMACHER, behind his desk staring petrified at
his office console on which pandemonium ha broken out.

The FLOOR MANAGER and the ASSOCIATE PRODUCER and
now an ELECTRICIAN are trying to pull HOWARD away from
his desk and HOWARD is trying to hit anybody he can
with an ineffective right hand haymaker --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     Get the fuck away from me!

          OTHER VOICES (ON MONITOR)
          (coming from all directions)
     --  cut the show! --
     --  get him out of there! --
     --   go to standby! --
     --  for Chrissakes, you stupid --

MAX'S PHONE RINGS --

          MAX
          (grabs the phone)
     How the hell do I know? --
          (he hangs up, seizes
          another phone, barks:)
     Give me the network news
     control room!

On the MONITOR SCREEN, hysteria is clearly dominating.
The SCREEN has suddenly leaped into a fragment of the
just-done cat food COMMERCIAL, then a jarring shot of
the bedlam of the studio floor.  This particular camera
seems unattended as it begins to PAN dementedly back
and forth showing the confusion on the studio floor.
Then abruptly the SCREEN is filled with Vice President
designate Nelson Rockefeller testifying before the
Senate Rules Committee --

          MAX
          (shouting into phone)
     Black it out!

The SCREEN abruptly goes into BLACK as MAX slashes his
phone back into its cradle.  His PHONE promptly RINGS
again, but MAX is already headed for the door.  The
SCREEN goes into STANDBY.  His SQUAWK BOX suddenly
blares --

          SQUAWK BOX
     What the hell happened, Max? --

          MAX
          (shouting as he exits)
     How the hell do I know?  I'm going
     down now!

He strides into --


14.   INT. ROOM 509 - COMMON ROOM OF NEWS

EXECUTIVE OFFICES

A large common room where all the SECRETARIES of the
News Division EXECUTIVES have their desks.  It is empty
now except for one SECRETARY just now putting the cover
on her typewriter.  MAX strides through and exits
into --

15.   INT. FIFTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

A long institutional corridor -- part of an endless
maze of similar corridors -- with offices and technical
rooms debouching on both sides.  The corridor has
begun to fill up with video-tape OPERATORS and other
News Division PERSONNEL who happen to be working late
-- all of whom are either wondering what happened or
are telling others what happened.  MAX yanks an exit
door open and disappears down a flight of steps to
emerge into --

16.   INT. FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

-- which leads directly to the doors for the control
room and for the studio.  Coming out of the control
room is the TECHNICAL DIRECTOR, who, on spotting MAX
striding down the corridor to him, says --

          TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
     Jesus Christ, Mr. Schumacher! --

He follows MAX into the --


17.   INT. STUDIO

Everything seems to have quieted a bit, the hysteria
down to mumbles and murmurs and occasional sounds of
laughter.  TELEPHONES are shrilly and incessantly
RINGING.  In the far corner of the studio sits HOWARD
BEALE surrounded by HARRY HUNTER, the DIRECTOR, the
ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, the PRODUCTION ASSISTANT, and the
FLOOR MANAGER.  CAMERAMEN, GRIPS and other FLOOR
PERSONNEL are gathered in a FLUX of little clumps around
the studio murmuring and muttering and giggling over the
whole absurd episode MAX heads straight for the GROUP
around HOWARD.  They part to let him in --

          HARRY HUNTER
          (to MAX)
     Tom Cabell wants you to call as
     soon as you come in --

MAX nods, stares at HOWARD --

          VOICE (O.S.)
     Harry!  Joe Sweeney on the phone! --

          HARRY HUNTER
          (bawls back)
     I'm not taking any more calls!
     Tell them Mr. Schumacher's here!
     They can talk to him!

          MAX
          (staring at HOWARD)
     Howard, you have got to be out of
     your ever-loving mind.  Are you drunk?
          (to the others)
     How much boozing has he been doing
     today?

PHONES O.S. RING and RING.  VOICES O.S. SHOUT --

          VOICES (O.S.)
     -- Mr. Schumacher, Mr. Cabell
     on the phone! --
     -- Mr. Schumacher!  Mr. Zangwill
     for you! --
     -- Harry!  Mr. Thackeray on Three! --

HOWARD slowly looks up to MAX who is still staring at

him.  He suddenly smiles broadly at MAX and winks.

          VOICES (O.S.)
     -- Harry!  Thackeray wants to
     talk to you right now! --
     -- Mr. Schumacher! Mr. Gianini
     wants to talk to you! --

          MAX
          (to HARRY HUNTER)
     You better get hold of Mr. Chaney
     and Frank Hackett --


18.   INT. FIFTH FLOOR - UBS BUILDING - ELEVATOR AREA - 10:47 P.M.

FRANK HACKETT, Executive Senior Vice President of the
network, 41 years old, one of the new cool young breed
of management/merchandising executives, wearing a tuxedo
-- (he had been pulled out of a dinner party in
Westchester by this unfortunate business) -- comes out
of the elevator and turns briskly into --


19.   INT. FIFTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

-- which is clotted with network EXECUTIVES of assorted
sizes and ages.  HACKETT, en route to Room 509, which
is clearly the humming hub of activity up here, pauses
to comment to one of the EXECUTIVES --

          HACKETT
     Lou, can't we clear out that
     downstairs lobby?  There must be
     a hundred people down there, every
     TV station and wire service in the
     city.  I could barely get in --

          LOU
     How'm I going to clear them out,
     Frank?

HACKETT murmurs and peels his way into --


20.   INT. ROOM 509 - EXECUTIVES' OFFICES OF THE NEWS DIVISION

HACKETT enters the common room, off which debouch the
offices of the President of News (MAX SCHUMACHER), the
VP News Division (ROBERT MCDONOUGH), the VP Public
Relations News Division (MILTON STEINMAN), the VP Legal
Affairs News Division (WALTER GIANINI), VP Owned
Stations News (EMIL DUBROVNIK), General Manager News,
Radio (MICHAEL SANDIES) -- all of whom are here and a
number of other network EXECUTIVES.  The VP Sales (JOE
DONNELLY) is just taking the phone from the VP News
Sales (RICHMOND KETTERING) who is seated at the desk of
the secretary for VP Public Relations News Division --

          DONNELLY (on phone)
     -- how many spots were wiped out? --

          HACKETT
          (to GIANINI, who is seated
          at another secretary's desk
          studying a typescript of
          the aborted news show)
     Anything litigable? --

          GIANINI
     Not so far --

          DONNELLY
          (on phone)
     -- We had to abort the show. Ed,
     what else could we do?  We'll
     make good, don't worry about it --

          HACKETT
          (to ARTHUR ZANGWILL, VP
          Standards and Practices,
          now coming out of MAX's
          office)
     Is Nelson in there?

          ZANGWILL
     He's talking to Wheeler.  So far,
     over nine hundred fucking phone
     calls complaining about the foul
     language --

          HACKETT
          (mutters)
     Shit --

          P.R. MAN
          (in b.g. on phone)
     -- come on, Mickey, what page
     are you putting it on?! --

HACKETT is already crossing into --


21.   INT. MAX'S OFFICE

-- which is pretty well jammed with NELSON CHANEY
(President of the network), 52, a patrician, sitting
behind MAX's desk and on the phone, looking up to
note HACKETT's arrival --

          CHANEY
          (on phone)
     Frank Hackett just walked in --

MILTON STEINMAN (VP Public Relations News Division),
early 50's, a rumpled, ordinarily amiable man, is
standing by the desk on the phone to someone at CBS --

          STEINMAN
          (on phone)
     I can't release the tape, Marty,
     we're still studying it ourselves --

A P.R. MAN sticks his head into the office

          P.R. MAN
          (calling to STEINMAN)
     ABC again, wants the tape --

          STEINMAN
     Tell  him to go fuck himself
          (to phone)
     And that goes for you too, Marty --

          HACKETT
          (to HOWARD BEALE,
          sitting on the couch)
     You're off the air as of now.

          CHANEY
          (extending his phone
          to HACKETT)
     He wants to talk to you --

          HACKETT
          (to MAX, leaning
          against a wall)
     Who's replacing Beale tomorrow?

          MAX
     We're flying up Snowden from
     Washington.

          STEINMAN
          (leaning across HACKETT
          to turn up the volume
          knob on Max's desk)
     All right, everybody hold it.
     Let's see how the other
     networks handled this --

He is referring to the four television monitors --
three on the wall and a large office console monitor
of UBS-TV, now blurting out their respective
commercials --

          THACKERAY
          (VP Stations Relations,
          lounging in the doorway)
     The ten o'clock news opened
     with it --

          HACKETT
          (on phone)
     Walter's drafted a statement, I
     haven't seen it yet -- I just got
     here, John, I was at a dinner party --

Suddenly, the faces of DAVE MARASH and ROLAND SMITH and
CHUCK SCARBOROUGH and ROGER GRIMSBY and BILL BEUTEL
and the UBS local news anchorman, TIM HALLOWAY, are on
the screen.  Affable DAVE MARASH on the CBS monitor
is saying:

          MARASH
          (affably)
     An unusual thing happened at one of
     our sister networks, UBS, this evening --

          ROGER GRIMSBY
          (almost simultaneously)
     Howard Beale, one of television's
     most esteemed newscasters --

          CHUCK SCARBOROUGH
     Howard Beale interrupted his network
     news program tonight to announce --

          HACKETT
          (mutters)
     Shit --

          TIM HALLOWAY
     Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
     made a forceful address before the
     United Nations General Assembly --

          HACKETT
          (to MAX)
     How are we handling it?

          MAX
     Halloway's going to make a brief
     statement at the end of the show
     to the effect Howard's been under
     great personal stress, et cetera

HACKETT reaches to click off the bank of monitor
screens.  They abruptly go black.

          HACKETT
          (on phone)
     I'll   call you back, John.
          (returns the phone to
          its cradle, regards the
          gathered EXECUTIVES)
     All right.  We've got a stockholders'
     meeting tomorrow at which we're going
     to announce the restructuring of
     management plan, and I don't want
     this grotesque incident to interfere
     with that.  I'll suggest Mr. Ruddy
     open with a short statement washing
     this whole thing off, and, you,
     Max, better have some answers in
     case some of those nuts that always
     come to stockholders' meetings --

          MAX
          (back to leaning
          against the wall)
     Mr. Beale has been under great
     personal and professional pressures --

          HACKETT
          (exploding)
     I've got some goddam surprises for
     you too, Schumacher!  I've had it
     up to here with your cruddy division
     and its annual thirty-three million
     dollar deficit! --

          MAX
     Keep your hands off my news division
     Frank.  We're responsible to
     corporate level, not to you.

          HACKETT
     We'll goddam well see about that!

          CHANEY
     All right, take it easy.  Right now,
     how' re we going to get Beale out of
     here?  I understand there's at least
     a hundred reporters and camera crews
ings --

          HERRON
          (buzzing the projectionist)
     Diana asked if she could sit in on
     this --

          MAX
     Fine --
          (sits, calls to DIANA)
     How's it going?

DIANA shrugs, smiles.  The lights in the room go down.
A shaft of light shoots out from the projection room.
The PHONE at MAX's elbow BUZZES.  HE picks it up --

          MAX
          (murmurs into phone)
     Max Schumacher -- I'm glad I got
     you, John.  Listen, I got into a
     hassle with Frank Hackett last
     night over the Howard Beale thing,
     and he made a crack about the
     stockholders' meeting this afternoon.
     He said something about having
     some surprises for me.  Is there
     something going on, John, I don't
     know about? ... John, I'm counting
     on you and Mr. Ruddy to back me up
     against that son of a bitch
     Okay, see you this afternoon --

He hangs up, leans back, watches the documentary film
which has just begun.  ON SCREEN, a handsome black
woman in her early 30's --

          MAX
     Who's that, Laureen Hobbs?

          HERRON
     Yeah.

-- is sitting in a typical panel discussion grouping,
flanked by three MEN and a WOMAN, two white, two
black, all very urban guerilla, in fatigues, sun
glasses and combat boots.  MISS HOBBS looks calmly
into camera and says:

          LAUREEN HOBBS (ON SCREEN)
     The Communist Party believes that
     the most pressing political necessity
     today is the consolidation of the
     revolutionary, radical and democratic
     movements into a United Front --

The PHONE BUZZES softly.  MAX picks it up --

          MAX
          (murmurs into phone)
     Yeah? ... Oh, goddamit, when, Louise?
     Well, did he say anything? ...
     All right, thanks.
          (hangs up, promptly
          picks up again)
     Four-eight-oh-seven --

          LAUREEN HOBBS (ON SCREEN) (in b.g.)
     Repression is the response of an
     increasingly desperate, imperialist
     ruling clique.  Indeed, the entire
     apparatus of the bourgeois-democratic
     state especially its judicial systems
     and its prisons is disintegrating --

          MAX (on phone)
     Harry, Howard left my house about
     ten minutes ago presumably headed here.
     Let me know as soon as he gets here.

               LAUREEN HOBBS (ON SCREEN) (in b.g.)
     The fascist thrust must be resisted
     in its incipient stages by the
     broadest possible coalition --


25.   INT. SCREENING ROOM 7 - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

Room still dark.  ON SCREEN, NUMBERED WHITE LEADER is
rolling down --

          HERRON
     What we're going to see now is
     something really sensational.
     The Flagstaff Independent Bank
     in Arizona was ripped off last
     week by a terrorist group called
     the Ecumenical Liberation Army,
     and they themselves actually took
     movies of the rip-off while they
     were ripping it off.  It's in
     black and white, but wait'll
     you see it --

The SCREEN suddenly erupts into film of the interior
of a bank being entered in the wake of THREE MEN, two
of them black, and TWO WOMEN, one black and one white.
They disperse to various parts of the bank as if they
were here on legitimate business --

          DIANA
     The Ecumenical Liberation Army
     -- is that the one that
     kidnapped Patty Hearst?

          HERRON
     No, that's the Symbionese
     Liberation Army.  This is the
     Ecumenical Liberation Army.
     They're the ones who kidnapped
     Mary Ann Gifford three weeks ago.
     There's a hell of a lot of
     liberation armies in the
     revolutionary underground and
     a lot of kidnapped heiresses.
     That's Mary Ann Gifford --

This last in reference to the young white woman on
screen who is lugging a shopping bag as she joins a
line at a teller's window --

          DIANA
     You mean, they actually shot
     this film while they were ripping
     off the bank?

          HERRON
     Yeah, wait'll you see it.  I
     don't know whether to edit or
     leave it raw like this.  That's the
     Great Ahmed Khan; he's the leader --

ON SCREEN, the film has gone out of focus a couple of
times and bounced meaninglessly around the bank and
finally settled on a large, powerful black man at one
of the desks, presumably writing out a series of
deposit slips --

          DIANA
     This is terrific stuff.  Where
     did you get it?

          HERRON
     I got everything through Laureen
     Hobbs.  She's my contact for
     all this stuff.

          DIANA
     I thought she was straight
     Communist Party.

          HERRON
     Right.  But she's trying to unify
     all the factions in the
     underground, so she knows
     everybody.

ON SCREEN, the CAMERA has whooshed amateurishly about,
unfocuses and focuses again to pick up MARY ANN GIFFORD
bending over her shopping bag and pulling out a Czech
service submachine gun 9 Parabellum which she points to
the ceiling and apparently fires; the FILM is silent,
but the reactions of everyone around suggest clearly
something was fired.  The FILM gets fragmented and
panicky about here, as does the activity in the bank.
The PHONE at MAX's elbow BUZZES.  MAX picks it up.

          MAX
          (on the phone, while
          in b.g. a bank hold-
          up goes on screen)
     Yeah? ... All right, put him on --


26.   INT. THE NIGHTLY NEWS ROOM - ROOM 517

HARRY HUNTER, on phone, is using an empty desk in the
main room.  Normal news room activity in b.g. --

          HARRY HUNTER
          (on phone, leans back
          to call into HOWARD'S
          office)
     Howard -- I've got Max on four,
     would you pick up? --


27.   INT. HOWARD'S OFFICE

          HOWARD
          (picking up phone)
     Listen, Max, I'd like another
     shot --


28.   INT. SCREENING ROOM 7

The silent footage of the frenetic bank robbery is
still going on in b.g.

          MAX
          (on phone)
     Oh, come on, Howard --


29.   INT. HOWARD'S OFFICE

          HOWARD
          (on phone)
     I don't mean the whole show.
     I'd just like to come on, make
     some kind of brief farewell
     statement and then turn the
     show over to Jack Snowden.  I
     have eleven years at this
     network, Max.  I have some
     standing in this industry.
     I don't want to go out like a
     clown.  It'll be simple and
     dignified.  You and Harry
     can check the copy


30.   INT. NIGHTLY NEWS ROOM

ACROSS HARRY HUNTER on phone, looking through the open
door of HOWARD's office to HOWARD at his desk in b.g.

          HARRY HUNTER
          (on phone)
     -- I think it'll take the strain
     off the show, Max.  How much time
     do you want, Howard?

          HOWARD
          (in b.g., on phone)
     A minute forty-five, maybe two

          HARRY HUNTER
     All right, I'll give you two on
     the top, then we'll go to Jack
     Snowden with the Kissinger UN
     speech --


31.   INT. SCREENING ROOM 7

The show is over, the room lights are on.   In b.g.,
DIANA and HERRON stand, murmur to each other --

          MAX
          (on phone)
     And no booze today, Howard --

In b.g., DIANA and HERRON move for the door, wave good-
byes.  MAX waves slackly in return.  He can't help
noticing as DIANA leaves that she has the most
beautiful ass ever seen on a VP Programs --


32.   INT. HOWARD'S OFFICE

          HOWARD
          (on phone)
     No booze --

And hangs up.  For a moment, he just sits, scowling and
making curious little grimaces.  Then he stands,
removes his jacket, dumps it on a chair.  He rolls his
sleeves up and suddenly makes a strange little GRUNT.
He sits behind his desk, fits a piece of paper into
the machine and then, again, suddenly, he makes a
strange little GROWL --


33.   INT. NIGHTLY NEWS ROOM

Our PRODUCTION ASSISTANT, remembered perhaps from the
control room scene, passes HOWARD's open door and is
given pause by the strange little noises coming from
HOWARD's office.  She stands in the doorway a moment
watching HOWARD GRUNTING, GROWLING and SNARLING as he
CLACKS away at the typewriter --

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
     You all right, Mr. Beale?
          (BEALE nods)
     You want me to close your door,
     Mr. Beale?
          (HOWARD nods, types away,
          GRUNTS, GROWLS)

The PRODUCTION ASSISTANT closes the door.


34.   INT. 14TH FLOOR - UBS BUILDING - ELEVATOR AREA

DIANA and HERRON come out of one of the elevators and
turn left to the glass doors marked:  DEPARTMENT OF
PROGRAMMING.  They continue into --


35.   INT. PROGRAMMING DEPARTMENT - RECEPTION AREA

(Needless to say, there is no one at the receptionist's
desk.)  DIANA and HERRON head down --


36.   INT. PROGRAMMING DEPARTMENT - CORRIDOR

     DIANA pauses en route to lean into one of the
     offices --

          DIANA
     George, can you come in my office
     for a minute?

She and HERRON continue on, turn into --


37.   INT. PROGRAMMING DEPARTMENT - COMMON ROOM

Where the SECRETARIES are all slaving away, reading
magazines and chatting among themselves.  An occasional
PHONE RINGS.  At the far end of the room, a chunky
WOMAN in her late 30's is instructing her SECRETARY in
something.  DIANA hails her --

          DIANA
     Barbara, is Tommy around anywhere?

          BARBARA (in b.g.)
     I think so.

          DIANA
     I'd like to see the two of you
     for a moment --

She leads HERRON now into --


38.   INT. DIANA'S SECRETARY'S OFFICE

The SECRETARY hands a sheaf of telephone messages to
DIANA which she carries with her into --


39.   INT. DIANA'S OFFICE

DIANA enters, followed by HERRON.  She sits, skims
through her messages.  The office is executive-size,
windows looking out on the canyons of glass and stone
skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue, desk piled high with
scripts.  GEORGE BOSCH (VP Program Development East
Coast), a slight, balding man of 39, enters the office,
nods to HERRON, takes a seat; and is immediately
followed by BARBARA SCHLESINGER (Head of the Story
Department), the chunky lady just called in by DIANA,
and TOMMY PELLEGRINO (Assistant VP Programs), 36,
swarthy, coifed and mustachioed.  They find seats on
the chairs, the small couch.  HERRON remains standing --

          DIANA
          (introducing)
     This is Bill Herron from our
     West Coast Special Programs
     Department -- Barbara Schlesinger
     -- George Bosch -- Tommy
     Pellegrino -- Look, I just saw
     some rough footage of a special
     Bill's doing on the revolutionary
     underground.  Most of it's
     tedious stuff of Laureen Hobbs
     and four fatigue jackets muttering
     mutilated Marxism.  But he's got
     about eight minutes of a bank
     robbery that is absolutely
     sensational.  Authentic stuff.
     Actually shot while the robbery
     was going on.  Remember the Mary
     Ann Gifford kidnapping? Well,
     it's that bunch of nuts.  She's
     in the film shooting off machine
     guns.  Really terrific footage.
     I think we can get a hell of a
     movie of the week out of it,
     maybe even a series.

          PELLEGRINO
     A series out of what? What're
     we talking about?

          DIANA
     Look, we've got a bunch of
     hobgoblin radicals called the
     Ecumenical Liberation Army who
     go around taking home movies
     of themselves robbing banks.
     Maybe they'll take movies of
     themselves kidnapping heiresses,
     hijacking 747's, bombing bridges,
     assassinating ambassadors.
     We'd open each week's segment
     with that authentic footage,
     hire a couple of writers to
     write some story behind that
     footage, and we've got
     ourselves a series.

          BOSCH
     A series about a bunch of bank-
     robbing guerillas?

          SCHLESINGER
     What're we going to call it --
     the Mao Tse Tung Hour?

          DIANA
     Why not? They've got Strike
     Force, Task Force, SWAT -- why
     not Che Guevara and his own
     little mod squad?  Listen, I
     sent you all a concept analysis
     report yesterday.  Did any of
     you read it?
          (apparently not)
     Well, in a nutshell, it said the
     American people are turning sullen.
     They've been clobbered on all
     sides by Vietnam, Watergate, the
     inflation, the depression.
     They've turned off, shot up,
     and they've fucked themselves
     limp.  And nothing helps.  Evil
     still triumphs over all, Christ
     is a dope-dealing pimp, even sin
     turned out to be impotent.  The
     whole world seems to be going
     nuts and flipping off into space
     like an abandoned balloon.  So
     -- this concept analysis report
     concludes -- the American people
     want somebody to articulate their
     rage for them.  I've been telling
     you people since I took this job
     six months ago that I want angry
     shows.  I don't want conventional
     programming on this network.  I
     want counter-culture.  I want
     anti-establishment.

She closes the door.

          DIANA
     Now, I don't want to play butch
     boss with you people.  But when
     I took over this department,
     it had the worst programming
     record in television history.
     This network hasn't one show in
     the top twenty.  This network is
     an industry joke.  We better
     start putting together one winner
     for next September.  I want a
     show developed, based on the
     activities of a terrorist group.
     Joseph Stalin and his merry band
     of Bolsheviks.  I want ideas from
     you people.  And, by the way,
     the next time I send an audience
     research report around, you all
     better read it, or I'll sack the
     fucking lot of you, is that
     clear?
          (apparently, it is.
          She turns to HERRON)
     I'll be out on the coast in four
     weeks.  Can you set up a meeting
     with Laureen Hobbs for me?

          HERRON
     Sure.


40.   INT. A BANQUET ROOM - NEW YORK HILTON - WEDNESDAY -
3:00 P.M.

LONG SHOT.  A stockholders' meeting.  Standing room
only.  Some 200 STOCKHOLDERS seated in the audience;
others standing around the walls.  On the rostrum, a
phalanx of UBS CORPORATE EXECUTIVES, seated in three
rows, including EDWARD RUDDY, Chairman of the Board,
the PRESIDENTS and SENIOR VICE-PRESIDENTS of the other
divisions and other groups -- the UBS Records Group,
the UBS Publishing Group, the UBS Theater Chain, etc.
Representing the network are NELSON CHANEY and the
divisional heads -- GEORGE NICHOLS, President of the
Radio Division; NORMAN MOLDANIAN, President Owned
Stations; General Counsel WALTER AMUNDSEN, and, of
course, MAX SCHUMACHER, President of the News Division.
FRANK HACKETT, Senior Executive Vice President UBS-TV,
is at the lectern making the annual report --

          HACKETT
          (in the droning manner
          of such reports)
     ... but the business of management
     is management; and, at the time
     C. C. and A. took control, the
     UBS-TV network was foundering
     with less than seven percent of
     national television revenues,
     most network programs being sold
     at station rates.  I am therefore
     pleased to announce I am submitting
     to the Board of Directors a plan
     for the coordination of the main
     profit centers, and with the specific
     intention of making each division
     more responsive to management --

ANOTHER ANGLE SINGLING OUT MAX SCHUMACHER in the second
row of the phalanx of EXECUTIVES, bored with the
proceedings, and whispering to NELSON CHANEY seated
beside him.  INCLUDE in frame the 67 year old, silver-
haired Brahmin of television, EDWARD RUDDY, who is
seated in the front row.  HACKETT in b.g.  It is some
twenty minutes later --

          HACKETT
          (reading from his report)
     ... point one.  The division producing
     the lowest rate of return has been
     the News Division --

MAX suddenly begins paying attention --

          HACKETT
     -- with its 98 million dollar budget
     and its average annual deficit of 32
     million.  To me, it is inconceivable
     such a wanton fiscal affront go
     unresisted --

ANOTHER ANGLE ACROSS HACKETT with a smoldering MAX
SCHUMACHER in b.g. --

          HACKETT
     -- The new plan calls for local
     news to be transferred to Owned
     Stations Divisions --

MAX in b.g., stares angrily down his row towards NORMAN
MOLDANIAN, who studiously avoids his eye --

          HACKETT
     -- News-Radio would be transferred
     to the UBS Radio Division --

ACROSS MAX turning in his seat to scowl at GEORGE
NICHOLS in the row behind him --

          HACKETT (in b.g.)
     -- and, in effect, the News Division
     would be reduced --

MAX leaning forward trying to catch the eye of EDWARD
RUDDY in the front row.  RUDDY is staring stonily
ahead --

          HACKETT
     -- from an independent division to
     a department accountable to network --

MAX is about ready to blow his stack --


41.   INT. BANQUET ROOM - NEW YORK HILTON - WEDNESDAY - 5:30 PM.

The stockholders' meeting is over.  The floor is a
swirling CRUSH of STOCKHOLDERS mingling with EXECUTIVES.
MAX SCHUMACHER is elbowing his way through the crowded
aisle to get to where EDWARD RUDDY is chatting away
with a COUPLE of STOCKHOLDERS --

          MAX
          (to RUDDY)
     What was that all about, Ed? --

          RUDDY
          (turning to MAX, urbane)
     This is not the time, Max.

          MAX
          (barely containing himself)
     Why wasn't I told about this? Why
     was I led onto that podium and
     publicly guillotined in front of
     the stockholders?  Goddammit, I
     spoke to John Wheeler this morning,
     and he assured me the News Division
     was safe.  Are you trying to get
     me to resign?  It's a hell of a
     way to do it.

          RUDDY
          (silken murmur)
     We'll talk about this tomorrow
     at our regular morning meeting.

RUDDY turns back to the clutch of STOCKHOLDERS around
him.  MAX wheels away in a rage --


42.   EXT. NEW YORK HILTON HOTEL - SIXTH AVENUE - DUSK

The Sixth Avenue entrance to the hotel.  Taxis pulling
in, disgorging PEOPLE; taxis pulling out with new fares.
MAX comes striding out of the hotel, sore as a boil.
PAN HIM as he bulls his way through the line of taxis
and across jammed, clanging 5:50 P.M. Sixth Avenue --


43.   INT. UBS BUILDING - 5TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

MAX, steaming, strides down the corridor to --


44.   INT. ROOM 509 - NEWS DIV. EXECUTIVE OFFICES

Empty except for perhaps one SECRETARY pecking away
at her typewriter.  MAX strides across and into --


45.   INT. MAX'S OFFICE

MAX takes off his jacket, throws it on the couch, sits
behind his desk.  But he's too steamed to stay there
long.  A moment later, he's up again, strides around,
a caged lion.  He thumps his desk angrily, strides
around, then whips his jacket up from the couch and
strides out --


46.   INT. CONTROL ROOM - NETWORK NEWS SHOW

The wall CLOCK reads 6:28.  The DIRECTOR, TECHNICAL
DIRECTOR, LIGHTING DIRECTOR and PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
are at their long shelf in front of the double bank
of television monitors.  The AUDIO MAN is off in his
glassed-in cubicle.  HARRY HUNTER and his SECRETARY
and the UNIT MANAGER are on the raised level in the
back.  HUNTER is on the phone, looks up as the door to
the control room opens, and MAX, carrying his jacket,
comes in.  Curious looks from the PERSONNEL here;
presidents of news rarely come down to the control
room.  HUNTER finishes his phone call, offers his seat
to MAX, but MAX prefers standing in the back --

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
     ... five seconds --

          LIGHTING DIRECTOR
     -- picture's too thick --

          DIRECTOR
     -- coming to -- and one --

The show monitor, which has been showing color patterns,
now suddenly flicks on to show HOWARD BEALE as he looks
up from the sheaf of papers on his desk and says:

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     Good evening.  Today is Wednesday,
     September the twenty-fourth, and
     this is my last broadcast.  Yesterday,
     I announced on this program that I
     would commit public suicide, admittedly
     an act of madness.  Well, I'll tell
     you what happened -- I just ran out
     of bullshit --

          HARRY HUNTER
     All right, cut him off.

The MONITOR SCREEN goes black.

          MAX
          (from the back wall)
     Leave him on --

HOWARD's image promptly flicks back on --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
          (looking O.S.)
     Am I still on the air?

Everybody in the control room looks to MAX --

          MAX
     If this is how he wants to go out,
     this is how he goes out.

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     I don't know any other way to say
     it except I just ran out of bull-
     shit ...

The PHONE RINGS.  HUNTER picks it up.  ANOTHER PHONE
RINGS.  HUNTER'S SECRETARY picks it up.

          HUNTER
          (on first phone)
     Look, Mr. Schumacher's right here,
     do you want to talk to him?
          (extends the phone to MAX)

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     Bullshit is all the reasons we give
     for living, and, if we can't think
     up any reasons of our own, we always
     have the God bullshit --

          HUNTER'S SECRETARY
          (awe)
     Holy Mary Mother of Christ --

          MAX
          (on phone)
     Yeah, what is it, Tom? --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     We don't know why the hell we're
     going through all this pointless
     pain, humiliation and decay, so
     there better be someone somewhere
     who does know; that's the God
     bullshit --

          MAX
          (on phone)
     He's saying life is bullshit,
     and it is, so what're you
     screaming about? --

He hangs up.  The PHONE promptly RINGS again.  HUNTER'S
SECRETARY picks it up.  (HUNTER is on the phone that
rang before.)

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     If you don't like the God bullshit,
     how about the man bullshit? Man
     is a noble creature who can order
     his own world, who needs God?

          HUNTER'S SECRETARY
          (to MAX)
     Mr. Amundsen for you, Mr. Schumacher.

          MAX
     I'm not taking calls.

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     Well, if there's anybody out there
     who can look around this demented
     slaughterhouse of a world we live
     in and tell me man is a noble
     creature, that man is full of
     bullshit --

          DIRECTOR
          (staring in awe at
          HOWARD on the screen)
     I know he's sober, so he's got to
     be just plain nuts --
          (starts to giggle)

          HARRY HUNTER
          (screaming)
     What's so goddam funny?

          DIRECTOR
     I can't help it, Harry, it's funny --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     I don't have any kids --

A PHONE RINGS.  HUNTER'S SECRETARY picks it up.

          HARRY HUNTER
     Max, this is going out live to
     sixty-seven affiliates --

          MAX
     Leave him on.

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     -- and I was married for thirty-
     three years of shrill, shrieking
     fraud --

A breathless and distraught YOUNG WOMAN bursts into
the control room.

          YOUNG WOMAN
     Mr. Hackett's trying to get through
     to you --

          MAX
     Tell Mr. Hackett to go fuck himself --


47.   INT. DIANA'S OFFICE

DIANA, sitting alone in her office, watching HOWARD
BEALE on her office console --

          HOWARD (ON CONSOLE)
     I don't have any bullshit left.
     I just ran out of it, you see --


48.   INT. CONTROL ROOM - NETWORK NEWS SHOW

--  as FRANK HACKETT and his assistant, TOM CABELL,
wrench the door open and stride in --

          HACKETT
          (roaring)
     Get him off!  Are you people nuts?!

The TECHNICAL DIRECTOR taps a button, and the SCREEN
mercifully goes black.


49.   INT. LOBBY - UBS BUILDING               .

White-haired, patrician EDWARD RUDDY, Chairman of
the Board, impeccably groomed, fastidious in a light
topcoat, making his way through the absolute CRUSH
of NEWSPAPER PEOPLE, WIRE SERVICE PEOPLE, CAMERA CREWS
from CBS, NBC, ABC, from the local stations, WPIX,
WOR-TV, METROMEDIA, and from Channel 13, the educa-
tional channel.  A half dozen SECURITY GUARDS protect
the elevators, and three more help RUDDY get through
the GLARING CAMERA LIGHTS and the horde of REPORTERS
thrusting mikes at him --

          RUDDY
          (moving through the crowd)
     -- I'm sorry, I don't have all the
     facts yet --


50.   INT. 20TH FLOOR - LOBBY, LOUNGE, CORRIDOR

MAX, standing by the deserted reception desk, in the
empty, silent lounge.  This is the top-management floor,
and the decor, which is posh-austere, reflects the
eminence of the top executives who have their offices
here.  It is all silent and empty now, cathedral,
hushed, echoing.  Way down at the far end of the
corridor, the double doors of the corner office open,
and NELSON CHANEY leans out and beckons to MAX, who
starts down the plush carpeting in response --


51.   INT. MR. RUDDY'S OFFICE

Large, regal.  Impressionist originals on those walls
which are not glass through which the crepuscular
grandeur of New York at night can be seen.  RUDDY sits
behind his desk.  JOHN WHEELER, 59, silent, forceful,
lounges in one of the several leather chairs.  The
door opens, and NELSON CHANEY and MAX SCHUMACHER come
in.  Everybody nods at everybody else.  MAX slumps
into a leather chair.

          RUDDY
          (murmurs to CHANEY)
     I'll want to see Mr. Beale after
     this.

CHANEY promptly picks up a corner phone and calls down
to the Fourteenth Floor.

          RUDDY
          (regards MAX briefly,
          murmurs)
     The way I hear it, Max, you're
     primarily responsible for this
     colossally stupid prank.  Is
     that the fact, Max?

          MAX
     That's the fact.

          RUDDY
     It was unconscionable.  There
     doesn't seem to be anything more
     to say.

          MAX
     I have something to say, Ed.
     I'd like to know why that whole
     debasement of the News Division
     announced at the stockholders'
     meeting today was kept secret from
     me.  You and I go back twenty
     years, Ed.  I took this job with
     your personal assurance that you
     would back my autonomy against
     any encroachment.  But ever since
     CCA acquired control of the UBS
     Systems ten months ago, Hackett's
     been taking over everything.  Who
     the hell's running this network,
     you or some conglomerate called
     CCA?  I mean, you're the Chairman
     of the Systems Group, and Frank
     Hackett's just CCA's hatchet man.
     Nelson here -- for Pete's sake, he's
     the president of the network -- he
     hasn't got anything to say about
     anything anymore.  Who the hell's
     running this company, you or CCA?

          RUDDY
          (murmurs)
     I told you at the stockholders'
     meeting, Max, that we would discuss
     all that at our regular meeting
     tomorrow morning.  If you had been
     patient, I would've explained to
     you that I too thought Frank Hackett
     precipitate and that the reorgani-
     zation of the News Division would
     not be executed until everyone,
     specifically you, Max, had been
     consulted and satisfied.  Instead,
     you sulked off like a child and
     engaged this network in a shocking
     and disgraceful episode.  Your
     position here is no longer tenable
     regardless of how management is
     restructured.  I expect you to
     bring in your resignation at ten
     o'clock tomorrow morning, and we
     will coordinate our statements to
     the least detriment of everyone.
          (to WHEELER)
     Bob McDonough will take over the
     News Division till we sort all
     this out.
          (WHEELER nods.  RUDDY turns
          to CHANEY still in the corner
          of the room on the phone)
     I'd like to see Mr. Beale now --

          CHANEY
          (on phone)
     They're looking for him, Ed.  They
     don't know where he is --


52.   INT. LOBBY - UBS BUILDING

HOWARD BEALE, bleached almost white by the GLARE of
the CAMERA LIGHTS, and almost totally obscured by the
tidal CRUSH of cameras, REPORTERS, SECURITY GUARDS
around him --

          HOWARD
     -- every day, five days a week,
     for fifteen years, I've been
     sitting behind that desk -- the
     dispassionate pundit --


53.   INT. DIANA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

DIANA, naked, sitting on the edge of her bed in a
dark bedroom, watching HOWARD BEALE's impromptu press
conference on television --

          HOWARD
          (on TV screen)
     -- reporting with seemly detachment
     the daily parade of lunacies that
     constitute the news -- and --

Also on the bed is a naked young STUD, who isn't really
that interested in the 11:00 News.  He is fondling,
fingering, noodling and nuzzling DIANA with the clear
intention of mounting her --

          HOWARD
          (on TV screen)
     -- just once I wanted to say what
     I really felt --

The young STUD is getting around to nibbling at DIANA's
breasts --

          DIANA
          (watching the TV set
          with single-minded
          intensity)
     Knock it off, Arthur --


54.   EXT. UBS BUILDING - 9:00 A.M., THURSDAY, SEPT. 25 - DAY

Bright morning sunshine.  DIANA, in a pants suit and
carrying half a dozen scripts, enters the building --


55.   INT. UBS BUILDING - LOBBY

DIANA, pausing at the newsstand to pick up the morning
papers, which she reads en route to the elevators --


56.   INT. UBS BUILDING - 14TH FLOOR - 9:15 A.M.

DIANA briskly enters through the door marked:
DEPARTMENT OF PROGRAMMING, and whisks off down the
corridor --

57.   INT. PROGRAMMING DEPARTMENT - COMMON ROOM

DIANA crosses to her own office.  THREE SECRETARIES,
including DIANA's, are abuzz in a corner over last
night's Howard Beale show.  DIANA'S SECRETARY scurries
to follow DIANA as, in b.g., BARBARA SCHLESINGER comes
out of her office carrying four scripts --


58.   INT. DIANA'S OUTER OFFICE

DIANA, rummaging through the papers on top of the
SECRETARY's desk as the SECRETARY enters --

          DIANA
     Did the overnight ratings come
     in yet?

          SECRETARY
     They're on your desk.

          DIANA
     Have you still got yesterday's
     overnights around?

          SECRETARY
     Shall I bring them in?

          DIANA
     Yeah --

She exits into --


59.   INT. DIANA'S OFFICE

Morning SUNLIGHT blasting in.  DIANA moves to her
desk, stands behind it, scanning the front pages of
the newspapers piled on her desk, then sits and studies
the overnight ratings also on her desk.  The SECRETARY
enters with yesterday's overnights, a sheet of paper,
which she extends to DIANA, who promptly studies them.
The SECRETARY exits as BARBARA SCHLESINGER enters,
sinks onto a chair with a sigh --

          SCHLESINGER
     These are those four outlines
     submitted by Universal for an hour
     series.  You needn't bother to
     read them.  I'll tell them to
     you.  The first one is set in a
     large Eastern law school, pre-
     sumably Harvard.  The series is
     irresistibly entitled The Young
     Lawyers.  The running characters
     are a crusty but benign ex-Supreme
     Court Justice, presumably Oliver
     Wendell Holmes by way of Dr. Zorba.
     There is a beautiful girl graduate
     student and the local district
     attorney who is brilliant and
     sometimes cuts corners --

          DIANA
          (studying the overnights)
     Next one --

          SCHLESINGER
     The second one is called The Amazon
     Squad --

          DIANA
          (studying the overnights)
     Lady cops?

          SCHLESINGER
     The running characters are a crusty
     but benign police lieutenant who's
     always getting heat from the
     Commissioner, a hard-nosed, hard-
     drinking detective who thinks
     women belong in the kitchen, and
     a brilliant and beautiful young
     girl cop fighting the feminist
     battle on the force --

          DIANA
          (now studying the front
          page of the Daily News)
     We're up to our ears in lady cop
     shows.

          SCHLESINGER
     The next one is another investi-
     gative reporter show.  A crusty
     but benign managing editor who's
     always getting heat from the
     publisher --

          DIANA
     The Arabs have decided to jack up
     the price of oil another twenty
     per cent, and the C.I.A. has been
     caught opening Senator Humphrey's
     mail, there's  a civil war in Angola,
     another one in Beirut, New York City's
     facing default, they've finally caught
     up with Patricia Hearst, and --
          (she flips the Daily News over
          so BARBARA can read it)
     -- the whole front page of the Daily
     News is Howard Beale.

ACROSS BARBARA SCHLESINGER, half-standing so she can
read the newspaper and showing the front page of the
Daily News -- which consists of a 3/4 page blowup of
HOWARD BEALE topped by a 52 point black banner headline:
-- BEALE FIRED --

          DIANA
     -- it was also a two-column story
     on page one of the Times --
          (calls to her SECRETARY)
     Helen, call Mr. Hackett's office,
     see if he can give me a few minutes
     this morning --


60.   INT. ROOM 520 - THE NETWORK NEWS ROOM - 9:30 A.M.

MAX SCHUMACHER and BOB McDONOUGH (mid-40's) enter.
The Network News Room is something less than Front
Page, but, nevertheless, a news room.  It's a long,
large, windowless room, some 40 desks, mostly
unoccupied, a wire room, typewriters and banks of
television monitors on the wall.  At the moment,
work has stopped, and the ENTIRE PERSONNEL of the news
room, some 60 PEOPLE -- EXECUTIVES and SECRETARIES,
PRODUCERS, ASSISTANT PRODUCERS, HEAD WRITERS, WRITERS,
DUTY AND ASSIGNMENT EDITORS, and DESK ASSISTANTS,
ARTISTS, and FILM AND TAPE EDITORS, REPORTERS,
NEWSCASTERS and CAMERA AND AUDIO MEN -- are all
gathered, standing and sitting about to hear MAX say --

          MAX
     Ladies and gentlemen, I've been
     at this network twelve years, and
     it's been on the whole a ball --

          VOICE (in b.g.)
     Louder --

          MAX
          (louder)
     -- and I want to thank you all.
     Bob McDonough here will be taking
     over for me for the time being,
     and, much as I hate to admit it,
     I'm sure everything will go along
     just fine without me --


61.   INT. UBS BUILDING - 15TH FLOOR - 10:00 A.M.

DIANA turning into --


62.   INT. HACKETT'S OUTER OFFICE

The SECRETARY waves DIANA straight into --


63.   INT. HACKETT'S OFFICE

where HACKETT sits unhappily at his desk poring over
memos from his Stations Relations Department and
reports from his Sales Department.

          HACKETT
          (not bothering to
          look up)
     KTNS Kansas City refuses to carry
     our network news any more unless
     Beale is taken off the air --

          DIANA
          (drops the sheet of
          paper on HACKETT's
          desk)
     Did you see the overnights on the
     Network News?  It has an 8 in New
     York and a 9 in L.A. and a 27 share
     in both cities.  Last night, Howard
     Beale went on the air and yelled
     bullshit for two minutes, and I
     can tell you right now that tonight's
     show will get a 30 share at least.
     I think we've lucked into something.

          HACKETT
     Oh, for God's sakes, are you
     suggesting we put that lunatic
     back on the air yelling bullshit?

          DIANA
     Yes, I think we should put Beale

     back on the air tonight and keep
     him On.  Did you see the Times
     this morning?  Did you see the
     News? We've got press coverage
     on this you couldn't buy for a
     million dollars.  Frank, that dumb
     show jumped five rating points in
     one night!  Tonight's show has got
     to be at least fifteen!  We just
     increased our audience by twenty
     or thirty million people in one
     night.  You're not going to get
     something like this dumped in your
     lap for the rest of your days, and
     you just can't piss it away!
     Howard Beale got up there last
     night and said what every American
     feels -- that he's tired of all the
     bullshit.  He's articulating the
     popular rage.  I want that show,
     Frank.  I can turn that show into
     the biggest smash in television.

          HACKETT
     What do you mean, you want that
     show?  It's a news show.  It's not
     your department.

          DIANA
     I see Howard Beale as a latter-day
     prophet, a magnificent messianic
     figure, inveighing against the
     hypocrisies of our times, a strip
     Savonarola, Monday through Friday.
     I tell you, Frank, that could just
     go through the roof.  And I'm talking
     about a six dollar cost per thousand
     show!  I'm talking about a hundred,
     a hundred thirty thousand dollar
     minutes!  Do you want to figure out
     the revenues of a strip show that
     sells for a hundred thousand bucks
     a minute?  One show like that could
     pull this whole network right out
     of the hole!  Now, Frank, it's being
     handed to us on a plate; let's not
     blow it!

HACKETT's intercom BUZZES.

          HACKETT
          (on intercom)
     Yes? ... Tell him I'll be a few
     minutes.
          (clicks off, regards DIANA)
     Let me think it over.

          DIANA
     Frank, let's not go to committee
     about this.  It's twenty after ten,
     and we want Beale in that studio
     by half-past six.  We don't want
     to lose the momentum --

          HACKETT
     For God's sakes, Diana, we're
     talking about putting a manifestly
     irresponsible man on national
     television.  I'd like to talk to
     Legal Affairs at least.  And Herb
     Thackeray and certainly Joe Donnelly
     and Standards and Practices.  And
     you know I'm going to be eyeball
     to eyeball with Mr. Ruddy on this.
     If I'm going to the mat with Ruddy,
     I want to make sure of some of my
     ground.  I'm the one whose ass is
     going on the line.  I'll get back
     to you, Diana.


64.   INT. EXECUTIVE DINING ROOM - 12:20 P.M.

A large room of white-linened tables, almost empty
save for the five men at one of the window tables,
with the spectacular view of midtown Manhattan.
The five are FRANK HACKETT, NELSON CHANEY, WALTER
AMUNDSEN (General Counsel Network,) ARTHUR ZANGWILL
(VP Standards and Practices,) and JOE DONNELLY (VP
Sales).

          CHANEY
          (who is standing)
     I don't believe this!  I don't
     believe the top brass of a national
     television network are sitting
     around their Caesar salads --

          HACKETT
     The top brass of a bankrupt national
     television network, with projected
     losses of close to a hundred and
     fifty million dollars this year.

          CHANEY
     I don't care how bankrupt!  You
     can't seriously be proposing and
     the rest of us seriously consider-
     ing putting on a pornographic
     network news show!  The FCC will
     kill us!

          HACKETT
     Sit down, Nelson.  The FCC can't
     do anything except rap our knuckles.

CHANEY sits.

          AMUNDSEN
     I don't even want to think about
     the litigious possibilities, Frank.
     We could be up to our ears in
     lawsuits.

          CHANEY
     The affiliates won't carry it --

          HACKETT
     The affiliates will kiss your ass
     if you can hand them a hit show.

          CHANEY
     The popular reaction --

          HACKETT
     We don't know the popular reaction.
     That's what we have to find out.

          CHANEY
     The New York Times --

          HACKETT
     The New York Times doesn't advertise
     on our network.

          CHANEY
          (stands)
     All I know is that this violates
     every canon of respectable broad-
     casting.

          HACKETT
     We're not a respectable network.
     We're a whorehouse network, and we
     have to take whatever we can get.

          CHANEY
     Well, I don't want any part of it.
     I don't fancy myself the president
     of a whorehouse.

          HACKETT
     That's very commendable of you,
     Nelson.  Now, sit down.  Your
     indignation has been duly recorded,
     you can always resign tomorrow.

CHANEY sits.

          HACKETT
     Look, what in substance are we
     proposing? -- merely to add
     editorial comment to our network
     news show.  Brinkley, Sevareid,
     and Reasoner all have their comments.
     So now Howard Beale will have his.
     I think we ought to give it a shot.
     Let's see what happens tonight.

          DONNELLY
     Well, I don't want to be the
     Babylonian messenger who has to
     tell Max Schumacher about this.

          HACKETT
          (flagging a WAITER)
     Max Schumacher doesn't work at
     this network any more.  Mr. Ruddy
     fired him last night.
          (to the WAITER)
     A telephone, please --
          (to his COLLEAGUES)
     Bob McDonoguh's running the News
     Division now --

A phone is placed before HACKETT, who promptly picks
it up and murmurs:

          HACKETT
          (on phone)
     Bob McDonough in News, please --


65.   INT. MAX'S OFFICE - 1:40 P.M.

MAX is on the phone and cleaning out his desk and
office at the same time.  There are empty cartons
everywhere into which MAX is dumping his files.  There
are piles of files on his desk, which he is skimming
through even as he talks on the phone --

          MAX
          (on phone)
     -- I'm just fine financially,
     Fred.  I cashed in my stock
     options back in April when CC
     and A took over the network
          (his other phone BUZZES)
     That's my other phone, Fred, thanks
     for calling --
          (hangs up, picks up
          the other phone)
     Max Schumacher . .. Hi, Dick,
     how's everything at NBC? --

HOWARD BEALE walks in, carrying an 8 x 12 photograph --

          MAX
     I don't know, Dick.  I might teach,
     I might write a book, whatever the
     hell one does when one approaches
     the autumn of one's years --

HOWARD puts the photograph on the desk in front of MAX.

          MAX
          (studying the photograph)
     My God, is that me? Was I ever
     that young?
          (on phone)
     Howard just showed me a picture
     of the whole Ed Murrow gang when
     I was at CBS.  My God, Bob Trout,
     Harry Reasoner, Cronkite, Hollenbeck,
     and that's you, Howard, right? --
     I'll see you, Dick --

Hangs up.

          HOWARD
          (points to the photo)
     You remember this kid? He's the
     kid I think you once sent out to
     interview Cleveland Amory on
     vivisection --

          MAX
          (beginning to shake
          with laughter)
     That's him -- that's him --

They both begin wheezing with laughter.  MILTON STEINMAN
pokes his head in --

          STEINMAN
     What the hell's so funny?


66.   INT. ROOM 509 - EXECUTIVE OFFICES, NEWS DIVISION

BOB McDONOUGH (VP Network News and interim head of the
division) enters, frowning.  There is a clot of PEOPLE
spilling out from MAX SCHUMACHER's office from whence
sounds of LAUGHTER and SHOUTING emanate.  Even the
SECRETARIES have left their desks to share the fun.
McDONOUGH, wondering what the hell it's all about,
makes his way through the CRUSH at the door, murmuring:
"Excuse me ... sorry, honey ... etc."  When he finally
gets through the outer office and into --


67.   INT. MAX'S OFFICE

-- what he sees is a room filled with News Executives
-- MAX, HOWARD, HARRY HUNTER, WALTER GIANINI (Legal
Affairs), MICHAEL SANDIES, MILTON STEINMAN, and a
COUPLE of younger PRODUCERS, delightedly listening to
this gang of middle-aged men remembering their maverick
days --

          MAX
     -- I jump out of bed in my pajamas!
     I grab my raincoat, run down the
     stairs, run out into the middle of
     the street, flag a cab.  I jump in,
     I yell:  "Take me to the middle of
     the George Washington Bridge!" --

HOWL of LAUGHTER --

          MAX
     -- The driver turns around, he
     says:  "Don't do it, kid, you
     got your whole life ahead of you!"


The room ROCKS with LAUGHTER.  When it subsides, BOB
McDONOUGH, standing in the doorway, says:

          McDONOUGH
     Well, if you think that's funny,
     wait'll you hear this.  I've
     just come down from Frank
     Hackett's office, and he wants
     to put Howard back on the air
     tonight.  Apparently, the ratings
     jumped five points last night,
     and he wants Howard to go back
     on and do his angry-man thing.

          STEINMAN
     What're you talking about?

          McDONOUGH
     I'm telling you -- they want
     Howard to go on yelling bullshit.
     They want Howard to go on
     spontaneously letting out his
     anger, a latter-day prophet,
     denouncing the hypocrisies
     of our times --

          HOWARD
     Hey, that sounds pretty good --

          MAX
     Who's this they?

          McDONOUGH
     Hackett.  Chaney was there, the
     Legal Affairs guy, and that
     girl from Programming.

          MAX
     Christenson?  What's she got to
     do with it?

          GIANINI (in b.g.)
     You're kidding, aren't you, Bob?

          McDONOUGH
     I'm not kidding.  I told them:
     "We're running a news department
     down there, not a circus.  And
     Howard Beale isn't a bearded lady.
     And if you think I'll go along
     with this bastardization of the
     news, you can have my resignation
     along with Max Schumacher's right
     now.  And I think I'm speaking
     for Howard Beale and everybody
     else down there in News.

          HOWARD
     Hold it, McDonough, that's my
     job you're turning down.  I'll go
     nuts without some kind of work.
     What's wrong with being an angry
     prophet denouncing the hypocrisies
     of our times? What do you think,
     Max?

          MAX
     Do you want to be an angry prophet
     denouncing the hypocrisies of
     our times?

          HOWARD
     Yeah, I think I'd like to be
     an angry prophet denouncing
     the hypocrisies of our times.

          MAX
     Then grab it.


68.   INT. 5TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - 3:00 P.M.

MR. RUDDY, slim, slight, white-haired, imperially
elegant in banker's gray, comes down the corridor
towards Room 509.  A VIDEOTAPE MAN, popping out of one
of the rooms that debouch off this corridor, quickly
stops, stands still --

          VIDEOTAPE MAN
          (murmurs)
     Afternoon, Mr. Ruddy --

          RUDDY
          (murmurs)
     Good afternoon.

He passes on towards --


69.   INT. ROOM 509

as RUDDY enters.  The SIX SECRETARIES pecking away at
their typewriters all pause to murmur awed --

          SECRETARIES
     Good afternoon, Mr. Ruddy --
     Good afternoon, Mr. Ruddy -- etc.

--  as RUDDY passes through to --


70.   INT. MAX'S OUTER OFFICE

where MITZI (MAX'S SECRETARY), at her desk, murmurs:

          MITZI
     He's waiting for you, Mr. Ruddy --

          RUDDY
          (murmurs)
     Thank you.

He goes into --


71.   INT. MAX'S OFFICE

-- and closes the door.

          RUDDY
     Nelson Chaney tells me Beale may
     actually go on the air this evening.

          MAX
     As far as I know, Howard's going
     to do it.  Are you going to sit
     still for this, Ed?

          RUDDY
          (takes a folded piece
          of paper from his
          inside jacket pocket)
     Yes.  I think Hackett's overstepped
     himself.  There's some kind of
     corporate maneuvering going on,
     Max.  Hackett is clearly forcing
     a confrontation.  That would
     account for his behavior at the
     stockholders' meeting.  However,
     I think he's making a serious
     mistake with this Beale business.
     C. C. and A. would never make such
     an open act of brigandage,
     especially against the News
     Division.  They are specifically
     enjoined against any manipulation
     of the News Division in the
     consent decree.  I suspect C. C.
     and A. will be upset by Hackett's
     presumptuousness, certainly Mr.
     Jensen will.  So I'm going to let
     Hackett have his head for awhile.
     He just might lose it over this
     Beale business.
          (places the paper
          on MAX's desk)
     I'd like you to reconsider your
     resignation.
          (moves to the couch,
          sits, crosses his legs,
          murmurs)
     I have to assume Hackett wouldn't
     take such steps without some
     support on the C. C. and A. board.
     I'll have to go directly to Mr.
     Jensen.  When that happens, I'm
     going to need every friend I've
     got.  And I certainly don't want
     Hackett's people in all the
     divisional positions.  So I'd
     like you to stay on, Max.

          MAX
     Of course, Ed.

          RUDDY
          (stands)
     Thank you, Max.

He opens the door and leaves.


72.   INT. MAX'S OFFICE - WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 1 - 7:00 P.M.

MAX sitting alone behind his desk in a dark office lit
only by his desk lamp, watching the Network News Show
starring HOWARD BEALE on his office console --

          NARRATOR
     The initial response to the new
     Howard Beale was not auspicatory.
     The press was without exception
     hostile and industry reaction
     negative.  The ratings for the
     Thursday and Friday show were
     both 14 and with a 37 share,
     but Monday's rating dropped
     two points, clearly suggesting
     the novelty had worn off --

On the office console, HOWARD BEALE doesn't seem too
much different than he had always been.  He scowls,
frowns, seems to be muttering --

          NARRATOR
     -- Indeed, Howard Beale played
     his new role of latter-day
     prophet poorly.  He was, after
     all, a newsman, not an actor.
     He was uncertain, uncomfortable,
     sometimes inaudible.  The general
     feeling around the network was
     that this new Howard Beale would
     be aborted in a matter of days --


73.   INT. MAX'S OFFICE - LATER

On the office console, the Network News Show has come
to an end; the CLOSING THEME MUSIC emerges into
SOUND, and the show's CREDITS begin to roll.  MAX
clicks off the set, folds his hands on the desk and
sits glumly regarding his folded hands.  After a
moment, he becomes aware of another presence in the
room and looks to the doorway where DIANA CHRISTENSON
is standing, wearing a white blouse and dark slacks
and carrying her jacket and purse.  If we haven't
already noticed how attractive she is, we do now --
standing as she is, framed in the doorway, backlit
by the lights of the deserted common room, suddenly
sensuous, even voluptuous.

          DIANA
          (entering the office)
     Did you know there are a number
     of psychics working as licensed
     brokers on Wall Street?
          (she sits across from
          MAX, fishes a cigarette
          out of her purse)
     Some of them counsel their clients
     by use of Tarot cards.  They're
     all pretty successful, even in a
     bear market and selling short.
     I met one of them a couple of
     weeks ago and thought of doing
     a show around her -- The Wayward
     Witch of Wall Street, something
     like that.  But, of course, if
     her tips were any good, she
     could wreck the market.  So I
     called her this morning and
     asked her how she was on
     predicting the future.  She said
     she was occasionally prescient.
     "For example", she said, "I
     just had a fleeting vision of
     you sitting in an office with
     a craggy middle-aged man with
     whom you are or will be
     emotionally involved."
     And here I am.

          MAX
     She does all this with Tarot cards?

          DIANA
     No, this one operates on
     parapsychology.  She has trance-
     like episodes and feels things
     in her energy field.  I think
     this lady can be very useful
     to you, Max.

          MAX
     In what way?

          DIANA
     Well, you put on news shows,
     and here's someone who can
     predict tomorrow's news for you.
     Her name, aptly enough, is Sibyl.
     Sybil the Soothsayer.  You could
     give her two minutes of trance
     at the end of a Howard Beale show,
     say once a week, Friday, which is
     suggestively occult, and she
     could oraculate.  Then next week,
     everyone tunes in to see how
     good her predictions were.

          MAX
     Maybe she could do the weather.

          DIANA
          (smiles)
     Your network news show is going
     to need some help, Max, if it's
     going to hold.  Beale doesn't
     do the angry man thing well at
     all.  He's too kvetchy.  He's
     being irascible.  We want a
     prophet, not a curmudgeon.  He
     should do more apocalyptic doom.
     I think you should take on a
     couple of writers to write some
     jeremiads for him.  I see you
     don't fancy my suggestions.

          MAX
     Hell, you're not being serious,
     are you?

          DIANA
     Oh, I'm serious.  The fact is,
     I could make your Beale show the
     highest-rated news show in
     television, if you'd let me
     have a crack at it.

          MAX
     What do you mean, have a crack
     at it?

          DIANA
     I'd like to program it for you,
     develop it.  I wouldn't interfere
     with the actual news.  But teevee
     is show biz, Max, and even the
     News has to have a little
     showmanship.

          MAX
     My God, you are serious.

          DIANA
     I watched your six o'clock news
     today -- it's straight tabloid.
     You had a minute and a half on
     that lady riding a bike naked in
     Central Park.  On the other hand,
     you had less than a minute of
     hard national and international
     news.  It was all sex, scandal,
     brutal crimes, sports, children
     with incurable diseases and
     lost puppies.  So I don't think
     I'll listen to any protestations
     of high standards of journalism.
     You're right down in the street
     soliciting audiences like the
     rest of us.  All I'm saying is,
     if you're going to hustle, at
     least do it right.  I'm going to
     bring this up at tomorrow's
     network meeting, but I don't like
     network hassles, and I was hoping
     you and I could work this out
     between us.  That's why I'm here
     right now.

          MAX
          (sighs)
     And I was hoping you were looking
     for an emotional involvement with
     a craggy middle-aged man.

          DIANA
     I wouldn't rule that out entirely.

They appraise each other for a moment; clearly, there
are the possibilities of something more than a
professional relationship here.

          MAX
     Well, Diana, you bring all your
     ideas up at the meeting tomorrow.
     Because, if you don't, I will.
     I think Howard is making a goddam
     fool of himself, and so does
     everybody Howard and I know in
     this industry.  It was a fluke.
     It didn't work.  Tomorrow, Howard
     goes back to the old format and
     this gutter depravity comes
     to an end.

          DIANA
          (smiles, stands)
     Okay.

She leans forward to flick her ash into MAX's desk ash
tray.  Half-shaded as she is by the cone of light
issuing from the desk lamp, it is nipple-clear she is
bra-less, and MAX cannot help but note the assertive
swells of her body.  DIANA moves languidly to the door
and would leave but MAX suddenly says:

          MAX
     I don't get it, Diana.  You
     hung around till half-past seven
     and came all the way down here
     just to pitch a couple of loony
     show biz ideas when you knew
     goddam well I'd laugh you out
     of this office.  I don't get
     it.  What's your scam in this
     anyway?

DIANA moves back to the desk and crushes her cigarette
out in the desk tray.

          DIANA
     Max, I don't know why you
     suddenly changed your mind
     about resigning, but I do know
     Hackett's going to throw you
     out on your ass in January.
     My little visit here tonight
     was just a courtesy made out
     of respect for your stature
     in the industry and because
     I've personally admired you
     ever since I was a kid majoring
     in speech at the University of
     Missouri.  But sooner or later,
     now or in January, with or
     without you, I'm going to take
     over your network news show,
     and I figured I might as well
     start tonight.

          MAX
     I think I once gave a lecture
     at the University of Missouri.

          DIANA
     I was in the audience.  I had
     a terrible schoolgirl crush
     on you for a couple of months.

She smiles, glides to the doorway again.

          MAX
     Listen, if we can get back for
     a moment to that gypsy who
     predicted all that about
     emotional involvements and
     middle-aged men -- what're
     you doing for dinner tonight?

DIANA pauses in the doorway, and then moves back
briskly to the desk, picks up the telephone receiver,
taps out a telephone number, waits for a moment --

          DIANA
          (on phone)
     I can't make it tonight, luv,
     call me tomorrow.

She returns the receiver to its cradle, looks at MAX;
their eyes lock.

          MAX
     Do you have any favorite
     restaurant?

          DIANA
     I eat anything.

          MAX
     Son of a bitch, I get the
     feeling I'm being made.

          DIANA
     You sure are.

          MAX
     I better warn you I don't do
     anything on the first date.

          DIANA
     We'll see.

She moves for the door.  MAX stares down at his desk.

          MAX
          (mutters)
     Schmuck, what're you getting into?

He sighs, stands, flicks off his desk lamp.


74.   INT. A RESTAURANT

MAX and DIANA at the end of their dinner.  In fact,
MAX is flagging a WAITER for two coffees, black --

          DIANA
          (plying away at
          her ice cream)
     You're married, surely.

          MAX
     Twenty-six years.  I have a
     married daughter in Seattle who's
     six months pregnant, and a
     younger girl who starts at
     Northwestern in January.

          DIANA
     -- Well, Max, here we are --
     middle-aged man reaffirming his
     middle-aged manhood and a
     terrified young woman with a
     father complex.  What sort of
     script do you think we can
     make out of this?

          MAX
     Terrified, are you?

          DIANA
          (pushes her ice cream
          away, regards him
          affably)
     Terrified out of my skull, man.
     I'm the hip generation, man,
     right on, cool, groovy, the
     greening of America, man,
     remember all that? God, what
     humbugs we were.  In my first
     year at college, I lived in a
     commune, dropped acid daily,
     joined four radical groups and
     fucked myself silly on a bare
     wooden floor while somebody
     chanted Sufi sutras.  I lost six
     weeks of my sophomore year
     because they put me away for
     trying to jump off the top floor
     of the Administration Building.
     I've been on the top floor ever
     since.  Don't open any windows
     around me because I just might
     jump out.  Am I scaring you off?

          MAX
     No.

          DIANA
     I was married for four years and
     pretended to be happy and had
     six years of analysis and pretended
     to be sane.  My husband ran off
     with his boyfriend, and I had an
     affair with my analyst.  He told
     me I was the worst lay he had
     ever had.  I can't tell you how
     many men have told me what a
     lousy lay I am.  I apparently
     have a masculine temperament.
     I arouse quickly, consummate
     prematurely, and can't wait to
     get my clothes back on and get
     out of that bedroom.  I seem
     to be inept at everything except
     my work.  I'm goddam good at my
     work and so I confine myself

     to that.  All I want out of life
     is a 30 share and a 20 rating.

The WAITER brings the coffee.

          MAX
          (sipping coffee)
     The corridor gossip says you're
     Frank Hackett's backstage girl.

          DIANA
          (sipping coffee, smiles)
     I'm not.  Frank's a corporation
     man, body and soul.  He surrendered
     his spirit to C. C. and A. years
     ago.  He's a marketing-merchandising
     management machine, precision-
     tooled for corporate success.
     He's married to one C. C. and A.
     board member's daughter, he
     attends another board member's
     church, his children aged two
     and five are already enrolled
     in a third board member's alma
     mater.  He has no loves, lusts
     or allegiances that are not
     consummately directed towards
     becoming a C. C. and A. board
     member himself.  So why should
     he bother with me? I'm not
     even a stockholder.

          MAX
     How about your loves, lusts
     and allegiances?

They smile at each other.

          DIANA
     Is your wife in town?

          MAX
     Yes.

          DIANA
     Well, then, we better go to
     my place.


75.   INT. DIANA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

Dark.  Blinds drawn.  MAX and DIANA lying naked on a
maelstrom of sheets, both still puffing from what
must have been an ebullient bout in the sack --

          DIANA
     Wow, and you were the guy who
     kept telling me how he was going
     to be a grandfather in three
     months.

          MAX
     Hell, you were the girl who
     kept telling me what a lousy
     lay she was.

She bounces out of bed and stands naked in the shadowed
darkness, arms akimbo, looking happily down at MAX on
the bed.

          DIANA
     All right, enough of this
     love-making.  Are you going
     to let me take over your
     network news show or not?

          MAX
          (laughs)
     Forget it.  Tomorrow, Howard
     Beale goes back to being a
     straight anchorman.  I'll tell
     him first thing tomorrow morning.


76.   INT. HOWARD BEALE'S BEDROOM

HOWARD BEALE, fast asleep in his dark, empty, hushed
room.

          HOWARD
          (suddenly)
     I can't hear you.  You'll have
     to speak a little louder.

He gets up on one elbow, eyes still closed, cocks his
head as if he were listening to someone mumbling from
the rocking chair across the room.

          HOWARD
     You're kidding.  How the hell
     would I know what the truth is?

He sits up, gets out of bed, walks around and perches
on the foot of the bed, stares at the empty rocker,
nods his head as if he is following a complicated
argument --

          HOWARD
     What the hell is this, the
     burning bush?  For God's sake,
     I'm not Moses --

Whoever he thinks he is talking to apparently gets up
and crosses the room to the overstuffed chair and sits
there, since HOWARD follows this movement with his eyes
and finally gets up and perches on the side of his bed
in order to continue the curious conversation.


          HOWARD
     Why me?  I'm a deteriorating
     old man.

HOWARD listens, sighs, shrugs:

          HOWARD
     Okay.


77.   EXT. UBS BUILDING - THURSDAY, OCT. 2, 9:00 A.M. - DAY

Bright sunny day to establish the next morning.


78.   INT. ROOM 517 - NIGHTLY NEWS ROOM

MAX enters.  The usual morning hum of activity.  PHONES
RING.  HARRY HUNTER, going over some wire releases with
his HEAD WRITER, looks up as MAX approaches --

          MAX
     Howard in his office?
          (HUNTER nods)
     Harry, I'm killing this whole
     screwball angry prophet thing.
     We're going back to straight
     news as of tonight's show.

          HUNTER
     Okay.

MAX veers off for --


79.   INT. HOWARD'S OFFICE

HOWARD at his typewriter, clicking away.   MAX leans
in through the open doorway --

          MAX
     Howard, we're going back to
     straight news tonight.  You
     don't have to be the mad
     prophet any more.

HOWARD turns to regard MAX in the doorway with a sweet
smile.

          HOWARD
     I must go on with what I'm doing,
     Max.  I have been called.  This
     is my witness, and I must make it.

This gives MAX pause, to say the least.

          MAX
     You must make what, Howard?

          HOWARD
     I must make my witness.  I must
     lead the people from the waters.
     I must stay their stampede to
     the sea.

MAX takes a step into the office and closes the door.

          MAX
     You must stay their what,
     Howard?

          HOWARD
     I must stay their headlong
     suicidal stampede to the sea.

          MAX
          (regards Howard
          for a moment)
     Well, hallelujah, Howard, are
     you putting me on or have you
     flipped or what?

          HOWARD
          (serenely)
     I have heard voices, Max.

          MAX
     You have heard voices.  Swell.
     What kind of voices, Howard?
     Still small voices in the night
     or the mighty thunder of God?
     Howard, you've finally done it.
     You've gone over the edge.
     You're nuts.

          HOWARD
     I have been called.  This is
     my witness, and I must make it.

          MAX
     Not on my goddam network news
     show.

He opens the door, goes back into --


80.   INT. NIGHTLY NEWS ROOM

--  where he stops, turns and wheels back to HOWARD's
office --

          MAX
     Now, look, Howard, I'm not
     kidding around about this.
     You go back to being a straight
     anchorman tonight.  I'm the
     voice you're hearing now, and
     this voice is telling you
     we're doing a straight news
     show from now on.  Okay?

HOWARD seems not to have heard him, continues pecking
away at his typewriter.  MAX scowls, turns, exits --


81.   INT. NETWORK NEWS CONTROL ROOM

The wall CLOCK says 6:29.  The control room STAFF are
all at their posts murmuring away.  HARRY HUNTER is
on the phone --

          HUNTER
          (muttering into phone)
     Max, I'm telling you he's fine.
     He's been sharp all day, he's
     been funny as hell.  He had
     everybody cracking up at the
     rundown meeting ... I told him,
     I told him ...


82.   INT. NETWORK NEWS CONTROL ROOM - LATER

On the SHOW MONITOR, HOWARD BEALE at his desk,
shuffles his papers, looks up for his cue.  The
wall CLOCK clicks to 6:30, the DIRECTOR murmurs into
his mike.  HOWARD looks out from the screen to his
vast audience and says:

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     Last night, I was awakened from
     a fitful sleep at shortly after
     two o'clock in the morning by a
     shrill, sibilant, faceless voice
     that was sitting in my rocking
     chair.  I couldn't make it out at
     first in the dark bedroom.  I
     said:  "I'm sorry, you'll have to
     talk a little louder."  And the
     Voice said to me:  "I want you to
     tell the people the truth, not
     an easy thing to do; because the
     people don't want to know the
     truth."  I said:  "You're kidding.
     How the hell would I know what
     the truth is?"  I mean, you have
     to picture me sitting there on
     the foot of the bed talking to
     an empty rocking chair.  I said
     to myself:  "Howard, you are
     some kind of banjo-brain sitting
     here talking to an empty chair."
     But the Voice said to me:  "Don't
     worry about the truth.  I'll put
     the words in your mouth." And I
     said:  "What is this, the burning
     bush? For God's sake, I'm not
     Moses." And the Voice said to
     me:  "And I'm not God, what's
     that got to do with it --"


83.   INT. NETWORK NEWS CONTROL ROOM

HARRY HUNTER still on the phone as the rest of the
control room STAFF just sit there staring at HOWARD
on the MONITOR --

          HUNTER
          (on phone)
     What do you want me to do? --


84.   INT. MAX'S OFFICE

MAX behind his desk on his phone, chin cupped in his
right hand, staring glumly at HOWARD on his CONSOLE --

          MAX
          (on phone)
     Nothing --

          HOWARD (ON CONSOLE)
     And the Voice said to me: "We're
     not talking about eternal truth
     or absolute truth or ultimate
     truth!  We're talking about
     impermanent, transient, human
     truth!  I don't expect you people
     to be capable of truth!  But,
     goddamit, you're at least capable
     of self-preservation!  That's
     good enough!  I want you to go
     out and tell the people to
     preserve themselves -- "

          MAX
          (mutters on phone)
     Right now, I'm trying to remember
     the name of that psychiatrist
     that took care of him when his
     wife died --


85.   INT. STUDIO - NETWORK NEWS

TIGHT SHOT OF HOWARD, his voice rising, his eyes
glowing with increasing fervor --

          HOWARD
          (growing fervor)
     And I said to the Voice:  "Why me?"
     And the Voice said:  "Because
     you're on television, dummy! -- "


86.   INT. DIANA'S OFFICE

DIANA watching HOWARD on her CONSOLE --

          DIANA
     Beautiful!

          HOWARD (ON CONSOLE)
     "You have forty million Americans
     listening to you; after tonight's
     show, you could have fifty million.
     For Pete's sake, I don't expect
     you to walk the land in sackcloth
     and ashes preaching the Armageddon.
     You're on Teevee, man! -- "


87.   INT. MAX'S OFFICE

MAX, no longer on the phone, is leafing through a
loose-leaf address book --

          HOWARD (ON CONSOLE)
     So I thought about it for
     a moment --

MAX taps out a telephone number on his private line --

          HOWARD (ON CONSOLE)
     And then I said:     "Okay -- "

          MAX
          (on phone)
     Doctor Sindell? My name is Max
     Schumacher, I'm at the Union
     Broadcasting Systems, and I hope
     you remember me? I'm a friend of
     Howard Beale whom you treated for
     a few months last year --


88.   INT. FIFTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

as HOWARD and HARRY HUNTER, followed by the rest of
the control room STAFF, come out of the stairway and
head down the corridor to --


89.   INT. ROOM 517 - NIGHTLY NEWS ROOM

where HUNTER and HOWARD move towards HOWARD's office
while the rest of the control room CREW disperse to
their own desks and to exchange muttered comments with
those Nightly News PERSONNEL still at their desks.
HOWARD walks straight as a ramrod, eyes uplifted,
serene to the point of beatitude.  He and HUNTER
go into --


90.   INT. HOWARD'S OFFICE

where MAX is sitting, waiting on the couch.  He
stands --

          MAX
     Close the door, Harry --

HUNTER does so.

          MAX
     Sit down, Howard.  Howard, I'm
     taking you off the air.  I
     called your psychiatrist.

          HOWARD
          (serene, sits
          behind his desk)

     What's happening to me, Max, isn't
     mensurate in psychiatric terms.

          MAX
     I think you're having a breakdown,
     require treatment, and Dr. Sindell
     agrees.

          HOWARD
     This is not a psychotic episode.
     It is a cleansing moment of clarity.
          (stands, an imbued man)
     I am imbued, Max.  I am imbued
     with some special spirit.  It's
     not a religious feeling at all.
     It is a shocking eruption of
     great electrical energy:  I feel
     vivid and flashing as if suddenly
     I had been plugged into some great
     cosmic electromagnetic field.  I
     feel connected to all living
     things, to flowers, birds, to
     all the animals of the world
     and even to some great unseen
     living force, what I think
     the Hindus call prana.

He stands rigidly erect, his eyes staring mindlessly
out, his face revealing the anguish of so transcendental
a state.

          HOWARD
     It is not a breakdown.  I have
     never felt so orderly in my life!
     It is a shattering and beautiful
     sensation!  It is the exalted
     flow of the space-time continuum,
     save that it is spaceless and
     timeless and of such loveliness!
     I feel on the verge of some
     great ultimate truth.

He stares haggardly at MAX, his breath coming with
great difficulty now; he shouts:

          HOWARD
     You will not take me off the air
     for now or for any other
     spaceless time!

He promptly falls in a dead swoon onto the floor.

          MAX
          (hurrying to his friend's
          prostrate form)
     Jesus Christ --

          HUNTER
          (from the door)
     Is he okay?

          MAX
          (bent over HOWARD)
     He's breathing anyway.  I'll
     have to take him to my house
     again for the night --

A CRASH OF THUNDER --


91.   INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

THUNDER CRASHES outside.  RAIN pelts against the
windows.  The room is dark.  MAX and his wife, LOUISE,
are fast asleep in their hushed room.  CAMERA PANS,
DOLLIES slowly out of the bedroom and into --


92.   INT. LIVING ROOM

Dark, hushed, sleeping.  HOWARD is asleep on the living
room couch.  Or rather he was asleep, for he now slowly
sits up, then stands in his borrowed pajamas, goes to
the hall closet, fetches out a raincoat, unchains,
unbolts and unlocks the front door of the apartment,
and goes out --


93.   EXT. A STREET IN THE EAST 60'S - OVERCAST DAY
FRIDAY , OCTOBER 3 - 7:30 A.M.

Another CRASH and RUMBLE of THUNDER.  RAIN slashes
through the streets.  The sky is dark and lowering --


94.   INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

ALARM CLOCK BUZZING.  MRS. LOUISE SCHUMACHER, a
handsome matron of 50, clicks it off and gets out of
bed.  MAX turns in the bed, sleeps on.  THUNDER and
RAIN O.S.  LOUISE starts sleepily for the bathroom,
pauses, then goes out into the --


INT. BACK HALLWAY

--  and down that to --


INT. LIVING ROOM

--  where she stands, frowning.  The couch, which had
been made up for a bed, has clearly been slept in
but is now empty.  She looks back up the hallway to
the guest bathroom.  The door is open, and there is
obviously nobody in the bathroom.  She pads across
the living room-dining room area and pokes her head
into the kitchen, and then back to the back hallway,
pauses a moment outside her daughter's closed bedroom
door, opens it, looks in, closes it and then returns
to --


INT. THE BEDROOM

She sits on MAX's side of the bed, shakes him awake.

          LOUISE
     Wake up, Max, because Howard's
     gone.  I'll make you some coffee.

She moves off.

          MAX
          (mutters)
     Shit.

He slowly sits up.


95.   INT. FRANK HACKETT'S OFFICE

HACKETT in a rage, shouting at MAX slumped in a soft
chair.  Others in the room are DIANA and HERB
THACKERAY.

          HACKETT
     What do you mean you don't know
     where he is? The son of a bitch
     is a hit, goddammit!  Over two
     thousand phone calls!  Go down
     to the mailroom!  As of this
     minute, over fourteen thousand
     telegrams!  The response is
     sensational!  Herb, tell him! --

THACKERAY starts to tell him, but HACKETT roars on --

          HACKETT
     Herb's phone hasn't stopped
     ringing!  Every goddam affiliate
     from Albuquerque to Sandusky!
     The response is sensational!

The PHONE RINGS, HACKETT seizes it.

          HACKETT
     What?  ... All right

He hangs up, snaps at THACKERAY --

          HACKETT
     It's your office, Herb.  You
     better get back there.

THACKERAY exits.  HACKETT roars on --

          HACKETT
     Moldanian called me!  Joe
     Donnelly called me!  We've got
     a goddam hit, goddam it!  Diana,
     show him the Times!  We even
     got an editorial in the holy
     goddam New York Times.  "A Call
     to Morality!" That crazy son of
     a bitch, Beale, has caught on!
     So don't tell me you don't know
     where he is!

          MAX
          (roaring back)
     I don't know where he is!  He
     may be jumping off a roof for
     all I know.  The man is insane.
     He's no longer responsible for
     himself.  He needs care and
     treatment.  And all you
     grave-robbers care about is
     he's a hit!

          DIANA
     You know, Max, it's just possible
     that he isn't insane, that he is,
     in fact, imbued with some special
     spirit.

          MAX
     My God, I'm supposed to be
     the romantic; you're supposed
     to be the hard-bitten realist!

          DIANA
     All right.  Howard Beale obviously
     fills a void.  The audience out
     there obviously wants a prophet,
     even a manufactured one, even

     if he's as mad as Moses.  By
     tomorrow, he'll have a 50 share,
     maybe even a 60 share.  Howard
     Beale is processed instant God,
     and right now it looks like he
     may just go over bigger than
     Mary Tyler Moore.

          MAX
     I'm not putting Howard back on
     the air.

          DIANA
     It's not your show any more,
     Max, it's mine.

          MAX
     You're nuts.  You're nuttier
     than Howard.

          HACKETT
     I gave her the show, Schumacher.
     I'm putting the network news show
     under programming.  Mr. Ruddy
     has had a mild heart attack and
     is not taking calls.  In his
     absence, I'm making all network
     decisions, including one I've
     been wanting to make a long time
     -- you're fired.  I want you
     out of this building by noon.
     I'll leave word with the
     security guards to throw you
     out if you're still here.

          MAX
     Well, let's just say, fuck you,
     Hackett.  You want me out, you're
     going to have to drag me out
     kicking and screaming.  And the
     whole news division will walk
     out kicking and screaming with
     me.

          HACKETT
     You think they're going to quit
     their jobs for you.  Not in
     this depression, buddy.

          MAX
     When Ruddy gets back, he'll
     have your ass.

          HACKETT
     I got a hit, Schumacher, and Ruddy
     doesn't count any more.  He was
     hoping I'd fall on my face with this
     Beale show, but I didn't.  It's a
     big, fat, big-titted hit, and I
     don't have to waffle around with
     Ruddy any more.  If he wants to take
     me up before the C.C. and A. board,
     let him.  And do you think Ruddy's
     stupid enough to go to the CCA board
     and say:  "I'm taking our one hit
     show off the air?"  And comes
     November Fourteen, I'm going to be
     standing up there at the annual CCA
     management review meeting, and I'm
     going to announce projected earnings
     for this network for the first time
     in five years.  And, believe me, Mr.
     Jensen will be sitting there rocking
     back and forth in his little chair,
     and he's going to say:  "That's very
     good, Frank, keep it up."  So don't
     have any illusions about who's
     running this network from now on.
     You're fired.  I want you out of
     your office before noon or I'll
     have you thrown out.
          (to DIANA)
     And you go along with this?

          DIANA
     Well, Max, I told you I didn't
     want a network hassle over this.
     I told you I'd much rather work
     the Beale show out just between
     the two of us.

          MAX
          (stands)
     Well, let's just say, fuck you
     too, honey.
          (to HACKETT)
     Howard Beale may be my best friend!
     I'll go to court.  I'll put him
     in a hospital before I let you
     exploit him like a carnival
     freak.

          HACKETT
     You get your psychiatrists,
     and I'll get mine.

          MAX
          (heading for the door)
     I'm going to spread this whole
     reeking business in every paper
     and on every network, independent,
     group, and affiliated station in
     this country.  I'm going to make
     a lot of noise about this.

          HACKETT
     Great!  we need all the press
     we can get.


MAX exits.  HACKETT clicks his intercom.

          HACKETT
          (on intercom)
     Get me Mr. Cabell --
          (to DIANA)
     Something going on between
     you and Schumacher?

          DIANA
          (sighs)
     Not any more.

          HACKETT
          (his PHONE BUZZES,
          he picks it up)
     Tom, Howard Beale has disappeared.
     Tell Harriman to prepare a big
     statement for the news media.
     And call the cops and tell them
     to find the crazy son of a bitch --


96.   EXT. UBS BUILDING - SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT - 6:40 P.M.

THUNDER CRASHES -- RAIN lashes the street.  PEDESTRIANS

struggle against the slashing rain.  The streets gleam
wetly, the heavy TRAFFIC heading uptown crushes and
HONKS along, erratic enfilades of headlights in the
shiny, black streets --


97.   CLOSER ANGLE


of entrance to UBS Building.  HOWARD BEALE, wearing a
coat over his pajamas, drenched to the skin, his mop of
gray hair plastered in streaks to his brow, hunched
against the rain, climbs the steps and pushes the glass
door at the entrance and goes into --


98.   INT. UBS BUILDING - LOBBY

TWO SECURITY GUARDS at the desk watch HOWARD pass --

          SECURITY GUARD
     How do you Mr. Beale?

HOWARD stops, turns, stares haggardly at the SECURITY
GUARD.

          HOWARD
          (mad as a loon)
     I have to make my witness.

          SECURITY GUARD
          (an agreeable fellow)
     Sure thing, Mr. Beale.

HOWARD plods off to the elevators.


99.   INT. NETWORK NEWS CONTROL ROOM

Murmured, efficient activity as in previous scenes.
DIANA stands in the back in the shadows.  On the SHOW
MONITOR, JACK SNOWDEN, BEALE's replacement, has been
doing the news straight --

          SNOWDEN (ON MONITOR)
     ...  Oil ministers of the OPEC
     nations meeting in Vienna still
     haven't decided how much more to
     increase the price of oil next
     Wednesday.  Iran and some of the
     Arab states want to jack up the
     price by as much as twenty
     percent --

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
     Five seconds --

          TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
     Twenty-five in Vienna --

          DIRECTOR
     And ... two --

          SNOWDEN (ON MONITOR)
     The Saudi Arabians are being more
     cautious.  They just want a ten per-
     cent increase.  More on that story
     from Edward Fletcher in Vienna --

All this is UNDER and OVERLAPPED by HARRY HUNTER
answering a BUZZ on his phone --

          HUNTER
          (on phone)
     Yeah? ... Okay --
          (hangs up, to DIANA)
     He came in the building about
     five minutes ago.

          PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
     Ten seconds coming to one --

          DIANA
     Tell Snowden if he comes in the
     studio to let him go on.

          HUNTER
          (to the STAGE MANAGER)
     Did you get that, Paul?

The STAGE MANAGER nods, passes on the instructions to his
A.D. on the studio floor.  On the SHOW MONITOR, we see
footage of the OPEC Vienna meeting. Lots of Arab headdresses
and bearded Levantine faces at conference tables, and we are
hearing the VOICE of Edward Fletcher in Vienna --

          FLETCHER (ON MONITOR)
     This has probably been the most divisive
     meeting the oil-producing states have
     ever had.  The thirteen nations of OPEC
     have still not been able to decide by
     how much to increase the price of oil --

On the SHOW MONITOR, the footage flicks to Sheik Zaki Yamani
being interviewed by a corps of correspondents outside the
meeting hall --

          FLETCHER (V.O.)
     Saudi Arabian oil minister Sheik Zaki
     Yamani flew to London yesterday for
     further consultations with his government.
     He returned to the Vienna meetings today--

Nobody in the control room is paying too much attention
to Yamani, they are all watching the double bank of
black-and-white monitors which show HOWARD BEALE
entering the studio, drenched, hunched, staring gauntly
off into his own space, moving with single-minded
purpose across the studio floor past cameras and
ASSISTANT DIRECTORS, CAMERAMEN, SOUND MEN, ELECTRICIANS
and ASSOCIATE PRODUCERS, to his desk which is being
vacated for him by JACK SNOWDEN.  On the SHOW MONITOR,
the film clip of Yamani has come to an end.

          ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
     Ready 2.


          DIRECTOR
     Take 2.

-- and, suddenly, the obsessed face of HOWARD BEALE,
gaunt, haggard, red-eyed with unworldly fervor, hair
streaked and plastered on his brow, manifestly mad,
fills the MONITOR SCREEN.

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     I don't have to tell you things
     are bad.  Everybody knows things
     are bad.  It's a depression.
     Everybody's out of work or scared
     of losing their job, the dollar
     buys a nickel's worth, banks are
     going bust, shopkeepers keep a
     gun under the counter, punks
     are running wild in the streets,
     and there's nobody anywhere who
     seems to know what to do, and
     there's no end to it.  We know
     the air's unfit to breathe and
     our food is unfit to eat, and
     we sit and watch our tee-vees
     while some local newscaster
     tells us today we had fifteen
     homicides and sixty-three
     violent crimes, as if that's
     the way it's supposed to be.
     We all know things are bad.
     Worse than bad.  They're crazy.
     It's like everything's going
     crazy.  So we don't go out any
     more.  We sit in the house, and
     slowly the world we live in
     gets smaller, and all we ask is

     please, at least leave us alone
     in our own living rooms.  Let me
     have my toaster and my tee-vee
     and my hair-dryer and my steel-
     belted radials, and I won't say
     anything, just leave us alone.
     Well, I'm not going to leave you
     alone.  I want you to get mad --

ANOTHER ANGLE showing the rapt attention of the PEOPLE
in the control room, especially of DIANA --

          HOWARD
     I don't want you to riot.  I
     don't want you to protest.  I
     don't want you to write your
     congressmen.  Because I wouldn't
     know what to tell you to write.
     I don't know what to do about the
     depression and the inflation and
     the defense budget and the Russians
     and crime in the street.  All
     I know is first you got to get
     mad.  You've got to say:  "I'm
     mad as hell and I'm not going
     to take this any more.  I'm a
     human being, goddammit.  My life
     has value."  So I want you to
     get up now.  I want you to get
     out of your chairs and go to
     the window.  Right now.  I want
     you to go to the window, open
     it, and stick your head out
     and yell.  I want you to yell:
     "I'm mad as hell and I'm not
     going to take this any more!"

          DIANA
          (grabs HUNTER's
          shoulder)
     How many stations does this
     go out live to?

          HUNTER
     Sixty-seven.  I know it goes out
     to Atlanta and Louisville,
     I think --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     -- Get up from your chairs.
     Go to the window.  Open it.
     Stick your head out and yell
     and keep yelling --

But DIANA has already left the control room and is
scurrying down --


100.  INT. CORRIDOR

-- yanking doors open, looking for a phone, which
she finds in --


101.  INT. AN OFFICE

          DIANA
          (seizing the phone)
     Give me Stations Relations --
          (the call goes through)
     Herb, this is Diana Christenson,
     are you watching because I want
     you to call every affiliate
     carrying this live --
     I'll be right up --


102.  INT. ELEVATOR AREA - FIFTEENTH FLOOR

DIANA bursts out of the just-arrived elevator and
strides down to where a clot of EXECUTIVES and OFFICE
PERSONNEL are blocking an open doorway.  DIANA pushes
through to --


103.  INT. THACKERAY'S OFFICE - STATIONS RELATIONS

HERB THACKERAY on the phone, staring up at HOWARD
BEALE on his wall monitor --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
     -- First, you have to get mad.
     When you're mad enough --

Both THACKERAY'S SECRETARY's office and his own office
are filled with his STAFF.  The Assistant VP Station
Relations, a 32-year-old fellow named RAY PITOFSKY,
is at the SECRETARY's desk, also on the phone.  Another
ASSISTANT VP is standing behind him on the SECRETARY's
other phone --

          DIANA
          (shouting to THACKERAY)
     Whom are you talking to?

          THACKERAY
     WCGG, Atlanta --

          DIANA
     Are they yelling in Atlanta,
     Herb?

          HOWARD (ON CONSOLE)
     -- we'll figure out what to do
     about the depression --

          THACKERAY
          (on phone)
     Are they yelling in Atlanta,
     Ted?


104.  INT. GENERAL MANAGER'S OFFICE - UBS AFFILIATE - ATLANTA


The GENERAL MANAGER of WCGG, Atlanta, a portly
58-year-old man, is standing by the open windows of his
office, staring out into the gathering dusk, holding
his phone.  The station is located in an Atlanta
suburb, but from far off across the foliage
surrounding the station, there can be heard a faint
RUMBLE.  On his office console, HOWARD BEALE is
saying --

          HOWARD (ON CONSOLE)
     -- and the inflation and the oil
     crisis --

          GENERAL MANAGER
          (into phone)
     Herb, s0 help me, I think they're
     yelling --


105.  INT. THACKERAY'S OFFICE

          PITOFSKY
          (at SECRETARY's desk,
          on the phone)
     They're yelling in Baton Rouge.

DIANA grabs the phone from him and listens to the
people of Baton Rouge yelling their anger in the
streets --

          HOWARD (ON CONSOLE)
     -- Things have got to change.
     But you can't change them unless
     you're mad.  You have to get mad.
     Go to the window --

          DIANA
          (gives phone back to
          PITOFSKY; her eyes
          glow with excitement)
     The next time somebody asks you
     to explain what ratings are,
     you tell them:  that's ratings!
          (exults)
     Son of a bitch, we struck the
     mother lode!


106.  INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

MAX, MRS. SCHUMACHER, and their 17-year-old daughter,
CAROLINE, watching the Network News Show --

          HOWARD (ON THE SET)
     -- Stick your head out and yell.
     I want you to yell:  "I'm mad
     as hell and I'm not going to
     take this any more!"

CAROLINE gets up from her chair and heads for the
living room window.

          LOUISE SCHUMACHER
     Where are you going?

          CAROLINE
     I want to see if anybody's
     yelling.

          HOWARD (ON TV SET)
     Right now. Get up. Go to
     your window --


107.  INT./EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

CAROLINE opens the window and looks out on the
rain-swept streets of the upper East Side, the
bulking, anonymous apartment houses and the occasional
brownstones.  It is thunder dark; a distant clap of
THUNDER CRASHES somewhere off and LIGHTNING shatters
the dank darkness.  In the sudden HUSH following the
thunder, a thin voice down the block can be heard
shouting:

          THIN VOICE (O.S.)
     I'm mad as hell and I'm not
     going to take this any morel

          HOWARD (ON TV SET)
     -- open your window --

MAX joins his daughter at the window.  RAIN sprays
against his face --


108.  MAX'S P.O.V.

He sees occasional windows open, and, just across
from his apartment house, a MAN opens the front door
of a brownstone --

          MAN
          (shouts)
     I'm mad as hell and I'm not
     going to take this any more!

OTHER SHOUTS are heard.  From his twenty-third floor
vantage point, MAX sees the erratic landscape of
Manhattan buildings for some blocks, and, silhouetted
HEADS in window after window, here, there, and then
seemingly everywhere, SHOUTING out into the slashing
black RAIN of the streets --

          VOICES
     I'm mad as hell and I'm not
     going to take this any morel

A terrifying enormous CLAP of natural THUNDER, followed
by a frantic brilliant FULGURATION of LIGHTNING; and now
the gathering CHORUS of scattered SHOUTS seems to be
coming from the whole, huddled, black horde of the
city's people, SCREAMING together in fury, an
indistinguishable tidal roar of human rage as formidable
as the natural THUNDER again ROARING, THUNDERING,
RUMBLING above.  It sounds like a Nuremberg rally, the
air thick and trembling with it --


109.  FULL SHOT - MAX

standing with his DAUGHTER by the open terrace window-
doors, RAIN spraying against them, listening to the
stupefying ROARS and THUNDERING rising from all around
him.  He closes his eyes, sighs, there's nothing he
can do about it any more, it's out of his hands.


110.  EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - WEDNESDAY,
OCTOBER 16 - 12:00 NOON - DAY

A jumbo 747 touches down at L.A. Airport --

          NARRATOR
     By mid-October, the Howard Beale
     show had settled in at a 42
     share, more than equaling all
     the other network news shows
     combined --


111.  AIRPORT - LATER

DIANA and BARBARA SCHLESINGER, carrying attach, cases,
scripts, hand baggage, deplane --

          NARRATOR
     In the September rating book,
     the Howard Beale show was listed
     as the fourth highest-rated show
     of the month, surpassed only by
     All in the Family, Rhoda, and
     Chico and the Man -- a phenomenal

     state of affairs for a news
     program --


112.  EXT. UBS BUILDING - L.A. - DAY

A towering glass building on Santa Monica Boulevard.
IDENTIFY.

          NARRATOR
     And, on October the Sixteenth,
     Diana Christenson flew to Los
     Angeles --


113.  INT. WEST COAST UBS BUILDING - A CONFERENCE ROOM

DIANA at a luncheon meeting (sandwiches and containers
of coffee), with her West Coast Programming
Department --

          NARRATOR
     -- for what the trade calls
     pow-wows and confabs with her
     West Coast programming execs --

These are FOUR MEN and TWO WOMEN; GLENN KOSSOFF and
BARBARA SCHLESINGER; the THREE OTHER MEN are the
Assistant VP Program Development West Coast, Head
of the Story Department West Coast, and a MAN from
Audience Research; the WOMAN is VP Daytime Programming
West Coast.  They are all sitting around a typical
mod-shaped conference table except for DIANA who is
moving towards a large display board at the far end
of the table stretching the length of the wall.  This
is an improvised programming "board".  It shows --
through movable heavy cardboard pieces -- what all
four networks have on by the half hour for all seven
days of the week --

          DIANA
     Wednesday night looks weak on
     all three of the other networks
     for next September, so we
     concentrate on Wednesday night.
     We're going to expand the Howard
     Beale show to an hour in
     January, which'll give us a
     hell of a lead-in to eight
     o'clock.  So, on Wednesday
     nights, I want to follow that
     with two strong dramatic hours,
     no sit-coms, nothing lightweight --

BILL HERRON pokes his head into the room --

          HERRON
          (to DIANA)
     I've got Laureen Hobbs' lawyer
     on the phone.  Is five-thirty okay,
     and where would you like to meet,
     here or at the hotel?

          DIANA
          (to SCHLESINGER)
     Let's put Hy Norman at five --
          (to HERRON)
     Five-thirty is fine, and at my
     office, if they don't mind.
          (back to her "board"
          and her exhortation
          to the programming
          people)
     -- What I want right now are movies
     of the week we can use for pilots.
     I want five movies of the week ready
     by March at the outside, preferably
     sooner --


114.  INT. UBS BUILDING WEST COAST - DIANA'S OFFICE

An utterly bland office kept for visiting firemen.
DIANA is behind the desk.  BARBARA SCHLESINGER is
sitting on the couch.  GLENN KOSSOFF is ushering TWO
GENTLEMEN out, spots someone in the outer office --

          KOSSOFF
          (to anteroom)
     Hy, come on in --

He ushers in a silver-haired, suntanned, fresh-from-
the-tennis-court man dressed in California elegance,
rakish blazer, archetype of all L.A. television pack-
agers -- HY NORMAN --

          KOSSOFF
     Hy, I think you know Barbara
     Schlesinger, but I don't know
     if you know Diana Christenson --

          NORMAN
          (sinking casually into
          the visitor's chair,
          crossing his legs,
          flashing a fully-capped
          set of teeth)
     As a matter of fact, I think we
     met during the 1972 McGovern-for-
     President campaign, of which, I
     am proud to say, I was a principal
     fund raiser --

          DIANA
          (leaning across the desk
          to shake his hand)
     No, I'm afraid not.  Now, Hy, we're
     running a little late, so I'd like
     to get right to it.  I have an idea
     for an hour television series, and
     I'd like to lay it in your lap.
     Here's the back-up story.  The hero
     is white-collar middle-class, an
     architect, aviation engineer,
     anything, a decent law-abiding
     man.  He lives with his wife and
     daughter in a large city.  His
     wife and daughter are raped and
     he's mugged.  He appeals to the
     police, but their hands are tied
     by the Warren Court decisions.
     There's nothing but pornography
     in the movies, and vandals bomb
     his church. The animals are
     taking over.  So he decides to
     take the law into his own hands.
     He buys a gun, practices till he's
     an expert.  He takes up karate,
     becomes a black belt, an adept in
     Kung Fu and all the other martial
     arts.  Now, he starts walking the
     streets of the city, decoying muggers
     into preying on him.  He kung fu's
     them all.  Pretty soon, he's joined
     by a couple of neighbors. What
     we've got now is a vigilante group.
     That's the name of the show -- the
     Vigilantes.  The idea is, if the
     law won't protect the decent people,
     they have to take the law into their
     own hands.

          NORMAN
     That may be he most fascistic idea
     I've heard in years.

          DIANA
     Right.

          NORMAN
     And a shameless steal from a movie
     called "Death Wish."

          DIANA
     I know.  And, so far, "Death Wish"
     has grossed seventeen million domes-
     tic.  It obviously struck a pulse in
     Americans.  I want to strike the
     same pulse.  Now, let me finish, Hy.
     The format is simple.  Every week a
     crime is committed, and the police
     are helpless to deal with it.  The
     victim turns to our group of vigi-
     lantes.  What the hell, it's FBI,
     Mission Impossible, Kojack, except
     the heroes are ordinary citizens,
     your neighbors and mine.

          NORMAN
          (standing)
     I find the whole thing repulsive.

          DIANA
     You give me a pilot script we can
     use as a movie of the week for
     January, and I'll commit to twelve
     segments on the basis of that script.

          NORMAN
          (turns)
     You'll commit on the basis of the
     pilot script?

          DIANA
     That's what I said.  That's a three
     million dollar commitment.  I figure
     you could skim a quarter of a million
     for yourself out of that.  Of course,
     we all know you're a highly principled

     political liberal, and you may find
     this kind of show repulsive --

          NORMAN
          (slowly sitting again)
     Well -- not necessarily.  I deplore
     vigilante tactics, of course, but
     the vigilante tradition is a profound,
     even proud tradition in the American
     social fabric.  This sort of program
     also offers opportunities for coming
     to grips with the burning issues of
     our times, to do meaningful drama and
     at the same time providing mass enter-
     tainment --

          DIANA
     Beautiful, Hy.

          NORMAN
     Who do I talk numbers with,
     Charlie Kinkaid?

          DIANA
     Right.  I'll call Charlie and tell
     him we'll go to forty thousand
     for the first script.  If you come
     in with anything good, Hy, I'll
     slot you on Wednesday nights at
     eight coming right off the Howard
     Beale Show, and that's the best
     lead-in you'll ever get.

NORMAN opens the door to leave, looks out into the
outer office, closes the door, turns to DIANA.

          NORMAN
     Is that Laureen Hobbs out there?
     What the hell is Laureen Hobbs
     doing out there?

          DIANA
     We're going to put the Communist
     Party on prime-time television, Hy.

          NORMAN
     I wouldn't doubt it for a minute.


115.  DIANA'S OFFICE - LATER

He opens the door and goes out.  On his heels, GLENN
KOSSOFF is already ushering in BILL HERRON, LAUREEN
HOBBS, (a handsome black woman of 35 in Afro and
dashiki); SAM HAYWOOD, (late 50's, a shaggy, unkempt
lawyer in the Clarence Darrow tradition, galluses,
string-tie, folksy drawl and all).; a younger lawyer,
ROBERT MURPHY, (early 30's, Harvard intellectual type);
and THREE AGENTS from the William Morris Office named
LENNIE, WALLIE and ED, (all in their mid-30's, all
wearing trim blue suits and all indistinguishable from
each other).  DIANA rises to greet them, extends her
hand to LAUREEN HOBBS --

          DIANA
     Christ, you brought half the William
     Morris West Coast office with you.
     I'm Diana Christenson, a racist lackey
     of the imperialist ruling circles.

          LAUREEN
     I'm Laureen Hobbs, a bad-ass Commie
     nigger.


          DIANA
     Sounds like the basis of a firm
     friendship.
          (to KOSSOFF)
     We're going to need more chairs --

In b.g., meanwhile, SCHLESINGER is exchanging hellos
with the THREE WILLIAM MORRIS AGENTS and is being
introduced to the LAWYERS and looking at baby pictures
proffered to her by one of the agents.  It's all jolly
as hell, a lot of chuckling and smiling --

          SCHLESINGER
          (in b.g.)
     Anybody want coffee?

          LENNIE
     Black with Sucaryl --

KOSSOFF and a SECRETARY are hauling in chairs --

          LAUREEN
          (introducing to DIANA)
     This is my lawyer, Sam Haywood,
     and his associate, Robert Murphy --

Handshakes, nods, smiles, everybody begins to sit.  The
SECRETARY goes around taking coffee orders

          HAYWOOD
          (an old union lawyer,
          given to peroration)
     Well, MS. Christenson, just what
     the hell's this all about?  Because
     when a national television
     network in the person of bubby
     here --
          (indicates HERRON)
     -- comes to me and says he wants
     to put the ongoing struggle of the
     oppressed masses on prime-time
     television, I have to regard this
     askance --

More chairs are brought in.  DIANA would answer HAYWOOD
but he booms along, beginning to hit his stride

          HAYWOOD
     I have to figure this as an
     antithetical distraction.  The
     thesis here, if you follow me, is
     that the capitalist state is in a
     terminal condition now, and the
     anti- thesis is the maturation of
     the fascist state, and when the
     correlative appendages of the
     fascist state come and say to me
     they want to give the revolution a
     weekly hour of prime-time
     television, I've got to figure this
     is preventive co-optation, right? --

The necessary chairs are in by now, and everyone is
seated. The SECRETARY has gone off to fetch the coffee.
A sudden HUSH follows HAYWOOD's Hegelian instruction,
and DIANA would answer, but HAYWOOD is now center-stage,
into the full swell of rhetoric --

          HAYWOOD
     The ruling classes are running
     scared, right?  You turned the full
     force of your cossack cops and
     paramilitary organs of repression
     against us.  But now the slave masters
     hear the rumble of revolution in their
     ears.  So you have no alternative but
     to co-opt us.  Put us on teevee and
     pull our fangs.  And we're supposed
     to sell out, right?  For your gang-
     stergold? Well, we're not going to
     sell out, baby!  You can take your
     fascist teevee and shove it right
     up your paramilitary ass!  I'm here
     to tell you, we don't sell out!  We
     don't want your gold!  We're not
     going on your teevee!

A moment of HUSH, in which everybody digests this opening
statement.

          DIANA
          (sighs, mutters)
     Oh, shit, Mr. Haywood, if you're not
     interested in my offer, why the hell
     did you bring two lawyers and three
     agents from the William Morris office
     along?

          MURPHY
          (Mr. Cool)
     What Mr. Haywood was saying, Ms.
     Christenson, was that our client,
     Ms. Hobbs, wants it up front that
     the political content of the show
     has to be entirely in her control.

          DIANA
     She can have it.  I don't give a
     damn about the political content.

          WALLIE
     What kind of show'd you have in
     mind, Diana?

          DIANA
     We're interested in doing a weekly
     dramatic series based on the Ecumen-
     ical Liberation Army, and I'll tell
     you what the first show has to be --
     a two-hour special on Mary Ann Gifford.
     We open this two-hour special with
     that bank rip-off footage, which is
     terrific stuff, and then we tell
     the story of how a rich young heiress
     like Mary Ann Gifford becomes a
     flaming revolutionary.  Would you
     people be interested in making such
     a movie for us?

Everybody looks to LAUREEN HOBBS.

          LAUREEN
     The Ecumenical Liberation Army is
     an ultra-left sect creating political
     confusion with wildcat violence and
     pseudo-insurrectionary acts, which
     the Communist Party does not endorse.
     The American masses are not yet ready
     for open revolt.  We would not want
     to produce a television show cele-
     brating historically deviational
     terrorism.

          DIANA
     Even better.  I see the story this
     way. Poor little rich girl kid-
     napped by ultra-left sect.  She
     falls in love with the leader of
     the gang, converts to his irrespon-
     sible violence.  But then she meets
     you, understands the true nature of
     the ongoing people's struggle for
     a better society, and, in an emotion-
     drenched scene, she leaves her devia-
     tional lover and dedicates herself to
     you and the historical inevitability
     of the socialist state.

          LAUREEN
          (smiles)
     That would be better, of course.

          ED
     What kind of numbers are we talking,
     Diana?

          DIANA
     We'll give you our top deal, which
     I think is two fifteen and twenty-
     five.  You'll have to talk to
     Charlie Kinkaid about that.  But
     as long as we're talking series
     now, I'll tell you what I want.
     I want a lot more film like the
     bank rip-off the Ecumenicals sent
     in.  The way I see this series is
     every week we open with the authen-
     tic footage of an act of political
     terrorism, taken on the spot and
     in the actual moment; then we go
     into the drama behind the opening
     film footage.  That's your job, Ms.
     Hobbs.  You've got to get the
     Ecumenicals to bring in that film
     for us.  The network can't deal
     with them directly.  They are,
     after all, wanted criminals.

          LAUREEN
     The Ecumenicals are an undisciplined
     ultra-left gang, and the leader is
     an eccentric to say the least.  He
     calls himself the Great Ahmed Khan
     and wears a hussar's shako.

          DIANA
     Ms. Hobbs, I'm offering you an hour

     of prime-time television every week
     into which you can stick whatever
     propaganda you want.  We're talking
     about thirty to fifty million people
     a shot.  That's a lot better than
     handing out mimeographed pamphlets
     on ghetto street corners.

          LAUREEN
     I'll have to take this matter to
     the Central Committee, and I'd
     better check this out with the
     Great Ahmed Khan.

          DIANA
     I'll be in L.A. until Saturday, and
     I'd like to get this thing rolling.
          (smiles at SCHLESINGER,
          HERRON and KOSSOFF)
     That's going to be our Wednesday
     night.  Seven to eight -- Howard
     Beale; eight to nine -- the
     Vigilantes; nine to ten -- the Mao
     Tse Tung Hour.

          KOSSOFF
     God, fascism and the revolution all
     on one night.

          DIANA
          (tired, rubs her eyes)
     I suppose that's what's called
     balanced programming.


116.   EXT. A SMALL ISOLATED FARMHOUSE IN ENCINO - NIGHT

LAUREEN HOBBS, sitting on the stoop of the front porch
talking to another member of the Central Committee,
a middle-aged white man named WITHERSPOON.  The door
behind them opens, and DOWLING, a young white man in
his 20's, wearing a fatigue jacket and torn Levi's and
dark sunglasses, pokes his head out:

          DOWLING
     Okay --

LAUREEN and WITHERSPOON rise, go up the steps and
follow DOWLING into --


117.  INT. THE ECUMENICALS' HEADQUARTERS - ENTRANCE FOYER

Dark.  An absolute shambles.  Cartons, crates, news-
papers and scraps of food have been littered about.
A young black man, WATKINS, (early 20's, standing on
the stairway to the second floor holding an army rifle),
watches LAUREEN and WITHERSPOON following DOWLING, and
himself follows them into --


118.  INT. DINING ROOM

-- or what had been the dining room.  A naked overhead
BULB is the only light in here.  Sitting on a wooden
folding chair is the GREAT AHMED KHAN, a powerful,
brooding black man in his early 30's.  He wears a
hussar's shako and the crescent moon of the Midianites
hanging pendant around his neck.  The chair he sits on
is the only visible piece of furniture.  There are two
tattered sleeping bags on the floor, part of a general
welter of torn newspapers, empty grocery bags, ham-
burger leftovers, etc.  The walls are bare except for
blowups of Che Guevara, Mao, Marlon Brando and Jane
Fonda, scotch-taped to the torn wall-paper.  Cartons
and crates here and there, automatic guns leaning
against the walls.  Boxes of ammunition and grenades

and mortar shells stacked against a wall.  In atten-
dance on the GREAT AHMED KHAN is a young black woman
in her late 20's, named JENKINS, and a young white
woman in her early 20's, MARY ANN GIFFORD, who is a
fire-eating militant with a bandolier of cartridges
across her torn shirt and with a B.A.R. held in her
hands.  LAUREEN pulls up an empty crate, sits, waves
a limp hand of hello to the others and regards the
GREAT KHAN --


          LAUREEN
     Well, Ahmed, you ain't going to
     believe this, but I'm going to
     make a teevee star out of you.
     Just like Archie Bunker.  You're
     going to be a household word.

          AHMED
     What the fuck are you talking about?

MUSIC: A RATAPLAN OF KETTLEDRUMS AND A TARANTARA OF
TRUMPETS.


119.  INT. UBS BUILDING - NEW YORK - A CONTROL ROOM - MONDAY,
JANUARY 27, 1975

Everybody murmuring away --

          DIRECTOR
          (murmurs into mike)
     -- and one --

The Show Monitor cuts to a beaming ANNOUNCER --

          ANNOUNCER
     Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear
     it -- how do you feel?

SHOW MONITOR now shows packed AUDIENCE happily roaring:

          AUDIENCE
          (roaring out)
     We're mad as hell, and we're not
     going to take this any more!


120.  INT. THE STUDIO

The ANNOUNCER beaming away in front of a curtain --

          ANNOUNCER
     Ladies and Gentlemen!  The Network
     News Hour! --


121.  INT. CONTROL ROOM

The SHOW MONITOR --

          ANNOUNCER (ON MONITOR)
     -- with Sybil the Soothsayer, Jim
     Webbing and his It's-the-Emmes-
     Truth Department, Miss Mata Hari
     tonight another segment of Vox

          ANNOUNCER
     -- the mad prophet of the airways,
     Howard Beale! --

MUSIC: A FULL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA SOARS INTO AN
IMPERIAL CRESCENDO --


122.  INT. THE STUDIO

-- as the HOUSE LIGHTS go to BLACK.  The curtain slowly
rises.  An absolutely bare stage except for one stained
glass window, suspended by wires high above stage left
through which shoots an overpowering SHAFT of LIGHT
as if emanating from heaven.  HOWARD BEALE, in an
austere black suit with black tie shambles on from the
wings, finds the SPOTLIGHT and stands there for a moment
shielding his eyes from the blinding light.  TUMULTUOUS
APPLAUSE from the AUDIENCE.

          HOWARD
          (erupts into a Savonarola-
          type tirade)
     Edward George Ruddy died today!
     Edward George Ruddy was the Chairman
     of the Board of the Union Broad-
     casting Systems -- and woe is us
     if it ever falls in the hands of
     the wrong people.  And that's why
     woe is us that Edward George Ruddy
     died.  Because this network is now
     in the hands of CC and A the
     Communications Corporation of
     America.  We've got a new Chairman
     of the Board, a man named Frank
     Hackett now sitting in Mr. Ruddy's
     office on the twentieth floor.  And
     when the twelfth largest company in
     the world controls the most awesome
     goddamned propaganda force in the
     whole godless world, who knows what
     shit will be peddled for truth on
     this tube?  So, listen to me!
     Television is not the truth!  Tele-
     vision is a goddamned amusement
     park, that's what television is!
     Television is a circus, a carnival,
     a travelling troupe of acrobats and
     story-tellers, singers and dancers,
     jugglers, side-show freaks, lion-
     tamers and football players.  We're
     in the boredom-killing business!
     If you want truth, go to God, go
     to your guru, go to yourself because
     that's the only place you'll ever
     find any real truth!  But, man,
     you're never going to get any truth
     from us.  We'll tell you anything
     you want to hear.  We lie like hell!
     We'll tell you Kojack always gets
     the killer, and nobody ever gets
     cancer in Archie Bunker's house.
     And no matter how much trouble the
     hero is in, don't worry:  just look
     at your watch -- at the end of the
     hour, he's going to win.  We'll
     tell you any shit you want to hear!

     We deal in illusion, man!  None of
     it's true!  But you people sit there
     -- all of you -- day after day, night
     after night, all ages, colors, creeds
     -- we're all you know.  You're
     beginning to believe this illusion
     we're spinning here.  You're be-
     ginning to think the tube is reality
     and your own lives are unreal.  You
     do whatever the tube tells you.  You
     dress like the tube, you eat like
     the tube, you raise your children
     like the tube, you think like the
     tube.  This is mass madness, you
     maniacs!  In God's name, you people
     are the real thing!  We're the illu-
     sions!  So turn off this goddam
     set!  Turn it off right now!  Turn
     it off and leave it off.  Turn it
     off right now, right in the middle
     of this very sentence I'm speaking
     now --

At which point, HOWARD BEALE, sweating and red-eyed with
his prophetic rage, collapses to the floor in a pro-
phetic swoon.


123.  INT. CC AND A CONFERENCE ROOM - CC AND A BUILDING -
MONDAY, JANUARY 27

A Valhalla of a room taking up the 43rd and 44th floors
of the CC and A Building.  It is dark and theatrical,
the lighting at the moment being provided by the shaft
of LIGHT issuing from a slide projector at the back of
the room onto a large SCREEN on the raised podium where
FRANK HACKETT in banker's gray stands making his annual
report.  On the SCREEN, we see charts of figures, one
after the other, which accompany HACKETT's explication.
A little red ARROW darts from one figure to another as
HACKETT drones on.  Seated in a semi-circular arrange-
ment like a miniature United Nations are 214 SENIOR
EXECUTIVES, (late 40's, 50's, and 60's).  They each
have their own little desks with swivel chairs, pin-
spot lights, piles of bound company reports, and name
plates giving their names and companies they represent.
NOTE one specific CHAIR in the dead center of the first
row that swivels back and forth, back and forth --

          HACKETT
          (on podium)
     -- UBS was running at a cash-flow
     breakeven point after taking into
     account one hundred and ten million
     dollars of negative cash-flow from
     the network.  Note please the added
     thirty-five millions resulting from
     the issuance of the subordinated sink-
     ing debentures.  It was clear the fat
     on the network had to be flitched off --

ANOTHER CLOSER ANGLE on the CHAIR in the first row that
keeps swiveling back and forth.

          HACKETT
          (on podium, as a new
          glide of charts flashes
          on screen)
     Please note an increase in pro-
     jected initial programming rev-
     enues in the amount of twenty-one
     million dollars due to the phenom-
     enal success of the Howard Beale
     show.  I expect a positive cash-
     flow for the entire complex of
     forty-five million achievable in
     this fiscal year, a year, in short,
     ahead of schedule --

ANOTHER ANGLE closer on the swiveling CHAIR but still
not revealing its occupant.

          HACKETT
     I go beyond that.  This network may
     well be the most significant profit
     center of the communications complex --

FULL SHOT of HACKETT barely concealing his pride --

          HACKETT
     -- and, based upon the projected rate
     of return on invested capital, and if
     merger is eventually accomplished,
     the communications complex may well
     become the towering and most profit-
     able center in the entire CC and A
     empire.  I await your questions and
     comments.  Mr. Jensen?

CAMERA PANS ACROSS the huge dark room of tiered seats
to the swiveling CHAIR in the front row which now
swivels to face CAMERA, revealing a short, balding,
bespectacled man with a Grant Woods face.  This is
ARTHUR JENSEN, the President and Chairman of the Board
of CC and A.

          JENSEN
          (murmurs)
     Very good, Frank.  Exemplary.
     Keep it up --

TIGHT SHOT of HACKETT, basking in this praise, suffused
with pride --


124.  INT. TEMPLE EMANUEL - NEW YORK - TUESDAY, JANUARY 28 -
10:30 A.M.

EDWARD GEORGE RUDDY lying in state.

ANOTHER ANGLE showing the vaulted reaches of the Temple
packed with a standing room audience of condolers with
the white yarmalka-ed RABBI in b.g. officiating.  All
the NETWORK BRASS are spotted around the congregation.

CLOSER ANGLE ACROSS MAX among the condolers, following
his eyes to several rows of pews down on the other side
of the aisle where DIANA is sitting.  Aware of MAX's
eyes on her, she turns her face a bit so that their eyes
meet briefly.  She smiles, turns back to the RABBI's
eulogy --


125.  EXT. 65TH STREET - MAIN ENTRANCE - TEMPLE EMANUEL - DAY -
SNOW

SNOW drifting down.  CROWD of overcoated condolers flood-
ing the sidewalk.  A cortege of black limousines lined
up in front of the temple as FUNERAL DIRECTORS guide
condolers into their respective limousines.  A curious
crowd of PASSERSBY watch.  MAX SCHUMACHER threads his
way through the CRUSH to where DIANA CHRISTENSON stands,
murmuring to NELSON CHANEY and WALTER AMUNDSEN, all


bundled up in winter coats.  There are muttered "Hello,
Max, how are you's" and "How's everything, Walter," etc.

          MAX
          (to DIANA)
     Buy you a cup of coffee?

          DIANA
     Hell, yes.

Good-byes all around, and MAX and DIANA move off through
the fringe of the CRUSH on the sidewalk.  CAMERA DOLLIES
with them.  They turn the corner onto --


126.  EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY - SNOW

They head downtown.  They walk silently.  SNOW drifts
down on them.  CAMERA DOLLIES with them.

          MAX
     Do you have to get back to the
     office?

          DIANA
     Nothing that can't wait.

They walk on silently.

          DIANA
          (after a moment)
     I drop down to the news studios
     every now and then and ask Howard
     Beale about you.  He says you're
     doing fine. Are you?

          MAX
     No.

          DIANA
     Are you keeping busy?

          MAX
     After a fashion.  This is the
     third funeral I've been to in two
     weeks.  I have two other friends
     in hospital whom I visit regularly.
     I've been to a couple of christenings.
     All my friends seem to be dying or
     having grandchildren.

          DIANA
     You should be a grandfather about
     now.  You have a pregnant daughter
     in Seattle, don't you?

          MAX
     Any day now.  My wife's out there
     for the occasion.  I've thought
     many times of calling you.

          DIANA
     I wish you had.

They both suddenly stop on Fifth Avenue between 65th
and 64th Streets and regard each other.  An occasional
snowflake moistens their cheeks, wets their hair.

          DIANA
     I bumped into Sybil the Soothsayer
     in the elevator last week.  I said:
     "You know, Sybil, about four months
     ago, you predicted I would get
     involved with a middle-aged man,
     and, so far, all that's happened
     is one many-splendored night.  I
     don't call that getting involved."
     And she said:  "Don't worry.  You
     will."  It was a many-splendored
     night, wasn't it, Max?

          MAX
     Yes, it was.

          DIANA
     Are we going to get involved, Max?

          MAX
     Yes.  I need to get involved very
     much.  How about you?

          DIANA
     I've reached for the phone to call

     you a hundred times, but I was sure
     you hated me for my part in taking
     your news show away.

          MAX
     I probably did.  I don't know any
     more.  All I know is I can't keep
     you out of my mind.

They stare at each other, bemused by the abrupt fragile
explosion of their feelings.  The SNOW drifts down.
PEDESTRIANS move back and forth around them. The Fifth
Avenue TRAFFIC honks and grinds its way downtown.

          DIANA
     My God, she's uncanny.

          MAX
     Who?

          DIANA
     Sybil the Soothsayer.  We've got
     a modern-day Greek drama here, Max.
     Two star-crossed lovers ordained
     to fall disastrously in love by
     the gods.  A December-May story.
     Happily married middle-aged man
     meets desperately lonely young
     career woman, let's say a violinist.
     They both know their illicit love
     can only end in tragedy, but they
     are cursed by the gods and plunge
     dementedly in love.  For a few
     brief moments, they are happy.  He
     abandons devoted wife and loving
     children, and she throws away her
     concert career.  Their friends plead
     with them to give each other up, but
     they are helpless playthings in the
     hands of malignant gods.  Their love
     sours, embittered by ugly little
     jealousies, cryptic rancors.  The
     soothsayer appears again and warns
     the girl she will die if she per-
     sists in this heedless love affair.
     She defies the soothsayer.  But
     now one of the man's children is
     rushed to the hospital with a
     mysterious disease.  He rushes
     back to his family, and she is left
     to throw herself on the railroad
     tracks.  Give me a two-page outline
     on it, Max.  I might be able to
     sell it to Xerox.

          MAX
     A bit too austere for teevee, I
     think.

          DIANA
     You're right.  We wouldn't get
     an 11 rating.  How about a twist
     on Brief Encounter?  Happily
     married man meets woman married
     to her career.

          MAX
     NBC did Brief Encounter last year,
     and it sank.

          DIANA
     Well, we're both a bit long in the
     tooth to try for Romeo and Juliet.

          MAX
     Why don't we just wing it?

She laughs, then he.  A PASSERBY darts them a curious
glance.


127.  INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MONDAY, FEBRUARY
25TH

MAX and his wife, LOUISE, in the middle of an ugly
domestic scene.  LOUISE sits erect on an overstuffed
chair, her eyes wet with imminent tears; MAX strides
around the room.  He is clearly under great stress.

          LOUISE
          (shrilly)
     How long has it been going on?

          MAX
          (prowling around the room)
     A month.  I thought at first it
     might be a transient thing and
     blow over in a week.  I still
     hope to God it's just a menopausal
     infatuation.  But it is an infa-
     tuation, Louise.  There's no sense
     my saying I won't see her again
     because I will.  Do you want me
     to clear out, go to a hotel?

          LOUISE
     Do you love her?

          MAX
     I don't know how I feel.  I'm
     grateful I still feel anything.
     I know I'm obsessed with her.

          LOUISE
          (stands)
     Then say it!  Don't keep telling me
     you're obsessed, you're infatuated
     -- say you're in love with her!

          MAX
     I'm in love with her.

          LOUISE
          (erupts)
     Then get out, go to a hotel, go
     anywhere you want, go live with
     her, but don't come back!  Because
     after twenty-five years of building
     a home and raising a family and all
     the senseless pain we've inflicted
     on each other, I'll be damned if I'll
     just stand here and let you tell me
     you love somebody else!
          (now it's she striding
          around, weeping, a
          caged lioness)
     Because this isn't just some con-
     vention weekend with your secretary,
     is it? Or some broad you picked up
     after three belts of booze.  This
     is your great winter romance, isn't
     it?, your last roar of passion be-
     fore you sink into your emeritus
     years.  Is that what's left for me?
     Is that my share?  She gets the great
     winter passion, and I get the dotage?
     Am I supposed to sit at home knitting
     and purling till you slink back like
     a penitent drunk?  I'm your wife,
     damn it!  If you can't work up a
     winter passion for me, then the
     least I require is respect and
     allegiance!  I'm hurt!  Don't you
     understand that?  I'm hurt badly!

She stares, her cheeks streaked with tears, at MAX
standing at the terrace glass door, staring blindly
out, his own eyes wet and welling.  After a moment,
he turns and regards his anguished wife.

          LOUISE
     Say something, for God's sake.

          MAX
     I've got nothing to say.

He enfolds her; she sobs on his chest.

          LOUISE
          (after a moment)
     Are you that deeply involved with
     her?

          MAX
     Yes.

          LOUISE
     I won't give you up easily, Max.

He struggles to restrain his tears.  She releases her-
self from his embrace.

          LOUISE
     I think the best thing is if you
     did move out.  Does she love you,
     Max?

          MAX
     I'm not sure she's capable of any
     real feelings.  She's the television
     generation.  She learned life from
     Bugs Bunny.  The only reality she
     knows is what comes over her teevee
     set.  She has devised a variety of
     scenarios for us all to play, as
     if it were a Movie of the Week.
     And, my God!, look at us, Louise.
     Here we are going through the obli-
     gatory middle-of-Act-Two scorned
     wife throws peccant husband out scene.
     But, no fear, I'll come back home
     in the end.  All her plot outlines
     have me leaving her and returning
     to you because the audience won't
     buy a rejection of the happy
     American family.  She does have
     one script in which I kill myself,
     an adapted for television version
     of Anna Karenina in which she's
     Count Vronsky and I'm Anna.

          LOUISE
     You're in for some dreadful grief,
     Max.

          MAX
     I know.


128.  INT. UBS BUILDING - N.Y. - DIANA'S OFFICE, FRIDAY,
FEBRUARY 28, 1975

DIANA, murmuring into her squawk box and, at the same
time, putting last minute things into a weekend bag.
She is ebullient --

          DIANA
          (on squawk box)
     ... I know what NBC offered them,
     Marty, so I'm saying go to three
     point five, and I want an option
     for a third run on all of them
     ... Marty, I'm in a big hurry, and
     you and Charlie are supposed to be
     negotiating this, so goodbye and
     good luck, and I'll see you Monday ...

Clicks off her squawk box, snaps her weekend bag shut,
whisks her sheep wool-lined coat out of her closet and
strides out into --


129.  INT. DIANA'S SECRETARY'S OFFICE

-- where there is no one sitting, and continues out
into --


130.  INT. PROGRAMMING DEPARTMENT - COMMON ROOM

where a few SECRETARIES are still at their desks.
TOMMY PELLEGRINO is just coming out of his office --

          PELLEGRINO
          (calls to DIANA)
     Jimmy Caan's agent just called
     and says absolutely nix.

          DIANA
          (striding across
          the room)
     You can't win them all.


          PELLEGRINO
     Where can I reach you later today?

          DIANA
          (exiting)
     You can't.  I'll be gone all weekend.

PELLEGRINO turns to BARBARA SCHLESINGER now poking her
head out of her office --

          PELLEGRINO
     I think the Dragon Lady got her-
     self a dragon fellow.

          SCHLESINGER
     Poor bastard.


131.  EXT. UBS BUILDING - SIXTH AVENUE - AFTERNOON - DAY

DIANA, now wearing her sheep wool-lined coat and carry-
ing her weekend bag, comes striding happily out through
the entrance doors, heads for 55th Street, spots a
double-parked car, and heads heedless of traffic
across the street to --



132.  EXT. 55TH STREET - DAY

MAX SCHUMACHER in a rented Chevy, leaning across to
open the door for her.  She slips into the front seat,
slams the door shut, nestles her head on MAX'S over-
coated shoulder, as he starts the ignition --

          DIANA
          (happy and in love)
     NBC's offering three point two
     and a half mil per for a package
     of five James Bond pictures, and
     I think I'm going to steal them
     for three point five with a third
     run --

They move out into the heavy traffic of Sixth Avenue --


133.  EXT. DESERTED BEACH IN THE HAMPTONS - DUSK

Traditional lyric love scene.  The two mackinawed
lovers walking hand-in-hand on a lovely stretch of
deserted winter beach.  The tide is coming in --

          DIANA
          (bubbling)
     The vigilante show is sold firm.
     Ford took a complete position at,
     so help me, five-fifty CPM.  In
     fact, I'm moving the vigilante
     show to nine and I'm going to
     stick the Mao Tse Tung Hour in
     at eight because we're having a
     lot of trouble selling the Mao
     Tse Tung Hour.  This way we give
     it a terrific lead-in from the
     Howard Beale Show and we'll back
     into the vigilantes, and it
     certainly ought to carry its own
     time slot --


134.  INT. A ROMANTIC LITTLE ITALIAN RESTAURANT

The obligatory Italian restaurant, checkered table-
cloth, candles, wine, etc.  DIANA and MAX at dinner,
utterly rapt in each other --

          DIANA
          (pouring out her heart)
     That Mao Tse Tung Hour is turning
     into one big pain in the ass.
     We're having heavy legal problems
     with the federal government right
     now.  Two FBI guys turned up in
     Hackett's office last week and
     served us with a subpoena.  They
     heard about our Flagstaff bank
     rip-off film, and they want it.
     We're getting around that by
     doing the show in collaboration
     with the News Division, so Hackett
     told the FBI to fuck off; we're
     standing on the First Amendment,
     freedom of the press, and the

     right to protect our sources --


135.  EXT. MOTOR COURT - NIGHT

DIANA and MAX getting out of their car and heading
for one of the ground-level rooms, MAX unlocking the
door --

          DIANA
          (chirping merrily along)
     -- Walter thinks we can knock out
     the misprision of felony charge --

They go into --


136.  INT. MOTOR COURT - THEIR ROOM

MAX flicks the light on, kicks the door shut, and they
are instantly into each other's arms in a passionate
embrace.

          DIANA
     -- but he says absolutely nix
     on going to series.  They'll hit
     us with inducement and conspiracy
     to commit a crime --

She busily removes her shoes and unbuttons her blouse
and whisks out of her slacks; and, down to her bikini
panties, she is now scouring the walls for a thermostat.

          DIANA
     Christ, it's cold in here --
          (she turns up
          the heat)
     You see we're paying these nuts
     from the Ecumenical Liberation Army
     ten thousand bucks a week to bring
     in authentic film footage on their
     revolutionary activities, and that
     constitutes inducement to commit
     a crime; and Walter says we'll all
     wind up in federal prison --

Nubile and nearly naked, she entwines herself around
MAX, who, by now, has stripped down to his trousers;
and the two hungering bodies slide down onto the bed
where they commence an affable moment of amative
foreplay --

          DIANA
          (efficiently unbuckling
          and unzippering MAX's
          trousers)
     -- I said: "Walter, let the government
     sue us!  We'll take them to the
     Supreme Court!  We'll be front page
     for months!  The Washington Post
     and the New York Times will be doing
     two editorials a week about us!
     We'll have more press than Watergate!"

Groping, grasping, gasping and fondling, they contrive
to denude each other, and, in a fever of sexual hunger,
DIANA mounts MAX, and the SCREEN is filled with the
voluptuous writhings of love, DIANA crying out with
increasing exultancy --

          DIANA
          (in the throes
          of passion)
     -- All I need -- is six weeks
     of federal litigation -- and the
     Mao Tse Tung Hour -- can start
     carrying its own time slot!

She screams in consummation, sighs a long, deliciously
shuddering sigh, and sinks softly down into MAX's
embrace.  For a moment, she rests her head on MAX's
chest, eyes closed in feline contentment.

          DIANA
          (after a moment,
          she purrs)
     What's really bugging me now is my
     daytime programming.  NBC's got a
     lock on daytime with their lousy
     game shows, and I'd like to bust
     them.  I'm thinking of doing a
     homosexual soap opera -- The Dykes
     -- the heart-rending saga of a
     woman helplessly in love with her
     husband's mistress. What do you
     think? --

          NARRATOR
     The Mary Ann Gifford pilot movie
     went on the air March 14th --


137.  EXT. A SMALL ISOLATED FARMHOUSE IN ENCINO - NIGHT

A black LIMOUSINE winds its way up the dirt road to
the front porch, where the car is halted and checked
out by an armed guard (DOWLING) --

          NARRATOR
     -- It received a 47 share in its
     first hour, climbing to a 51 during
     its second hour --

Slivers of lights slither out from behind the drawn
shades of the farmhouse, and we can hear the sounds of
ANGRY VOICES.

TWO AGENTS from ICM disgorge from the limousine -- a
young man in his early 30's, FREDDIE, carrying a large
manila envelope, and a fat young woman in her mid-30's,
HELEN MIGGS, carrying an attach, case --

          NARRATOR
     -- showing sustained and increasing
     audience interest.  The network
     promptly committed to fifteen
     shows --

MIGGS and FREDDIE go up the porch and into --


138.  INT. THE FARMHOUSE - ENTRANCE FOYER

Cartons, crates, newspapers, scraps of food, torn
grocery bags, stacks of pamphlets, cases of weapons and
ammunition, broken furniture and sleeping bags are
littered every which way about.  There seems to be some
sort of conference going on in the living room, O.S.
left --

          NARRATOR
     -- with an option for ten more --


139.  As the TWO ICM AGENTS head for the living room,
we can see LAUREEN HOBBS and the three William
Norris agents, WALLIE, LENNIE and ED, perhaps
remembered from earlier scenes.  We can also see
the GREAT AHMED KHAN, still wearing his shako, MARY
ANN GIFFORD, still wearing her bandoliers of bullets,
and OTHER MEMBERS of the Khan's group in fatigues
and bearing arms.  There is also a middle-aged LAWYER
from ICM named WILLIE STEIN.  Everybody -- with the
exception of the GREAT KHAN's retinue -- is seated
on broken chairs and cartons and crates --

          NARRATOR
     -- There were, of course, the usual
     production difficulties --

Everybody in the living room conference is studying
80-page contracts from which one of the agents (WALLIE)
is reading --

          WALLIE
          (mumbling along)
     -- "herein called either 'the
     Production Fee' or 'overhead' equal
     to twenty percent two-oh (except
     such percentage shall be thirty
     percent three-oh for ninety minute
     or longer television programs --


140.  INT. THE FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM

          STEIN
          (a nervous man, to the new
          arrivals, now entering)
     Where the hell have you been?

          MIGGS
          (embracing the
          GREAT KHAN)
     Ahmed, sweet, that dodo you sent
     for a driver couldn't find this
     fucking place.

There is a genial exchange of helloes and waves between
the phalanxes of AGENTS --

          STEIN
     Let's get on with this before
     they raid this place, and we all
     wind up in the joint.

          ED
          (to FREDDIE now
          pulling up a crate)
     We're on Schedule A, page seven,
     small c small i --

          MIGGS
          (whisking through her
          copy of the contract)
     Have we settled that sub-licensing
     thing? We want a clear definition
     here.  Gross proceeds should consist
     of all funds the sublicensee receives
     not merely the net amount remitted
     after payment to sublicensee or
     distributor.

          STEIN
     We're not sitting still for over-
     head charges as a cost prior to
     distribution.

          LAUREEN
          (whose nerves have
          worn thin, explodes:)
     Don't fuck with my distribution
     costs!  I'm getting a lousy two-
     fifteen per segment, and I 'm already
     deficiting twenty-five grand a week
     with Metro.  I'm paying William
     Morris ten percent off the top!
          (indicates the
          GREAT KHAN)
     -- And I'm giving this turkey ten
     thou a segment and another five for
     this fruitcake --
          (meaning MARY ANN GIFFORD)
     And, Helen, don't start no shit
     with me about a piece again!
     I'm paying Metro twenty percent of
     all foreign and Canadian distribution,
     and that's after recoupment!  The
     Communist Party's not going to see
     a nickel out of this goddam show
     until we go into syndication!

          MIGGS
     Come on, Laureen, you've got the
     party in there for seventy-five
     hundred a week production expenses.

          LAUREEN
     I'm not giving this pseudo in-
     surrectionary sectarian a piece
     of my show!  I'm not giving him
     script approval!  And I sure as
     shit ain't cutting him in on my
     distribution charges I

          MARY ANN GIFFORD
          (screaming in from
          the back)
     Fuggin fascist! Have you seen the
     movies we took at the San Marino
     jail break-out demonstrating the
     rising up of a seminal prisoner-
     class infrastructure!

          LAUREEN
     You can blow the seminal prisoner-
     class infrastructure out your ass!
     I'm not knocking down my goddam
     distribution charges!

The GREAT KHAN decides to offer an opinion by SHOOTING
his PISTOL off into the air. This gives everybody
something to consider, especially WILLIE STEIN who
almost has a heart attack.

          THE GREAT KHAN
     Man, give her the fucking over-
     head clause.

          STEIN
     How did I get here? Who's going
     to believe this?  I'm sitting here
     in a goddam farm in Encino at ten
     o'clock at night negotiating over-
     head charges with cowboys!

          THE GREAT KHAN
          (flipping through
          his copy)
     Let's get to page twenty-two,
     five, small a, subsidiary rights.

Everybody starts flipping through their contracts.

          LENNIE
     Where are we now?

          WALLIE
     Page twenty-two, middle of the
     page, subsidiary rights --

141.  EXT. FRONT OF THE CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - WEDNESDAY,
MAY 28 - 6:00 P.M. - DAY

A HOTEL MARQUEE which reads:

WELCOME UBS AFFILIATES CONVENTION

Across the marquee, looking down on the CRUSH of station
managers, program executives and sales vice-presidents
from the various affiliates, all tuxedoed and
evening-gowned and milling about.  Spotted in the
cheerful CRUSH can be seen DIANA, MR. AND MRS. AMUNDSEN,
MR. AND MRS. ZANGWILL, jollying it up with the
affiliates' executives and their wives --


142.  INT. GRAND BALLROOM - COCKTAIL AREA - CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL

A huge BANNER reading UBS AFFILIATES 1975 hanging
high over the ballroom.

PAN DOWN to show 1000 tuxedoed and evening-gowned
PEOPLE, mostly middle-aged in the vast shuffle of
cocktail time -- HUBBUB, intermingling flux and a
slow general shuffling surge through the doors
leading into --


143.  INT. GRAND BALLROOM

CLOSER ANGLE of the CRUSH of PEOPLE at the doors.
HERBERT THACKERAY, (VP Stations Relations,) and NORMAN
MOLDANIAN (VP Owned Stations,) with their WIVES and
carrying their drinks and exchanging pleasantries with
the GENERAL MANAGER of WJGL Cincinnati and his WIFE and
the GENERAL MANAGER of KBEX Albuquerque and his WIFE as
well as the SALES MANAGER of that station and his WIFE.
High CHATTER and HUBBUB, lots of hearty chuckles and
general Rotarian bonhomie.  In b.g., FRANK HACKETT and
his WIFE exchanging Rotarian bonhomie with some other
GENERAL MANAGERS and PROGRAM DIRECTORS and SALES
MANAGERS of various affiliates and their WIVES --


144.  ANOTHER ANGLE as DIANA, evening-gowned, beautiful,
glowing and effulgent, leans down from her place on the
dais to accept congratulatory comments from the SALES
MANAGER of KGIM, Boise, and his WIFE standing on the
floor level --

          SALES MANAGER
          (pumping DIANA's hand)
     -- Millard Villanova, Sales Manager,
     KGIM, Boise -- my wife, here, Maureen --

          DIANA
     My pleasure --

          SALES MANAGER
     I just want to tell you we saw your
     great stuff this afternoon, Di --
     it was great --

          DIANA
     Great, Millard --

She turns to accept some more enthusiastic greetings
from another GENERAL MANAGER and his WIFE being brought
down the dais to her by WALTER AMUNDSEN, (General
Counsel Network) --


145.  WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the whole ballroom, dark, everybody
seated at their tables now, listening to an address by
NELSON CHANEY (President UBS Network), a spotlighted
figure at the podium --

          CHANEY
     -- Over the past two days, you've
     all had opportunity to meet Diana
     Christenson, our Vice President
     in charge of programming.  This
     afternoon, you all saw some of
     the stuff she's set up for the
     new season --

CLOSER SHOT of CHANEY --

          CHANEY
     You all know she's the woman behind
     the Howard Beale show.  We know
     she's beautiful.  We know she's
     brainy. I just think, before we
     start digging into our Chateau-
     briands, we ought to let her know
     how we feel about her --

An OVATION from the AUDIENCE.  In response to CHANEY's
beckoning, DIANA rises from her chair in the glistening
shadows of the dais and comes down to the podium.  She
stands there -- showered with APPLAUSE, beaming,
exultant --

          DIANA
     We've got the number one show in
     television!
          (applause)
     And, at next year's affiliates'
     meeting, I'll be standing here
     telling you we've got the top
     five!
          (tumult)

ANOTHER ANGLE ACROSS HACKETT at the dais with DIANA
in b.g.  An ASSISTANT MANAGER leans across HACKETT
and murmurs to him --

          DIANA
     Last year, we were the number
     four network -- next year, we're
     number one!
          (tumult)

HACKETT rises, murmurs apologies to his neighbors,
follows the ASSISTANT MANAGER through the shadows of
the dais and heads out --

          DIANA
     It is exactly seven o'clock here
     in Los Angeles.  And right now over
     a million homes using television
     in this city are turning their dials
     to channel 3-- and that's our channel!

MUSIC:  A RATAPLAN OF KETTLEDRUMS AND A TARANTARA
OF TRUMPETS.


146.  INT. COCKTAIL AREA OF THE GRAND BALLROOM

A portable Teevee set perched on a bar --

          ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
     Ladies and gentlemen! -- let's
     hear it! -- how do you feel?! --

          STUDIO AUDIENCE (ON TV)
          (happily roaring out)
     We're mad as hell, and we're not
     going to take this any more!

PULL BACK to show we are in the vast cocktail area of
the Grand Ballroom, now being cleared away by a staff of
WAITERS and BUSBOYS -- hors d'oeuvres, spreads and booze
being carried away, table and chairs being packed off,
linens being whisked and folded.  A couple of WAITERS
are watching the Howard Beale show on the portable TV
set perched on the room's bar --

          STUDIO ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
     Ladies and gentlemen -- the mad
     prophet of the airways -- Howard
     Beale!

On the TV set, the house lights go down, the curtain
rises, and, as before, bare stage, shimmering stained
glass window, an ethereal shaft of light, and HOWARD
BEALE in his austere black suit trudges out and
explodes --

          HOWARD (ON TV)
     All right, listen to me!  Listen
     carefully!  This is your goddam life
     I'm talking about today!  In this
     country, when one company takes over
     another company, they simply buy up
     a controlling share of the stock.
     But first they have to file notice
     with the government.  That's how
     C.C. and A. -- the Communications
     Corporation of America -- bought up
     the company that owns this network.
     And now somebody's buying up C.C.
     and A!  Some company named Western
     World Funding Corporation is buying
     up C.C. and A!  They filed their
     notice this morning!  Well, just who
     the hell is Western World Funding
     Corporation?  It's a consortium of
     banks and insurance companies who
     are not buying C.C. and A. for
     themselves but as agents for
     somebody else!


147.  LONG WIDE ANGLE SHOT with TV set in f.g. showing the
spacious cocktail area being cleared away, as far across
the room the doors to the Ballroom open and HACKETT
follows the ASSISTANT MANAGER in.  HACKETT lingers at
the doors while the ASSISTANT MANAGER gets a WAITER to
bring a jack phone to one of the tables still standing --

          HOWARD (ON TV)
     Well, who's this somebody else?
     They won't tell you!  They won't
     tell you, they won't tell the
     Senate, they won't tell the SEC,
     the FCC, the Justice Department,
     they won't tell anybody!  They say
     it's none of our business!  The
     hell it ain't! --

REVERSE ACROSS HACKETT as a jack phone is brought to
his table; the cluster around the TV set in b.g.

          HACKETT
          (on phone)
     This is Mr. Hackett, do you have
     a New York call for me?
          (calls to cluster
          around TV set)
     Do you want to turn that down,
     please --

REVERSE ACROSS TV set with HACKETT in b.g.

          HOWARD (ON TV)
          (volume a bit down)
     Well, I'll tell you who they're
     buying C.C. and A. for.  They're
     buying it for the Saudi-Arabian
     Investment Corporation!  They're
     buying it for the Arabs!

REVERSE ON HACKETT.

          HACKETT
          (on phone, the
          hearty executive)
     Clarence?  Frank Hackett here I
     How's everything back in New York?
     How's the good lady? --
          (his face sobers)
     -- All right, take it easy,
     Clarence, I don't know what you're
     talking about...When?...Clarence,
     take it easy.  The Howard Beale
     show's just going on out here.  You
     guys get it three hours earlier in
     New York ...  Clarence, take it
     easy.  How the hell could I see it?
     It's just on now -- Well, when did
     Mr. Jensen call you?

REVERSE ACROSS TV set.  In b.g., HACKETT has hung up and is
slowly walking toward the group around the TV set --

          HOWARD (ON TV)
     -- We know the Arabs control more
     than sixteen billion dollars in this
     country!  They own a chunk of Fifth
     Avenue, twenty downtown pieces of
     Boston, a part of the port of New
     Orleans, an industrial park in Salt
     Lake city.  They own big hunks of
     the Atlanta Hilton, the Arizona Land
     and cattle Company, the Security
     National Bank in California, the
     Bank of the Commonwealth in Detroit!
     They control ARAMCO, so that puts
     them into Exxon, Texaco and Mobil
     oil!  They're all over - New Jersey,
     Louisville, St.Louis, Missouri!  And
     that's only what we know about!
     There's a hell of a lot more we
     don't know about because all those
     Arab petro-dollars are washed
     through Switzerland and Canada and
     the biggest banks in this country!

HACKETT peers over the shoulder of a WAITER to watch the
television show --

          HOWARD (ON TV)
     For example, what we don't know
     about is this C.C.A. deal and all the
     other C.C.A. deals!
          (HACKETT winces)
     Right now, the Arabs have screwed us
     out of enough American dollars to
     come back and, with our own money,
     buy General Motors, IBM, ITT, A T
     and T, Dupont, U.S.  Steel, and
     twenty other top American companies.
     Hell, they already own half of England.


148.  INT. A VIDEOTAPE ROOM - UBS BUILDING - LOS ANGELES

HACKETT, NELSON CHANEY and WALTER AMUNDSEN, all
tuxedoed, and DIANA, evening-gowned, sit and stand
in the dark smallish room, cluttered with electronic
equipment, watching a replay of the Howard Beale show
on the big screen.  TWO TECHNICIANS fiddle with their
equipment --

          HOWARD' (ON SCREEN)
     Now, listen to me, goddammit!  The
     Arabs are simply buying us!  They're
     buying all our land, our whole
     economy, the press, the factories,
     financial institutions, the
     government!  They're going to own
     us!  A handful of agas, shahs and
     emirs who despise this country and
     everything it stands for --
     democracy, freedom, the right for me
     to get up on television and tell you
     about it -- a couple of dozen
     medieval fanatics are going to own
     where you work, where you live, what
     you read, what you see, your cars,
     your bowling alleys, your mortgages,
     your schools, your churches, your
     libraries, your kids, your whole
     life! --

          AMUNDSEN
          (mutters)
     The son of a bitch is effective
     all right --

HACKETT, who's seen all this already, isn't even watching.
He is sprawled in his chair, eyes closed, numbed, even
serene with despair.

          HOWARD (ON SCREEN)
     -- And there's not a single law on
     the books to stop them!  There's
     only one thing that can stop them --
     you!  So I want you to get up now.
     I want you to get out of your chairs
     and go to the phone.  Right now.  I
     want you to go to your phone or get
     in your car and drive into the
     Western Union office in town.  I
     want everybody listening to me to
     get up right now and send a telegram
     to the White House --

          HACKETT
          (sighs in soft anguish)
     Oh, God

          HOWARD (ON SCREEN)
     By midnight tonight I want a million
     telegrams in the White House!  I
     want them wading knee-deep in
     telegrams at the White House!  Get
     up!  Right now!  And send President
     Ford a telegram saying:  "I'm mad as
     hell and I'm not going to take this
     any more!  I don't want the banks
     selling my country to the Arabs!  I
     want this C.C. and A. deal stopped
     now! --

          HACKETT
     Oh, God --

          HOWARD (ON SCREEN)
     I want this C.C. and A. deal stopped
     now!  I want this C.C. and A. deal
     stopped now!

At which point, HOWARD keels over in his now familiar
prophetic swoon.  On SCREEN, ATTENDANTS come and carry
HOWARD off --

          CHANEY
          (to a TECHNICIAN)
     Is that it? Does he come back
     later in the show?

          TECHNICIAN
     That's it.  This is one of those
     shows he just zonks out.

          CHANEY
          (to HACKETT)
     Do you want to see any more, Frank?
          (HACKETT sits in
          numb silence)
     All right, turn it off --

The other TECHNICIAN pushes a button and the SCREEN
goes white. The first TECHNICIAN flicks the room
lights on.

          AMUNDSEN
          (to HACKETT)
     Do you want to go to your office?

HACKETT stares silently into space.

          CHANEY
          (to the TECHNICIANS)
     Look, could we have the room?

          TECHNICIAN
     Sure.


149.  The two TECHNICIANS exit.  SILENCE fills the cluttered
room.  AMUNDSEN and HACKETT sit in their chairs, CHANEY
leans against a side wall, DIANA lounges against a rear
wall.  After a moment, AMUNDSEN stretches, stands --

          AMUNDSEN
     Well, I'd like to see a typescript
     and run it a couple of more times,
     but I don't think he said anything
     seriously actionable.  But, as for
     this whole C.C. and A. deal with the
     Saudis, you'd know a lot more about
     that than I would, Frank, is it
     true?

HACKETT sighs.

          HACKETT
          (mumbles)
     Yes.  C.C. and A. has two billions
     in loans with the Saudis, and they
     hold every pledge we've got.  We
     need that Saudi money bad.
          (he stands, so
          wretched he is
          tranquil)
     A disaster.  This show is a disaster,
     an unmitigated disaster, the death
     knell.  I'm ruined, I'm dead, I'm
     finished.

          CHANEY
     Maybe we're overstating Beale's
     clout with the public.

          HACKETT
     An hour ago, Clarence McElheny called
     me from New York.  It was ten o'clock
     in the East, and our people in the
     White House report they were already
     knee-deep in telegrams.  By tomorrow
     morning, they'll be suffocating in
     telegrams.

          CHANEY
     Well, can the government stop the
     deal?

          HACKETT
     They can hold it up.  The SEC could
     hold this deal up for twenty years
     if they wanted to.  I'm finished.
     Any second that phone's going to
     ring and Clarence McElheny's going
     to tell me Mr. Jensen wants me in
     his office tomorrow morning so he
     can personally chop my head off.

Tears stream shamelessly down his cheeks as he shuffles,
a broken man, around the room.

          HACKETT
     Four hours ago, I was the sun God
     at C.C. and A., Mr. Jensen's hand-
     picked golden boy, the heir apparent.
     Now I'm a man without a corporation!

          DIANA
          (comes off the
          back wall)
     Let's get back to Howard Beale.
     You're not seriously going to pull
     Beale off the air.

          HACKETT
     Mr. Jensen is unhappy with Howard
     Beale and wants him discontinued.

          DIANA
     He may be unhappy, but he isn't
     stupid enough to withdraw the number
     one show on television out of pique.

          HACKETT
          (explodes)
     Two billion dollars isn't pique!
     That's the wrath of God!  And the
     wrath of God wants Howard Beale
     fired!

          DIANA
     What for?  Every other network
     will grab him the minute he walks
     out the door.  He'll be back on
     the air for ABC tomorrow.  And
     we'll lose twenty points in audience
     share in the first week, roughly a
     forty million loss in revenues for
     the year.

          HACKETT
     I'm going to kill Howard Beale!
     I'm going to impale the son of a
     bitch with a sharp stick through
     the heart!

          DIANA
     And let's not discount federal
     action by the Justice Department.
     If C.C. and A. pulls Beale off the
     air as an act of retribution,
     that's a flagrant violation of
     network autonomy and an egregious
     breach of the consent decree.

          HACKETT
          (beginning to like his
          new train of thought)
     I'll take out a contract on him.
     I'll hire professional killers.
     I'll do it myself.  I'll strangle
     him with a sashcord.

          DIANA
     No, I don't think Jensen is going
     to fire anybody.  He's sitting up
     there in his office surrounded by
     lawyers and senior vice presidents,
     and right about now, they've begun
     to realize the extraordinary impact
     of television.  That impact can be
     focused, manipulated, utilized.
     If Howard Beale can hurt them, he
     can help them.

The PHONE RINGS.  A moment of anxious silence.  HACKETT
picks it up --

          HACKETT
          (on phone)
     Hackett -- Yes, Clarence, I've
     already booked my flight ... Well,
     can you give me a little more time
     than that?  I've got the red-eye
     flight, I won't be back in New York
     till six tomorrow morning ... That'll
     be just fine.  I'll see you then --

He returns the phone to its cradle, regards DIANA for
a moment.

          HACKETT
     Mr. Jensen wants to meet Howard
     Beale personally.  He wants Mr. Beale
     in his office at ten o'clock tomorrow
     morning --


150.  EXT. THE C.C. AND A. BUILDING - PARK AVE. AND 46TH
STREET - MORNING

A black limousine pulls to the curb in front of the C.C.
and A. Building, disgorging HACKETT, and, a moment
later, HOWARD BEALE, both dressed in banker's gray.  As
they move for the building's entrance, HACKETT herding
HOWARD along, it becomes clear that HOWARD is in a
beatified state.  His eyes glisten transcendentally, and
he smiles the smile of the elevated spirit.  He suddenly
pulls up abruptly, raises his arms over his head, and
announces at the top of his lungs:

          HOWARD
          (imbued)
     The final revelation is at hand!
     I have seen the shattering
     fulgurations of ultimate clarity!
     The light is impending!  I bear
     witness to the light!

This outburst doesn't seem to bother most of the PEOPLE
passing by except for ONE or TWO who murmur:  "Hey,
that's Howard Beale, isn't it?"  The outburst does
appall FRANK HACKETT, who stares in distress and
entreaty to some god in the heavens, and clutches at
HOWARD's arm to get him moving again.


151.  INT. ARTHUR JENSEN'S OFFICE

An enormous office with two walls of windows towering
over the Manhattan landscape and through which SUNLIGHT
streams in.  ARTHUR JENSEN is rising from behind his
massive desk --

          JENSEN
     Good afternoon, Mr. Beale.  They
     tell me you're a madman.

CAMERA DOLLIES to include HOWARD just coming into the
room.

          HOWARD
          (closing the door
          behind himself)
     Only desultorily.

          JENSEN
     How are you now?

          HOWARD
          (as mad as a hatter)
     I'm as mad as a hatter.

          JENSEN
     Who isn't? Don't sit down.
     I'm taking you to our conference
     room which seems more seemly a
     setting for what I have to say
     to you.

He takes HOWARD'S arm and moves him to a large oaken
door leading out of JENSEN'S office --

          JENSEN
     I started as a salesman, Mr. Beale.
     I sold sewing machines and automobile
     parts, hair brushes and electronic
     equipment.  They say I can sell
     anything.  I'd like to try and sell
     something to you --

They pass into --


152.  INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM - C.C. AND A. BUILDING

The overwhelming cathedral of a conference room
remembered perhaps from an earlier scene where Frank
Hackett gave his annual report.  When last seen, it was
in pitch darkness, but now the enormous curtains are up,
and an almost celestial light pours in through the huge
windows.  Being on the 43rd and 44th floors, the sky
outside is only sporadically interrupted by the towers
of other skyscrapers.  The double semi- circular bank of
seats are all empty, and the general effect is one of
hushed vastness --

          JENSEN
     Valhalla, Mr. Beale, please sit
     down --

He leads HOWARD down the steps to the floor level,
himself ascends again to the small stage and the podium.
HOWARD sits in one of the 200 odd seats.  JENSEN pushes
a button, and the enormous drapes slowly fall, slicing
away layers of light until the vast room is utterly
dark.  Then, the little pinspots at each of the desks,
including the one behind which HOWARD is seated, pop on,
creating a miniature Milky Way effect.  A shaft of white
LIGHT shoots out from the rear of the room, spotting
JENSEN on the podium, a sun of its own little galaxy.
Behind him, the shadowed white of the lecture screen.
JENSEN suddenly wheels to his audience of one and roars
out:

          JENSEN
     You have meddled with the primal
     forces of nature, Mr. Beale, and I
     won't have it, is that clear?!  You
     think you have merely stopped a
     business deal -- that is not the
     case!  The Arabs have taken billions
     of dollars out of this country, and
     now they must put it back.  It is
     ebb and flow, tidal gravity, it is
     ecological balance!  You are an old
     man who thinks in terms of nations
     and peoples.  There are no nations!
     There are no peoples!  There are no
     Russians.  There are no Arabs!
     There are no third worlds!  There is
     no West!  There is only one holistic
     system of systems, one vast and
     immane, interwoven, interacting,
     multi-variate, multi-national
     dominion of dollars! petro-dollars,
     electro-dollars, multi-dollars!,
     Reichmarks, rubles, rin, pounds and
     shekels!  It is the international
     system of currency that determines
     the totality of life on this planet!
     That is the natural order of things
     today!  That is the atomic,
     subatomic and galactic structure of
     things today!  And you have meddled
     with the primal forces of nature,
     and you will atone!  Am I getting
     through to you, Mr. Beale?
          (pause)
     You get up on your little twenty-
     one inch screen, and howl about
     America and democracy.  There is no
     America.  There is no democracy.
     There is only IBM and ITT and A T
     and T and Dupont, Dow, Union Carbide
     and Exxon.  Those are the nations of
     the world today.  What do you think
     the Russians talk about in their
     councils of state -- Karl Marx?
     They pull out their linear
     programming charts, statistical
     decision theories and minimax
     solutions and compute the price-cost
     probabilities of their transactions
     and investments just like we do.  We
     no longer live in a world of nations
     and ideologies, Mr. Beale.  The
     world is a college of corporations,
     inexorably deter- mined by the
     immutable by-laws of business.  The
     world is a business, Mr. Beale!  It
     has been since man crawled out of
     the slime, and our children, Mr.
     Beale, will live to see that perfect
     world in which there is no war and
     famine, oppression and brutality --
     one vast and ecumenical holding

     company, for whom all men will work
     to serve a common profit, in which
     all men will hold a share of stock,
     all necessities provided, all
     anxieties tranquilized, all boredom
     amused.  And I have chosen you to
     preach this evangel, Mr. Beale.

          HOWARD
          (humble whisper)
     Why me?

          JENSEN
     Because you're on television, dummy.
     Sixty million people watch you
     every night of the week, Monday
     through Friday.

HOWARD slowly rises from the blackness of his seat so
that he is lit only by the ethereal diffusion of light
shooting out from the rear of the room.  He stares at
JENSEN spotted on the podium, transfixed.

          HOWARD
     I have seen the face of God!

In b.g., up on the podium, JENSEN considers this
curious statement for a moment.

          JENSEN
     You just might be right, Mr. Beale.

          NARRATOR
     That evening, Howard Beale went
     on the air to preach the corporate
     cosmology of Arthur Jensen.


153.  INT. NETWORK NEWS CONTROL ROOM

The CREW at their various control panels.  Business
as usual.  If anything, EVERYBODY in the control room
appears a little more bored.  On the SHOW MONITOR,
HOWARD BEALE stands in his stained-glass-filtered
spotlight, but, rather than his old enraged self, he
seems sad, resigned, weary --

          HOWARD (ON MONITOR)
          (sad, resigned, weary)
     Last night, I got up here and asked
     you people to stand up and fight for
     your heritage, and you did and it
     was beautiful.  Six million
     telegrams were received at the White
     House.  The Arab takeover of C.C.
     and A. has been stopped.  The people
     spoke, the people won.  It was a
     radiant eruption of democracy.  But
     I think that was it, fellers.  That
     sort of thing isn't likely to happen
     again.  Because, in the bottom of
     all our terrified souls, we all know
     that democracy is a dying giant, a
     sick, sick dying, decaying political
     concept, writhing in its final pain.

     I don't mean the United States is
     finished as a world power.  The
     United States is the most powerful,
     the richest, the most advanced
     country in the world, light-years
     ahead of any other country.  And I
     don't mean the Communists are going
     to take over the world.  The
     Communists are deader than we are.
     What's finished is the idea that
     this great country is dedicated to
     the freedom and flourishing of every
     individual in it.  It's the
     individual that's finished.  It's
     the single, solitary human being
     who's finished.  It's every single
     one of you out there who's finished.
     Because this is no longer a nation
     of independent individuals.  This is
     a nation of two hundred odd million
     transistorized, deodorized,
     whiter- than-white, steel-belted
     bodies, totally unnecessary as human
     beings and as replaceable as piston
     rods --

          NARRATOR
     It was a perfectly admissible
     argument that Howard Beale advanced
     in the days that followed; it was,
     however, also a very tedious and
     depressing one.  By the end of
     the first week in June --


154   INT. DIANA'S APARTMENT - THURSDAY - JUNE 19 - ENTRANCE
FOYER - 7:15 P.M.

-- as MAX lets himself into the apartment.  MAX seems
depressed --

          NARRATOR
     -- the Howard Beale show had dropped
     one point in the ratings, and its
     trend of shares dipped under forty-
     eight for the first time since last
     November --

MAX moves into the living room as DIANA's VOICE erupts
shrilly from the bedroom --

          DIANA (O.S.)
     -- You're his goddam agent, Lew!,
     I'm counting on you to talk some
     sense into the lunatic!


155.  INT. DIANA'S BEDROOM

DIANA perched on her bed, shrilling into the telephone --

          DIANA
     We're starting to get rumbles from
     the agencies.  Another couple of
     weeks of this, and the sponsors will
     be bailing out! ... This is breach of
     contract, Lew!  This isn't the Howard
     Beale we signed.  You better get him
     off this corporate universe kick or,
     so help me, I'll pull him off the
     air! ... I told him, Lew! I've been
     telling him every day for a week!
     I'm sick of telling him! Now, you
     tell him!

She slams the receiver down, sits in silent rage on the
bed, turns up the volume on her remote control unit.
HOWARD'S VOICE suddenly emanates from the television set
across the room from her --

          HOWARD (ON TV)
     -- Well, the time has come to say:
     is dehumanization such a bad word?
     Because good or bad, that's what's
     so.  The whole world is becoming
     humanoid, creatures that look human
     but aren't.  The whole world, not
     just us.  We're just the most
     advanced country, so we're getting
     there first --

DIANA reaches for the phone again, dials briskly.  She looks
up to note MAX regarding her from the doorway.  She regards
him sullenly.  They are both clearly in foul tempers.

          HOWARD (ON TV)
     -- The whole world's people are
     becoming mass-produced, programmed,
     wired, insensate things useful only
     to produce and consume other
     mass-produced things, all of them as
     unnecessary and useless as we are --

          MAX
     I'm sorry I'm late --


They exchange dully sullen looks.  MAX turns back into --


156.  INT. THE LIVING ROOM

-- where he sprawls morosely on one of the soft chairs --

          HOWARD (ON TV O.S.)
     -- that's the simple truth you
     have to grasp, that human existence
     is an utterly futile and purposeless
     thing --


158.  INT. THE BEDROOM

DIANA perched on her bed, cross-legged --

          DIANA
          (on phone)
     Barbara?  Diana --

          HOWARD (ON TV)
     -- because once you've grasped that,
     then the whole universe becomes
     orderly and comprehensible --

          DIANA
          (on phone)
     Listen, I had another howling
     session with Howard Beale today,
     and he's impenetrable.  We better
     start shoring up the dykes --

          HOWARD (ON TV)
     -- We are right now living in what
     has to be called a corporate
     society, a corporate world, a
     corporate universe.  This world
     quite simply is a vast cosmology of
     small corporations orbiting around
     larger corporations who, in turn,
     revolve around giant corporations --

          DIANA
          (stares at set, mutters)
     Jesus Christ --

          HOWARD (ON TV)
     -- and this whole, endless, ultimate
     cosmology is expressly designed for
     the production and consumption of
     useless things --

DIANA clicks the remote control thing, and the TV set
goes black.

          DIANA
          (on phone)
     Let's start looking around for
     possible replacements.  I hear ABC's
     grooming a mad prophet of their own
     in Chicago as our com- petition for
     next season.  See if you can get a
     tape on him.  Maybe we can steal
     him.  And let's start building up
     the other segments on the show.
     Sybil the Soothsayer, Jim Webbing.
     The Vox Populi segment is catching
     on; let's make that a daily feature --


159.  INT. THE LIVING ROOM

MAX sprawled on the soft chair.  We notice that, in the
back of the living room, a bridge table has been set up
as a makeshift desk.  It has a typewriter on it and a
welter of papers and books and filing folders.  DIANA
appears in the bedroom doorway, regards MAX coldly --

          DIANA
     You know, you could help me out
     with Howard if you wanted to.
     He listens to you.  You're his
     best friend --

          MAX
          (exploding off
          the chair)
     I'm tired of this hysteria about
     Howard Beale!

          DIANA
          (erupting herself)
     Every time you see somebody in
     your family, you come back in one
     of these morbid middle-aged moods!

          MAX
          (raging around the room)
     And I'm tired of finding you on the
     goddamned phone every time I turn
     around!  I'm tired of being an
     accessory in your life!

He finds himself by the upstage typewriter, which he
sweeps crashing off the bridge table, sending the
welter of papers there flying off in a storm --

          MAX
     -- and I'm tired of pretending to
     write this dumb book about my
     maverick days in those great early
     years of television!  Every execu-
     tive fired from a network in the
     last twenty years has written this
     dumb book about the great early
     days  But don't
     worry about me.  I'll manage.
     I always have, always will.  I'm
     more concerned about you.  Once
     I go, you'll be back in the eye
     of your own desolate terrors.
     Fifty dollar studs and the
     nightly sleepless contemplation
     of suicide.  You're not the
     boozer type, so I figure a year,
     maybe two before you crack up or
     jump out your fourteenth floor
     office window.

          DIANA
          (stands)
     Stop selling, Max.  I don't need
     you.

She exits out into --


166.  INT. THE LIVING ROOM

-- and across that to the --


167.  INT. THE KITCHEN

-- where a kettle is steaming.  She fetches a cup and
saucer from the cupboard and would make some instant
coffee but she is overtaken by a curious little spasm.
Her hand holding the cup and saucer is shaking so much
she has to put them down.  With visible effort, she
pulls herself together.  She moves out of the kitchen to
the --


168.  INT. THE LIVING ROOM

--  where she stands in the middle of the room and
shouts at MAX through the opened bedroom doorway.

          DIANA
          (cries out)
     I don't want your paint  I don't
     want your menopausal decay and
     death!  I don't need you, Max.

          MAX
     You need me badly!  I'm your
     last contact with human reality!
     I love you, and that painful,
     decaying menopausal love is the
     only thing between you and the
     shrieking nothingness you live
     the rest of the day!

He slams the valise shut.

          DIANA
     Then don't leave me!

          MAX
     It's too late, Diana!  There's
     nothing left in you that I can live
     with!  You're one of Howard's
     humanoids, and, if I stay with you,
     I'll be destroyed!  Like Howard
     Beale was destroyed!  Like Laureen
     Hobbs was destroyed!  Like
     everything you and the institution
     of television touch is destroyed!
     You are television incarnate, Diana,
     indifferent to suffering,
     insensitive to joy.  All of life is
     reduced to the common rubble of
     banality.  War, murder, death are
     all the same to you as bottles of
     beer.  The daily business of life is
     a corrupt comedy.  You even shatter
     the sensations of time and space
     into split-seconds and instant
     replays.  You are madness, Diana,
     virulent madness, and everything you
     touch dies with you.  Well, not me!
     Not while I can still feel pleasure
     and pain and love!

He turns back to his valise and buckles it.  DIANA finds
a chair, sits in it.  A moment later, MAX comes out of
the bedroom, lugging a raincoat as well as the valise.
He lugs his way across the living room, then pauses for
a moment, reflects --

          MAX
     It's a happy ending, Diana.
     Wayward husband comes to his senses,
     returns to his wife with whom he
     has built a long and sustaining love.
     Heartless young woman left alone
     in her arctic desolation.  Music
     up with a swell.  Final commercial.
     And here are a few scenes from
     next week's show.

He disappears down the foyer.  We can hear the CLICK
of the front door being opened and the CLACK of the
door closing.  DIANA sits in her chair, pulling the
shower robe around her, alone in her arctic desolation.


169.  INT. 20TH FLOOR - UBS BUILDING - LOBBY, LOUNGE,
CORRIDOR - 10:15 P.M.

A solemn FRANK HACKETT in blue suit walks down the long,
empty, hushed corridor to the large double doors of his
office (which had originally been EDWARD RUDDY's office).
At the doors, NELSON CHANEY is waiting for him.

          CHANEY
     How'd it go?

HACKETT sighs, enters --


170.  INT. SECRETARY'S OFFICE

--  where HERB THACKERAY and JOE DONNELLY are lounging.
Everybody follows HACKETT into --


171.  INT. HACKETT'S OFFICE (ONCE RUDDY'S OFFICE)

Nighttime outside, the crepuscular grandeur of
Manhattan glittering below us. Waiting in the office,
seated here and there, are WALTER AMUNDSEN and DIANA.
HACKETT sits behind his desk.  The others all find
places around the room.

          HACKETT
     Mr. Jensen was unhappy at the
     idea of taking Howard Beale off
     the air.  Mr. Jensen thinks Howard
     Beale is bringing a very important
     message to the American people, so
     he wants Howard Beale on the
     air.  And he wants him kept on.

Nobody has anything to say to this.

          HACKETT
     Mr. Jensen feels we are being too
     catastrophic in our thinking.  I
     argued that television was a
     volatile industry in which success
     and failure were determined week by
     week.  Mr. Jensen said he did not
     like volatile industries and
     suggested with a certain sinister
     silkiness that volatility in
     business usually reflected bad
     management.  He didn't really care
     if Howard Beale was the number one
     show in television or the fiftieth.
     He didn't really care if the Beale
     Show lost money.  The network should
     be stabilized so that it can carry a
     losing show and still maintain an
     overall profit.  Mr. Jensen has an
     important message he wants conveyed
     to the American people, and Howard
     Beale is conveying it.  He wants
     Howard Beale on the air, and he
     wants him kept on.  I would describe
     his position on this as inflexible.
     Where does that put us, Diana?

          DIANA
          (taking papers out
          of her attache case)
     That puts us in the shithouse,
     that's where that puts us.
          (holds up her
          sheaf of papers)
     Do you want me to go through this?

          HACKETT
     Yes

          DIANA
     I have an advance TVQ report here.
     The Beale show Q score, which was
     forty-seven in the May book, is down
     to thirty-three and falling.  Most
     of this loss occurred in the child
     and teen and eighteen-thirty-four
     categories, which were our core
     markets.  NBC Nightly News, by
     contrast, has gone up to a
     twenty-nine Q, and, at this rate,
     will pass us by the end of July.
     Everybody here knows the Neilsen and
     share-trend scores.  Let me just
     capsulate our own AR demographic
     reports which have been extensive.
     It is the AR department's carefully
     considered judgment -- and mine --
     that if we get rid of Beale, we
     should be able to maintain a very
     respectable share in the high
     twenties, possibly thirty, with a
     comparable Q level.  The other
     segments on the Beale show -- Sybil
     the Soothsayer, Jim Webbing, the Vox
     Populi -- have all developed their
     own audiences.  Our AR reports show
     without exception that it is Howard
     Beale that's the destructive force
     here.  Minimally, we are talking
     about a ten point differential in
     shares.  I think Joe ought to spell
     it out for us.  Joe?

          DONNELLY
     A twenty-eight share is eighty-
     thousand dollar minutes, and I
     think we could sell complete
     positions on the whole.  As a
     matter of fact, we're just getting
     into the pre-Christmas gift-sellers,
     and I'll tell you the agencies are
     coming back to me with four dollar
     CPMs.  If that's any indication,
     we're talking forty, forty-five
     million dollar loss in annual
     revenues.

          THACKERAY
     You guys want to hear all the flak
     I'm getting from the affiliates?

          HACKETT
     We know all about it, Herb.

          AMUNDSEN
     And you would describe Mr. Jensen's
     position on Beale as inflexible?

          HACKETT
     Intractable and adamantine.

          CHANEY
     So what're we going to do about
     this Beale son of a bitch?

A sad silence settles over the top management of UBS-TV
as they lounge about the enormous room.

          HACKETT
          (sighs)
     I suppose we'll have to kill him.

Another long contemplative silence.

          HACKETT
     I don't suppose you have any ideas
     on that, Diana.

          DIANA
     Well, what would you fellows say
     to an assassination? --


172.  INT. THE LOBBY - UBS BUILDING - A FEW DAYS LATER - 6:00 P.M.

Bustling and crowded.  Long lines of PEOPLE, four
abreast, roped off and waiting to get into the HOWARD
BEALE show.  Uniformed USHERS here and there,
occasionally chatting with the waiting CROWD.  OVER
THIS, the VOICES of the network meeting just interrupted
CONTINUE:

          DIANA'S VOICE

     -- I think I can get the Mao Tse
     Tung people to kill Beale for us.
     As one of their programs.  In
     fact, it'll make a hell of a kick-
     off show for the season.  We're
     facing heavy opposition from the
     other networks on Wednesday nights,
     and the Mao Tse Tung Hour could
     use a sensational show for an opener.
     The whole thing would be done right
     on camera in the studio. We ought
     to get a fantastic look-in audience
     with the assassination of Howard
     Beale as our opening show --


173.  INT. THE LOBBY - UBS BUILDING - ELEVATOR AREA

--  as the waiting AUDIENCE is herded into the elevators.
OVER THIS, the VOICES of the meeting CONTINUE:

          AMUNDSEN'S VOICE
     Well, if Beale dies, what would
     be our continuing obligation to
     the Beale corporation? I know our
     contract with Beale contains a buy-
     out clause triggered by his death
     or incapacity --


174.  INT. UBS BUILDING - FOURTH FLOOR

-- as the elevator load of AUDIENCE is led out of the
elevator and down the long, carpeted corridors, past
the large wall photographs of TV stars, glass-enclosed
control rooms, and other showpieces of the network's
electronic glory.  OVER THIS, the VOICES CONTINUE:

          HACKETT'S VOICE
     There must be a formula for the
     computation of the purchase price.

          AMUNDSEN'S VOICE
     Offhand, I think it was based on
     a multiple of 1975 earnings with
     the base period in 1975.  I think
     it was fifty percent of salary plus
     twenty-five percent of the first
     year's profits --


175.  INT. HACKETT'S OFFICE

The meeting is still going on --

          AMUNDSEN
          (continuing above speech)
     -- multiplied by the unexpired
     portion of the contract.  I don't
     think the show has any substantial
     syndication value, would you say,
     Diana?

          DIANA
     Syndication profits are minimal.


176.  INT. THE BEALE SHOW STUDIO AND AUDIENCE AREA

The new load of AUDIENCE finds seats in the rapidly-
filling auditorium.  On the floor of the studio, the
CREW is setting the cameras, checking the booms.  The
stage curtain is down.  OVER THIS, the VOICES of the
meeting CONTINUE:

          CHANEY'S VOICE
     We're talking about a capital crime
     here, so the network can't be
     implicated.

          AMUNDSEN'S VOICE
          (chuckling)
     I hope you don't have any hidden
     tape machines in this office,
     Frank --


177.  INT. THE BEALE SHOW STUDIO - SHOWTIME

The warm-up is over; the stage footlights are on; the
AUDIENCE sits expectantly.  The big wall CLOCK shows:
6:29, clicks to 6:30.  On the studio stage, the
ANNOUNCER strides out from the wings, bellows happily
at the audience

          ANNOUNCER
     Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear
     it -- how do you feel?


178.  REVERSE SHOT of the AUDIENCE.  Suddenly SPOT the GREAT
AHMED KHAN and some of his FOLLOWERS, right in the
middle, happily joining all the others in their communal
response:


          AUDIENCE AND THE KHAN
     We're mad as hell, and we're not
     going to take this any more!

          ANNOUNCER
     Ladies and gentlemen!  The Network
     News Hour! With Sybil the Sooth-
     sayer, Jim Webbing and his It's-
     the-Emmes-Truth Department, Miss
     Mata Hari, tonight another segment
     of Vox Populi, and starring --


MUSIC:  A FLOURISH OF DRUMS

          ANNOUNCER
     -- the mad prophet of the airways,
     Howard Beale!

MUSIC:  A FULL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA SOARS INTO AN IMPERIAL
CRESCENDO --


179.  -- as the HOUSE LIGHTS go to BLACK.  The curtain slowly
rises.  The bare stage, the stained glass window, the
celestial SHAFT of light.  HOWARD BEALE, in his black
suit and tie, strides on from the wings, stands basking
in the SPOTLIGHT.  APPLAUSE UP.


180.  INT. HACKETT'S OFFICE

The meeting is still going on.

          HACKETT
     Well, the issue is:  shall we
     kill Howard Beale or not.  I'd
     like to hear some more opinions
     on that --

          DIANA
     I don't see we have any option,
     Frank.  Let's kill the son of a
     bitch.


181.  INT. THE BEALE STUDIO

The APPLAUSE for HOWARD BEALE has died.  HUSH --
suddenly, the HUSH is shattered by a HORRENDOUS
ENFILADE of GUNFIRE.  An embroidery of red bullet
holes perforate HOWARD'S shirt and jacket, and we
might even see the impact of a head wound as he
pitches backwards dead.


182.  A BANK OF FOUR COLOR TELEVISION MONITORS

It is 7:14 P.M., WEDNESDAY, July 9, 1975, and we
are watching the network news programs on CBS, NBC,
ABC and UBS-TV.  The AUDIO is ON:  head shots of
WALTER CRONKITE, JOHN CHANCELLOR, HOWARD K. SMITH,
HARRY REASONER, and JACK SNOWDEN, substituting for
HOWARD BEALE, interspersed with tapes of the horrible
happening at UBS the day before, flit and flicker
across the four television screens.  Television
continues relentlessly on.

          NARRATOR (OVER)
     This was the story of Howard Beale
     who was the network news anchorman
     on UBS-TV, the first known instance
     of a man being killed because he
     had lousy ratings.


                         FADE OUT.
THE END
