                BEING JOHN MALKOVICH

             A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman



     INT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY

     The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The 
     wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
     a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
     book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
     "Sit." Craig opens the book. It reads: "sit sit sit sit
     sit..." over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
     book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
     He looks at the book again. It is now entitled "Die."  He
     opens it up.  "die die die die die..."  A rooster crows.


                                             CUT TO:


     INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
     crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for 
     work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.


                     LOTTE
              Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin
              Hatch was out of his pen. Good
              morning.


     Lotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead.

                     CRAIG
              Morning.

                     LOTTE
              Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms
              coming in first thing.

                     CRAIG
              Enjoy.

                     LOTTE
              Craig, listen, honey, I've been
              thinking... maybe you'd feel better
              if you got, you know, a job or
              something.

                     CRAIG
              We've been over this. Nobody's
              looking for a puppeteer in today's
              wintry economic climate.

                     LOTTE
              Well, you know, maybe something else
              until this whole puppet thing turns
              around.

                     CRAIG
                   (bitterly)
              The Great Mantini doesn't need a day
              job.

                     LOTTE
                   (sighs)
              Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.
                   (beat)
              Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me
              a favor?

                     CRAIG
              What?

                     LOTTE
              Would you check in on Elijah? He seems
              to be a little under the weather this
              morning.

                     CRAIG
              Which one is Elijah again?

                     LOTTE
              The monkey.

                     CRAIG
              Yeah. Okay.

     INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING

     The place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers.
     A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage.
     The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet 
     version of Craig. The "Craig" puppet paces back and forth, 
     wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,
     above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.
     His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into
     a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the
     puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one
     would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on
     the real Craig’s brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
     puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
     brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
     device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
     collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to
     its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down
     around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches
     off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.

     INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     The room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all
     kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits
     on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the 
     background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding
     his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is
     working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower.
     The assembled crowd is enthralled.


                     TV ANNOUNCER
              The crowd is enthralled as Derek
              Mantini, arguably the greatest
              puppeteer in the history of the 
              world, performs "The Belle of
              Amherst" with his 60 foot Emily
              Dickinson puppet, directed by the
              inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.

     Charles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon.

                     CHARLES NELSON REILLY
              Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.

                     CRAIG
              Gimmicky bastard.

     Craig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a
     female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs 
     his chin in thought, then stands with great determination.

              No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with
              your secretary.

                     LESTER
              She's not my secretary. She's what
              they call an executive liaison, and
              I'm not banging her, if that's what
              you’re implying.

                     CRAIG
              Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply
              misspoke.

                     LESTER
              Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you
              feel you can bring to LesterCorp?

              You think so, eh? Which comes first,
              L or... Glooph?     

                     CRAIG     
              Glooph is not a letter, sir.     

                     LESTER     
              Damn, you are good. I tried to trick
              you. Okay, put these in order.

              she puts up with this damn speech
              impediment of mine.

              You don't have a speech impediment,

              trust Floris on this one. You see,
              she has her doctorate in speech
              impedimentology from Case Western.

              That's why the eastern, read Jewish,
              publishing establishment won't touch

                     DON
              It's an interesting story, Wendy.
              Many years ago in the late 1800's,
              James Mertin, an Irish ship captain
              looking to invest in the future of
              our great country, came to this town
              and decided to erect an office
              building.

              One day. Captain Mertin received an
              unexpected visitor.

     There is a knock at the door.

                     MERTIN
              Enter ye, if ye dare enter.

     A tiny woman enters.

              Captain Mertin?

              What want ye, girl child?

                     TINY WOMAN
              I am not a child, Captain Mertin,
              but rather an adult lady of miniature
              proportions.

              I see. Well, it is not my fault that
              thou art tiny. So if it is charity
              yer after, then be gone with ye,
              ye foul demon.

                     TINY WOMAN
              I am not asking for alms, but rather
              the ear of a kind man with a noble
              heart.

              Aye. Speak then if ye must.

                     TINY WOMAN
              Captain Mertin, surely I am a
              God-fearing Christian woman like
              yourself, but alas, I am afraid that
              the world was not built with me in
              mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs
              are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms
              mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie
              lady, Captain. after all, who would
              marry a person of my diminutiveness?
              So I am forced to work for my few
              pennies a week as an optometrist.
              Why cannot there be a place for me
              to work safe and comfortable?

     Mertin wipes a tear from his eye.

                     MERTIN
              Woman, your story moves me like n
              other. Me own sister was tiny and
              then died. Therefore, I shall make

     Maxine walks away.

     INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S GARAGE - NIGHT

     Craig is at his workbench, painting the finishing touches
     on a new puppet. It is beautiful. It is Maxine. Lotte
     watches quietly from  the door. A Lotte puppet hangs
     from a hook, tangled and dusty.

                     LOTTE
              New puppet?

     Craig is surprised, caught.

                     CRAIG
              Yeah, just an idea I had.

                     LOTTE
              She's very beautiful.

                     CRAIG
                   (shrugging)
              Just an idea I had.

     Craig hangs the puppet, stands, and switches off the light.

                     CRAIG (CONT'D)
              C'mon, let's go to bed.

     INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The room is dark. Lotte snores lightly. Craig lies there
     with his eyes open. Quietly, he gets up and leaves the
     bedroom. Lotte watches him go.

     INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

     Craig stands above the puppet stage. He is working both the
     Craig puppet and the Maxine puppet at the same time. The
     two perform a beautiful and graceful pas de deux. They
     finish in a passionate embrace.

                     CRAIG
                   (quietly)
              I would too know what to do with you.

     INT. FILE ROOM - MORNING

     Craig files. Floris watches him from the doorway. Dr.
     Lester watches Floris from behind a cabinet.

                     FLORIS
              Oh, what magic those fingers could
              work on the right “cabinet.”
                   (strokes Craig's neck)
              Alphabetize me, baby. And don't
              forget, I comes before U.

     Floris laughs long and hard. Too long and too hard.

                     CRAIG
              Floris, you're very nice, but I'm
              afraid I’m in love with somebody
              else.

                     FLORIS
                   (upset)
              I'm afraid I... have no idea what
              you are saying... you bastard!

     Floris runs from the room. Lester pokes his head out from
     behind the cabinet.

                     LESTER
              Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz.
              Why, if I were eighty years younger,
              I'd box your ears.

                     CRAIG
              I wasn't toying with her, sir. I
              was just... How old are you?

                     LESTER
              One hundred and five. Carrot juice.
                   (beat)
              Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost
              not worth it. I piss orange. Oh,
              and I, have to piss sitting down...
              like a godamn girly... every fifteen
              minutes. But nobody wants to die,
              Schwartz.

                     CRAIG
              I'll keep that in mind, sir.

                     LESTER
              No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what
              I do is get older, wrinkled like a
              former plum that's become the
              wrinkled prune you see before you.
              Oh, to be a young man again, maybe
              then Floris would care for me.

                     CRAIG
              The elderly have so much to offer,
              sir. They are our link with history.

                     LESTER
              I don't want to be your godamn link,
              damn you. I want to feel Floris'
              naked thighs against my own. I want
              to know passion. I want my body to
              inspire lust in that beautiful,
              complex woman. I want her to shiver
              in a spasm of ecstasy when I
              penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony
              of the flesh, Schwartz.

                     CRAIG
              Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that
              you share your feelings with me, I
              believe perhaps the workplace is not
              the most suitable environment for
              this type of discussion.

                     LESTER
              All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice
              Juice Bar after work today and I'll
              spill my goddamn guts for you.

     Lester exits.

                     CRAIG
              Shit.

     Craig squats next to a payphone.

                   (into phone)
              I won't be late. I just have to
              listen to Lester's sexual fantasies
              and drink carrot juice for a little
              while. It's a job thing.

     Maxine walks by. Craig grabs her arm, signals for her
     to wait a minute. She waits.

                     CRAIG (CONT'D)
                   (into phone)
              I gotta go back to work. Yeah,
              okay. You too. Okay. Bye.

     Craig hangs up.

                     MAXINE
              What?

                     CRAIG
              I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did
              you know I still don't know your
              name or where you work?

                     MAXINE
              Yeah.

                     CRAIG
              How about this, if I can guess your
              first name within three tries, you
              have to come out for a drink with me
              tonight.

                     MAXINE

              That's incredible! Nobody told me!
              I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! 
              It's a beautiful name. There's a
              psychic connection. Don't you see?
              It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine!
              Maxine! I will shout it from the
              rooftops!

                     MAXINE
              Somebody told you.

                     CRAIG
              Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine,
              Maxine. It just came out of me like
              a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy,

     Lester and Craig sit at a table. There are several emptied

              Imagine a room full of women.
              Nubile, blonde, wet with desire,
              Schwartz. A harem, if you will.
              Me in leather. A harness, if you
              like. I am the object of this
              desire, and all eyes are on me as
              I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am
              the love god, Eros. I intoxicate
              you. My spunk is to you manna from

              Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her,
              Craig.

                     CRAIG
              Yessir.

              Just the two of us?

                   (checking watch)
              That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta
              run.

     Craig hurries to the door. Lester downs Craig's juice,
     signals the waiter for more.

              Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine,
              Maxine.

              Just.

                     CRAIG
              Buy you a drink, Maxine?

              You married?

                     CRAIG
              Yeah. But enough about me.

     Maxine laughs. The bartender approaches.

                     CRAIG (CONT'D)
              What'll you have?

                     MAXINE
                   (to bartender)
              The usual, Barry.

                   (to bartender)
              I'll have, like, a beer. Like a
              Budweiser, or something.

     The bartender walks away.

                     CRAIG (CONT'D)
              I like you. I don't know what it
              is exactly.

              My tits?

                     CRAIG
              No, no, it's your energy or your
              attitude or the way you carry
              yourself or...

                     MAXINE
              Christ, you're not a fag are you?
              Because I don't want to be wasting
              my time.

     The drinks arrive. Maxine's is in an enormous fishbowl of
     a glass. It's bright blue, with fruit and marshmallows
     swimming in it. Paper umbrellas stick out of it, an
     plastic monkeys hang from the rim.

                     CRAIG
              That's the usual?

                     MAXINE
              Don’t let the girly shit fool you.
              It'd blow your shorts off.

     Maxine downs it like a shot of whiskey. She pushes the
     empty glass to the bartender.

                     MAXINE (CONT'D)
              Set me up again, Barry.

     The bartender walks away with the empty glass.

                     CRAIG
              I’m not a homosexual. I just like
              women for more than their bodies.
              I guess you could say I'm the new
              American male.

                     MAXINE
              You're a fag or a liar.

                     CRAIG
                   (backpedaling)
              I mean, I am really attracted to

                   (mocking)
              I mean, I am really attracted to
              you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can
              share recipes, if you like, Darlene.

     Maxine gets up.

                     CRAIG
                   (at a loss)
              No, wait! I like your tits.
                   (beat)
              I love your tits. I want to fuck
              you.

                     MAXINE
                   (sitting)
              Good. Now we're getting somewhere.
                   (beat)
              Not a chance.

     Maxine's second drink comes. She downs it, pushes the
     glass toward the bartender.

                     MAXINE (CONT’D)
              So, tell me about yourself. If you
              can get your mind out of the gutter
              long enough, dog-boy.

                     CRAIG
              Well, I'm a puppeteer...

     The bartender comes back with Maxine's drink.

                     MAXINE
                   (to bartender)
              Check.

                   (nervous, talking too much)
              Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just
              wouldn't let me go. We’re supposed
              to have dinner with him on Friday.
              I can get us out of it if you want.
              He's really amazing, this insane old
              lech. It's actually sort of amusing
              when you get past just how disgusting
              it is.

     There is a silence. Lotte continues to comb out Elijah.
     Finally:

                     LOTTE
              Did you eat?

                     CRAIG
              Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I
              didn't call. It was just, you know,
              hard to get away.

                     LOTTE
              I was worried.

                     CRAIG

              Right.

                     LOTTE
              I dressed the wound. Then I've
              just been feeding everyone, putting
              everyone to bed.

              No thanks. I'm going to turn in.

                     CRAIG
              All right. I'll be in my workshop
              for a little while. I'll be in in

     INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

     Craig works the Craig and Maxine puppets. The puppets
     sit on the edge of the small stage and chat. Craig does a
     pretty fair impersonation of Maxine's voice.

                     CRAIG
                   (as Maxine, fascinated)
              Tell me, Craig, why do you love
              puppeteering?
                   (as Craig)
              Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.
              Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
              someone else for a little while.
              Being inside another skin. Moving
              differently, thinking differently,
              feeling differently.
                   (as Maxine)
              Interesting. Would you like to be
              inside my skin, Craig? Think what I
              think? Feel what I feel?
                   (as Craig)
              More than anything. Maxine.
                   (as Maxine)
              It's good in here, Craig. Better
              than your wildest dreams.

     The puppets kiss.

              Hi.

                     MAXINE
              You're not someone I could get
              interested in. Craig. You play
              with dolls.

                     CRAIG
                   (rehearsed)
              Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea
              of being inside someone else,
              feeling what they feel, seeing
              what they see...

                     MAXINE
              Yikes.

                     CRAIG
              Please, let me explain.

     Craig grabs Maxine's hand and drags her into an empty
     office.

     Craig pulls Maxine in closes the door.

                     CRAIG
              It's just, and I've never done
              this before, Maxine, but it's just
              that I feel something for you. I've
              never felt this before for anyone,
              not even my wife. My future is with
              you, Maxine.

                     MAXINE
              You might want to check those tarot
              cards one more time.

     Maxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts
     his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he
     notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across
     it.

                     CRAIG
              Another evil secret of the 7 1/2
              floor.

     Craig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a
     dark and wet membranous tunnel inside.

                     CRAIG
              Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love
              this.

     Craig lets go of the door and it slams shut.

     Craig rushes in.

                     CRAIG
              Dr. Lester. . .

                     LESTER
              Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted
              to see.
                   (proudly spreading his arms)
              Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your

              never, never use it while bathing in

                     CRAIG
              Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was
              in that vacant office down the hall
              and I stumbled upon a little door
              and....

                     LESTER
              Ah. yes, the little door.
                   (checks watch)
              There is a short film on the little
              door in the orientation room in
              exactly two minutes. If you hurry,
              you'll just make it.

                     CRAIG
              Thank you, sir.

              Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in
              this vacant office.

                     WENDY
              Well, Don, I peeked in here, even
              though I know it's against floor
              policy. and I discovered that
              there's a little tiny door in here.
              Isn't it cute? It's almost like a
              little dolly's door. I wonder what
              it’s for.

                     DON
                   (laughing)
              That's right, Wendy, it is against
              floor policy, but as long as you're
              here, let me tell you what I know
              about our cute little door friend.
              Many years ago, this very office
              was occupied by a kindly old
              watchmaker named Mr. White.

     We're still in POV. The person walks across the room, picks
     up his wallet from a coffee table. looks in a mirror and
     checks his teeth for food. It's John Malkovich.

     around, sees a N.J. Turnpike sign. After a moment, he goes

              Absolutely, doll. I'm just about
              to close up here.

     Craig walks in disheveled and exhausted. Maxine sees him,

                   (looking at his hand on her arm)
              It better be.

     Craig sits Maxine down in a chair, lets go of her arm.

                     CRAIG
              There's a tiny door in that empty
              office. It's a portal, Maxine. It
              takes you inside John Malkovich.
              You see the world through John
              Malkovich's eyes, then, after about
              fifteen minutes, you're spit out into
              a ditch on the side of The New Jersey
              Turnpike.

                     MAXINE
              Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is
              John Malkovich?

                     CRAIG
              He's an actor. One of the great
              American actors of the 20th century.

                     MAXINE
              What's he been in?

                     CRAIG
              Lots of things. He's very well
              respected. That jewel thief movie,
              for example. The point is that this
              is a very odd thing, supernatural,
              for lack of a better word. It raises
              all sorts of philosophical questions
              about the nature of self, about the
              existence of the soul. Am I me? Is
              Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha
              right, is duality an illusion? Do
              you see what a can of worms this
              portal is? I don't think I can go
              on living my life as I have lived
              it. There's only one thing to do.
              Let's get married right away.

                     MAXINE
              Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?

                     CRAIG
              Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

                     MAXINE
              Good. We'll sell tickets.

                     CRAIG
              Tickets to Malkovich?

                     MAXINE
              Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

                     CRAIG
              But there's something profound here,
              Maxine, we can't exploit it.

                     MAXINE
              Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going
              to offer a partnership to you, but
              this way it's more money for me.

                     CRAIG
              You wanted to be partners with me?

                     MAXINE
                   (bored)
              Sure. It'd be fun.

                     CRAIG
                   (pleased)

              Don't be ridiculous. There is no such
              thing as a portal into someone else's
              brain.

              Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte.
              I was right inside him looking out.
              We're going to be rich.

                     LOTTE
              I want to try.

              What?

                     LOTTE
              I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow
              morning. Plus I'd like to meet this
              partner of yours.

              Well, you know we're going to be
              very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you
              what. Let's do it tonight. Right

              Holy cow!

     Malkovich steps out of the shower, slowly towels himself

              I have to go back, Craig. Being
              inside did something to me. All of a
              sudden everything made sense. I knew
              who I was.

                     CRAIG
              You weren't you. You were John

     It's a posh place with flocked wallpaper and candelabras.
     Lester, Craig, and Lotte sit around an elegantly appointed
     table with all different sorts of juices in front of them.
     Lotte is still wet. Lester sits quite close to her.

              Tell me, Lotte, can you understand
              a word I'm saying?

                     LOTTE
              Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.

                     LESTER
              Oh, be still my heart.

                     LOTTE
              Dr. Lester, would you point me
              toward the restroom?

              With immense pleasure, my dear. Down
              that hall, ninth door on the left.
              Watch the step down. It's sunken,
              you know.

     Lotte smiles, and heads down the hall.

                     LESTER
              More beet-spinach juice, my friend?

                     CRAIG
              No thank you sir. It's delicious,
              though. I just wanted to thank you
              for the opportunity to work at
              LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm
              going to have to tender my resignation
              effectively immediately.

                     LESTER
              I see. Are you unhappy at our little
              company?

                     CRAIG
              No sir, not at all. It's just that

              and...

                     LESTER
              And what sort of business will this
              be? If you don't mind my asking.

              Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right

              The vacant office. I see. Olive oil.
              Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz,
              there are certain “doors” which
              should never be opened.

     Lotte enters the room. It is dark. At the far end there
     is what amounts to a candle-lit shrine to John Malkovich.
     The centerpiece of the shrine is an enormous photograph
     of Malkovich bordered by a garland of flowers. Lotte stares
     at it for a moment, then drops to her knees in front of it.

     Disappointedly, she drops the towel and heads out of the

              Thank you very much.

                     GUY
              I just wanted to tell you that. And
              say thank you. I have a cousin that's
              a retard, so, as you can imagine, it
              means a lot to me to see retards
              portrayed on the silver screen so
              compassionately.

     The guy walks away. Malkovich scans the room. Maxine enters
     the restaurant. We see her, but Malkovich doesn't single her
     out of the crowd. She looks around.

                     LOTTE (V.O.)
              Maxine!

     Maxine spots Malkovich. and heads over. He focuses on her.

                     MAXINE
              Hi. I'm so glad you decided to
              come. I'm Maxine.

     Maxine holds out her hand. She is charming. Malkovich takes
     her hand.

                     MALKOVICH
              I'm John. I didn't think I was going
              to come, but I felt oddly compelled.
              I have to admit I was a bit intrigued
              by your voice.

                     LOTTE (V.O.)
              God, she's beautiful. The way she's
              looking at me. At him. At us.

                     MAXINE
              And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich,
              my voice is probably the least
              intriguing thing about me.

                     LOTTE (V.O.)
              I've never been looked at like this
              by a woman.

                     MALKOVICH
              Can I get you a drink?

                     MAXINE
              Whatever you're having.

                    INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT

     Craig drives. Lotte is soaking wet. She stares out the
     window.

                     CRAIG
              So how was it? What was he doing?

                     LOTTE
              Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging
              around his apartment. I think he must
              be a lonely man.

                     CRAIG
              You see, men can feel unfulfilled,
              too. I'm glad you're realizing that.
              You shouldn't be so quick to assume
              that switching bodies would be the
              answer to all your problems.

                     LOTTE
              You're right. You know I was thinking
              that we should have Maxine over for
              dinner. Since you two are partners
              and all. It might be a nice gesture.

                     CRAIG
              I don't know. There's some tension
              between us. I'd hate to expose you to
              that.

                     LOTTE
              It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna.
              We’ll smoke a joint.
                   (dreamily)
              Tensions will melt away.

     INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     Craig, Lotte, and Maxine are seated at the table and eating
     lasagna. Lotte eyes Maxine. Craig eyes Maxine. There is an
     awkward silence.

                     LOTTE
                   (to Maxine)
              Did you know that Eskimos have not
              one, but fifty words for snow. It's
              because they have so much of it.

                     CRAIG
              After dinner I'll show you my puppets.

                     MAXINE
              Ah.

                     LOTTE
              After that I'll introduce you to my
              favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an
              ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood
              trauma. But we're getting to the
              bottom of it.
                   (whispers)
              Psychotherapy.

     There is another silence.

                     MAXINE
                   (to no one in particular) 
              The way I see it, the world is divide
              into those go after what they want
              and those who don't. The passionate
              ones, the ones who go after what they
              want, may not get what they want, but
              they remain vital, in touch with
              themselves, and when they lie on
              their deathbeds, they have few
              regrets. The ones who don't go
              after what they want... well, who
              gives a shit about them anyway?

     Maxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the
     same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and
     start kissing her passionately about the face and neck.
     They stop just as suddenly and look at each other.

                     CRAIG
              You?

     Lotte looks away.

                     MAXINE
              Craig, I just don't find you
              attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten
              with you, but only when you're in
              Malkovich. When I looked into his
              eyes last night, I could feel you
              peering out. Behind the stubble and
              the too-prominent brow and the male
              pattern baldness, I sensed your
              feminine longing peering out, and
              it just slew me.

                     CRAIG
                   (disgusted)
              My God.

     Lotte strokes Maxine's face. Craig clears dishes from the
     table.

                     MAXINE
                   (to Lotte, removing her hand)
              Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry. 
                   (gets up)
              Thanks for a wonderful dinner.
                   (walks past kitchen. to Craig)
              No hard feelings, partner.

     Maxine exits. Craig and Lotte look at each other.

                     LOTTE
              I want a divorce.

     INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - MORNING

     It is deadly silent. Craig and Maxine sit at their desks.
     The wall clock ticks. Craig whistles tunelessly, every
     once in a while looking up and discreetly checking out
     Maxine. Eventually there is a knock at the door.

                     CRAIG
                   (a little too urgently)
              Come in!

     Erroll, a sad, fat young man enters meekly.

                     ERROLL
              Hello, I'm here about the ad.

                     CRAIG
              Please, have a seat.

     Erroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He
     glances nervously over at Maxine.

                     ERROLL
              When you say, I can be somebody
              else, what do you mean exactly?

                     CRAIG
              Exactly that. We can put you inside 
              someone else's body for fifteen minutes.

                     ERROLL
              Oh, this is just the medical
              breakthrough I've been waiting for.
              Are their any side effects? Please
              say no! Please say no!

                     MAXINE
              No.

                     ERROLL
              Long term psychic or physiological
              repercussions?

                     MAXINE
              No. Don't be an ass.

                     ERROLL
              Can I be anyone I want?

                     MAXINE
              You can be John Malkovich.

                     ERROLL
              Well that's perfect. My second
              choice. Ah, this is wonderful.
              Too good to be true! You see, I'm
              a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh,
              I've tried all the diets, my friends.
              Lived for a year on nothing but
              imitation mayonnaise. Did it work?
              You be the judge. But Malkovich!

              Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!

     enormous bear hug.

                     MAXINE
              So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.

     Craig unlocks the door. Lester steps in, closes the door
     behind him, locks it.

                     LESTER
              You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.

              Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're
              talking about.

                     LESTER
              There are rules, boy, procedures,
              etiquette. This is not a toy. I've
              been waiting seventy years to utilize
              this room, grooming myself, quietly
              setting the stage, performing
              ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all
              his motion pictures again and again.
              Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping
              properly.

                     CRAIG
              You're insane.

              I am not alone. There are others. We
              are legion. You will pay for this
              blasphemy. You will pay dearly.

     Lester exits. Craig looks at Maxine. There is a moment
     of tension. Finally:

                     MAXINE
              Crackpot.

     Craig opens the door. The first few fat people move noisily

              I have to see you. Can you call him
              and invite us over?

              When?

              Exactly.

     Maxine checks her alarm clock. The time is 3:11 AM.

     INT. MAXINE'S APARTMENT - A BIT LATER

     The doorbell rings. Maxine, in a sheer black nightgown,
     answers it. John Malkovich stands there.

                     MAXINE
              Thanks so much for coming over.

                     MALKOVICH
              Oh, I'm really glad you called.

     Maxine gestures for him to enter. As Malkovich passes by
     her, she checks the wall clock. The time is 3:50.

     Maxine and Malkovich sit a bit awkwardly next to each other
     on the couch.

              So, do you enjoy being an actor?

                     MALKOVICH
              Oh sure. It's very rewarding...

     The digital clock on the VCR clicks over to 4:11 AM.
     Maxine's look softens, and she kisses Malkovich hard
     on the lips. He seems surprised, but quickly warms to
     it. We shift top Malkovich's POV as Maxine begins to
     unbutton Malkovich's shirt.

                     LOTTE (V.O.)
              Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.

                     MAXINE
              I love you, Lotte.

              I'm sorry, did you just call me
              "Lotte"?

                   (thinking)
              No, I guess not. I'm an actor.

     They get back to it.

              Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.

                   (thinks he's playing along)
              Yes, Maxine, yes.

     looks up at her.

                     CRAIG
              You were him last night, weren't you?

                     LOTTE

              Yes.

                     CRAIG
              And he was with her.

                     LOTTE
              We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.

                     CRAIG
              We?

                     LOTTE
              Me and John.

              Don't forget me.

              Well, you have the Maxine action
              figure to play with.

     Craig looks down at his coffee.

                     LOTTE (CONT'D)
              I'm sorry. That was nasty.

                     CRAIG
              Life is confusing, isn't it?

                     LOTTE
              Sometimes we're forced to make
              hard decisions.
                   (beat)
              I'd like for us to stay together,
              Craig. You know, platonically,
              if that's possible. I truly value
              our friendship.

                     CRAIG
              I feel that somehow my parents never
              prepared me to make this particular
              decision. Not that I blame them. How
              could they know? Today's world is so
              complicated.
                   (beat)
              No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry,

              You're late.

                     CRAIG

              I don't think so. I've fallen in
              love. This is what people who've
              fallen in love look like.

                     MAXINE
              You picked the unrequited variety.
              Very bad for the skin.

                     CRAIG
              You're evil, Maxine.

                     MAXINE

              to have two people look at you with
              total lust and devotion through the
              same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose

     Craig stands still and tense, with gun in hand. We hear

     Craig. He grabs her from behind as she passes. Lotte
     screams. Craig holds the gun to her head.

              I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed

              Shut up!

     Lotte is stunned. She feels the muzzle against her forehead.
     She shuts up. Keeping the gun trained on Lotte, Craig
     dials the phone. He hands the receiver to her. He holds his
     ear to the receiver also.

                     CRAIG (CONT'D)
              Tell her you need to see her.

              membranous tunnel open for paying

              Oooh, doll. I love this new
              devil-may-care side of you. Alrighty,

              see both of you in one hour.
              Exactamundo.

     Maxine hangs up. Lotte hands the phone to Craig, who hangs
     it up. Craig opens up the big cage where Elijah is housed,
     and motions with the gun for Lotte to enter.

                   (screaming)
              Help! He's locking me in a cage!

     Craig slaps Lotte hard. She looks at him, almost sadly.

                     NEIGHBOR
              Shut up!

              feel what Malkovich feels, rather
              than just see what he sees... And
              then, dare I say it, if only I could
              control his arms, his legs, his
              pelvis, and make them do my bidding.

     A panicked Malkovich is pulling on his clothes.

                     MALKOVICH
              Something was making me talk. Some
              Goddamn thing was making me move. I
              gotta get out of here.

                     MAXINE
              Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion
              for me taking hold.

                     MALKOVICH
              No, Dollface, I know what my passion
              taking hold feels like. I gotta go.

     He leaves. Maxine falls back on the couch and sighs
     contentedly.

     A wet, mess Craig sits next to Lotte's cage. Lotte is bound
     and gagged.

                     CRAIG
              I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm
              across your girlfriend's glorious tit.
              I made him talk. And, oh, there was
              the beginning of sensation in the
              fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a
              matter of practice before Malkovich
              becomes nothing more than another
              puppet hanging next to my worktable.

     Malkovich paces nervously, a glass of whisky in his hand.
     Kevin Bacon sits on the couch and fiddles with a Rubic's

                     MALKOVICH
              It's like nothing I've ever felt
              before. I think I'm going crazy.

                     KEVIN BACON
              I'm sure you're not going crazy.

              Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda.
              Were you stoned?

                     MALKOVICH
              Yes, but you see, someone else was
              talking through my mouth.

                     KEVIN BACON
              You were stoned. Case closed. End

              I think it might've been this Lotte
              woman talking through me. Maxine
              likes to call me Lotte.

                     KEVIN BACON
              Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you
              to channel some dead lesbian lover.
              Let me know when you're done with her.
              This is my type of chick.

                     MALKOVICH
              I'm done with her now. Tonight really
              creeped me out.

                     KEVIN BACON
              You're crazy to let go of a chick who
              calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a
              friend.

                     MALKOVICH
              I don't know anything about her. What
              if she's some sort of witch or
              something?

              Ha ha ha.

              I gotta know the truth, Kevin.

     and walks down the block. Malkovich follows at a safe
     distance.

     INT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - MORNING

     The elevator doors are pried open. It's packed. Maxine and
     a few other people climb out. The last to emerge is
     Malkovich. He is astounded by the dimensions of the floor.
     He turns the corner and sees the long line of crouching fat
     people. Maxine goes into the office and closes the door.
     Maxine sees "J.M. Inc." stenciled on the office door. He
     turns to the first fat man and line.

                     MALKOVICH
              Excuse me, what type of service does
              this company provide?

                     FAT MAN
              You get to be John Malkovich for
              fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams.

              I see.

                     FAT MAN

     Malkovich pounds on the door.

                     FAT MAN (CONT'D)
              No cutting!

     Several fat people jump on Malkovich, and start beating
     him. Craig steps out of the office.

              Hey! Break it up! Break it up!
              Everybody gets a chance to be...

     The fat people climb off Malkovich. His glasses and cap
     have been knocked off and everyone recognizes him.

              Schwartz. I can explain. We operate

              simulates, for our clientele, the
              experience of... being you, actually.

                     MALKOVICH
              Simulates?

              Sure, after a fashion.

                     MALKOVICH

              Of course, right this way, Mr.

     also Malkovich, but in a gown. He looks around the
     restaurant. Everyone is Malkovich in different clothes.
     Malkovich is panicked. The girl Malkovich across the

     Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for

     Cars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car.

                     MOTORIST

              Yeah but I didn't do anything about
              it. Out of respect for our marriage.

                     LOTTE
              You didn't do anything about it out
              of respect for the fact that she
              wouldn't let you near her with a ten
              foot pole, which is, by the way,

     out. We see a weathered wooden sign which reads "Africa."
     The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We
     watch from up in a tree (Elijah's POV) as two men in safari
     suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The
     chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie
     them up. The safari men laugh.

              Well, there monkeys ain't going
              nowhere. Let's get us a couple a
              brews 'fore the boss comes back...

     The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend
     from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. One
     of the chimps looks at the camera. He grunts and squeals.

              Quickly! Before the great bald
              chimp-men return.

     A small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and
     struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two
     speaks.

              Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me
              in John the last three times. Craig's
              had me locked up in the apartment. He
              made me call you at gunpoint. It's
              been him! Oh, God, it's been him!

                     MAXINE (O.S.)
                   (beat, calmly)
              Really? Well, you know, he's quite
              good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have
              a session with Malkovich I have to
              attend. I'll speak with you soon.

                     LOTTE
              But Maxine, I thought it was me you
              loved.

                     MAXINE (O.S.)
              I thought so too, doll. I guess we
              were mistaken.

     Maxine hangs up. Lotte, visibly shaken, dials the phone.

              Hello, Dr. Lester?

     INT. MALKOVICH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The doorbell rings. Malkovich answers it. Maxine stands
     there, dressed in an evening gown.

                     MALKOVICH
              Come on in.

                     MAXINE
              I can explain about the portal,
              darling.

                     MALKOVICH
              Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I
              just let you up here to tell you
              that, and to tell you that I'm taking
              you and Schwartz to court.

                     MAXINE
              Oh shut up.
                   (beat)
              Craig, darling are you in there?

     Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward,
     puppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be
     against him will.

                     MALKOVICH
              Yes. How did you know it was me?

                     MAXINE
              Lotte called me.

                     MALKOVICH
              Oh, so the bitch escaped.

                     MAXINE
              Apparently you can control this
              Malkovich fellow now.

                     MALKOVICH
              I'm getting better all the time.

                     MAXINE
              I'll say you are. Let's do it on his
              kitchen table, then make him eat an
              omelette off of it.

                     MALKOVICH
                   (as Malkovich)
              No... damn... you...
                   (as Craig)
              Oh shut up, you overrated sack of
              shit.

     Malkovich begins undressing, and does a lewd bump and grind
     while looking mortified. Maxine giggles. Malkovich (Craig)
     laughs wildly.

     Lester's hand is in a bloody bandage. The juicer sits on hi
     desk. Lotte sits across from him looking nervous and
     hollow-eyed.

                     LESTER
              You know I think it pays to leave
              juice-making to the trained
              professionals. You look terrible,
              my dear.

              Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr.
              Lester.

              Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must
              inform you that I find that highly
              arousing.

              No, you don't understand. I've been

              What?! That is not allowed. My God,
              you are supposed to be one of us.
              You know you must never partake of
              Malkovich by yourself!

                     LOTTE
              No, I didn't know that.

              indoctrination video?

     TITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH

     A much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black
     and white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's.

                     LESTER ON FILM
              Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians.
              As you may already know, today a
              baby was born into this sad world.

     We see a shot of a newborn.

                     LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
              His name is John Horatio Hannibal
              Malkovich. And we are the keepers
              of the door to his soul. One day,
              when his brain is big enough, we
              will all journey into his head and
              live there for all eternity. Following
              the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,
              we will build the ultimate communist
              community, one body and hundreds,
              maybe thousands, of brains inside
              working together to form a super
              human intellect capable of curing
              disease, stopping all war, and
              ruling the world with a benevolent
              fist. We will take a wife, a woman
              of uncommon beauty and intellect, who
              is, as yet, still an infant herself.

     We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in
     her hair.

                     LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
              Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella
              DeMent.

                     LOTTE
              Does Floris know that she's the
              chosen?

                     LESTER
              Well, I tried to explain it to her,
              but...

     Lester points to his ear and shrugs.

     INT. MALKOVICH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Malkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite
     relaxed.

                     MAXINE
              You still there, sweets?

                     MALKOVICH
              Yeah. I've figured out how to hold
              on as long as I want. Oddly enough,
              it's all in the wrists.

                     MAXINE
              Wow.
                   (little girl pout)
              Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.

                     MALKOVICH
              You mean with Malkovich?

                     MAXINE
              I'd love to see your work.

                     MALKOVICH
                   (pleased)
              Really? Yeah. Okay.

     Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.

                     MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
              I'll do something I call "Craig's
              Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."

     Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper
     did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same,
     complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow.
     He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.

                     MAXINE
                   (moved)
              That was incredible. You're brilliant!

                     MALKOVICH
              You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing
              with dolls.

                     MAXINE
              You're right, my darling, it's
              so much more. It's playing with
              people!

     Malkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.

                     MAXINE
              Stay in him forever?

                     MALKOVICH
                   (as Malkovich, screaming)
              No!
                   (as Craig, calmly)
              But how will we make a living,
              my love, if our clientele doesn't
              have access to our product?

                     MAXINE
              Well, we'll have all the money in
              Malkovich's bank account, plus he
              still gets acting work occasionally.

                     MALKOVICH
                   (as Malkovich, breaking through)
              No! Please!
                   (as Craig, to Malkovich)
              Shut up, will you? We're trying to
              think here.
                   (to Maxine)
              It is sort of like being a puppeteer.
              I like that about it.

                     MAXINE
              No one would ever have to know its
              not him.

                     MALKOVICH
                   (an idea)
              Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
              What if we presented Malkovich as the
              world's most complicated puppet and
              me as the only puppeteer sophisticated
              enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor
              with the Great Mantini!

                     MAXINE
              Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!

              Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're
              all prepared, and perhaps this
              Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand
              a bit. We will enter the portal

     INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Maxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal
     with cement. Suddenly Malkovich stops and runs to the
     office door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. He stops
     just as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.

                     MALKOVICH
                   (Craig to Malkovich)
              Shut up!

                   (kissing him)
              It's okay, my sweet.

     They go back to filling the portal. There is the sound
     of many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies
     open and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst
     in. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.

                     LESTER

     her back.

                     LESTER
              No! Don't harm the vessel!

                     LOTTE
              It's Craig in there, I can tell.

              I understand, but we must protect
              the vessel at all costs.
                   (to Malkovich)
              Please, Craig, please step aside
              and allow us to have what is
              rightfully ours.

                     CRAIG
              Squatter's rights, Lester.

     Craig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm
     through Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances
     triumphantly over at Lotte.

                     MAXINE
              Now excuse us, we have an

              They will be dealt with in due time.

     The Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine
     exit.

              Now, let's see what we can do to
              salvage this portal... for the sake
              of all that is good.

     The Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and
     begin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement.
     Fingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and
     skin on the rough gray surface.

     INT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS

     Lester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a
     flash of light.

     INT. BUNKER - DAY

     The scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping.
     There is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester
     views the scene through somebody's POV.

                     LESTER (V.O.)
              My God, where am I? This seems so
              familiar.

     The person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler.

                     LESTER (V.O.)
              My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker!
              Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!

                     DIRECTOR
              Cut!

     We look over to see a director and camera crew.

                     LESTER (V.O.)
              Oh, I'm just the actor in that
              Twilight Zone episode.

     There is a popping sound.

     EXT. DITCH - DAY

     Lester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is
     waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly
     shakes his head "no."

     INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - DAY

     The cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting.
     Lester enters with the cult member who picked him up at
     the ditch. All quiet down and look over at him.

                     LESTER
              Thank you all for your efforts,
              but I'm afraid we can no longer get
              into Malkovich through the portal.

                     LOTTE
                   (panicky)
              Why not? I need to get in there!

                     LESTER
              I'm not certain, my dear, but I
              believe your husband has somehow
              psychically diverted the route.

                     LOTTE
              That bastard! I'll gladly dispose
              of him in the name of the order, Son
              of Malkovich.

                     LESTER
              I'm afraid that no physical harm
              must come to him as long as he
              inhabits the vessel.

                     MAN #3
                   (raises hand)
              Oooh, I got an idea! What if we
              build another portal to Malkovich,
              like around back, and sneak in that
              way?

                     MAN #4
              Only Captain Mertin knew how to build
              a portal, dummy, and he's dead!

                     LESTER
              Actually, my friends, I suppose its
              time I told you, I'm Captain James
              Mertin.

     The members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes
     some refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on
     a board. He then rearranges them for a while.

                     LESTER (CONT'D)
              You see, Lester is an anagram for
              Mertin.

     Lester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little
     tense now.

                     LESTER (CONT'D)
              It used to work, I'm sure of it.

     Several members check their watches.

                     LESTER (CONT'D)
              Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.

     L-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns
     from the board to face the congregation.

                     MAN #3
              How can this be? I thought you were
              only one hundred and five years old.
              Mertin would have to be...

                     LESTER
                   (chuckles amiably)
              I'm two hundred and five, truth be
              told.

                     WOMAN #1
                   (flirtatiously)
              You don't look a day over one
              hundred and five, Captain. What's
              your secret?

                     LESTER
              Lots of carrot juice, little lady.
              That, and a deal with the Devil.

     There is a lot of murmuring in the room now.

                     MAN #2
              So what exactly are you saying? Are
              we in cahoots with the Dark Master
              here?

                     LESTER
              Surprise.

     The cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.

                     LESTER (CONT'D)
              Wait! It's not that bad! When we get
              into Malkovich, we still get to rule
              the world, just like I told you. The 
              only difference is that we rule in the
              name of evil, instead of good.

     People stop in their tracks.

                     MAN #3
              That's the only difference?

                     LESTER
              Absolutely.

     The cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.

                     LESTER (CONT'D)
              So anyway...

     Lotte stands.

                     LOTTE
              Well, I for one, am resigning. I will
              not serve evil. I am ashamed of all
              of you.

     Lotte heads for the door.

                     LESTER
              My dear, let me assure you that when
              we attain power, it will be much more
              pleasant for those inside Malkovich,
              than for those outside.

     Lotte stops and turns.

                     LOTTE
              I'll take my chances.

     She exits.

                     LESTER
              Anybody else?

                     WOMAN #1
              Do we get to wear a crown?

                     LESTER
              But of course.

                     WOMAN #1
              Count me in.

                     LESTER
              Good. I think its time to beckon
              Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us
              out of this pickle.

                                             FLIP TO:

     INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER

     Mr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and
     blazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch
     him.

                     FLEMMER
              Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest,
              I didn't anticipate this.

                     LESTER
              And as I said, sir, we can't very
              well exert physical persuasion upon
              the sacred vessel Malkovich.

                     FLEMMER
              Right, Lester. I heard you the first
              time. I'm not a dummy.

                     LESTER
              Didn't mean to imply that you were,
              sir.

                     FLEMMER
              Look, I'm going back to my house
              to ponder this. So stay calm and
              keep track of Schwartz's comings
              and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose
              of Schwartz's wife, will you?
                   (to cultists)
              Nice to meet you all.

     The cult members ad-lib "same here, sir."

     INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Lotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly
     sobbing. The caged animals watch her.

                     LOTTE
              Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're
              not human. People are treacherous
              and greedy and corrupt. I've lost
              my heart to two of them and I almost
              lost my soul to another. And I'm no
              better. Look at the way I keep you,
              locked in cages, for my own enjoyment.
              Well, I've been in a cage too, my
              friends. Literally and figuratively.
              So tonight I set you free.

     Lotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks
     all the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their
     cages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until
     she is alone.

                     LOTTE (CONT'D)
              Good-bye, friends.

     A hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still
     there and holding her hand. She smiles.

                     LOTTE (CONT'D)
              Hello, friend

     EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

     We see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted
     street, dispersing into the night. A lone dark figure turns
     the corner, and walks slowly up the street to Craig and
     Lotte's building.

     Lotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps.
     The buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.

                     LOTTE
              They've come to kill me, Elijah. See,
              I know too much. I should get the
              door. It's impolite to keep death
              waiting.

     Elijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes.
     Then he leads her by the hand out the window.

     INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

     Malkovich sits in a tuxedo and watches himself in the
     dressing table mirror. Maxine, in a tight black number,
     reclines on the couch.

                     MAXINE
              This is it, lover. You're stepping
              onto that stage a nobody and
              presto-change-o, you're coming
              back the greatest puppeteer the
              world has ever seen.

                     MALKOVICH
              I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting
              me hard today.

     Malkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control.

                     MAXINE
              Doesn't he know how important
              tonight is to us?

                     MALKOVICH
              He's a selfish bastard.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT. LAS VEGAS THEATER - NIGHT

     The house is filling with formally dressed audience members.
     The cultists and Lester, also in tuxes and gowns, are among
     them. The lights go down.

                     ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
              Ladies and gentlemen, it is the
              great privilege of the Luxor hotel
              and Casino to present Craig Schwartz
              and his magical puppet John
              Malkovich.

     The orchestra starts up. The curtains part.

                     LESTER
              Blasphemous bastard.

     Malkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly
     nimble and the audience "oohs" and "aahs."

                     LESTER (CONT'D)
                   (grudgingly)
              Pretty good though.

     Malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one
     knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: "Kiss Today
     Goodbye."  in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up
     with him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man
     with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit
     appears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at
     him.

                     USHER
              Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting
              you tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid
              there's not an empty seat in the
              entire house.

                     MANTINI
                   (not taking his eyes from the stage)
              Make one empty.

                     USHER
              Y-y-y-es sir.

     The usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.
     Martini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now
     performing the "back of the car scene" from "On The
     Waterfront."  He alternates between the Marlon Brando part
     and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one
     stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see
     Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.

                     LESTER
              Not too shabby.

     Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a 
     beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the
     exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some
     concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and
     smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On
     stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and
     juggling chainsaws.

                     MANTINI
              Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.

     At this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich
     a spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the
     cultists get up.

     INT. SEWER - NIGHT

     Lotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel. She is scrunched-up
     against the damp cold. A small fire smolders in front of
     her. We hear footsteps approaching. It is Elijah, carrying
     supplies:  food and blankets. He covers her with a blanket
     and sits down next to her.

                     LOTTE
              They're going to take over the
              world, Elijah. Evil will reign.
              But, then, evil already reigns,
              doesn't it? So what difference
              does it make if John Malkovich
              is wearing the fucking crown while
              it's reigning?

     Elijah sighs, then holds his stomach. The ulcer is
     returning.

     head in his hands, deep in thought. The doorbell rings.

                     FLEMMER
              It's open.

     The door opens and Lester pokes his head in.

                     LESTER
              It's just me, boss. I brought
              croissants.

     Lester enters with a greasy white paper bag.

                     FLEMMER
              Have a seat. I wracking my brain
              over this Malkovich thing.

                     LESTER
              We saw his show at the Luxor last
              night.

                     FLEMMER
                   (impressed)
              Vegas? What'd you think?

                     LESTER
              The kid's got talent. You've never
              seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz
              had him up there singing and dancing.
              Impressions.

                     FLEMMER
              Impressions? Those are hard.

                     LESTER
              Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad
              we can't kill him.

                     FLEMMER
              I suppose I could come to him in a
              dream. I don't know. That's the best
              I can think of right now.

                     LESTER
              A scary dream?

                     FLEMMER
              No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary
              dream.

                     LESTER
                   (noncommittally)

                     MAXINE
              Oh, darling. It's a dream come true.
              We're going to ride this straight to
              the top.

                     MALKOVICH
              Sleepy suddenly.

                     MAXINE
              Busy day, my little fire chief. Why
              don't you climb into bed, and I'll
              meet you there in just...

     But Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of
     his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts 
     blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face.

     INT. HELL - NIGHT

     Craig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of
     flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened.
     He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away
     from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking
     the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister
     grin.

                     CRAIG
              Who are you?

                     FLEMMER
              I am the Devil.

                     CRAIG
              Oh.

                     FLEMMER
              Leave Malkovich. He is mine.

                     CRAIG
              Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

     Malkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him.

                     MAXINE
              Bad dream, darling?

                     MALKOVICH
              I've got to leave Malkovich.

                     MAXINE
              You've got to be kidding.

                     MALKOVICH
              I just had the most horrifying
              nightmare. The devil was in it.

     Flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased
     with himself.

                     MAXINE
              Malkovich is our meal ticket. You
              can't back out because of some
              stupid dream.

                     FLEMMER
                   (to himself)
              Shit.

                     MALKOVICH
              Honey, we can be happy and poor
              together.

                     MAXINE
                   (laughs derisively)
              Perhaps you'll want to consult that
              Ouija board again.

     There is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry.

                     MAXINE (CONT'D)
              Yeah what?!

                     MALKOVICH
              Derek Mantini!

     Mantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and
     Maxine give each other the once over.

                     MANTINI
                   (still eyeing Maxine)
              Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.

                     MALKOVICH
              Did you see the reviews?

                     MANTINI
              Yeah, I saw them

                     MALKOVICH
              Because if you missed any, I just
              happen to have copies here you can
              take with you when you leave now.

                     MAXINE
              I'm Maxine. I produced the evening
              with Malkovich.

                     MANTINI
              Very impressive. I could use a
              producer with your vision. And
              other outstanding attributes.

                     MALKOVICH
              She's not available.

                     MANTINI
              We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

                     MAXINE
              Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

                     MANTINI
              I won't waste your time Schwartz, or
              more importantly, mine. Here's my
              proposal: There's only room in this
              world for one "World's Greatest
              Puppeteer."  Correct? So let's allow
              the puppet-going public to crown
              their king.

                     MALKOVICH
              How do we do that?

                     MANTINI
              A friendly competition, if you will.
              Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.
              Truman puppet appear opposite each
              other in a play. Not some Vegas
              Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play
              that requires actual acting. The
              audience decides who is more deserving
              of the title. The losing puppeteer
              bows out graciously. Goes back to
              obscurity as a file clerk.

                     MALKOVICH
              What's the play?

                     MANTINI
              Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.

                     MALKOVICH
              Never heard of it.

                     MANTINI
              Broadway's finest three hours. It's
              about the suppression of the
              individual. Conformity as God in
              modern society.

                     MALKOVICH
              Sounds boring. Are there any songs?

                     MANTINI
              Nothing but acting to hide behind,
              buddy-boy.

                     MALKOVICH
              I'm not afraid. I toured for a year
              with the National Puppet Company's
              production of "Long Day's Journey
              Into Night."

                     MANTINI
              Great then.

                     MALKOVICH
              Is there dancing?

                     MANTINI
              No.

                     MALKOVICH
              Who needs dancing?

     INT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Lester is watering Flemmer's plants. A key is heard in the
     door. Flemmer enters, a small carry-on bag slung over his
     shoulder.

                     LESTER
              How'd it go? Did you say the
              philodendron gets water or no?

                     FLEMMER
              No, for God's sake, I just watered
              it yesterday.
                   (beat)
              It almost went well. I gave a pretty
              good dream, but circumstances arose.

                     LESTER
              What kind of circumstances?

                     FLEMMER
              Maxine says she'll leave him if he
              leaves Malkovich, plus he's been
              challenged to a puppet-duel by
              Mantini.

                     LESTER
              The Great Mantini?

                     FLEMMER
              No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course
              the Great Mantini!

                     LESTER
              Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I
              saw him do "Tru" with his sixty
              foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.

                     FLEMMER
              But I think I have another plan.

                     LESTER
                   (snippy)
              Do tell. I love a good plan.

                     FLEMMER
              Why are you being like this?

     Lester shrugs.

                     LESTER
              I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me
              the plan.

                     FLEMMER
              Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will
              leave Malkovich, right? So, if he
              needs it, I help Mantini's performance
              a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the
              show.

                     LESTER
              Can you do that? I mean, do you know
              anything about puppetry?

                     FLEMMER
              I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can
              handle it.

                     LESTER
              I was just asking. No disrespect
              intended.

                     FLEMMER
              Fine. Let's drop it.

                     LESTER
              Fine. I mean, it's not like I was
              doubting you, it's just that I know
              puppetry is a skill that takes a long
              time to acquire.

                     FLEMMER
              Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.

                     LESTER
              Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen
              table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a
              letter from Alex Trebek.

              Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging.
              I'm tired of this conversation. I'm
              tired period. What has the world ever

              It is better to light one candle than

              for me. He raises his matted head. He
              opens his great, square teeth and says

     Malkovich is in convulsions on the floor. Big dramatic
     convulsions. Truman scoops him up, and places him on the
     bench. Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking
     it. Truman speaks.

                     HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
              Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ...
              Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back!
              Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ...
              Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ...
              In. Out .. In ... Out ...

     Malkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the
     focus on himself. Flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the
     crowd. The audience is watching Malkovich.

                     AUDIENCE MEMBER
                   (to his wife)
              That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine
              actor.

                     FLEMMER
                   (blood boiling)
              Bastard is stealing my thunder.

     Malkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing,
     swirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he
     talks.

                     HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
              All right! I'll take it away! He'll be
              delivered from madness. What then?
              He'll feel himself acceptable! What
              then?

     Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman
     out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on
     the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all
     fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog.
     Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when
     he talks, fire comes out of his mouth.

                     HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
              I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll
              erase the welts cut into his body by
              flying manes.

     The audience "ooohs" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his
     clothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from "Swan
     Lake." The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech,
     now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and
     flying around the auditorium as he speaks.

                     HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
              You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses
              will be quite safe. You'll save your
              pennies every week, till you can
              change that scooter into a car...

     The audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned,
     in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes
     into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings "Mr.
     Bojangles", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant
     swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns
     to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S.
     Truman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just
     raised from the dead.

                     ACTUAL TRUMAN
              Where am I? Aren't I dead?
                   (possessed)
              Vote for Mantini!

     Truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant
     puppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a
     standing ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the
     catwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage.

     INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

     Malkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him.
     Thunderous applause is heard in the background.

                     MALKOVICH
              Good-bye, Maxine.

                     MAXINE
              Whatever.

     Malkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head.

                     MALKOVICH
                   (weak but relieved)
              I'm back! My nightmare is over.

     INT. CATWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Flemmer watches Malkovich from above. He pulls out a
     walkie-talkie.

                     FLEMMER
                   (into walkie-talkie)
              Okay, now!

     INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Lester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds
     the walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and
     the Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal,
     while shrieking a war cry.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

     Maxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground.
     Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then
     by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with
     each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting
     out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich
     is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war
     cry and runs out onto the stage.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

     The Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks.
     Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the
     audience.

                     MALKOVICH
                   (now sounding like fifty voices)
              I am your earthly king! Kneel before
              me!

     The audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to
     their knees.

                     CROWD
                   (like automatons)
              Hail Malkovich, king of the damned.

     Malkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in
     the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back.

     Lotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath
     figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the
     theater.

     INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

     Maxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for
     the exit.

     EXT. NEW JERSEY TUNPIKE - NIGHT

     A dejected Craig walks along the shoulder. He is wet and
     cold. We hold on him for a long while until he eventually
     merges with the landscape.

     FADE OUT

     FADE IN

     EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

     CHYRON:  LATER THAT WEEK

     Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but
     everything is painted gray:  the buildings, the streets,
     the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets,
     carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody
     talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky.
     There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie
     theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich
     movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating
     about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red,
     jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe
     and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his
     lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the
     street looks up.

                     MALKOVICH
                   (fifty voices)
              Greetings, my lowly subjects.

                     FLORIS
              Great things, my lonely subtext?

                     MALKOVICH
                   (rolls his eyes)
              Boy, be careful what you wish for.
                   (to Floris)
              Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,
              will you?

     Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.

                     MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
                   (to the people on the street)
              I am bored. You will dance for your
              king now.

     Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks
     into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally
     silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see
     that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is
     void of expression. Malkovich laughs.

                     MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
              Faster! Faster, my little trained
              monkeys!

     The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over,
     exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to
     help, nobody dares.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

     Bird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every
     tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves
     in, through some gray trees and gray brush to:

     A LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT

     This place is filled with life:  Colorful birds, lizards,
     cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but
     totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their
     position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the
     animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands
     and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear
     gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.

                     ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
              Must you take this terrible demon
              on yourself, my love?

                     LOTTE
              Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter
              Malkovich and destroy him from the
              inside. If not me, who?

                     ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
              If there was any way I could go in
              your place. But I'm only a monkey
              and...

                     LOTTE
                   (puts finger to his lips)
              Hush, sweetheart.

     Lotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb
     on her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then
     embrace.

                     LOTTE
                   (to the animals)
              I'll be with you always, my friends.
              Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll
              rejoin you with wings and a beak.

                     ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
              Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings
              and a halo.

     Lotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends
     into a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.

                     PARROT
                   (softly)
              Good-bye. Good-bye.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. MERTIN-FLEMMER BUILDING - DAY

     A man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast
     is clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of
     the others, and enters the building.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

     Lotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses
     the emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt.
     She picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the
     door. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes
     and wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.

                                             CUT TO:

     INT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUS

     Lotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It
     is nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She
     turns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.

                     LOTTE
              My God!

                     CRAIG
              I'm so glad you're safe. You look
              really wonderful.

                     LOTTE
              I'm in love. For the first time.
              It's funny, but when it happens to
              you, there's no question.

                     CRAIG
              He's a lucky man.
                   (beat)
              Do I know him?

                     LOTTE
              It's Elijah.

                     CRAIG
              The iguana?

                     LOTTE
              The monkey.

                     CRAIG
              Oh, right. As long as you're happy.
              I'm sure he's a better lover than I
              ever was.

                     LOTTE
              A better friend.

                     CRAIG
                   (beat)
              I'm sorry for everything.

                     LOTTE
                   (pecking him on the cheek)
              It's okay, Craig. It all worked out,
              in an odd sort of way.

                     CRAIG
              You came up here looking for the
              portal?

                     LOTTE
              Yeah. I was going to kill him from
              the inside.

                     CRAIG
              And yourself too in the process. God,
              you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I
              see that before?

                     LOTTE
              You saw it once. Now you see it again.
              That's life, isn't it? And you were
              up here to try the same thing, weren't
              you?

                     CRAIG
              I suppose. But they got here first,
              the lousy bastards. So now it's all
              over, I guess.

                     LOTTE
              I don't know. There's a small
              community of us. We have a place they
              don't know about. We're happy. We'll
              keep trying to figure out a way. Come
              stay with us. Join the struggle.

                     CRAIG
              You'll have me, after all I've done
              to you?

                     LOTTE
              People make mistakes.

                     CRAIG
              I'm through with puppets, Lotte.
              I just want you to know that.

                     LOTTE
              I know.

                     CRAIG
              I'd like to be a farmer. I want to
              help things grow, to encourage life.
              Do you and your friends need a farmer?

                     LOTTE
              Sure. We could really use a farmer.
              We'd be grateful for the help.
                   (beat)
              Also, I think, you know, if you
              wouldn't mind too terribly, a little
              puppet show every once in a while,
              would do a lot to lift our spirits.
              You know, if you wouldn't mind too
              terribly.

     Craig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.

                     LOTTE (CONT'D)
              Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.

     She puts her arm around him and leads him toward the
     elevator.

                     CRAIG
              I love you, Lotte.

     We come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put
     it around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.
     We follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a
     marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless
     Mantini in a gray jumpsuit.

                     MANTINI
                   (in Craig's voice)
              I can't wait to see where you and your
              friends live, Lotte.

                     LOTTE (O.S.)
              It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.

     Now we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w
     follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.

                     FLEMMER
              One serpent, coming up.

     Flemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves
     into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,
     looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal
     tunnel.
