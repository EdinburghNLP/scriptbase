Living in Oblivion (1995) movie scriptby Tom DiCillo.Shooting draft, 1995.
More info about this movie on IMDb.com


A battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod 
surrounded by blackness. Opening credits begin. An almost 
imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly 
forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME 
CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, 
glass full moon. Fade to BLACK.

Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping 
the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White.

EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT

A quiet, deserted industrial street. It is over an hour before 
dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness 
of night.

In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT 
and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out 
breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete 
silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie-
talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters 
and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a 
mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered 
donuts.

          BERT
     What time is it?

          CYBIL
     Four. Why?

          BERT
     This milk is bad.

          CYBIL
          (sniffs)
     When did you buy it?

          BERT
     Tuesday? I don't know. What's today?

          CYBIL
     Monday.
          (pause)
     There's a deli on Broadway.

          BERT
     Nothing closer?

          CYBIL
     Nothing that's open.

          BERT
          (sniffs the milk)
     Is it that bad?

          CYBIL
     I don't know. You're the one who 
     said it was bad.

At that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and 
shudders to a stop in front of the building. Bert replaces 
the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice.

EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT. B/W

Amid low, one-word greetings, the CREW tumbles out of the 
trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the Craft Service 
table. WOLF -- the Cameraman, assumes a place of prominence. 
He wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black 
leather half-fingered gloves.

          WOLF
     This is the worst fucking coffee 
     I've had in my life.

          CYBIL
     Then don't drink it.

          GAFFER
     What're we doing today?

          WOLF
          (pulls out a wrinkled 
          callsheet)
     "Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks 
     to Mom."

          AC
     Any nudity?

          CYBIL
     Yeah, you have to take your fucking 
     pants off.

          AC
     I'll do it. I like Ellen.

          GAFFER
     Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse 
     in that Richard Gere movie.

          BERT
     I worked on that.

          AC
     The shower scene.

          WOLF
     Start with the 5K in the window. Run 
     feeders for three blonds into the 
     living room.

          GAFFER
     Two people. Sitting? Standing?

          WOLF
     Who fuckin' knows?

          GAFFER
          (walks off)
     "Ellen talks to Mom."

INT. CAR. NIGHT. B/W

NICOLE sits quietly in the back seat of a beat-up station 
wagon. She glances out at the empty city moving past her 
window and lets out a deep sigh.

JEFF, the young intern assigned as her driver, glances into 
the rearview mirror.

          JEFF
     Tired?

          NICOLE
     No, I've been up since four. I've 
     got a big scene today and I'm kind 
     of nervous.

          JEFF
     "Ellen talks to Mom."

          NICOLE
     Have you read the script?

          JEFF
     No. It's on the callsheet.

          NICOLE
     Oh. Well, it's pretty emotional. I 
     tell my mother I never felt she really 
     loved me.

          JEFF
     You're going to yell at each other?

          NICOLE
     I don't know. I'm just going to go 
     with how I feel. Which is the scary 
     part. I'm very close to this 
     character.

          JEFF
     Problems with your own mom?

          NICOLE
     Yes. But she died before I, well 
     before we could reconcile...

          JEFF
     You were great in that Richard Gere 
     movie.

          NICOLE
     Thanks.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL. NIGHT. B/W

CU sidewalk. A pair of women's orthopedic shoes enter the 
frame and begin pacing.

Camera pans up to reveal CORA, a small woman in her early 
60s, pacing beneath the awning of her residential hotel. She 
appears to be rehearsing dialogue with herself.

          CORA
     Ellen, I have no memory of this 
     whatsoever. Ellen... Ellen I have NO 
     memory of this whatsoever.

Jeff pulls the car up to the curb and Cora gets into the 
back seat.

INT. CAR. NIGHT. B/W

          NICOLE
     Good morning, "Mom."

          CORA
          (gruff)
     Morning.

          NICOLE
     Sleep well?

          CORA
     Not a wink.

Cora immediately lights a cigarette. Nicole instinctively 
wrinkles her nose and turns away. Cora notices this and makes 
an exaggerated effort to keep the smoke away from Nicole by 
blowing it hard out the side of her mouth. Jeff glances back 
at the two women in the rearview mirror. No one speaks.

INT. SET. DAWN. B/W

NICK -- the Director, WOLF -- the Cameraman and WANDA -- the 
AD, stand in a loose triangle on the darkened set. All are 
holding coffee cups. The Gaffer can be seen in the background 
fumbling with a light.

          NICK
     Look, I'm not blaming anybody, Wanda. 
     I'm just saying we left last night 
     and I knew we didn't get that scene.

          WANDA
     I'm sorry, I thought it was a great 
     scene, Nick.

          NICK
     It was OK; and it's going to be 
     alright. But I'm not settling for OK 
     today. This is a big scene and I'm 
     not leaving till we get it.

          WANDA
     Whatever it takes, Nick. We're here 
     for you.

          NICK
     Alright, here's what I'm thinking. 
     Wolf, I want to do the whole scene 
     in one shot.

          WOLF
     It's been done.

          NICK
     I know that but I'd like to try it 
     anyway.

          WOLF
     Handheld.

          NICK
     No, dolly. We go from Close-up to 
     Wide-shot and back to Close-up in 
     the same shot.

          WOLF
     I'll use the 35, minimize distortion; 
     I'll light it all from the ceiling. 
     It could be kind of great.

          WANDA
     Sounds incredible. How long, Wolf?

          WOLF
     I'll need to see a couple run-
     throughs.

          NICK
     Not too many. It's a tough scene for 
     the actors. I want them to feel 
     relaxed, fresh...

          WANDA
     We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it 
     takes. What do you think, Wolf -- an 
     hour, 45?

          WOLF
     I don't know how you drink that shit 
     black, Nick. I got to dump in the 
     milk. It's the only way I can cut 
     the taste.

Suddenly the Gaffer turns on the 5K, flooding the room with 
harsh, blinding light.

          NICK
     Jesus!

          WOLF
     What the fuck?!

          WANDA
     Flame on, asshole!!

The screen goes completely WHITE.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

Screen is still white. Gradually it shifts back to proper 
exposure revealing NICOLE in Medium CU. Her eyes are riveting; 
it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene. A 
light meter is thrust in front of her face. She barely 
registers it.

WS, the entire Living Room set. Nicole sits on a sofa facing 
Cora seated opposite in an overstuffed chair. Two flats have 
been joined at right angles to create the Living Room corner. 
A table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the 
rather scrawny looking set.

Most of the movie crew is seen, including Wolf looking through 
the camera.

          WANDA
     OK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the 
     work. Lock it up. Going for picture.

Nick approaches Nicole and Cora.

          NICK
     OK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing 
     fine. Remember, really listen and 
     really answer.
          (smiles at Nicole)
     I've got nothing to say to you. Just 
     let it happen. It's all there.

          WANDA
     Ready, Nick?

          WOLF
     Look at this a second, Nick.

Nick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece. 
Another CU of Nicole fills the frame. The image is visually 
and emotionally breathtaking.

          WOLF
     I pushed in a foot. She's incredible. 
     It's coming right through the lens.

Nick grips Wolf's shoulder in gratitude.

          NICK
     That's great, man. Beautiful.

          WANDA
     Ready, Nick?

          NICK
     Let's go. Right away.

          WANDA
     And, roll sound.

          SOUND

          NICK
     Action.

INT. APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 1. COLOR

From the moment Nick calls "action" the film will cut directly 
to the shot the set camera is filming. The shot is fluid, 
graceful and in richly, beautiful COLOR. Nicole's performance 
is very strong; flawed only slightly by her nervousness.

          NICOLE
     Dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
     It didn't hurt that much but I started 
     crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
     me alone. He went over and started 
     hitting Danny.

          CORA
     Ellen, I have no memory of this 
     whatsoever.

          NICOLE
     You were just standing there looking 
     at me. Then you pulled me up and 
     said, "You're not hurt." Like I was 
     disgusting for faking, for doing the 
     only thing I could think of to keep 
     him from hitting me again.

          CORA
     I was worried about Danny.

          NICOLE
     You do remember.

          CORA
     He was smaller than you.

Nicole turns to Cora with the heartbreaking gaze of an 
abandoned child. Nick and the rest of the crew watch in awe.

          NICOLE
     You were so worried about Danny --

Suddenly the BOOM dips all the way into the shot.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

          WOLF
     Cut! Boom in. Sorry, I had to cut. 
     Les, your boom was all the way in 
     the shot.

          BOOM
     Well, where's the frame line?

All the crew move around, all talking at once.

          WANDA
     OK, can we get a frame line? Hold it 
     down. We're going again right away. 
     Nobody moves. Les, you got the frame 
     line?

          BOOM
     I guess so.

          WANDA
     OK, here we go. Right away. Picture's 
     up.

Nick approaches Nicole and Cora.

          NICK
     Beautiful; both of you. Stay focused. 
     Stay with it. No big deal. Let's go, 
     Wanda. Right away.

          WANDA
     Roll sound!

INT. APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 2. COLOR

          NICOLE
     Dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
     It didn't hurt that much but I started 
     crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
     me alone. He went over and started 
     hitting Danny.

          CORA
     Ellen, I --

The image suddenly goes out of focus.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

          AC
     I'm sorry, I have to cut. I was 
     completely off on the focus. It's my 
     fault, I'm sorry.

          WANDA
     Thanks for the apology but you'll 
     never work in this town again.
          (laughter)

          AC
     I've got it now.

          WANDA

          NICK
     And, action.

INT. APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 3. COLOR

The scene begins once again. Remarkably, Nicole's enormous 
commitment is just as full and sharp. Nick is in ecstasy.

          NICOLE
     Dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
     It didn't hurt that much but I started 
     crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
     me alone. He went over and started 
     hitting Danny.

          CORA
     Ellen, I have no memory of this 
     whatsoever.

Suddenly a car stops right outside, a heavy, bass-driven rap 
song blasting out of its trunk-mounted speakers.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

          SOUND
     Street noise!

          WANDA
     That's a cut!
          (into her walkie)
     What the fuck's going on down there!? 
     You call that a lock-up!? Get that 
     car out of there!

          NICK
     Jesus Christ. Why doesn't the guy 
     just get a flatbed trailer with about 
     600 speakers on it and tow it behind 
     his car.

Everyone nods in annoyed agreement; everyone except the Boom 
man who appears to be following the music with the mike, 
bopping to it through the headphones. Slowly, interminably, 
the music fades off into the distance.

          SOUND
     And... it's clear.

          WANDA
          (into her walkie)
     Do I have a lock-up?

          WALKIE (V.O.)
     kkkkkssst... sttttss yes.

          WANDA
     Is that a real lock-up?

     You were just standing there looking 
     at me. Then you pulled --

Suddenly the BOOM drops into frame again.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

          WOLF
     Boom's in.

          NICK
     Jesus Christ.

          BOOM
     Where?

          WOLF
     The whole left side of frame, Les.

          WANDA
     Alright, can we please get a 
     motherfucking frame line please?!

          BOOM
     The frame keeps changing.

          WOLF
     That's the idea, Les.

          SOUND
     May I make a suggestion? Is it 
     possible to maybe break the shot 
     down? Maybe two shots instead? Might 
     make it easier for Les.

          NICK
     No.

          SOUND
     Then I need ten minutes to switch to 
     radio mikes.

          WANDA
     Your call, Nick.

          NICK
     There won't be any other sound 
     problems?

          SOUND
     No more boom problems.

          NICK
     Switch to radios.

          WANDA
     That's a ten-minute break. Release 
     the lock-up. Stand by.

          WOLF
          (to the AC)
     Get me a coffee. Half milk.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

Nick looks for Nicole but sees only Cora standing by the 
couch. Les has both arms up the back of her dress, running 
the wire to her radio mike. She's wearing stockings rolled 
down to just above her knees.

Nick turns and spots Nicole by herself in a dark corner of 
the set and walks over to her.

INT. SET APT. A CORNER. DAY. B/W

          NICK
     I'm sorry about all this, Nicole.

          NICOLE
     It's not your fault, Nick. Is there 
     a way to use some of the earlier 
     takes?

          NICK
     Not unless I change the shot; do a 
     cutaway of Cora or something and 
     intercut the takes. I don't want to 
     do that. It's a really nice shot and 
     what you're doing is incredible.

          NICOLE
     Thanks, Nick.

          NICK
     The radio mikes are going to make 
     everything easier. So, look. Take a 
     moment. Let all this shit go. We 
     don't roll till you're ready.

          NICOLE
     OK.

Nick moves back to the set, leaving Nicole in the shadows. 
Camera stays on her as she begins emotionally preparing 
herself once again.

          SCRIPT (V.O.)
     How was she in that Richard Gere 
     movie?

          CYBIL (V.O.)
     So-so.

Camera slips halfway through an open bedroom door, holding 
Nicole on one side of the frame while revealing PAM the Script 
Supervisor and CYBIL sitting on the floor smoking. Though 
separated by the wall, Nicole hears everything the two women 
say.

          SCRIPT
     Her career really took off, didn't 
     it?

          CYBIL
     I saw her in a Michael Bolton video.

          SCRIPT
     She is nice; but I could do a better 
     job.

Camera slips into a CU of Nicole. She closes her eyes as the 
two women continue talking about her. Screen goes BLACK.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

A BLACK scrim, held by the Gaffer, passes in front of the 
camera, revealing the set with Nicole and Cora settling in 
for a take.

          WANDA
     Where's that flag going?

          GAFFER
     It's a scrim.

          WANDA
     Wolf!

          WOLF
     Two seconds, Wanda.

          WANDA
     No. No more tweaking. Picture's up.
          (into her walkie)
     Lock it up!

Wolf quickly motions Gaffer to hand-hold the scrim in front 
of the 5K.

          WANDA
     And, roll sound.

INT. SET APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 5. COLOR

Once again the scene begins. Nicole shows the first signs of 
losing her concentration.

          NICOLE
     Dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
     It didn't hurt that much but I started 
     crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
     me alone. He went over and started

          CORA
     Ellen, I have no memory --

Suddenly there is a tremendous EXPLOSION sending bits of 
glass flying through the frame. Cora jumps, clutching her 
chest.

          CORA
     Oh, God!

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

CU the light the Gaffer had been holding the scrim before. 
It is smoking and shattered.

          NICK
     Jesus fucking Christ!

          WOLF
          (to the Gaffer)
     Kill it. Kill it. Pull the plug. 
     Right there by your foot.

          WANDA
     That's a cut. Anybody hurt? Cora, 
     are you alright?

Cora nods wordlessly, gasping for breath.

          WANDA
     Props. Props! Let's get a broom up 
     here right away. Clear the set!

INT. APT. HALLWAY. DAY. B/W

Nick, Cora, and Nicole stand in a corner of the landing. 
Nick is making obvious attempts to lighten the mood.

          NICK
     Well, let's see. What do you think 
     is going to happen next, Cora?

          CORA
     I'm going to have a heart attack!

          NICK
     No, you're not. You're going in there 
     in two minutes and we are really 
     going to nail this scene. I know it. 
     I have no doubt about it. Nicole...

Nick turns to Nicole and stops in midsentence. He looks at 
her for a long moment. Nicole returns his gaze then suddenly 
looks away.

          WANDA (V.O.)
     Nick! Nick!

          NICK
     One second!

Nick hesitates a moment then rushes back to the set.

          CORA
     I'll tell you this much right now; I 
     am never, ever doing another fucking 
     low-budget movie.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

Nick joins Wanda and Wolf on the set couch and chair.

          NICK
     What's up?

          WANDA
     Wolf and I were talking... Ellen's 
     losing it a little bit. You got three 
     quarters of the scene really, really 
     incredible in the first take. Do a 
     quick cut-away and all you need is a 
     pickup of the last part of the scene.

          NICK
     Wolf?

          WOLF
     You know how I feel; I love this 
     shot. Hell, I designed it.

          NICK
     Then let's just stick with the game 
     plan, OK? It's a simple shot. We're 
     going to get it this time, I feel 
     it.

          WANDA
     We're here for you, Nick. Whatever 
     it takes.

Nick moves off. Wanda stares at Wolf who studiously inspects 
his light meter.

          WANDA
     Thanks.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

INT. SET APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 6. COLOR

As the scene begins again, it is obvious that both actresses 
are completely distracted. Nick's face betrays a rapidly 
increasing anxiety.

          NICOLE
     Dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
     It didn't hurt that much but I started 
     crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
     me alone. He went over and started 
     hitting Danny.

          CORA
     I...

There is a long awkward pause as Cora realizes she can't 
remember her line.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

          NICK
     Cut. That's OK, Cora. What's the 
     line? Just say it to me; no acting.

          CORA
     I...
          (pause)

          AC
     "Ellen, I have no memory of this 
     line whatsoever."

Amid general tittering from the crew, Wanda yells out.

     OK, could we get the line please?! 
     Script!

          SCRIPT

saying the lines.

          NICOLE
     Dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
     It didn't hurt that much but I started 
     crying anyway --

          CORA
     I was worried about Danny!

Nicole stops cold, completely thrown by Cora jumping her 
line.

          NICOLE
     I'm sorry, I'm lost...

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

          NICK
     Cut. It's OK. No big deal.

Nick's voice has the rigid tremble of someone barely able to 
keep from screaming.

          NICK
     Everyone relax. We're just going to 
     run the lines. That's all. No acting. 
     Just run the lines. Then we're going 
     to shoot this fucking scene.

INT. SET APT. THE COUCH. DAY. B/W

Nicole gets up quietly and sits next to Cora on the couch, 
wordlessly taking her hand in hers.

          CORA
          (whispers)
     I'm so sorry. I'm fucking this up 
     for you.

          NICOLE
          (whispers)
     Cora, don't even think that. You're 
     doing great. I'm the one who's fucking 
     it up. If I get through this I swear 
     I'm never acting again.

She means it. Cora glances up at her, seeing for the first 
time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from Nicole's 
face. On an impulse Cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand 
of Nicole's hair from her eyes.

A sudden amazed alarm fills Nicole. The living room grows 
strangely quiet.

          NICK
          (faintly, from a 
          distance)
     And, action on the run-through.

CU Nicole. She looks quickly toward Nick in confusion.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY. COLOR

DISSOLVE to a nurse moving quickly past the camera and out 
the open door of the hospital room.

CU Nicole, seated on the edge of the hospital bed. Still 
confused, she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed. 
The woman's face is pale and drawn. As Nicole leans closer 
her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair 
away from her face. The gesture is one of love, acceptance, 
and farewell. It is identical to the one we have just seen 
Cora make to her.

          NICK (V.O.)
     And action on the run-through.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

WS, the Living Room Set. Nick, Wanda, the rest of the crew 
standing quietly. Nicole glances over at Cora and instantly 
something unspoken and unexplained passes between them. The 
run-through begins.

From the moment Nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there 
has been a remarkable change in her. Every word now has the 
stunning clarity of truth. Cora is completely engulfed in 
the moment.

          NICOLE
     Dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
     It didn't hurt that much but I started 
     crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
     me alone. He went over and started 
     hitting Danny.

          CORA
     Ellen, I have no memory of this 
     whatsoever.

          NICOLE
     You were just standing there looking 
     at me.

As Nicole continues, one by one the crew turn and watch this 
exquisite moment happening before them. Nick's face is lit 
with rapture.

          NICK
          (whispering)
     Roll camera... roll camera.

He glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind 
the camera. He whispers frantically to the AC.

          NICK
     Where's Wolf?

          AC
          (whispers)
     In the bathroom... he doesn't feel 
     good.

          NICK
          (whispers)
     Get him! Get him!

Nick turns back to the scene, watching its beauty now in 
agony.

          NICOLE
     Then you pulled me up and said, 
     "You're not hurt." Like I was 
     disgusting for faking, for doing the 
     only thing I could think of to keep 
     him from hitting me again.

          CORA
     I was worried about Danny.

          NICOLE
     You do remember.

          CORA
     He was smaller than you.

          NICOLE
     You were so worried about Danny. 
     What about me, Mom? Why weren't you 
     worried about me?

There is a heavy, stunned silence as the scene ends. Nicole 
and Cora are in each other's arms. Pam and Cybil share a 
piece of tissue. CUT TO: an extreme CU of Nick.

          NICK
     Where the fuck is Wolf?!!!

INT. BATHROOM. DAY. B/W

In the cramped confines of the dingy basement bathroom, Wolf 
pukes violently into the toilet. His face is pale and slick 
with perspiration. His eyes look upward toward the sound of 
Nick yelling.

          WOLF
     One second!

Wolf tries to continue but another spasm of nausea wrenches 
him back toward the toilet bowl.

INT. SET APT. THE COUCH. DAY. B/W

The set is quiet, subdued. Nick sits on the couch with Nicole 
and Cora. Wolf sits groggily behind the camera wiping the 
sweat from his face. Wanda addresses the crew.

          WANDA
     OK, listen up. Nobody drinks the 
     milk downstairs. OK? It appears to 
     be bad.

Nick speaks uneasily to Nicole and Cora. He is a wreck and 
his insistent smile of encouragement looks absolutely 
demented.

          NICK
     I've had to, well I've changed the 
     shot; we're just a little pressed 
     for time. It'll just be a CU of Ellen 
     for the last part of the scene, 
     starting with Cora's "I was worried 
     about Danny." OK? I'll find a way to 
     cut this into the fourth take. We 
     almost had it. That was unbelievable, 
     both of you. But let's not think 
     about it. That moment is gone, and... 
     we'll, we'll get another one. I have 
     no doubt about it. OK? Here we go.

Nick walks over and stands beside the camera.

INT. SET APT. BY THE CAMERA. DAY. B/W

          WOLF
     I'm ready, Nick.

Nick is so angry he can't even look at Wolf.

          NICK
     Call it, Wanda.

          WANDA
     And, roll sound.

          SOUND

INT. SET APT. THE SCENE: PICKUP 1. COLOR

The scene begins at the pickup point. Miraculously, both 
Cora and Nicole are just as concentrated and engaged as they 
were in the run-through.

          CORA
     I was worried about Danny.

          NICOLE
     You do remember.

          CORA
     He was smaller than you.

          NICOLE
     You were so worried about Danny. 
     What about me, Mom? Why weren't --

In the middle of this final, delicate moment an insistent 
electronic beeping is heard.

INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

          NICK
     CUT!!!!

          WANDA
     What the fuck is that?! Sound?

          SOUND
          (frantically checking 
          his equipment)
     It's not me.

          BOOM
     It's the camera.

          WOLF
     The fuck it is. It's off; it's not 
     even running.

The beep continues, growing louder.

          WANDA
          (into her walkie)
     What's going on down there?! Do I 
     have a lock-up?! Nothing? You don't 
     hear a beeping sound?
          (to Nick)
     The street's quiet.

          NICK
     Then what the fuck is it!!?

          AC
     It's somebody's watch!

Everybody holds their watches up to their ears.

          WOLF
     Not mine.

          WANDA
     Not mine.

          SOUND
     Not mine.

          BOOM
     Not mine.

And so on, until all watches have been checked with negative 
results. The beeping continues, growing louder and louder.

Suddenly Nick loses it. He starts running around the set, 
ripping things apart, knocking over tables, lamps, chairs. 
He shoves Cora off the couch and whips off the cushions, 
heaving them against the wall with a startling violence.

          NICK
     Where is it!! You motherfucker! You 
     cock-sucking motherfucking bastard! 
     Where the fuck are you!? Where!! 
     Where!!

Everyone watches Nick demolish the set in stunned, open-
mouthed amazement. Nick turns to the crew in rage.

          NICK
     Can someone help me please?! Do I 
     have to do everything myself here?!

Nick loses it completely.

          NICK
     Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn 
     your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you 
     finally going to pay attention here?! 
     Hey, focus puller, you want to make 
     a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got 
     some great fuckin' Thai Stick here! 
     Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret-
     wearing motherfucker! I saw your 
     reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell 
     would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda, 
     next time can you wear a shirt that's 
     a little more distracting to my 
     actors!
          (to the Gaffer)
     Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make 
     a little more noise on the dolly you 
     creaky motherfucker!
          (to Cybil)
     What is your name!? What do you 
     fucking do around here?!
          (to the Soundman)
     Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't 
     even find a teeny fucking beep?!

CU of Nicole. She turns away, unable to watch anymore. The 
beeping continues.

          NICK
     See what I have to put up with, 
     Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do 
     some of that magic on camera!? But 
     no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking 
     his guts out, "Oh now I'll be good!!"

WS, the entire room. Nick's last word echoes throughout the 
silent set. Suddenly he stops in the center of the demolished 
set and lets out a long, wrenching scream.

INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. COLOR

QUICK CUT TO extreme CU Nick's face, just as his eyes open. 
The film is in COLOR now. The room is in heavy darkness except 
for the light on Nick's face. Nick reaches over and shuts 
off his clock radio. The digital dial shows 4:00 A.M. The 
beeping finally stops.

Nick turns on a light and sits up in bed, drenched in sweat 
and still breathing heavily.

          NICK
     God...
          (this is not a sigh 
          of relief)

The camera DOLLIES swiftly back away from Nick. He stares at 
it in stunned amazement. Just then a DOOR closes right into 
the lens turning the frame into complete BLACKNESS.

Out of the BLACKNESS a door opens away from the camera 
revealing WANDA looking into her closet (the camera is inside 
the closet). From this point on, the rest of the film is in 
COLOR except where specifically indicated to be Black and 
White.

INT. WANDA'S APT. DAWN

She is wearing only a bra, black stretch pants, and cowboy 
boots. She rummages quickly through some blouses, selects 
the same garish one she wore in Part One, then walks away 
revealing WOLF sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed. He is 
dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete 
with beret. He struggles groggily into his socks and boots. 
The entire apartment is in disarray. A bedside clock reads 
4:13 A.M.

          WOLF
     Well, when did he ask you?

          WANDA
     Yesterday, when I was helping him 
     check into his hotel.

          WOLF
     What, the guy can't even check into 
     a hotel by himself?

          WANDA
     Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino 
     in this movie will benefit us all. 
     If being there when he checks into 
     his hotel makes him feel better, 
     then I'm happy to do it.

          WOLF
     Well, how did it come up?

          WANDA
     He asked me if I liked jazz, I said 
     yes, and he suggested we meet tonight 
     at a jazz club.

          WOLF
     I like jazz.

          WANDA
     He did not invite you.
          (applies perfume)

          WOLF
     Why are you wearing perfume to work?

          WANDA
     Because I feel like it.

          WOLF
     You didn't wear it yesterday.

          WANDA
     Oh, stop it. You're acting like a 
     child.

Wanda playfully swipes at Wolf's face with a negligee she is 
returning to the closet. It misses him completely.

          WOLF
     My eye!

          WANDA
     Oh, God. Sweetheart, are you alright?

          WOLF
     Do I look alright?!

          WANDA
     Let me see. Christ, we're going to 
     be late.

Wanda sits and perfunctorily examines Wolf's eye.

INT. CAR. DAWN

The car is parked outside a rather seedy hotel. JEFF, the 
Intern and NICK, the Director, sit quietly in the motionless 
car.

          NICK
     Should we call up to the room again?

          JEFF
     He said he'd be right down.

Nick lets out a huge yawn.

          JEFF
     Tired?

          NICK
     I'm exhausted. I dreamt I was on the 
     set all night. I was just trying to 
     do one shot and everything kept going 
     wrong.

          JEFF
     That's an anxiety dream. Are you 
     anxious about something?

          NICK
     I don't know. Sometimes I wonder 
     what the hell I'm doing in this 
     business. It's all just one compromise 
     and disappointment after another. I 
     don't know if I have the personality 
     for it.

          JEFF
     Sounds kind of like an identity 
     crisis.

          NICK
     Maybe you're right. Who am I? What 
     am I really capable of? Maybe I should 
     just get a job teaching at a women's 
     college somewhere.

          JEFF
     How'd you get into cinematography?

          NICK
     I'm not a cinematographer.

          JEFF
     You're not?

          NICK
     No. I'm directing this movie.

          JEFF
          (pause)
     How'd you get into directing?

INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN

In the dim light of the hotel room, CHAD PALOMINO dresses 
quickly. He is young, handsome, with long blond hair. A WOMAN 
sits nude on the bed, her back to the camera. The faint sound 
of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom.

          PALOMINO
     They're waiting downstairs.

          WOMAN
     Go ahead, I'll take a taxi.

          PALOMINO
     Oh, OK. Listen, I've got to tell 
     you, I had a lot of fun last night, 
     really, but for me, where I'm at 
     right now in my life, a relationship 
     is...

          WOMAN
     Chad; hold it. This was a one-time 
     deal. You know it, I know it. There 
     is no need for melodrama.

          PALOMINO
     I just thought you might...

          WOMAN
     Look, all I ask is that you don't 
     mention this to anyone.

          PALOMINO
     Hey, that's not my style.

          WOMAN
     Good.

          PALOMINO
     So, I'll see you on the set.

Palomino slips out the door. The woman falls back onto the 
bed, turning her face toward the camera. We see it is NICOLE.

          NICOLE
     God damn it.

She lies for a moment, listening to the sound of the shower. 
The bedside clock reads 4:30 A.M.

INT. CAR. DAWN

The car pulls up outside a NYC apt building. Jeff, Nick, and 
Palomino sit inside.

          PALOMINO
     I got two films coming up right after 
     yours, Nick. One I play a rapist 
     that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love 
     with. The other I'm kind of a sexy 
     serial killer who shacks up with 
     Winona Ryder.

          NICK
     That's great, man.

          PALOMINO
     Yeah, but I'm not into that hostess 
     twinkie shit, Nick.

          NICK
     Hostess twinkie?

          PALOMINO
     That Hollywood shit. It's all fluff, 
     man. These are the kind of movies I 
     want to do, right here.

          NICK
     I'm glad you feel that way, Chad. 
     And I just want to tell you, I'm 
     really happy we can work together.

          PALOMINO
     Hey, me too! You're a great director, 
     man. Your films are wacked! And I'm 
     gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a 
     hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick. 
     I'm gonna pick your brain.

          NICK
     Good. Then you can pick my nose.

          PALOMINO
          (big laugh)
     See what I mean? You're wacked. Hey, 
     what are we sitting here for?

          NICK
     We're waiting for Nicole.

          PALOMINO
     Nicole? She's takin' a tax --
          (he stops)

          NICK
     What?

          PALOMINO
     Probably taking a shower or something. 
     Hey, how was her shower scene in 
     that Richard Gere movie?

          NICK
     Good.

          JEFF
     Really great.

The three men sit in silence. WS, showing the car parked 
outside Nicole's apt, the men inside waiting.

INT. THE SET. MORNING

A small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the 
middle of the huge empty space. One wall has a fake window. 
The GAFFER lies on the bed staring absently at the AC sitting 
motionless beside the camera a few feet away. Neither speaks 
for a long moment.

          GAFFER
     I think we got nudity today.

          AC
          (reads from his 
          callsheet)
     It just says "Scene Six: Ellen and 
     Damian kiss."

          GAFFER
     Could be a kiss with nudity.

          AC
     I like Ellen. She's my type.

          GAFFER
     Why is that?

          AC
     She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky.

          GAFFER
     Maybe I'll give her a part. That's 
     right; I'm makin' my own movie pretty 
     soon.

          AC
     Oh yeah?

          GAFFER
     Yup. Feature. I brought my script.

The Gaffer tugs a thin, tattered SCRIPT, folded lengthwise, 
out of his back pocket.

          GAFFER
     Palomino's perfect for the lead. I'm 
     going to give it to him right during 
     lunch. Maybe right after.

          AC
     Alright.

          GAFFER
     Got to be aggressive. You want to 
     shoot it?

          AC
     Sure.

          GAFFER
     You ever shot anything?

          AC
     No.

          GAFFER
     That's alright; got to start 
     somewhere.

Suddenly the Gaffer reaches out and warmly shakes the AC's 
hand.

INT. MAKEUP CORNER. DAY

Nicole sits before the makeup mirror. LORDE, the male Makeup 
artist picks up a tube of Preparation H and begins applying 
it under Nicole's eyes just as Nick walks up.

          NICK
     Jesus, what are you doing?

          LORDE
     Shrinking tissue. That's what this 
     stuff is for. Let that sit for two 
     minutes, pumpkin; I'll be right back.

          NICK
     How'd you get here?

          NICOLE
     Took a taxi.

          NICK
     Oh. We've been waiting in front of 
     your apartment for half an hour.

          NICOLE
     God, I'm sorry, Nick. Something came 
     up. I forgot to call. I'm sorry, I 
     feel like such an asshole.

          NICK
     You're just saying that because you 
     have Preparation H on your face.

          NICOLE
     I never should have gone out last 
     night. I hate jazz. God, I look 
     terrible.

          NICK
     No you don't.

          NICOLE
     Don't bullshit me, Nick.

          NICK
     I'm not. You really look beautiful.

Something in Nick's voice makes Nicole glance up at him. He 
looks away quickly. The moment is awkward, as if they both 
realize he has inadvertently revealed something. Just then 
Palomino approaches.

          PALOMINO
     Hey! How'd you get here, Nicole?

          NICOLE
     I took a cab.

          PALOMINO
     Oh, cause we were wondering how you 
     got here.

Nick looks at both of them in a moment of silence.

          NICK
     Alright, good; everybody's here. 
     We'll do a run-through as soon as 
     you guys are ready.

          PALOMINO
     You got it, Chief.

Lorde reenters as Nick leaves. Palomino sits in the chair 
beside Nicole and Lorde immediately begins his makeup. No 
one speaks.

INT. THE SET. DAY

The crew is assembled behind the camera. Wolf is now wearing 
a black eyepatch over one eye. Nick is on the set, talking 
with Nicole and Palomino. Palomino wears a tuxedo and Nicole 
is in an elaborate low-cut gown.

          WANDA
     Hold it down, hold it down, people. 
     Actors working.

          PALOMINO
     Great shirt, Wanda.

          WANDA
          (big smile)
     Why, thank you, Chad.

          NICK
     OK, let's work out the rest of this 
     blocking. Wolf --
          (notices Wolf's 
          eyepatch)
     What happened to your eye?

          WOLF
     A little accident.

          NICK
     You going to be alright?

          WOLF
     I think so.

          PALOMINO
     It looks good on you, man.

          NICK
     Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're 
     there by the chair. Camera is close 
     on Ellen: her first line.

          NICOLE
     I've always admired you from afar.

          PALOMINO
     Admired? That sounds rather 
     professional.

          NICK
     Good! "Professional," that's the 
     cue; Damian steps up to the bed. 
     Camera pulls back. The scene 
     continues.

          NICOLE
     Well, then: loved. How does that 
     sound?

          PALOMINO
     It sounds like the champagne talking.

          NICOLE
     I've loved you from the moment we 
     met.

          PALOMINO
     Why didn't you tell me?

          NICOLE
     We were working together. I didn't 
     want anything to interfere.

          PALOMINO
     God. And all this time I thought...

          NICK
     Then the kiss. How's that feel?

          PALOMINO
     Great.

          NICK
     Nicole?

          NICOLE
     Good.

          NICK
     Wolf, any thoughts?

          WOLF
     Nope.

          PALOMINO
     I've got a thought. What about Damian 
     having an eyepatch like Wolf's?

          NICK
     Let me think about that one, Chad.

          PALOMINO
     OK, you're the genius. Nick Reve, 
     Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take 
     One. Let's shoot it!

          NICK
     One second, Chad. You ready for one, 
     Wolf?

          WOLF
     Hell, I been ready.

          PALOMINO
     Alright, Wolfman.

          NICK
     Good. Call it, Wanda.

          WANDA
     Going for picture. Lock it up. And 
     roll sound.

          SOUND
     Speed!

          WANDA
     Roll camera!

          AC
     Rolling!

          CLAPPER
     Scene six, take one!

          NICK
     And, action.

INT. THE SET. TAKE ONE

Instantly the film cuts from color to B/W. Chad and Nicole 
begin their Love Scene.

          NICOLE
     I've always admired you from afar.

          PALOMINO
     Admired? That sounds rather 
     professional.

The camera starts to dolly, however Chad does not move. He 
goes out of frame forcing Wolf to pan abruptly to Nicole.

          NICOLE
     Well, then: loved. How does that 
     sound?

          PALOMINO
     It sounds like the champagne talking.

          NICOLE
     I've loved you from the moment we 
     met.

          PALOMINO
          (finally moves to his 
          mark)
     Why didn't you tell me?

          NICOLE
     We were working together. I didn't 
     want anything to interfere.

          PALOMINO
     God. And all this time I thought...

Palomino and Nicole embrace. Their kiss, like the entire 
scene, is flat, lifeless, and awful.

INT. THE SET

          NICK
     Cut. Very good.

          WOLF
     Not for camera. Chad was completely 
     out of frame.

          NICK
     Yeah, Chad; what happened, buddy? 
     Forget your cue?

          PALOMINO
     Oh no, man. I held back. It really 
     felt like something Damian would do; 
     holding back to the last moment.

          NICK
     Oh, I see. How's that for you, Wolf?

          WOLF
     I don't care when he moves. Just 
     give me a fucking cue.

          PALOMINO
     The Lone Wolf!

          NICK
     What line did he move on?

          SCRIPT
     "Why didn't you tell me?"

          NICK
     Alright, "me" is the new cue. Nicole, 
     how does that feel to you?

          NICOLE
     Fine, if that's what Chad wants to 
     do.

          PALOMINO
     "Me, me, me," that's the cue. Let's 
     shoot; I'm stoked!

          NICK
     One second, Chad.

Nick approaches the bed and speaks quietly to Chad and Nicole.

          NICK
     Chad, how would you describe this 
     scene, in one word?

          PALOMINO
     Great. It's a great scene, man.

          NICK
     No, I mean it's a love scene. Right?

          PALOMINO
     Definitely.

          NICK
     These two people really love each 
     other. And we want to see that, 
     especially in the kiss.

          PALOMINO
     Hey, say no more, Chief.

          NICK
     Nicole?

          NICOLE
     I understand, Chief.

          NICK
     Good. Here we go. Call it, Wanda.

          WANDA
     Going for picture. Lock it up. And 
     roll sound.

     And, action.

INT. THE SCENE. TAKE TWO. DAY

          NICOLE
     I've always admired you from afar.

Palomino moves immediately to the bed, changing his blocking 
and causing the camera crew and Nicole considerable confusion.

          PALOMINO
     Admired? That sounds rather 
     professional.

          NICOLE
     Well, then: loved. How does that 
     sound?

          PALOMINO
     It sounds like the champagne talking.

          NICOLE
     I've loved you from the moment we 
     met.

          PALOMINO
     Why didn't you tell me?

          NICOLE
     We were working together. I didn't 
     want anything to interfere.

          PALOMINO
     God. And all this time I thought...

The scene once again is awful. Nick gives their listless 
kiss a few moments then calls CUT.

INT. THE SET. DAY

          NICK
     And, cut. Very good. Wolf?

          WOLF
     Chad missed his cue again; the whole 
     dolly is unusable.

          NICK
     Yeah, Chad. What happened; I thought 
     you were going to hold back till 
     "me"?

          PALOMINO
     The more I thought about it the more 
     it didn't seem right. And I'm 
     thinking, watch me here, instead of 
     coming around the bed, what if I 
     just slip here like this and do the 
     whole scene lying down?

          NICK
     I don't know, that seems a little...

          PALOMINO
     Hey, I'm just throwing out ideas 
     here. Trying to get the juices 
     flowing.

          NICK
     Nicole, how does that feel to you?

          NICOLE
     Well, I can turn to look at him. But 
     won't you be shooting the back of my 
     head?

          WOLF
     Plus Chad is completely out of the 
     light down there.

          PALOMINO
     Hey, Wolf; I'm not worried about my 
     face, man. It's about the acting; 
     that's all I care about.

          WOLF
     It's your call, Nick. His acting or 
     his face.

          NICK
     For some reason I was hoping we could 
     get both.
          (laughs)
     I thought that's what we were trying 
     to do here.

          WOLF
     I'll have to set another light.

          WANDA
     We're ahead of schedule, Nick. I 
     think we can afford a few minutes to 
     set a light for Mr. Palomino.

          NICK
     Good, let's do it. Ellen, Damian; 
     let's talk for a second.

As Nick, Nicole, and Palomino step off the set Wanda speaks 
to the crew in general.

          WANDA
     We'll pause to set this light and go 
     again right away. How long, Wolf?

Wolf doesn't answer, though he stands a mere foot away, 
watching the Gaffer set up a light.

          WANDA
     Wolf?

Wolf walks away from Wanda without a word. The entire crew 
watches this.

INT. A CORNER. DAY

Nick, Palomino, and Nicole confer, all three smoking.

          NICK
     OK, let's make sure we know what's 
     going on here. These two people have 
     loved each other for years, each of 
     them not knowing the other was in 
     love with them. And tonight, in this 
     little room it all comes out. It's 
     like a dam bursting. Does that make 
     sense? Nicole?

          NICOLE
     It makes perfect sense. I just haven't 
     found it yet. I'll get it though.

          NICK
     What about you, Chad?

          PALOMINO
     I'm there, man. I got the dam going, 
     the river, everything. You watch, 
     that little change in the blocking 
     is going to open the whole scene up 
     for me.

          WANDA (V.O.)
     We're ready, Nick!

          NICK
     Good. Let's go.

INT. THE SET. DAY

INT. THE SCENE. TAKE THREE. DAY

          NICOLE
     I've always admired you from afar.

Palomino saunters over and sprawls on the bed, forcing Nicole 
to turn her head completely away from the camera.

          PALOMINO
     Admired? That sounds rather 
     professional.

          NICOLE
     Well, then: loved. How does that 
     sound?

          PALOMINO
     It sounds like the champagne talking.

          NICOLE
     I've loved you from the moment we 
     met.

          PALOMINO
     Why didn't you tell me?

          NICOLE
     We were working together -- I'm sorry, 
     can we cut, Nick?

INT. THE SET. DAY

          NICK
     Cut!

          WANDA
     That's a cut!

          PALOMINO
     Dammit! That was a good one!

          NICOLE
     I know, I'm sorry. But this feels 
     really awkward; turning all the way 
     around like this.

          NICK
     Yeah, I think the lying on the bed 
     is not quite working, Chad. Let's 
     try one with the original blocking.

          PALOMINO
     Which one was that? There's been so 
     many damn changes. Could somebody 
     help me out please?

          SCRIPT
     The cue for the original blocking is 
     "professional."

          PALOMINO
          (intimate)
     Thank you. Thank you very much.

          NICK
     OK, right away. Call it, Wanda.

          NICOLE
     Nick? Could I just have a moment? Is 
     that alright?

          NICK
     Of course, Nicole; are you kidding? 
     Hold the roll, Wanda.

          WANDA
     Holding the roll!

Nicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and 
closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion 
for the scene. Everyone watches her in complete silence.

INT. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY

Palomino tiptoes over to the camera where Wanda and the 
Scriptgirl are standing side by side. As he leans between 
them, checking his lines on the Scriptgirl's script, he 
inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh.

          PALOMINO
          (whispers)
     Someone over here smells very, very 
     nice.

Thinking he means her, Wanda's lips flutter in a brief, 
involuntary smile. Meanwhile, the Scriptgirl turns away, 
blushing furiously.

INT. THE SET. DAY

Palomino tiptoes again back to his spot. Nicole raises her 
head and nods once to Nick. She seems to have aroused some 
real emotion in herself.

          NICK
          (with quiet intensity)
     Call it, Wanda.

          WANDA

          WANDA
     Hold the roll!

          NICK
     What is it, Chad?

          PALOMINO
     Just stop me if I'm out of line here, 
     but she says "admired from afar," 
     right? Doesn't it make sense to see 
     Damian up close and her "afar?" You 
     start on a Close-up of Damian, watch 
     me here; as she declares her love, 
     the camera moves with me into this 
     primo two-shot that you and the 
     Wolfmeister have set up here.

          NICK
     What do you think, Wolf?

          WOLF
     I don't like it. This is Ellen's 
     scene.

          NICK
     I don't know; it sort of makes sense.

          PALOMINO
     Hey, you did it, man. It's all there 
     in the writing.

          WOLF
     I'd have to relight.

Nick pauses, thinking hard.

          WANDA
     We're still ahead of schedule, Nick; 
     if that means anything to you.

          NICK
     Let's do it.

          WOLF
          (to the Gaffer)
     Get me a tweenie right here, with 
     diffusion.

          WANDA
     OK, everyone stand by. We're pausing 
     briefly to set one little light, 
     then we're going again, right away. 
     Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino.

          GAFFER
     I'll do it.

          WOLF
     Get the fucking light!

INT. CRAFT SERVICE TABLE. DAY

Several members of the crew loiter around the table. The 
Scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup 
of coffee in the other. Palomino notices her and moves quietly 
to her side. Without a word he picks up the milk and pours 
some in her coffee. Nicole stands nearby and watches the 
following exchange.

          SCRIPT
     Thanks.

          PALOMINO
     My pleasure. Sugar?

          SCRIPT
     Just a bit.

Palomino puts sugar in her coffee with extreme care.

          PALOMINO
     You like jazz?

          SCRIPT
     Very much.

          PALOMINO
     Maybe we could go hear some tonight.

Palomino smiles and moves away just as Wanda comes up for a 
coffee refill.

          WANDA
     It's going well I think. Don't you 
     think?

          SCRIPT
     Very well. What time do you think 
     we'll finish?

          WANDA
     Early I hope. I'm going to a jazz 
     club tonight.

          SCRIPT
     Really? So am I. He's wonderful, 
     isn't he?

          WANDA
     Chad?

          SCRIPT
     He's so natural, like... air.

Nicole approaches.

          SCRIPT
     I wonder what his sign is. Do you 
     know, Nicole?

          NICOLE
     I don't know his sign, but I think 
     his moon is in Uranus.

Wanda chokes hard on her coffee as Nicole walks off with a 
bitter smile.

          SCRIPT
     You don't have to be nasty.

INT. THE SET. DAY

Palomino saunters onto the set as Wolf and his crew finish 
relighting.

          PALOMINO
     Yo, Wolfman. Is this my new mark?

          WOLF
     Until you change it. Where's my 
     fucking eyepatch?!

Wolf walks off. The Gaffer slips the AC a shrewd wink then 
walks over and stands next to Palomino, giving him a big, 
friendly grin.

          GAFFER
     Hey, Chad.

          PALOMINO
     Hey, whatya say.

          GAFFER
     I'm Bob. I'm lighting this show.

          PALOMINO
     Chad Palomino; Actor.

          GAFFER
          (big smile)
     I know.

          PALOMINO
          (to the ac)
     Hey, what's your name?

          AC
     Maurice.

          PALOMINO
     Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any 
     relation? Probably not. Hey, smoking 
     crew guys, really.

The Gaffer slips his own script out of his back pocket and 
begins leafing through it.

          GAFFER
     Hey thanks, Chad. Actually I wrote a 
     script.

          PALOMINO
     Oh, yeah?

Palomino takes the Gaffer's script and holds it up to his 
eyes, shading them from a light he's looking at across the 
room. He points to the light.

          PALOMINO
     Hey, Bill. See that light over there?

          GAFFER
     Uh, yeah.

          PALOMINO
     Lower it about three feet.

Palomino hands the Gaffer back his script and walks off. The 
Gaffer and AC stand in silence for a long awkward moment.

INT. BATHROOM. DAY

Nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. Leaning 
closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair 
falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself.

          NICK
     Would you care to have a drink 
     tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you 
     say you and I have a drink tonight?

Suddenly the door opens behind him and Nicole walks in.

          NICOLE
     Oh, Nick! I'm sorry!

          NICK
     That's OK, no problem. I'm just 
     slapping a little water on my face.

The two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. Nick looks 
like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out.

          NICK
     So, it's going pretty good, huh?

          NICOLE
     Is it? Something feels off.

          NICK
     Yeah, you seem a little tense.

          NICOLE
     Do I?

          NICK
     But don't worry about it. Just take 
     your attention off yourself and put 
     it on Chad. Work off him a little 
     more.

          NICOLE
     OK, I'll try that.

          NICK
     And listen, I know he's no Olivier. 
     But he's got something, don't you 
     think? Kind of a natural presence.

          NICOLE
     Oh yes, he's very natural.

Nick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the 
question.

          NICK
     So Nicole... anything else I can 
     help you with?

          NICOLE
     Actually there is. Could you maybe 
     ask him to brush his teeth?

          NICK
     Oh, sure.

INT. THE SET. DAY

Wanda crosses the set and assumes her position beside the 
camera. Wolf sits behind it, barely a foot away.

          WOLF
     My eye is killing me.

          WANDA
     Put your eyepatch on.

          WOLF
     I lost it.

          WANDA
     Is that little light set yet?

          WOLF
     That little light was set ten minutes 
     ago.

          WANDA
          (into her walkie)
     Get me the A Team in here right away. 
     Nick, Nicole, and Mr. Palomino.
          (to Wolf)
     Why didn't you tell me?

          WOLF
     Hey, you're not worried about the 
     time, I'm not worried about the time.

          WANDA
     Oh, I am very worried about the time!

          WOLF
     I know you are.

          WANDA
     What is that supposed to mean?

          WOLF
     What do you think it means?!

          WANDA
     I don't know what it means!

          WOLF
     Oh yes you do, you know exactly what 
     it means.

          WANDA
     I have no idea what you're talking 
     about! Why are you --

          WOLF
     You don't understand me, Wanda! You 
     have no idea --

          WANDA
     I don't understand you?!! All I do 
     is take care of you!!!

Nick suddenly runs up just as Wolf and Wanda are on the verge 
of blows.

          NICK
     Hey, hey, hey! What the hell's going 
     on here?! Jesus, Wanda. This is a 
     very intimate scene and a lot of 
     tension on the set doesn't help. OK? 
     Now, Wolf, let's just go through the 
     first part of the move. Damian, on 
     your new mark. Good. Close-up, Damian; 
     Ellen in the background.

Nick suddenly sees Palomino is wearing a black eyepatch.

          NICK
     Chad, what are you doing?

          WOLF
     Hey, that's my fucking eyepatch.

          PALOMINO
     Wolf, could I borrow it? Cause I'm 
     telling you, Nick; it really feels 
     right. I feel like this guy now, 
     man.

          NICK
     I don't know, Chad. I don't think it 
     works.

          PALOMINO
     You're wrong, man. I'm going to fight 
     you on this one.

          WOLF
     Hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and I 
     don't want anyone wearing it. It's 
     insanitary.

Palomino removes the eyepatch and tosses it back to Wolf.

          PALOMINO
     Fine. I'll get my own. Nick, send 
     someone out for an eyepatch. I'll 
     fucking pay for it myself.

Nick pulls Palomino aside and whispers to him confidentially.

          NICK
     Listen, Chad. I didn't want to say 
     this in front of Wolf but it makes 
     you look a little... gay.

          PALOMINO
     Really?

          NICK
     Yeah, a little bit.

          PALOMINO
     Jesus.

Palomino sneaks a glance back at Wolf then whispers to Nick.

          PALOMINO
     You're right. Thanks, buddy. Good 
     call.

          WANDA
     Are you ready, Nick?

          NICK
     One second. You need a rehearsal, 
     Wolf?

          WOLF
     Let's just fucking shoot it!!

          PALOMINO
     El Lobo!

Palomino winks at Nick and walks back to his new mark, making 
a barely audible howling sound behind his hand.

          NICK
     Call it, Wanda.

          WANDA
     Going for picture. Lock it up. And 
     roll sound.

          SOUND
     Speed!

          WANDA
     Roll camera!

          AC
     Rolling!

          CLAPPER
     Scene six, take four!

          NICK
     And, action.

INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FOUR

The scene begins again. Palomino milks his Close-up for all 
it's worth.

          NICOLE
     I've always admired you from afar.

          PALOMINO
     Admired? That sounds rather 
     professional.

          NICOLE
     Well, then: loved. How does that 
     sound?

Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera 
moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with 
extreme care and concentration.

          PALOMINO
     It sounds like the champagne talking.

          NICOLE
     I've loved you from the moment we 
     met.

          PALOMINO
     Why didn't you tell me?

          NICOLE
     We were working together. I didn't 
     want anything to interfere -- God!

Under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole 
suddenly jerks her head away hard. Palomino jumps up and 
begins pacing at the rear of the set.

INT. THE SET. DAY

          NICK
     Cut!

          WANDA
     That's a cut. Hold the work, going 
     again, right away.

          NICOLE
     I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I 
     did that. I'm sorry.

Palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses Nick with a 
curtness that is a little startling.

          PALOMINO
     Nick, could I talk to you a second?

Palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head 
indicating his wish for Nick to follow him.

          WANDA
     A momentary delay. Everyone stand 
     by. We're going again, right away.

          SOUND
     Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low 
     on that take.

          NICOLE
     Oh, OK. I'll bring it up. Actually 
     could I listen to the take before?

The Sound man gives Nicole his headphones and rewinds the 
tape recorder for her. The first several lines of the last 
take are heard through the headphones.

INT. OFF THE SET. DAY

Nick follows Palomino behind the set, stopping just beside 
the fake set window. Palomino whirls on Nick and whispers 
fiercely.

          PALOMINO
     I'm out of here, man!

          NICK
     What's the matter?!

          PALOMINO
     I like you, but I made a big mistake 
     taking this part. Have someone call 
     me a cab.

          NICK
     Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to 
     me. What's going on!?

          PALOMINO
     I can't act with this woman. I know 
     she's a friend of yours but I got to 
     tell you: she cannot act worth a 
     shit! I'm giving her everything! The 
     whole thing I just did with the hair; 
     did you see that? I came up with 
     that on my own because I thought it 
     would help her. But no, she's giving 
     me nothing! I'm out of here.

INT. THE SET. DAY

Nicole listens to the last line of the previous take.

          PALOMINO
     God, and all this time I thought...
          (the muted rustle of 
          the kiss)

The Sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take, 
sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword 
puzzle. Nicole is just about to take off the headphones when 
she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking quite 
clearly. Glancing up, she sees the Boom man has left his 
boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the 
open set window.

          PALOMINO (V.O.)
     Why did you cast her? She sucked in 
     that Richard Gere movie!

          NICK (V.O.)
     You're right. She is not the best 
     actress in the world. I see that now 
     but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm 
     asking you to please help me here. 
     We've got to get through this somehow.

The camera begins a slow DOLLY in to Nicole's astonished 
face. This will be intercut with a similar DOLLY in to the 
microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ECU of the 
mike.

INT. OFF THE SET. DAY

Camera is close on Nick and Palomino.

          PALOMINO
     I'll tell you what this is about, 
     man. You know why she took a cab 
     this morning?

          NICK
     Something came up.

          PALOMINO
     No. She was in my hotel room and she 
     didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm 
     sorry it had to come out like this 
     but I told her this morning "thanks 
     a lot, it was a lot of fun last night 
     but let's get something straight -- 
     it was just a one-time deal," and 
     she didn't want to hear that. She 
     wanted more, you see what I'm saying? 
     It's rejection.

INT. THE SET. DAY

The camera reveals Nicole now seated in her spot on the bed. 
She rises as Nick and Palomino reappear and approach her 
from behind the set.

          NICK
     Nicole, listen...

          NICOLE
     Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't 
     working. I apologize. Chad, I 
     apologize to you too. I'm completely 
     unfocused here and I think you're 
     absolutely right; what we need to do 
     is loosen the scene up somehow.

Nick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment.

          NICK
     What would you like to do?

          NICOLE
     I was wondering if we could try 
     improvising the scene. More along 
     the lines of what Chad has been doing. 
     Maybe that would help me find 
     something.

Nick's smile of gratitude to Nicole looks almost drug-induced.

          NICK
     That's a fantastic idea. What do you 
     think, Chad?

          PALOMINO
     Hey, that's the only way I can work. 
     Let's take it apart, let's cut loose.

          NICK
     Good! And we'll shoot it! Hell, why 
     not?!

          PALOMINO
     Roll that motherfucking camera, 
     Wolfie!

          WOLF
     Kiss my ass!

Although Wolf says this quite loud, Palomino doesn't hear 
him because he suddenly yells:

          PALOMINO
     Yeah! Let's go!

          NICK
     Alright, now we're making a fucking 
     movie! Call it, Wanda!

          WANDA
     Going for picture. Lock it up. And 
     roll sound.

          SOUND
     Speed!

          WANDA
     Roll camera!

          AC
     Rolling!

          CLAPPER
     Scene six, take five!

          NICK
     And, action.

INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FIVE. THE IMPROV

Nicole stays seated, though Palomino moves around making a 
great show of loosening up.

          NICOLE
     I've always admired you from afar.

          PALOMINO
     Have you? That's, wow; that's 
     incredible. But that sounds kind of 
     professional doesn't it? Admired?

          NICOLE
     You're right. How does despised sound?

          PALOMINO
     Great!
          (laughs)
     What's it mean?

          NICOLE
          (laughs)
     It's sort of like I think you're a 
     piece of shit.

Palomino is somewhat startled by this. He looks to Nick in 
confusion. Nick silently encourages him to keep going.

          PALOMINO
          (another laugh)
     That sounds like the champagne 
     talking.

          NICOLE
     It's not. I really do think you are 
     a piece of shit.

          PALOMINO
     No, you don't. You love me.

          NICOLE
     The fuck I do. I can't stand looking 
     at you!

          PALOMINO
     Then I guess I have nothing else to 
     say.

          NICOLE
     No, I think you have a lot more to 
     say, Damian.

          PALOMINO
     Well, I am surprised you feel this 
     way, Ellen. I always thought you 
     admired --

          NICOLE
     That's not what I meant. You should 
     tell everyone what you just told 
     Nick behind the set.

          PALOMINO
     Hey, this isn't part of the scene.

          NICOLE
     Say it anyway: The reason this scene 
     isn't working is because you and I 
     slept together last night. Did 
     everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad 
     last night!

Nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement.

          PALOMINO
     See, Nick! I told you this was about 
     rejection!

          NICOLE
     You fucking scumbag! You think I 
     give a rat's ass about you?! I was 
     there to get laid and even that was 
     a joke!

          PALOMINO
     You know, you are really starting to 
     piss me off!

          NICOLE
     Oh, does that mean you're not going 
     to come wiggle on the bed anymore, 
     or stroke my hair real soft and 
     concerned, or kiss me like a soap 
     opera acting piece of shit!

Palomino snaps, and lunges for Nicole. She leaps to the other 
side of the bed.

          NICOLE
     Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come 
     on!

Nick steps between Nicole and Palomino.

          NICK
     OK, guys, I think we can stop there.

          PALOMINO
     You bet your ass we can stop! Wanda, 
     call me a cab!

          NICK
     Hold on, Chad. Let's just try to 
     calm down.

          PALOMINO
     Fuck you. I'm out of here, man. This 
     movie is bullshit.

          NICK
     Now wait a second, Chad. There's no 
     reason for hostility.

          PALOMINO
     Shut up, you fucking loser. The only 
     reason I took this part was because 
     someone said you knew Quentin 
     Tarantino! You're nowhere, man.

          NICK
     Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of 
     your shit, you hostess twinkie 
     motherfucker!

          PALOMINO
     What'd you call me?

          NICK
     You heard me.

          PALOMINO
     Say it again.

          NICK
     You hostess twinkie motherfucker!

Palomino suddenly punches Nick in the stomach, leaving him 
bent over and gasping for breath. Nicole instantly leaps on 
Palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of 
his head. Palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as 
Wanda rushes forward.

          WANDA
     Alright, everyone just stop. Stop! 
     Stop this right now!

As she tries to separate Nicole and Palomino, Palomino shoves 
her hard, knocking her down. Instantly Wolf leaps off the 
camera and runs up to Palomino.

          WOLF
     Alright, you've asked for it, Chad!

Palomino suddenly punches Wolf in the teeth, dropping him 
like a stone.

          WANDA
          (shrieks)
     Wolf!

Suddenly Nick staggers to his feet and rushes at Palomino. 
His momentum knocks all three backwards onto the bed, 
Palomino's head cracking Nicole in the teeth.

          NICOLE
     Oh, God!

Nicole rolls free as Nick and Palomino wrestle on the bed. 
Nick gets Palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding 
his head against the mattress.

          NICK
     You want to pick my brain?! This is 
     the way I direct hostess twinkie 
     scumbags like you!

As Nick continues to pound Palomino's head the Gaffer notices 
Palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of 
Nick's forearm around his neck. He and the Boom man rush 
forward and finally manage to pry Palomino free.

          NICK
     Get him out of here! Someone take 
     him back to his hotel!

As the Gaffer and Boom man drag off the almost unconscious 
Palomino, the Scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him.

          SCRIPT
          (sniffling)
     Chad...

Suddenly, everything becomes quiet except for Nick's labored 
breathing and the Scriptgirl's sniffles. Nick leans over and 
touches Nicole's shoulder.

          NICK
     Are you alright?

          NICOLE
     Don't touch me.

EXT. DAY. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE SET

The Gaffer and AC help the still-groggy Palomino into the 
back of the production van. JEFF, the driver, watches them 
in sleepy curiosity.

With Palomino safely propped in a seat, the AC goes back to 
the set. The Gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out 
of his back pocket and slaps it into Palomino's motionless 
hand.

          GAFFER
     It's called "Tsunami." A Japanese 
     tidal wave hits New York. You've an 
     ex-Navy S.E.A L. frogman, working 
     undercover. You save the city. You'd 
     be perfect for the lead. That's my 
     number; call me, or I'll call you. 
     Either way it's been great working 
     with you, man.

As Palomino stares at him blankly, the Gaffer slams the door. 
The car pulls out.

INT. THE SET. DAY

Nick and Nicole are sitting up on the bed, alone on the now 
empty set.

          NICK
     Nicole, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. 
     You were great in that Richard Gere 
     movie.

          NICOLE
     Shut up. You're no different than he 
     is. You lie, you're deceitful...

          NICK
     I'm not lying. Christ, I tell everyone 
     how great you are. I've got nothing 
     but respect and admiration for you.

          NICOLE
     Oh God, now you're doing your own 
     fucking script.

          NICK
     Well, why do you think I wrote it?!

          NICOLE
     I have no idea!

          NICK
     It's about you. It's about how I 
     feel about you.

          NICOLE
     Christ, did you get a bump on your 
     head, Nicky. 'Cause you're talking 
     like an idiot.

          NICK
     Nicole. I've loved you since the day 
     we met.

Nicole sits for a long moment in stunned silence.

          NICOLE
     Why didn't you tell me?

          NICK
     I didn't want anything to get in the 
     way of us working together.

          NICOLE
     God, and all this time I thought...

Nick and Nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss.

INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN

Nicole snaps awake with a jolt. She glances quickly at the 
clock which reads 4:35. The sound of the shower still running 
in the bathroom.

          NICOLE
     Oh, God.

Nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. As the 
camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right 
against the lens, turning the image to total BLACKNESS.

The frame is BLACK. The recognizable clatter and clunk of 
the FILM CREW is heard. Wanda's voice is prominent.

          WANDA
     Don't go out that door!

Suddenly a DOOR opens away from camera and the AC stops, a 
foot away from the lens. Behind him, Wanda and the rest of 
the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming. 
We see now the door and the plywood walls around it are FAKE.

INT. THE SET. DAY

          AC
     Why not?

          WANDA
     It's part of the set, goddamnit. Now 
     go around.

          AC
     Next time. This is an emergency.

The AC rushes past and a moment later the camera DOLLIES 
slowly through the fake door toward Wanda pacing near the 
set camera.

          WANDA
          (into her walkie)
     Has Ellen showed up yet?

          WALKIE
     ssss... kkkkkrrk.

          WANDA
     Get her into wardrobe right away.

          WALKIE
     ssskk... ssssrrrk?

          WANDA
     No! Scene six; Scene five has been 
     postponed. I'm not going to say it 
     again; Mr. Palomino is not working 
     today. Now where is that smoke 
     machine!

INT. SET BUILDING, HALLWAY. DAY

The AC bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and 
walks quickly toward the camera. Without knocking he pushes 
open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short.

          AC
     Oh. Sorry.

Standing on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off 
the running faucet is, TITO a DWARF. He is dressed in a sky 
blue tuxedo with tails. A top hat and white gloves rest on 
the closed toilet seat. Tito appears extremely annoyed.

          TITO
     What do you want?!

          AC
     I need to use the bathroom. Kind of 
     an emergency.

          TITO
     Well, fucking knock!!

Tito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall, the 
AC staring after him in astonishment.

          TITO
          (muttering)
     I swear to Christ, one of these days 
     I'm going to punch somebody in the 
     balls!

INT. WARDROBE ROOM. DAY

Camera is close on Nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin 
white veil is placed on her head. Camera pulls back to reveal 
SACHIKO, the Costume Designer putting the finishing touches 
to Nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white 
wedding gown. Nick stands nearby, smoking.

          NICK
     Just as we pull up to your apartment 
     Palomino suddenly says he feels so 
     sick he can't work today.

          NICOLE
     God. Was it something he ate?

          SACHIKO
     Stand up, please.

          NICK
     I don't know.

          NICOLE
     Can he work tomorrow?

          SACHIKO
     Turn around, please.

          NICK
     Don't know that either. But I'm not 
     worrying about it. I had this dream 
     last night where I was on the set. 
     You were in it, and another woman, 
     someone older. Anyway, everything 
     was going wrong. The harder I tried 
     to hold things together the more 
     they fell apart. And you know what 
     that dream was telling me, Nicole? 
     You just got to roll with it. And 
     that's what I'm doing, I'm rolling 
     with it. So, we'll just shoot the 
     Dream Sequence today.

Just then Tito walks in.

          NICK
     Hey, Tito. You look great, man.

          TITO
     I feel like shit.

          NICK
     No, you look good. Thanks for coming 
     in on such short notice. This is 
     Nicole; she's playing Ellen.

          NICOLE
     Hello. Toto, is it?

          TITO
     Tito.

          NICOLE
     Oh, I'm sorry.

          NICK
     Listen, if there's anything I can do 
     to make you... if you need... uh, 
     just let me know.

          TITO
     Put a stool in the bathroom.

Tito walks out, followed immediately by Sachiko, leaving 
Nicole alone with Nick.

          NICK
     Did I just offend him?

          NICOLE
     What did you say?

          NICK
     "Short notice?"

          NICOLE
     Come on; that was nothing. I'm the 
     one who called him "Toto." Jesus, 
     I'm out of it. I dreamt I was on the 
     set last night too.

          NICK
     Oh yeah?

          NICOLE
     Yeah. You were in the dream.

          NICK
     Was I freaking out?

          NICOLE
     Actually, you were.

          NICK
     That's great: I freak out in my dream; 
     I freak out in your dream. No wonder 
     I'm fucking exhausted.

          NICOLE
     Nick...

          NICK
     Yeah?

Nicole stares at Nick for a long moment then smiles briefly 
and turns away.

INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY

A dented, ancient smoke machine squats forlornly in the middle 
of the set. WOLF (with eyepatch), the GAFFER, AC, BOOM MAN, 
and the SOUND MAN stand around it, scrutinizing it intently. 
Wolf seems in an unusually good mood.

          WOLF
     Alright, guys; special effects today. 
     Could be fun. Who knows how to work 
     this baby?

          GAFFER
     It's the old T-160. I used it once 
     in '85.

          AC
     Damn. '85.

          WOLF
     What's this?

          GAFFER
     That's where the gas goes.

          BOOM
     No, that's where the oil goes.

          GAFFER
     Is it?

          BOOM
     I think so.

          GAFFER
     You're right. It's coming back now.

          WOLF
     I'm going to let you handle this 
     one, Bob. This is your baby. And 
     Les, if he needs help you give him a 
     hand. OK, guys? We're all working 
     together today.

Wolf walks off. The Gaffer kneels to inspect the smoke machine 
closer.

          GAFFER
     Yup, all coming back now. Like riding 
     a bike. T-160, 1985. 1985, T-160.

          AC
     Way to go, Bob.

INT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA

Wanda stands alone by the camera, looking around at the 
bustling crew like a battalion commander watching her troops 
in battle. Nick approaches her.

          NICK
     How are we doing, Wanda?

          WANDA
     Not good, Nick. Not bad, but not 
     good. We need to finish this scene 
     and do Scene thirty-one today.

          NICK
     Scene thirty-one?! I left my notes 
     for Scene thirty-one at home! I didn't 
     know we were --

          WANDA
     Nick, Nick. I'll send someone to 
     your apartment to pick them up. Now, 
     relax.

          NICK
     Oh, OK. Send somebody to my apartment 
     to pick them up; it's the red 
     notebook, under the bed.

          WANDA
     It's taken care of, Nick.

          NICK
     Good. Great. Good.

Nick walks off quickly, muttering to himself. A moment later 
Wolf strolls up to Wanda.

          WOLF
     We're all lit, the smoke machine is 
     under control; we're ready to go.

          WANDA
          (hard)
     What about the dolly?

          WOLF
     Just need to see a run-through and 
     we're all set. I'm going to make 
     your job easy today, Wanda. Wandaful.
          (he slips his arm 
          around her)
     Mmm, I'm glad you wore that perfume. 
     And don't worry about Palomino; I'll 
     take you to a jazz club tonight.

          WANDA
     Oh, I can't make it. I have to go 
     see Chad; he's extremely ill.

          WOLF
     Oh, by the way my eye's much better.

          WANDA
     Listen, Wolf, this may not be the 
     best time to say this but our 
     relationship is going nowhere.

          WOLF
     What do you mean?

          WANDA
     Please, don't take it personally. 
     Because I care for you, Wolf, I really 
     do. But I've had this feeling for 
     quite a while and I think it's time 
     we ended it. OK?

          WOLF
          (pause)
     OK.

          WANDA
     I think it's better.

          WOLF
     So do I.

          WANDA
     Well, good. Still friends?

          WOLF
     Sure.

          WANDA
     Great, cause we still have to work 
     together and there's no reason it 
     has to be unpleasant. Give me a hug.

Wanda and Wolf move into an extremely wooden embrace.

          WANDA
     You're a real special guy, Wolf.

          WOLF
     Thanks.

Wanda slips Wolf a tender smile then walks away.

          WANDA
          (into her walkie)
     OK, let's get the A Team in please! 
     Nick, Ellen, Mr. Tito!

INT. THE SET. DAY

Nick is working with the crew and the actors. The set consists 
of two flats (one with the fake door) joined to make a corner. 
The flats are painted fire-engine red.

          NICK
     OK, here's the shot. We start wide 
     with Ellen standing absolutely still 
     right in the middle of the frame. 
     You got that, Wolf?

          WOLF
     Yeah.

          NICK
          (notices eyepatch)
     What happened to your eye?

          WOLF
     Nothing. It's a little sensitive 
     today.

          NICK
     Can you see?

          WOLF
          (snaps)
     Of course I can see!

For a moment Nick looks like he might snap back at Wolf but 
he draws a deep breath and continues.

          NICK
     OK, Ellen is standing there. The 
     smoke is flowing in and: Ellen's 
     line.

          NICOLE
     I am so hungry.

          NICK
     Good, Tito, that's your cue.

The fake door opens and Tito enters wearing his top hat and 
carrying a golden apple in his gloved hands.

          NICK
     You walk around her once, hold the 
     apple out, that's right; just beyond 
     her reach. You're staring at her 
     hard. Harder, good. Then stop right 
     here. Can we get a mark, please?

The AC moves up to Nick and places a piece of yellow tape on 
the floor. CU the yellow tape.

          NICK
     Then we dolly in to Tito's Close-up. 
     Alright, Wolf?

          WANDA
     It should be hand-held.

          NICK
     No, I think it's better on the dolly.

          WOLF
     Whatever.

          NICOLE
     Nick, do I see him?

          NICK
     No, just the apple. And Tito, right 
     after we dolly in give me a little 
     laugh there.

          TITO
     A little laugh?

          NICK
     Big, little; anything you feel like 
     doing. OK? Good. Let's shoot one. 
     Call it, Wanda.

          WANDA
     OK, here we go. Camera back to One. 
     Action on the smoke.

The Gaffer turns on the smoke machine which emits a pathetic 
wisp of smoke that immediately dissipates.

          WANDA
     And roll sound.

          NICK
     Hold it, Wanda. Can we get a little 
     more smoke? Is that possible?

          GAFFER
     Oh, sure.

The Gaffer adjusts a knob and another thin puff of smoke 
wheezes out.

          NICK
     Good. Call it, Wanda.

          WANDA
     Going for picture. Lock it up. And 
     roll sound.

          SOUND
     Speed!

          WANDA
     Roll camera!

          AC
     Rolling!

          CLAPPER
     Scene six, take one!

          NICK
     And, action.

INT. THE DREAM. TAKE ONE. DAY

Nicole stands motionless in the middle of the empty set. Her 
white wedding gown stands out sharply against the deep red 
walls. A sad shred of smoke drifts by her head.

          NICOLE
     I am so hungry.

Tito opens the door and walks in, staring hard at Nicole. 
His sky-blue tuxedo gleams in the rich light. He walks around 
her in a circle holding the golden apple just beyond her 
reach. He stops on his mark and the camera dollies into a CU 
of him. He doesn't laugh. Nick watches this for a moment in 
intense concentration.

INT. THE SET. DAY

          NICK
     And... cut.

          WANDA
     That's a cut. Nick; comments?

          NICK
     Yeah, just a couple. I thought that 
     was uh... good. Tito, that was very 
     good, man, really. You didn't feel 
     like laughing?

          TITO
     I laughed.

          NICK
     Oh, OK; I guess I missed it. You 
     could make it bigger if you want. 
     And Ellen, maybe just a little more 
     tension when you see him.

          NICOLE
     I thought I didn't see him.

          NICK
     Right, maybe you see him a little 
     bit.

          NICOLE
     Alright, I'm confused. Do I see him 
     or not?

          NICK
     You see him.

          NICOLE
     OK, what is the tension? Who is Toto?

          TITO
          (hard)
     It's Tito.

          NICOLE
          (alarmed)
     What did I say?

          TITO
     Toto.

          NICOLE
     Oh, God. I'm sorry, Tito. I don't 
     know why I'm doing that. I'm really 
     sorry.

          NICK
     Ellen, come on now; concentrate. 
     Remember; you're marrying Damian 
     tomorrow. You're a little anxious. 
     You have this dream. Let's call it 
     an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents 
     the anxiety.

CU Tito looking none too happy about this representation.

          NICK
     OK? It seems pretty simple.

          NICOLE
     Let's just try it.

          NICK
     Good. And Bob, let's really have 
     some smoke on this one.

          GAFFER
     OK, more smoke.

          WOLF
     I still think it should be hand-held.

          NICK
     Yeah, well, I don't want it hand-
     held. I want it on the dolly. Where's 
     my notebook, Wanda?

          WANDA
     On it's way, Nick.

          NICK
     Good. Call it, Wanda.

          WANDA
     Lock it up. Going for picture. And 
     roll sound.

          SOUND
     Speed!

          WANDA
     Roll camera!

          AC
     Rolling!

          CLAPPER
     Scene six, take two!

          NICK
     And, action.

INT. THE DREAM. TAKE TWO

Nicole stands motionless as a few more emaciated puffs of 
smoke hang in the air.

          NICOLE
     I am so hungry.

Tito enters, walks around her holding the apple just beyond 
her reach then moves to his mark. The camera dollies into a 
CU. He does not laugh.

INT. THE SET. DAY

          NICK
     Cut.

          WANDA
     That's a cut. Going again, Nick?

          NICK
     Yes.

          WANDA
     Going again, please stand by.

          NICK
     OK, Ellen, good. You're on to 
     something there.

          NICOLE
     No, something's not right. It all 
     feels fake to me.

Nick's tone with Nicole suddenly takes on an almost 
imperceptible edge, tinged with annoyance.

          NICK
     Well, it's not fake; it's real. Just 
     remember, you really want the apple. 
     Tito, I still think we could see 
     more of a laugh at the end.

          TITO
     What kind of laugh?

          NICK
     Just a laugh.

          TITO
     Show me.

          NICK
     Oh, OK. A laugh. I'm thinking maybe 
     like this. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Everyone watches Nick demonstrate the laugh. He seems unaware 
he resembles a drunken, slightly annoyed idiot.

          NICK
     Something like that. OK? And remember, 
     Tito, this is a dream. Not everything 
     has to make sense. A laugh right 
     there heightens our sense of... of...

          TITO
     Anxiety.

          NICK
     Exactly. Wolf, how was that for you?

          WOLF
     I still think it should be hand-held.

          NICK
          (snaps)
     Well, God damn it! It's not going to 
     be! It's on the dolly so just forget 
     about it!

There is a strained moment of silence on the set as everyone 
witnesses this rebuke.

          NICK
     And Bob, what the fuck is that smoke? 
     Might as well get a couple hamsters 
     in here blowing smoke rings for 
     Christ's sake.

          GAFFER
     The septic valve wasn't open. I got 
     it now. We're going to see some smoke 
     now.

          NICK
     Alright, let's try another take.

          WANDA
     And, lock it up.

          WOLF
     Nick, could I talk to you for a 
     minute?

          NICK
     What?!

          WOLF
     In private.

          NICK
          (sighs in exasperation)
     Alright.

Nick follows Wolf off the set.

          WANDA
     Release the lock-up. Everyone stand 
     by.

          GAFFER
     We'll see some smoke now.

          AC
     Way to go, Bob.

INT. A CORNER. DAY

As soon as Wolf and Nick reach the darkened corner, Wolf 
whirls to face Nick.

          WOLF
     I really don't like being spoken to 
     like that, Nick!

          NICK
     Yeah, well I don't like your attitude!

          WOLF
     I don't have an attitude!

          NICK
     The hell you don't! Every time I ask 
     you to do something all I get is No, 
     No, No and I'm sick of it! I hired 
     you to do a job; if you're not going 
     to do it you better let me know right 
     now!

Wolf is about to yell back at Nick when suddenly he stops 
and lets out a deep, painful sigh.

          WOLF
     I'm sorry, Nick. I'm going through 
     some heavy shit.

          NICK
     What do you mean?

          WOLF
     I can't really go into it. It's pretty 
     heavy.

          NICK
     Personal?

Wolf makes a slight motion with his head toward Wanda who is 
standing some distance away watching them. Seeing the two 
men looking at her Wanda shoots them a hard glare which 
prompts Wolf and Nick to turn away quickly.

          WOLF
     Personal, professional, emotional. 
     It's doing a number on me. And now 
     you're telling me you're going to 
     fire me.

          NICK
     I didn't say that, Wolf. Come on, 
     I'm not going to fire you. You're 
     doing a great job here.

          WOLF
     Am I?

          NICK
     Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without 
     you, man. You've got a great eye. I 
     just hope it's not the one under 
     that eyepatch.

Nick lets out a tense, strained laugh but Wolf's only response 
is to stare back at him sadly.

          NICK
     Listen, Wolf. Let me tell you one 
     thing I've learned; sometimes you 
     just have to roll with things. You 
     know?

          WOLF
     You're right.

          NICK
     Roll with it, man. You'll be OK.

Wolf lets out another deep sigh.

          WOLF
     Thanks, bro.

INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY

The Gaffer, Boom man, and AC kneel around the smoke machine. 
A can of gas and a quart of oil stand beside them.

          BOOM
     That's where the oil goes.

          GAFFER
     No, that's where the gas goes.

          BOOM
     I'm tellin' you, Bob. That's where 
     the oil goes.

          SOUND
     Lester, don't you think Bob knows 
     where the oil goes?!

          GAFFER
     I don't remember using oil in '85.

          AC
     Maybe both the oil and gas go in 
     there?

The Gaffer and Boom man turn and look at the AC for a long 
moment.

          BOOM
     I think he's right.

          GAFFER
     I think he is too. OK, three parts 
     gas, one part oil.

The Gaffer and Boom man pour liberal amounts of gas and oil 
into the T-160.

INT. THE SET. DAY

Nick rushes up to his position by the camera.

          NICK
     Is my notebook here yet, Wanda?

          WANDA
     Any minute, Nick.

          NICK
     Good. Call it, Wanda.

          WANDA
     Going for picture. Lock it up. And 
     roll sound.

          SOUND
     Speed!

          WANDA
     Roll camera!

          AC
     Rolling!

          CLAPPER
     Scene six, take three!

          NICK
     And, action.

INT. THE DREAM. TAKE THREE

Nicole stands motionless in her white wedding dress, looking 
genuinely alarmed, possibly because of the huge clouds of 
smoke now spewing out of the panting smoke machine.

          NICOLE
     I am so hungry.

Tito enters, stares at her hard and walks around her in a 
circle holding the apple just beyond her reach. The smoke is 
so thick both of them are barely visible. Just as Tito gets 
to his mark the smoke machine backfires with a tremendous 
explosion and begins filling the room with dense, blinding 
smoke.

INT. THE SET. DAY

The smoke blanks out the entire frame. Frantic shouts are 
heard from unseen bodies.

          NICK
     Cut! Cut! Cut!

          WANDA
     Turn it off! Turn it off!

          GAFFER
     I can't find the switch!

          WOLF
     Pull the plug! Bob! Pull the plug!

          WANDA
     Open the door! Get some water!

          GAFFER
     I got it! I got it!

The smoke machine emits a loud hiss and dies, filling the 
room with sudden silence. Slowly the smoke begins to clear 
as the crew moves around muttering and coughing.

          WANDA
     Clear the set! Ellen! Tito! Please 
     step off the set!

          TITO (V.O.)
     I'm off the set!

          NICOLE (V.O.)
     So am I.

          WANDA
     Then who is that? Who is that? Please 
     step off the set!

A pair of fuzzy-slippered feet enter the smoky frame. The 
camera BOOMS up, passing over a woman's bare shins, a 
flowered, blue silk housecoat until finally coming to rest 
on the pleasantly smiling face of CORA. This is the same 
woman who played Ellen's Mother in Part One; she is dressed 
exactly the same as she was in their scene. The camera pulls 
back to reveal JEFF the Intern standing nervously beside her 
with a red notebook in his hands.

          CORA
     Hi, Nicky.

Nick gapes in utter astonishment.

          NICK
     Mom!

INT. THE SET PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY

Wanda speaks urgently into the phone while Nicole stands 
beside her. Jeff (still wearing his hat) waits at a distance 
clutching Nick's red notebook.

          WANDA
     Cora Reve, R-E-V-E. Blue housecoat, 
     blue slippers. How do I know? Because 
     she's sitting ten feet away from me. 
     Well sweetheart, that's going to be 
     a real fucking problem.

Nicole turns away and walks past Jeff to the Craft Service 
table.

          JEFF
     She was waiting outside Nick's 
     apartment when I went to pick up his 
     notebook. She said she was looking 
     for him so I figured I should just 
     bring her up here. You look really 
     pretty in that dress.

Nicole nods politely then looks to the Makeup corner where 
Nick sits talking earnestly to his mother.

INT. MAKEUP CORNER

          NICK
     How did you get here?

          CORA
     I took a bus in; went right to your 
     apartment.

          NICK
     How did you get out of your room?

          CORA
     Oh, I just went right through the 
     door.

          NICK
     It was unlocked!?

          CORA
     No, it was locked. I just went through 
     it. It's something I've learned to 
     do, Nicky. I can walk through just 
     about anything; like air.

          NICK
     Mom, you've got to stop doing this. 
     I'm serious. I'm a little upset with 
     you. You could have gotten lost, or 
     hurt.

          CORA
     I wanted to see you. I've missed 
     you.

          NICK
     I know, Mom; I've missed you too. 
     But it's not really a good time.

Nicole approaches, holding up the hem of her wedding gown. 
There is a subtle tension smoldering between her and Nick.

          NICOLE
     They're sending a car. It should be 
     here in a couple of hours. They didn't 
     even know she was gone.

          NICK
     Jesus, I don't believe this.

          CORA
     I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was 
     going to be a wedding I would have 
     worn my fucking hat.

INT. THE SET. DAY

The camera holds on Tito pacing slowly, alone on the set. He 
is smoking fiercely, holding his top hat with one hand. 
Suddenly he begins laughing in a loud, stage bellow.

INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY

Nick sets a chair for his mother and helps her sit down. 
Nicole joins Tito on the set and talks quietly to him.

          NICK
     There. How's that, Mom? Can you see?

          CORA
     Is the little fellow going to do 
     gymnastics?

Tito glances up at her quickly.

          NICK
     Shhhh! No. Now come on, Mom. You've 
     got to be quiet. Absolutely quiet. 
     OK?

          CORA
          (whispers)
     OK.

INT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY

Wanda and Wolf stand beside each other in tense, awkward 
silence for a long moment.

          WANDA
     How are you doing?

          WOLF
     Good; real good.

Wolf looks as if he's about to burst into tears as Nick walks 
up.

          NICK
     How's the smoke machine?

          WANDA
     It's dead, Nick. I've got calls out 
     to every Effects house in the city 
     but I just can't seem to locate --

          NICK
     Forget it. We'll shoot without it.

          WANDA
     But Nick, it's a Dream Sequence.

          NICK
     That's the way it goes, Wanda. We're 
     just going to have to roll with it. 
     Nothing else we can do. We've got to 
     roll with it, right, Wolf?

Wolf meets Nick's eyes and gives an extremely melancholy 
nod. Nick turns to address Nicole and Tito and the edge 
immediately slips back into his voice.

          NICK
     OK, here we go. Ellen, you've got to 
     keep reaching for that apple. I don't 
     feel that you really want it. I mean, 
     Christ, how many times do I have to 
     tell you!

Nicole glares at Nick for a moment then abruptly turns and 
walks off the set. Nick stares after her in confusion then 
quickly follows her.

          WANDA
     Everyone stand by. Nobody move. Going 
     again, right away.

EXT. STREET. NYC. DAY

Nicole stands with her back to the camera as Nick strides up 
to her with impatience.

          NICK
     Alright, Nicole. What's the matter?

          NICOLE
     You tell me! You're the one with the 
     bug up your ass!

          NICK
     Now wait just a second!

          NICOLE
     You've been picking on me all day! I 
     can't do anything right!

          NICK
     I'm sorry if I was short with you, 
     Nicole, but I think you can see I'm 
     under a little pressure here. I'm 
     shooting a Dream Sequence without a 
     smoke machine, my mother's out there 
     thinking she's at a circus wedding 
     and you tell me the whole movie seems 
     fake!

          NICOLE
     I never said that!

          NICK
     You did too. You said, "Everything 
     feels fake."

          NICOLE
     I meant me! I feel fake! Everything 
     I'm doing feels fake. I can't act. I 
     should just do shower scenes in 
     Richard Gere movies for the rest of 
     my life!

          NICK
     Nicole, that's ridiculous. You're a 
     fantastic actress. All you have to 
     do is show me you want that apple 
     more than anything else in the world; 
     don't give up. Understand? You cannot 
     give up.

          NICOLE
     OK.

Suddenly Wanda yells out.

          WANDA
     Ready, Nick?!

          NICK
     Ready!

INT. THE SET. DAY

Nick rushes back onto the set.

          NICK
     OK, here we go. Everybody focus, 
     concentrate. And Tito, we're still 
     looking for that little laugh, pal. 
     OK? Call it, Wanda!

          WANDA
     Picture's up. There will be no smoke 
     in this scene. No smoke. No smoke in 
     the Dream Sequence. And roll sound.

          SOUND
     Speed!

          WANDA
     Roll camera!

     And, action.

INT. THE DREAM. TAKE FOUR. DAY

Nicole stands motionless in her wedding gown.

          NICOLE
     I am so hungry.

Tito walks in, stares at her hard, then walks around her 
once with the golden apple just beyond her outstretched hands. 
He stops and the camera dollies into his CLOSE-UP. Nick 
watches in hopeful expectation. He waits and waits but Tito 
does not laugh.

Just then the door in the rear set wall opens and Cora steps 
in, looking oddly puzzled.

          CORA
     Oh, I thought this was the TV room.

INT. THE SET. DAY

          NICK
     Cut!

          WANDA
     That's a cut. Going again, right 
     away.

INT. OFF THE SET. DAY

Nick escorts his mother back to her chair.

          NICK
     Mom, listen to me. I don't want you 
     to move from this chair. Do you 
     understand?

          CORA
     Oh Jesus, you sound just like your 
     father...

          NICK
     Mom, I'm serious.

          CORA
     OK, OK. I won't move.

          NICK
     Thank you.

INT. THE SET. DAY

Nick walks back on the set and addresses Nicole and Tito.

          NICK
     OK, good. Very good.
          (laughs)
     Tito, I think we're having a little 
     communication problem here. All I 
     want you to do is laugh. OK?

          TITO
     Why?

          NICK
     I told you why.

          TITO
     Tell me again.

INT. OFF THE SET. DAY

Wolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly 
in a chair beside Cora. He does not speak to her and gazes 
blankly out at Nick, Tito, and Nicole on the set some distance 
away. Cora however stares at the side of his head with such 
intensity Wolf can't help but turn to her.

Cora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares 
even more intently into his eye.

Wolf glances away for a moment then looks back. Cora continues 
to stare at him. Suddenly, his eye is full of tears. Cora 
watches in rapt silence. Wolf is crying openly now. Cora 
reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently 
lifts the eyepatch off of his eye. A tight smile of 
satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is 
released, streaming quickly down Wolf's cheek. No one sees 
this.

INT. THE SET. DAY

Nick paces tensely in front of Nicole and Tito.

          NICK
     Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal. 
     It's a dream, alright. Strange things 
     happen in a dream. All you have to 
     do is laugh. Why is that such a 
     problem?

          TITO
     Why does it have to be a dwarf?

          NICK
     What?

          TITO
     Why does my character have to be a 
     dwarf?

          NICK
     He doesn't have to be a dwarf.

          TITO
     Then why is he?! Is that the only 
     way you can make this a dream; put a 
     dwarf in it?

          NICK
     No, Tito; that's not --

          TITO
     Have you ever had a dream with a 
     dwarf in it?! Do you know anyone 
     who's had a dream with a dwarf in 
     it? NO! I don't even have dreams 
     with dwarves in them! The only place 
     I've seen dwarves in dreams is in 
     stupid movies like this! Make it 
     weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone 
     will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a 
     dream, there's a fucking dwarf in 
     it!" Well, I'm sick of it. You can 
     take this Dream Sequence and shove 
     it up your ass!

Tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks 
out. Everyone stares at Nick who is frozen in stunned silence. 
Finally Wanda approaches him hesitantly.

          WANDA
     Nick?
          (no response)
     I can get right on the phone. We'll 
     try to get another... small person 
     here as soon as possible.

          NICK
     No. He's absolutely right.

Nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence. 
Wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes.

          WOLF
     You want to just shoot Ellen, Nick? 
     She could be in the dream by herself.

          NICK
     No. We're not going to shoot anything. 
     I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help, 
     but it's over. I can't take it 
     anymore. I tried to roll with it but 
     it's time to face the music; I can't 
     do this. I am not a director. The 
     shoot is over. I give up.

Nick's speech has the simple eloquence of truth; he is not 
bitter or self-pitying. He seems unaware of how disturbing 
this is to the crew. They all stand around him in shock, 
afraid to move or speak. Finally Wolf turns to the AC and 
puts his hand on his shoulder, like a father to his young 
son.

          WOLF
     Take the camera off the dolly. Start 
     putting it away.

Everyone watches the AC unfasten the camera in silence. Nicole 
stands alone on the set in her wedding dress, still holding 
the golden apple. Her face is frozen in dismay. Suddenly 
CORA comes through the set door and marches up to Nicole.

          CORA
     Give me that apple!

At the sound of his mother's voice, Nick looks up. He sees 
her snatch the apple from Nicole's hand and march back out 
the door, closing it behind her.

          CORA
          (behind the door)
     I'm ready, Nick!

INT. BY THE CAMERA. DAY

Nick gets up slowly and whispers intensely to Wanda, Wolf, 
and the rest of the crew.

          NICK
     Roll camera. Roll sound. Let's go. 
     Right away.

Wolf grabs the camera and puts it on his shoulder (hand-held) 
as the rest of the crew moves quickly and silently into 
position. On a terse signal from Nick the camera starts 
rolling.

INT. THE SET. THE DREAM. DAY

Nicole takes the silent "action" cue from Nick.

          NICOLE
     I am so hungry.

Right on cue Cora walks through the door, holding the golden 
apple out in front of her. She circles Nicole with 
determination, seemingly oblivious to Nick and the rest of 
the crew hovering behind Wolf as he begins following her 
with the hand-held camera. Wolf is now in his element; gliding 
like Nureyev with the camera. When he pans suddenly with 
Cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera 
range.

Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly. 
Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of Nicole. 
Wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing CU 
of the apple with Nicole seen behind it. Nicole reaches out, 
grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it.

CU Nick's face, eyes wide in anxious delight.

Cora takes one step forward. CU her fuzzy slippers stopping 
right on the yellow tape mark. Cora waits momentarily until 
Wolf has reframed both her and Nicole, then lets out a huge 
laugh.

INT. THE SET. DAY

          NICK
     And cut!!

General mayhem erupts on the set.

          NICK
     Wolf, talk to me, man! Did you get 
     it?

          WOLF
     Got it, Nick! Everything!

          NICK
     The Close-up?

          WOLF
     Perfect. See? That's what I meant 
     about going hand-held!

          NICK
     You're a genius, man! What about the 
     focus?!

          AC
     Nailed it.

          WOLF
     Fuckin' A!

Wolf slaps the AC's palm, then the Gaffer's standing right 
beside him. He turns gleefully to the next person but seeing 
it is Wanda he rigidly turns away.

          WANDA
     Going again, Nick?

          NICK
     How was the sound?

          SOUND
     I could use another but definitely 
     acceptable.

Nick runs up to his mother and throws his arms around her. 
Nicole stands beside him.

          NICK
     Mom, you kook! That was incredible! 
     Did you know we were filming?

          CORA
          (testily)
     Of course I knew you were filming.

          NICK
     You were great, you're a natural. 
     And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't 
     you dare tell me that felt fake.

Suddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, Nick and 
Nicole embrace. Just then Wanda steps up.

          WANDA
     Going again, Nick?

          NICK
     Oh, hold on. Let me think a second.

The set grows suddenly quiet as Nick begins pacing rapidly, 
muttering to himself.

          NICK
     Can I use it for the Dream Sequence, 
     that's the question. Does it work 
     for the Dream Sequence?

Nick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him; 
Nicole in her wedding gown, Wolf with his eyepatch, his mother 
still eating the apple, Wanda, the crew.

          NICK
     We're going with it, Wanda!

          WANDA
     Alright everyone, listen up. That is 
     a wrap on Scene Six.

The set erupts in applause.

          SOUND
     Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

          WANDA
     What?!

          SOUND
     I need to record room tone. I'll 
     need thirty seconds of silence.

          WANDA
     Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!! 
     Thirty seconds of room tone. The 
     sooner you're quiet the sooner we're 
     done.

          CORA
          (whispers to Nick)
     What's room tone?

          NICK
     It's for the sound, Mom. We just 
     have to be quiet.

At that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a 
DOCTOR and NURSE enter. The Nurse carries an extra overcoat. 
Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be 
quiet.

          WANDA
     And roll sound. Nobody move.

          SOUND
     Speed.

INT. THE SET. DAY

The camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew. 
Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues. 
As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually 
changes. One by one people drift into their own private worlds 
of reflection.

MS the Sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his 
stopwatch. Behind him the Boom man holds the mike in position 
to record general ambiance while staring off into the 
distance.

CU the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision.

CU the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds 
have passed.

MS Nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm 
casually over Nick's shoulder. Nick glances up and sees Nicole 
beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts. Suddenly she looks 
up and her eyes meet Nick's. She slips him the barest hint 
of a smile.

The camera DOLLIES slowly through the standing, silent group, 
passing over faces in different degrees of thought.

CU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing 
ten seconds have passed.

MS Nick. He is so immersed in thought he looks at no one. 
The camera slowly DOLLIES into a CU of him.

INT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY

CHAD PALOMINO stands at a gleaming podium, looking radiant 
in an immaculate tuxedo. He holds an envelope in his hands.

          CHAD
     We have a new category this year: 
     Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being. 
     And the winner is none other than my 
     Best Bud, Nick Reve!

Amid thunderous applause Nick bounds on the stage and accepts 
an Oscar from Chad. He stands grinning like an idiot as the 
applause continues.

INT. THE SET. DAY

MS Nick, still wrapped in thought, his lips starting to form 
the same idiotic smile. MS Nicole. The camera DOLLIES slowly 
into her face, now tinged with a slight uneasiness.

INT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT

Wide shot at the counter. Nicole stands facing a large bald 
man with his back to the camera. She is wearing a cheap pink 
waitress uniform and has her hair under a hairnet.

          MAN
     Had any experience?

          NICOLE
     I was an actress for a while.

She pulls her headshot out of her shoulder bag and hands it 
to the man with a hopeful smile. He flips over the headshot 
and looks at her credits with confused annoyance.

          MAN
     Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger?

          NICOLE
          (doubtfully)
     Probably.

INT. THE SET. DAY

MS Nicole. She jerks her head slightly in response to this 
moment of thought.

CU the stopwatch, showing fifteen seconds have passed.

MS Wolf. The camera begins a slow DOLLY into his CU.

INT. WANDA'S APT. DAY

Wolf stands like Thor in the middle of the Red Set, his arms 
crossed over his chest, his jaw set in determination. Smoke 
billows around him. At his feet, dressed in Nicole's wedding 
gown, Wanda sobs hysterically.

          WANDA
     Wolf, I'm sorry! Please forgive me! 
     I love you, Wolf! Please! Give me 
     one more chance. Let me prove it! I 
     love you! I love you, Wolf!

Wolf remains unmoved for a long moment. Finally he reaches 
out with a forgiving smile and pats Wanda's head.

INT. THE SET. DAY

MS Wolf. He glances furtively at Wanda with a trace of hope 
still in his eyes.

MS Wanda, looking off. The camera DOLLIES into her CU.

INT. A CHEAP HOTEL ROOM

This is the same hotel room from Part Two, in which we saw 
Nicole and Chad Palomino. At the moment Wanda and Chad lie 
panting in the sweat-soaked sheets.

          WANDA
     What I love about you, Chad, is you're 
     not afraid of my power.

          CHAD
     Oh God, Wanda! I love your power. 
     It's like an afferdesiac to me!

INT. THE SET. DAY

MS Wanda. She shifts slightly and glances quickly around 
her. Her smile is tinged with the hint of sexual pleasure.

MS the Gaffer, frowning, absorbed in thought. The camera 
DOLLIES into a CU of him.

INT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT. DAY

Suddenly, a CU of an incredibly beautiful hamburger being 
placed in a toasted bun on a gleaming white oval plate. A 
hand places a garnish of parsley on it then carries the plate 
to the lunch counter. Camera PANS to reveal the GAFFER sitting 
on the stool. He picks up the hamburger and takes a huge 
bite out of it. This shot holds for quite some time as he 
continues to chew.

INT. THE SET. DAY

MS The Gaffer. A hopeful, delicious smile spreading over his 
face.

CU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing 
twenty seconds have passed.

MS Cora. She gazes serenely out before her.

INT. NURSING HOME. DAY

In the pale afternoon light, Cora stands in the middle of 
her drab, barren room. She appears to be staring at the door. 
Suddenly she begins striding toward it. Effortlessly, easily, 
she walks right through it.

INT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY

Nick still stands at the podium with his Oscar.

          NICK
     In closing I'd like to say to all 
     the people who told me not to make 
     this movie, who wouldn't meet with 
     me or return a simple phone call. To 
     my favorite professor at Film School 
     whose parting advice to me was to 
     take a job teaching at a women's 
     college. To Delores DelSporto, the 
     girl I loved in high school who left 
     me for a Jr. Varsity football player: 
     to all these people I'd like to say 
     thank you but I can't because what I 
     really feel like saying is go fu --
     !!

INT. THE SET. DAY

MS Nick, his head and body jerking in a sudden spasm. He 
finishes the last word of his speech in a choked whisper and 
the Sound man frowns hard at him.

CU the Sound man's stopwatch showing twenty-five seconds 
have passed. The camera stays on the watch until the final 
five seconds have elapsed.

          SOUND
     And, that's a cut on room tone.

The room erupts with activity. Everyone moves and talks at 
once. Nick whispers something to Nicole then runs off.

          WANDA
     OK, strike the set. Props! Art 
     Department! Redress for Scene thirty-
     one. Let's go! Right away people! 
     Nick! Nick! Anyone seen Nick?!

WS the set. Suddenly the fake door closes right into the 
lens, turning the frame completely BLACK.

END CREDITS.

                    THE END
