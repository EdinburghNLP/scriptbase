at it helplessly as Grant strangles him and they drop to the ground.

Behind them, the lights of Spectre House go on, revealing the MEN OF THE
SPECTRE PARTY, standing on a terrace.  The men walk forward.

GRANT

rises retracting the garrote into his watch.  He looks up to see

MORZENY

approaching followed by the other men.

GRANT

stands at attention as Morzeny reaches him holding a watch.

MORZENY

	(to Grant)

Exactly one minute, fifty-two seconds.  That's excellent.

BOND

lies motionless on the ground.  Morzeny's hand reaches down and pulls a
mask off his face, revealing an UNIDENTIFIED MAN who has been disguised
as Bond.  TILT UP to reveal Morzeny and Grant walking away toward the
house.

				CUT TO:

THE MAIN TITLES

A BELLY DANCER performs as the credits are projected across various
parts of her body.

INT. CHESS ROOM - VENICE HOTEL

A scoreboard reads:

VENICE INTERNATIONAL

GRANDMASTERS CHAMPIONSHIP

MATCH	FINAL

Czechoslovakia	WHITE	BLACK	Canada

  KRONSTEEN	11 1/2	11 1/2	MACADAMS

PULL BACK to reveal KRONSTEEN ('No. 5') and MACADAMS sitting across from
each other at a chess table, the 1st and 2nd UMPIRES, an ATTENDANT and
SPECTATORS.  Kronsteen smokes a cigarette and flicks an ash into an
ashtray.

KRONSTEEN

moves his white knight and takes Macadam's black bishop, setting it
beside many other black pieces.

Kronsteen

Check.

Kronsteen clicks a timer.

OVER KRONSTEEN'S SHOULDER

Macadams looks thoughtfully at the board.

ANGLE ON THE SCOREBOARD

1st UMPIRE

Knight takes bishop.

The Attendant moves a corresponding white piece on the scoreboard.

ATTENDANT

Knight takes bishop.

EXTREME WIDE ANGLE

The spectators look on murmuring.  A WAITER approaches the table with a
tray containing two glasses.

CLOSER

The waiter sets a glass in front of Macadams then turns to Kronsteen and
puts a glass of water and a mat in front of him.

STILL CLOSER

Kronsteen stares at the waiter, whose hand still grips the glass.  The
hand backs away and Kronsteen picks up the glass and the mat.  He starts
to drink then looks through the glass.  We hear the clock still ticking.

KRONSTEEN'S POV - THE GLASS AND MAT

Seen through the bottom of the glass on the mat are the words:

'YOU ARE REQUIRED

AT ONCE.'

KRONSTEEN

sets the glass down and dabs the mat against his lips.  Meanwhile
Macadams looks at the chessboard.  Kronsteen tears up the mat.

OVER KRONSTEEN'S SHOULDER

Macadams moves a black chess piece and clicks the timer.

ANGLE ON THE SCOREBOARD

1ST UMPIRE

King to rook two.

The Attendant moves a corresponding black piece.

ATTENDANT

Macadams and clicks the timer.

OVER KRONSTEEN'S SHOULDER

Macadams studies the chessboard.

ANGLE ON THE SCOREBOARD

The Attendant moves a corresponding white piece.

1st Umpire

Queen to king four.

Attendant

	(repeating)

Queen... to king four.

WIDE ANGLE

The spectators murmur in anticipation.

MACADAMS

studies the board.

Kronsteen

stares back at him, eyes unmoving.  Macadams' hand reaches forward and
touches the top of the black king.

OVER KRONSTEEN'S SHOULDER

Macadams tips over his king onto the table.

KRONSTEEN

stares at him.

OVER KRONSTEEN'S SHOULDER

Macadams rises.

MACADAMS

My congratulations, sir.  A brilliant coup.

Macadams holds out his hand as the spectators applaud.  Kronsteen rises
and shakes it.

HIGH ANGLE - CRANE SHOT

Kronsteen releases Macadams' hand and, as we CRANE DOWN, walks away from
the table.  A SPECTATOR reaches out to give him a handshake but
Kronsteen ignores him and keeps walking.

				DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BLOFELD'S ('NO. 1') YACHT - WIDE ANGLE - DAY

The yacht rests in a bay.

EXT. BLOFELD'S CABIN - SAME TIME

A GUARD with a machine gun over his shoulder comes downstairs, Kronsteen
following and looking around.  The guard rings a doorbell to Blofeld's
cabin.  Kronsteen looks back and sees a SECOND ARMED GUARD coming down
the stairs.

INT. BLOFELD'S CABIN - SAME TIME

ROSA KLEB is looking into a desktop aquarium.  She moves backwards
looking down at it.

BLOFELD (O.S.)

Siamese fighting fish.  Fascinating creatures.  Brave, but on the whole,
stupid.

KLEB'S POV - THE AQUARIUM

Three fish swim in it.

BLOFELD (O.S.)

Yes, they're stupid.

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD'S LAP

A white cat rests in his lap and he pets it.

BLOFELD (O.S.)

Except for the occasional one such as we have here...

CLOSE SHOT - AQUARIUM

The fish swim around each other and then, in quick cuts, fight each
other.

BLOFELD (O.S.)

...who lets the other two fight while he waits... waits until the
survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself.

KLEB

watches the aquarium.

CLOSE SHOT - AQUARIUM

The fish continue to fight.

BLOFELD (O.S.)

And then, like SPECTRE, he strikes.

CLOSE-UP - KLEB

KLEB

I find the parallel -- amusing.

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD'S CAT

Blofeld handles the cat.

BLOFELD (O.S.)

Our organization did not arrange for you to come over from the
Russians...

ANGLE ON KLEB OVER BLOFELD

BLOFELD

	(continuing)

...just for amusement, Number Three.

CLOSE SHOT - CONSOLE

Blofeld pushes one of four buttons on his desk.

[END OF REEL 1.  START REEL 2.]

BLOFELD'S POV - KLEB

stands in f.g. as a door behind her opens and Kronsteen enters.

BLOFELD

Come in, Kronsteen.  Sit down, Number Three...

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD'S CAT

He continues to stroke it.

BLOFELD

... while we listen to what Number Five has devised for us.

CLOSE-UP - KLEB

KLEB

I hope Kronsteen's efforts as Director of Planning will continue to be
as successful as his chess.

CLOSE-UP - KRONSTEEN

KRONSTEEN

They will be.  According to your instructions, I have planned for
SPECTRE to steal from the Russians their new Lektor decoding machine. 
For this we need the services of a female member of the Russian
cryptograph section in Turkey and  - - uh  - - the help of the British
Secret Service.

CLOSE-UP - KLEB

Listening, she looks up at Kronsteen.

Kronsteen (O.S.)

	(continuing)

Naturally, neither the Russians nor the British will be aware...

CLOSE-UP - BLOFELD'S CAT

He continues to pet it.

KRONSTEEN (O.S.)

	(continuing)

...that they are now working for us.

BLOFELD (O.S.)

Number Three, is your section ready to carry out Kronsteen's directives?

CLOSE-UP - KLEB

KLEB

Yes, Number One.  The operation will be organized according to
Kronsteen's plan.  I have selected a suitable girl from the Russian
Consulate in Istanbul.  She's capable, cooperative, and her loyalty to
the State is beyond question.

WIDE ANGLE OVER BLOFELD AT KLEB AND KRONSTEEN

BLOFELD

And you're absolutely sure she believes you're still...

CLOSE-UP - BLOFELD'S CAT

He continues to stroke it.

BLOFELD

	(continuing)

... head of operations for Soviet Intelligence?

CLOSE-UP - KLEB

KLEB

It is most unlikely she would know I'm now working for SPECTRE.  Moscow
has kept my defection secret from everyone but a few members of the
Presidium.

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD'S CAT

As he stroke it:

BLOFELD

For your sake, I hope so.

BLOFELD'S POV - KLEB AND KRONSTEEN

Blofeld (O.S.)

Kronsteen, you're sure this plan is foolproof?

Kronsteen

	(tapping a cigarette

	 against its case)

Yes, it is, because I have anticipated every possible variation of
counter-move.

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD'S CAT

As he strokes it:

Blofeld

But what makes you think that 'M,' the head of British intelligence,
will oblige you by falling in with your plan?

CLOSE-UP - KRONSTEEN

KRONSTEEN

For the simple reason that it is so obviously a trap.

	(he starts to put the

	 cigarette into his

	 mouth then lowers it)

My reading of the British mentality is that they always treat a trap as
a challenge.  And in any case, they couldn't possibly pass up even the
slightest chance of getting their hands on a Lektor decoder.  They have
wanted one for years.

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD'S CAT

As he strokes it:

Blofeld (O.S.)

Um-hmm.  All that you say could be true.  What else?

CLOSE-UP - KRONSTEEN

KRONSTEEN

As an added refinement, I think that SPECTRE would probably have the
added chance of a personal revenge for the killing of our operative,
Doctor No.  Because the man the British will almost certainly use on a
mission of this sort would be their agent, James Bond.

ANGLE OVER BLOFELD AT KLEB AND KRONSTEEN

BLOFELD

Let his death be a particularly unpleasant and humiliating one.

Kronsteen

Good.  I shall put my plan into operation straightaway.

KLEB

looks at Kronsteen.

KRONSTEEN

KRONSTEEN

And there will be no failure.

				CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - GRANT

Naked but for shorts, he lies face-down on a towel on grass.  He glances
up.

A FEMALE MASSEUSE

in a skirt approaches.

GRANT

closes his eyes.

MEDIUM SHOT - GRANT AND MASSEUSE

She sets a bag down then turns away and unbuttons and removes her shirt,
revealing large breasts in a bra.  She pulls down her skirt, revealing
shorts, and turns toward Grant.

She kneels, picks up a container of ointment then looks up.

A HELICOPTER

hovers overhead.

MEDIUM SHOT

The masseuse massages Grant's back.

THE HELICOPTER

lands in front of SPECTRE House.

CLOSER ANGLE

Morzeny and other SPECTRE men, including RHODA, approach the helicopter
as it lands.

MORZENY

Hurry.

Kleb emerges from the chopper.

MORZENY

	(to Kleb)

Welcome to SPECTRE Island.  A great honour.  I hope you had a pleasant
flight.

CLOSER - MORZENY AND KLEB

KLEb

My time is limited.  Is the man I requested ready?

Morzeny hands her a file.

Morzeny

His dossier.

Kleb

Good.

Kleb look at the file.

Kleb

Donald Grant, convicted murderer.  Escaped Dartmoor Prison in nineteen
sixty.  Recruited in Tangier nineteen sixty-two.  Excellent!  Where is
he now?

Rhoda turns to Morzeny.

RHODA

At the Lake.

Morzeny

Bring him to my office, will you?

Morzeny touches Kleb's elbow as if to escort her; she backs away
repulsed.

Kleb

Take me to the Lake.

Morzeny

	(pointing)

Through the training area.

MOVING SHOT

Kleb, Morzeny and Rhoda walk across the grounds.

Morzeny

This Grant's one of the best men we've ever had.  Homicidal paranoiac,
superb material.  Though his methods were a little crude, his response
to our training and indoctrination have been remarkable.

EXT. KILLING SCHOOL - MOVING SHOT

Kleb, Morzeny and Rhoda walk along a series of galleries where men fire
at targets.  Other men in judo garb break cinder blocks in f.g.  In
another gallery, a man fires a flame-thrower at a running man.  Two men
fight with knives.  In yet another gallery, men practice judo.

Morzeny

I hope our work here meets with your approval?

Kleb

Training is useful, but there is no substitute for experience.

Morzeny

I agree.  We use live targets as well.

WIDE ANGLE

Kleb, Morzeny and Rhoda walk away as the mayhem continues.

				DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LAKE

The threesome approach around a grove of trees and turn to face the
Lake.

Grant reclines on his back as the masseuse works on one of his arms.  A
trampoline and barbell lay nearby.  The masseuse looks up at the
visitors.

Kleb takes a step forward.

KLEB

Call him.

Morzeny

Grant!

Grant jumps to his feet and stands attention.  Kleb looks at him then
removes her purse from her shoulder.

Grant walks up to the visitors.  He stops in front of Kleb and stands at
attention.  Kleb circles him, looking him over.  As she does, she puts
on a knuckle duster.

When Kleb arrives in front of Grant again she suddenly punches him hard
in the stomach.  He barely flinches.

Kleb

He seems fit enough.  Have him report to me in Istanbul in twenty-four
hours.

Kleb immediately turns and walks off, Morzeny and Rhoda following.

				DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ISTANBUL - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

Minarets in f.g., a mosque and the Bospherous beyond.

EXT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - DAY

A sign on an outer wall reads:

    CCCP USSR

CONSULATE GENERAL

A PORTER holds open a wrought-iron gate and three embassy women emerge
onto the sidewalk  - - a striking blonde, TATIANA ROMANOVA (known as
TANIA), and her friends IRINA and NATASHA.  Tania holds a piece of
paper.

Irina

	(in Russian)

Are you sure you don't want to come with us?

Tania

	(in Russian)

I have some shopping to do.

Natasha

	(in Russian)

We'll see you later as the hostel.

Irina

	(in Russian)

Don't be late.  Goodbye for now.

Tania

	(in Russian)

Goodbye for now.

Natasha

	(in Russian)

Goodbye for now.

Irina and Natasha walk away.  Tania turns, looking at the piece of
paper, and walks off.

				DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - KLEB'S HOTEL - DAY

Tania walks up a cobblestone path to a policeman and shows him the piece
of paper.

Tania

	(in Turkish)

Can you show me this house?

The policeman points further up the path.

POLICEMAN

	(in Turkish)

It's the first door on the left.

Tania continues up the narrowing path toward the hotel, which looks more
like a sinister tenement.

THROUGH AN ARCHWAY

Tania approaches the hotel, stops, looks at the paper again, looks
around, then turns up a flight of stairs.

ON THE STAIRS - MOVING SHOT

Tania continues up the stairs then turns down a walkway.  Suddenly a
man's shadow crosses a pillar in f.g.  He stops behind it and watches. 
It's Grant, in a suit and tie.

Tania stops at a door and knocks.

AT THE DOOR

MOVE IN on the door as it opens with a creak, revealing Kleb.  She wears
a Russian uniform.

INT. KLEB'S ROOM - WIDE ANGLE

Tania stands on the threshold.

Tania

Corporal of State Security Tatiana Romanova.

KLEB

	(matter-of-factly)

Come in.

Tania enters the room.  We crane down and in as Kleb shuts the door and
follows her down a flight of stairs into an office.  It contains a desk
and a chair.  Kleb sits behind the desk.

Kleb

You know who I am?

Tania

Colonel Kleb.  Head of operations for -- for SMERSH.  I saw you once in
Moscow when I worked for the English decoding crew.

Kleb

Did you tell anyone at the Consulate you were coming here?

Tania

No, the message said --

Kleb

Yes, yes.  I know.  I sent it.

INTERCUT - TANIA AND KLEB

Tania stands watching her, uncertain.

Kleb dons a pair of black-rimmed glasses and opens a dossier on her
desk.

Kleb

Your work record is excellent.  The State is proud of you.

Tania

Thank you, Comrade Colonel.

Kleb

Take off your jacket.

Tania is surprised, then unbuttons and removes her jacket.

Kleb

Turn around.

Tania obediently pivots around.

Kleb

Umm.  You are a fine-looking girl.

Tania glances down diffidently.

Kleb

	(politely)

Sit down.

Tania sits in the chair and keeps looking at Kleb, who continues to scan
the dossier.

Kleb

I see you trained for the ballet.

Tania

But I grew an inch over regulation height, and so...

Kleb

And then you have had three lovers?

[Tania looks off shocked.

Kleb

Did you enjoy their attention?]

Tania

	(showing her anger)

What is the purpose of such an intimate question?

Kleb explodes, cracking a short whip against her desk.

Kleb

You are not here to ask questions!  You forget to whom you are speaking!
 [Did you enjoy it?]

Tania

	(softens then smiles)

I was in love.

Kleb

And if you were not in love?

Tania

	(thinks deeply, then

	 smiles again)

I suppose that would depend... on the man.

Kleb

Sensible answer.

Kleb rises from her desk.

WIDER ANGLE

We see now that Tania is sitting with her legs crossed and her skirt is
raised revealing her knee.

Kleb walks to her holding a photograph, hands it to her then sits on the
edge of the desk holding the whip.

Kleb

This man, for instance.

Tania

	(studying the photo)

I cannot tell.  Perhaps if he was kind and kulturny.

Kleb

Corporal...

Kleb rests a hand on Tania's knee but withdraws it at Tania's look of
distaste.  DOLLY IN CLOSER to them.

Kleb

...I have selected you for a most important assignment.  Its purpose is
to give false information to the enemy.  If you complete it successfully
you will be promoted.  From now on you will do anything he says.

Tania

And if I refuse?

Kleb

Then you will not leave this room alive.

Tania looks at her aghast, then regains her composure.

Tania

I will obey your orders.

ANGLE ON KLEB

She rises from the desk, then we PAN on her as she crosses behind Tania.

Kleb

Good.  Now these are your instructions.  You report to me here.

Tania

Yes.

Kleb

But the Consulate security man must not know that I am in Istanbul. 
This is classified far above his level.

Tania

I will say nothing to anyone.

DOLLY OUT as Kleb steps toward her.

Kleb

If you do, you will be shot!

	(she cracks the

	 whip hard against

	 the chair, then

	 softens)

Come, come, my dear.

	(she strokes Tania's

	 shoulder)

You are very fortunate to have been chosen for such a simple, delightful
duty.

	(her hand moves up

	 to stroke Tania's

	 hair)

A real labour of love... as we say.

DOLLY IN to Tania looking down at the photograph.

				DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RIVER - DAY

A punt glides by with a MAN and YOUNG WOMAN inside.  He is piloting.

man

Great sport, this!

YOUNG WOMAN

What did you say?

Man

Great sport, this punting!

The punt continues off.  TILT DOWN TO REVEAL another punt, resting on
the shoreline beneath a tree.  Inside are Bond and SYLVIA, embracing and
kissing.  An ice bucket and glasses are beside it.

Bond

I couldn't agree with him more.

Sylvia

I might even give up golf for it.

Bond

Really?

He tugs on a cord that extends between his toes into the water, pulling
up a bottle of champagne.  He touches it.

Bond

Not quite.

He lowers the bottle again.  Sylvia notices something on his back  - -
a scar.  She runs her finger across it.

Sylvia

Ooh!  Souvenir from another jealous woman?

He turns back and slips an arm around her.

Bond

Yes, but I haven't turned my back on one since.

He fully embraces her and they kiss.  Suddenly a BEEPER goes off.  Bond
looks back, disheartened.

Bond

Excuse me.

Sylvia

What?

He reaches into his coat pocket and switches off the device.

WIDER ANGLE

Bond climbs out of the punt with his jacket, then turns back.

Bond

Give me my shirt, will you?

Sylvia

	(tossing it to him)

What's going on?

Bond

I have to make a phone call.

PAN ON BOND as he walks to his car  - - a classic green convertible.

Sylvia (O.S.)

	(calling)

But we haven't eaten yet!  I'm starving!

Bond opens the driver's door and picks up a phone while raising his
shirt.

Bond

	(into phone)

Come in, Univex.  James Bond here.  Over.

INT. MISS MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

She sits holding her phone and with her other hand taps a cigarette
against a file on her desk.

MISS MONEYPENNY

He's been asking for you all morning.  Where in the world are you,
James?

[END OF REEL 2.  START REEL 3.]

MEDIUM SHOT - BOND

He is in his shirt now, buttoning it.

BOND

Well, I've just been reviewing an old case.

SYLVIA

approaches in a huff.  PAN on her as she walks to Bond.

Sylvia

Oh, so I'm an old case now, am I?

Bond

Shh!  It's the office.

	(into phone)

Err... tell him I'm on my way, will you?

Sylvia snatches the phone from him.

Sylvia

	(into phone)

He is not on his way.

Bond

	(taking the phone

	 back)

Sylvia, behave!  We'll do this again some other time, soon.

	(he keeps buttoning

	 his shirt)

Sylvia

Do what?  The last time you said that you went off to Jamaica.

	(she undoes one of

	 his buttons)

I haven't seen you for six months.

He slaps her hand.

Bond

	(into phone)

I'll be there in an hour.

INTERCUT - MISS MONEYPENNY

She now holds a lit cigarette.

Miss Moneypenny

Hey, your old case sounds interesting, James.

INTERCUT - BOND AND SYLVIA

Sylvia has completely unbuttoned Bond's shirt.

Bond

	(into phone)

Er... make that an hour and a half.

He returns the phone to its cradle as Sylvia quietly claps her hands
together.  Bond passes her and raises the convertible top.  DOLLY IN
till it conceals him and Sylvia and the screen goes black.

Bond

Now, about that lunch...

Sylvia

	(giggling)

Hmm-hmm.

FADE IN:

INT. A DOOR - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The door opens to reveal Bond dressed in a suit and tie and holding his
hat.  As he enters, PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT. MISS MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE

Unseen by Bond, 'M' stands with Miss Moneypenny at a filing cabinet
behind the door.  'M' holds a file marked 'SECRET.'  They look up.

Bond tosses his hat at a hat-rack and it lands perfectly on a hook.  He
turns to Miss Moneypenny and begins to close the door.

Bond

For my next miracle, I...

'M' comes into view.  Bond stops cold.  The others just look at him. 
Chagrined, Bond gently leans against the door to shut it the rest of the
way  - - and it creaks loudly.

Wordlessly, 'M' nods to Bond to follow him.  PAN ON THEM as they cross
the room and pass through an open doorway into 'M's' office.  BOOTHROYD
['Q'] stands just outside the office holding a briefcase and waiting. 
Bond closes a padded door behind them.

Miss Moneypenny

	(to Boothroyd)

It'll be a miracle if he can explain where he's been all day.

INT. 'M's OFFICE

'M' walks toward his desk, Bond following having just closed the padded
inner door.

Bond

But I've never even heard of a Tatiana Romanova.

'M'

Ridiculous, isn't it?

Bond

It's absolutely crazy.

'M'

Of course, girls do fall in love with pictures of film stars.

'M' stops behind his desk and gestures to Bond to sit.

INTERCUT - BOND AND 'M'

Bond

But not a Russian cipher clerk with a file photo of a British agent. 
Unless she's, uh... mental.

'M'

Mmm.

Bond

No, it's some sort of trap.

'M'

	(filling his pipe)

Well, obviously it's a trap, and the bait is a cipher machine.  A brand
new Lektor.

Bond

A Lektor, no less.  The C.I.A.'s been after one of those for years.

ANGLE ON 'M'

over Bond's shoulder.  'M' lights his pipe and sits.

'M'

Yes.  So have we.  When she contacted Kerim Bey, head of Station T,
Turkey, and told him she wanted to defect, she said she'd turn it over
to us, on one condition:  that you went out to Istanbul and brought her
and the machine back to England.

	(he takes a photo

	 from the file)

Here's a snapshot Kerim managed to get of her.

BOND

takes the photo, glances at it absently, then looks up.

Bond

Well, I don't know too much about cryptography, sir, but, uh... a Lektor
could decode their top secret signals.  The whole thing's so fantastic,
it just could be...

	(he finally looks

	 at the photo and

	 catches himself)

...true.

INSERT - THE PHOTO

shows Tania standing at a railing aboard a ship with one hand raised
provocatively, holding her hair back.

'M' (O.S.)

Hmm.  That had occurred to me.

BOND

continues to look at the photograph

'M' (O.S.)

Besides, the Russians haven't been up to any tricks recently.

Bond

Well, really, I'm not too busy at the moment, sir.

INTERCUT - BOND AND 'M'

'M'

You're booked on the eight-thirty plane in the morning.  If there's any
chance of us getting a Lektor, we simply must look into it.

Bond

Suppose when she meets me in the flesh, I don't come up to expectations?

ANGLE ON 'M'

over Bond's shoulder.

'M'

Just see that you do.

He presses a switch on his intercom.

'M'

Miss Moneypenny, ask the Equipment Officer to come in, please.

	(he releases the switch)

Q Branch has put together a smart looking piece of luggage for us.

ANGLE ON THE PADDED DOOR

Boothroyd enters carrying the briefcase.  PAN ON HIM as he walks to the
desk, to include Bond and 'M'.

'M' (O.S.)

We're issuing this to all double-o personnel.

Boothroyd nods to Bond and sets the briefcase on the desk.  Bond rises
to face him.

Boothroyd

An ordinary black leather case...

	(tilts it up and points

	 to two buttons on

	 its back edge)

... with twenty rounds of ammunition here and here.

Boothroyd presses one of the buttons and a narrow tube pops up.  Bond
does the same to the other button and another tube pops up.

MEDIUM SHOT - BOND AND BOOTHROYD

Boothroyd

	(indicating the tube)

Now, if you take the top off, you'll find the ammunition inside.

Bond opens the top and drops a couple of bullets into his hand, then
returns them to the tube.  Meanwhile Boothroyd turns the briefcase the
other way around.

Boothroyd

In the side here: flat throwing knife.

CLOSE SHOT - THE BRIEFCASE

Boothroyd's hand enters.

Boothroyd (O.S.)

Press that button there...

	(he presses a release

	 and a knife pops

	 out)

... out she comes.

Bond's hand enters and takes the knife.

MEDIUM SHOT - BOND AND BOOTHROYD

Boothroyd opens the briefcase and sets it down flat.

Boothroyd

Inside the case...

CLOSE SHOT - THE BRIEFCASE

The inside is bright red and contains what looks like part of a rifle. 
Boothroyd's hand picks it up.

Boothroyd (O.S.)

...you'll find an AR Seven folding sniper's rifle.

	(he pulls the heel

	 off the grip,

	 revealing a barrel

	 hidden inside)

Point-two-five calibre, with an infra-red telescopic sight.

He reattaches the heel and sets the rifle beside the briefcase.  Then he
pulls on a strap connecting the case's lid to its body.  A hidden strap
comes out of the inner lining and gold sovereigns are embedded in it.

Boothroyd

Then, if you pull out these straps, inside are fifty gold sovereigns. 
Twenty-five in either side.

He slides the strap back into the lining.

TIGHT TWO-SHOT - BOND AND BOOTHROYD

Boothroyd

Now watch very carefully.

	(he reaches down)

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - THEIR TORSOS

Boothroyd takes a tin of talcum powder from his pocket.  It bears the
trademark 'Club.'

Boothroyd (O.S.)

An ordinary tin of talcum powder.  Inside, a tear gas cartridge.

TWO-SHOT

Boothroyd

That goes in the case against the side...

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - THE BRIEFCASE

DOLLY IN as Boothroyd's hand attaches the tin to the inside of the case.

Boothroyd (O.S.)

... here, like that.  It's magnetized so it won't fall.

His hands shut the case and close the catches.

Boothroyd

Shut the case.

TWO-SHOT

Boothroyd

Now, normally to open a case like that...

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - THE BRIEFCASE (BOND'S POV)

Boothroyd's thumbs rest on the catches.

Boothroyd (O.S.)

... you move the catches to the side.

	(his thumbs move

	 sideways without

	 touching the catches)

If you do, the cartridge will explode -- in your face.

TWO-SHOT

Boothroyd

Now, to stop the cartridge exploding...

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - THE BRIEFCASE (BOND'S POV)

Boothroyd's fingers twist the catches sideways.

Boothroyd

... turn the catches horizontally, like that.  Then open normally.

His thumbs open the catches and the briefcase pops open.

TWO-SHOT

Boothroyd

Now you try it.

MEDIUM CLOSE-UP - 'M'

Pipe in his mouth, 'M' looks up at Bond, removes the pipe and blows out
smoke.

MEDIUM TWO-SHOT - BOND AND BOOTHROYD

Bond moves behind the upright case and lays his fingers the catches.

Bond

Hmm.  Turn the catches...

	(twisting them)

...like that...

Boothroyd

That's right.

Bond

And open ordinarily.

Bond snaps the briefcase open then grins in satisfaction.

Boothroyd

You've got it?

Bond

Yes, I think so.

Boothroyd

	(to 'M', off)

Is that all, sir?

'M' (O.S.)

Yes, thanks very much.

Boothroyd

Right.  Thank you.

Boothroyd exits as Bond closes the briefcase.

Bond

That's a nasty little Christmas present.  But I shouldn't think I'll
need it on this assignment, sir.

CLOSE-UP - 'M'

'm'

All the same, take it with you.

WIDE ANGLE OVER 'M's SHOULDER

'm'

Good luck, Double-o-seven.

Bond

Thank you, sir.

Bond heads for the door.

CLOSE-UP - 'M'

He returns the pipe to his mouth and looks down at the file.

INT. MISS MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Bond enters from 'M's office flipping the padded door shut behind him. 
PAN WITH HIM as he walks to Miss Moneypenny's desk and sets the
briefcase down.

Bond

'Once more into the breach, dear friends.'

Miss Moneypenny holds up an airline ticket.

Miss Moneypenny

And one plane ticket.

Bond sits on the edge of her desk and takes the ticket from her.  SLOW
DOLLY IN to tight two-shot as they talk.

Miss Moneypenny

Lucky man. I've never been to Istanbul.

Bond

You've never been to Istanbul?

Miss Moneypenny

No.

Bond

	(leaning toward her)

Where the moonlight on the Bospherous is irresistible.

Miss Moneypenny

	(rising and touching

	 her forehead to his)

Maybe I should get you to take me there some day.  I've tried everything
else.

Bond

Darling Moneypenny, you know I never even look at another woman.

Miss Moneypenny

Oh, really, James?

Bond

Uh-huh.  Let me tell you the secret of the world...

	(he leans back to

	 her ear)

Just then her intercom buzzes.

CLOSE SHOT - INTERCOM

Miss Moneypenny's finger switches it on.  PULL BACK TO MEDIUM TWO-SHOT
of Bond and Miss Moneypenny.

'M' (over intercom)

Miss Moneypenny, ask Double O Seven to leave the photograph.  I'm sure
he'll recognize the lady when he sees her.

Miss Moneypenny holds out her hand.  Bond takes out Tania's photograph
and sets it on her palm.  Then he picks up a pen.

CLOSE SHOT - THE PHOTOGRAPH

Bond's hand writes the words 'WITH LOVE,' then adds above it 'FROM
RUSSIA.'

MEDIUM TWO-SHOT

Bond picks up the briefcase and steps off the desk.

MISS MONEYPENNY

	(watching him go)

Good luck.

Bond

	(passing in front

	 of her)

Ciao!

Miss Moneypenny

Ciao!

INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE - REVERSE TRUCKING SHOT

Bond, wearing a grey suit and holding his briefcase, walks through the
lounge, surrounded by other passengers.

He passes a CHAUFFEUR who stands holding a glass at a drink tray manned
by a DRINK SELLER.  The chauffeur sports a mustache and wears a grey
suit, black tie, cap and gloves.

CHAUFFEUR

Chauffeur

Kerim Bey sent a car for you, sir.

Bond

Oh, fine.

	(reaches into his

	 coat and takes out

	 a cigarette case)

Can I borrow a match?

Chauffeur

I use a lighter.

Bond

	(opening the case

	 to reveal cigarettes)

It's better still.

Chauffeur

Until they go wrong.

Bond

	(shutting the case)

Exactly.

Bond gestures to the chauffeur to move on.

Chauffeur

I'll get the car, sir.

The chauffeur walks off.  Bond follows in REVERSE TRUCKING SHOT,
returning the cigarette case to his pocket.  Bond walks off and we HOLD
on a man in b.g. watching him  - - HASSAN.  Hassan steps forward,
staring after him.

EXT. TERMINAL BUILDING - LONG SHOT - SAME TIME

Bond follows the chauffeur to a black Rolls Royce waiting at the curb. 
Meanwhile we see Grant's face reflected in the driver's door mirror of a
car in f.g., watching them.  He raises a gloved hand to his mouth.  PAN
TO GRANT.  He chews on one of the gloved fingers.

BOND'S ROLLS ROYCE

PAN ON IT as it drives away, then HOLD on the front of the terminal. 
Hassan emerges watching it go.  A black Citreon car pulls up.  Hassan
climbs into the passenger seat.

WIDE ANGLE - ENTRANCE TO TERMINAL

The Citreon drives away.

INT. ROLLS ROYCE - DRIVING - DAY

The chauffeur is in f.g., Bond behind him in the back seat.  Bond waves
his hat across his face against the heat.  Through the rear window we
see the Citreon following.

Chauffeur

Kerim Bey suggested that you see him before going to the hotel, sir. 
Would that be convenient?

Bond

Fine.

Bond glances back, sees the Citreon following, then looks forward again
and continues fanning his face with his hat.

EXT. ISTANBUL STREET - SAME TIME

PAN ON THE ROLLS as it drives on.  Then hold on ancient ruins in b.g. as
the Citreon passes following it.

I suppose it's customary to have people trailing you in these parts.

Chauffeur

Oh, yes, sir.  Today it's Citreon H-three-one-eighty-four on duty.

		(MORE)

Chauffeur (cont'd)

They are Bulgarians working for the Russians.  They follow us, we follow
them.  It's a sort of understanding we have.

Bond

That's very friendly.

EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

CRANE BACK ON THE ROLLS as it swings over toward the Grand Bazaar and
stops.

THE CITREON

MEDIUM LONG SHOT - A COBBLESTONE STREET

Bond and the chauffeur walk down the street.  PAN ON them as they walk
into the bazaar.

INT. GRAND BAZAAR - SAME TIME

PAN ON THEM as the chauffeur leads Bond through the Bazaar.  It is
filled with people and Bond glances back at some of them.  They continue
past us and walk off.

HASSAN

stands in a passageway drinking a cup of coffee and watching them.

HASSAN'S POV - BOND AND THE CHAUFFEUR

They turn into a shop where Turkish rugs hang outside.

INT. SHOP (STUDIO SEQUENCE) - SAME TIME

The chauffeur leads Bond through the shop to a door covered by a hanging
tapestry.  Salesmen are showing rugs to customers.

CLOSER ANGLE

The chauffer pulls a cord which retracts the tapestry, revealing a door.
 He opens the door to reveal an office.

Bond starts to step inside but stops, seeing KERIM'S MISTRESS within. 
She is picking up a hat, dons it and walks toward the doorway
straightening the shoulder of her blouse.  DOLLY BACK as she exits past
Bond pulling her skirt down and straightening her hat.

Bond steps into the office followed by the chauffeur.

KERIM (O.S.)

Ah, my friend, come in!

INT. KERIM'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

well-appointed with curtains, pillars, and a large bed with a golden
cover that KERIM BEY is straightening.  He turns to Bond.

KERIM

Come in!  Glad to see you!  Welcome to Istanbul!

Kerim walks to Bond and shakes his hand, then PAN ON THEM as they walk
to Kerim's desk.

Bond

Oh, thank you for sending the car, but, uh  - - it does rather tie you
in with me.

Bond sits in a chair across from the desk.  Kerim picks up a yellow
plastic cigarette holder and a wooden cigarette box.

Kerim

You are in the Balkans now, Mr. Bond.  The game with the Russians is
played a little differently here.  In the day-to-day routine matters we
don't make it too difficult to keep a tab on each other.

Kerim holds out the box to Bond.

ANGLE ON BOND

Bond

	(taking a cigarette

	 from the box)

So I gathered from your chauffeur.  He's a rather intelligent young man,
by the way.

Bond lights the cigarette.

KERIM

steps back behind his desk.

Kerim

He should be.  He's my son.

Kerim picks up a bell and rings it.

ANGLE ON BOND

He puffs on the cigarette.

KERIM (O.S.)

Coffee?

Bond

Medium sweet.

A YOUNG MAN enters through the doorway behind him.

CLOSE SHOT -  KERIM

Kerim

Two, medium sweet.

ANGLE ON BOND, KERIM IN F.G.

The young man nods and shuts the door.

KERIM

He also is my son.

INTERCUT - BOND AND KERIM

Kerim sits at his desk, his cigarette burning in the yellow holder.

KERIM

All of my key employees are my sons.  Blood is the best security in this
business.

Bond

You must have quite an establishment here.

KERIM

Biggest family payroll in Turkey.  Not bad for a man who started life
breaking chains and bending bars with his teeth in a circus.  But let's
talk about this business of yours.

BOND

Well, 'M' thinks I'm wasting my time here.

Kerim

And so do I.

	(points to his nose)

This is an old friend of mine.  And it tells me something smells.

Bond

Maybe.  But if there's a chance of getting a Lektor...  Now you tell me.
 Where can I contact this girl?

Kerim

She said she would make her own arrangements.  You'll just have to wait.

A knock sounds at the door.

Kerim

	(rising)

Ah!

[END OF REEL 3.  START REEL 4.]

A YOUNG MAN

walks in carrying a tray containing two demitasse cups.  PAN on him as
he walks to Kerim's desk and sets the tray down.

Kerim

Thank you.

The young man exits.  Kerim sets his cigarette in an ashtray, hands Bond
a cup and takes the other cup.

Kerim

My friend, if you really want my advice...

DOLLY IN on Kerim.

Kerim

... you should spend a few pleasant days with us here in Istanbul,
then... then go home.

				DISSOLVE TO:

him.

Bond

James Bond.  You have a reservation for me.

Concierge

Ah, Mister Bond.  Your room is ready.

	(to the receptionist)

Number thirty-two.

The concierge rings a bell.  A PORTER walks up and takes the suitcase
from the chauffeur.

FEMALE ASSISTANT

	(to the porter)

Thirty-two for Mister Bond.

Concierge

	(to Bond)

Hope you enjoy your stay.

Bond

Thank you.

The chauffeur tips his hat to Bond, then Bond and the porter cross the
lobby and enter a lift.  The doors close.

				WIPE BOTTOM TO TOP TO:

INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY

The porter opens the door for Bond.  Bond enters, crosses the room and
drops his briefcase on the bed.  He hears the porter clear his throat
and turns back.

Porter

Will there be anything else, sir?

Bond slips some cash into his pocket.

Bond

No, only this.  Thank you.

Bond turns to the bathroom door.  The porter peeks at the money.

Porter

Thank you, sir.

The porter exits.

Bond opens the bathroom door and looks inside, then turns to a painting
on the wall and looks behind it, then walks to another painting and
looks behind it.  Then he crosses the room, glances at a clock, then
looks behind another painting.  On the wall behind it are a microphone
and a cord.

BOND

backs away, continuing to look around.  He sees a chandelier overhead,
walks under it and turns it around, then steps forward and looks at:

INSERT - A PHONE

resting on the nightstand.

BOND

turns up his briefcase, moves the catches sideways and opens it.  He
takes out a test instrument and picks up the phone.

INSERT - PHONE

Bond places the instrument beneath it.  The meter rises and crackles.

BOND

drops the phone onto the bed and picks up the receiver.

BOND

Mister Bond here.

Receptionist's VOICE

Yes?

Bond

I'm afraid the room won't do.

RECEPTIONIST'S VOICE

I'm sorry.

BOND

The bed's too small.

INTERCUT - FRONT DESK

RECEPTIONIST

	(into phone)

One moment, sir.

She turns to the concierge, who stands in a back room holding a
receiver.  A WOMAN sits behind him at a console wearing headphones.

Receptionist

	(to the concierge)

Did you hear that?

Concierge

Tell him that's all there is, unless he would like the Bridal Suite.

The concierge raises the receiver to his ear.

Receptionist

	(into phone)

I'm sorry, sir.  That's all we have available, except the Bridal Suite.

INTERCUT - SITTING ROOM

Bond

	(into phone)

Well, let's have a look at it.  I may like it.

INTERCUT - FRONT DESK

The receptionist cups her hand over the receiver and looks back at the
concierge.  He nods to her.

Receptionist

	(into phone)

The porter will show it to you.  He will be up immediately.

She rings the bell.  The concierge walks up to her.

Concierge

Good.

INTERCUT - BOND

He cups his hand over the mouthpiece, hears a click, grins tightly and
hangs up.

THE DOORMAN

walks to the Citreon, suddenly sees something and pulls the back door
open.

which was leaning against the door falls forward.

INT. GREEN CAR - DRIVING - SAME TIME

Grant sits in back with Kleb.

Kleb

Good work.

drops the string of pearls from her mouth.

Kerim's Mistress

Ali Kerim Bey.

ANGLE ON KERIM	

He sits unmoved, continuing to write.

THE MISTRESS

gets up, straightens her skirt, walks over to Kerim and puts her hands
around him.

Kerim's Mistress

You're not glad to see me this morning, sirree?

Kerim

	(annoyed)

Overjoyed.

KERIM'S MISTRESS

I... I no longer please you?

Kerim

Be still.

Giving up, he slaps the file down on his lap then sets it on a table.

Kerim

	(rising)

Back to the salt mines.

KERIM

walks toward the bed unbuttoning his jacket.  From behind, his mistress
removes it.  [MISTAKE:  She starts further away.]

Kerim turns.  She wraps her arms around him and they kiss.  Suddenly an
explosion occurs which bathes them both in red.  She screams and they
fall.

KERIM'S DESK

one leg broken crashes to the floor as smoke envelops it till the image
turns black.

FADE IN:

handkerchief.

BOND

Well, who won?

Kerim

I had visitors.

CLOSER ANGLE

PAN ON KERIM as he moves the table to one side and sets it down.

Kerim

Limpet mine on the wall outside, timed to catch me at my desk.  But by
good fortune, I was relaxing on the settee for a few moments.  The girl
left in hysterics.

Bond

	(grinning)

Found your technique too violent?

Kerim

I cannot understand this sudden breach of the truce.  It is unlike our
Russian friends to break the peace this way.

Bond

It's most inconsiderate.  I think my visit might have something to do
with it.

Kerim

Let's try and find out.

Kerim walks off; Bond follows.

KERIM'S SHOWROOM - SAME TIME

DOLLY BACK as Kerim leads Bond into the showroom, grabs a flashlight
from the wall and goes to a door covered by a tapestry.  Kerim pulls a
cord, withdrawing the tapestry to reveal a door which he opens.

Kerim

Bond goes through the doorway, Kerim follows and shuts the door.  An
ASSISTANT walks up and retracts the tapestry.

INT. UNDERGROUND CISTERN

Bond and Kerim walk down a flight of stairs.

Bond

Quite a place you've got here.

Kerim

The Emperor Constantine built it as a reservoir sixteen hundred years 
ago.

Bond

Really?

	 flashlight)

Here.

Kerim unties a boat, they get in (Bond sitting and Kerim standing), and

Kerim

He pulls a tarpaulin off a periscope.

Kerim

A present from your navy.

CLOSER TWO-SHOT

Kerim raises the periscope and wipes the lens with his handkerchief.

Kerim

Our friends were turned out while the Public Works Ministry conducted a
survey.  The story was that the heavy traffic was shaking the
foundations.  By the time the place was declared safe, I had this
installed.

Bond

I can see everything 'M' said about you is right.

Kerim

Or, why I stay in this mad business?

Bond

Well, it could be that you find selling rugs a bore.

Kerim

My friend, you should be a mind reader.

Kerim looks into the periscope.

KERIM'S POV - A CONFERENCE ROOM

GENERAL VASSILI, KOSLOVSKI, BENZ and another MAN sit at a conference
table.

Kerim

Head of the table is General Vassili, Director of Military Intelligence.
 On his left, Koslovski, Chief of Security.  Opposite him, Benz, one of
his agents.

He pans the periscope to one side.

Kerim

I can't see the face of the other man  - - the one the general is
shouting at.

BOND AND KERIM

Kerim steps back and Bond looks through the periscope.

Bond

He's giving him a hell of a blowing up for something.

BOND'S POV - THE CONFERENCE ROOM

Bond pans across the room.

KERIM (O.S.)

It's too bad we can't hear as well as see.

BOND AND KERIM

Bond

Tell me, does our girl Romanova ever come to this room?

Kerim

Sometimes with messages.

BOND'S POV - THE CONFERENCE ROOM

Koslovski leans back in his chair, revealing the other man.

Bond (O.S.)

I can see the face of the other man now.

BOND AND KERIM

Bond steps back and Kerim looks through the periscope again.

Kerim

	(exclaiming)

Krilencu!

KERIM'S POV - THE CONFERENCE ROOM

KRILENCU, an evil-looking man with a mustache, is speaking vociferously.

Kerim

So he's back!  Another Bulgarian they use as a killer.

BOND AND KERIM

Looking up at them from a LOWER ANGLE

Kerim

Just the man for that limpet mine job.  I have had trouble with him
before.  But he's stayed away from Istanbul for over a year now.  Take a
look  - - you should remember him.  This man kills for pleasure.

Bond looks through the periscope.

BOND'S POV - THE CONFERENCE ROOM

Krilencu is still talking, then suddenly stops and looks at the door
which is opening.

Bond (O.S.)

Nice face.  - - Just a moment...

A smart-looking pair of female legs enter  - - Tania.

Bond (O.S.)

A girl's just come in.

BOND AND KERIM

Kerim

Probably Romanova.  She's the only one who's allowed to.  How does she
look to you?

BOND'S POV - THE CONFERENCE ROOM

The periscope pivots, following Tania's legs.

Bond (O.S.)

Well, from this angle, things are shaping up nicely.  I'd like to see
her in the flesh.  Yes.

BOND AND KERIM

Bond backs away from the periscope.

Bond

Could you get me a plan of that place?

Kerim

I wish I could.

Bond

But there must be the original architect's drawings registered
somewhere.

Kerim

I'll get onto that.

	(lowers the periscope)

Now, I need a little time to deal with this stinking Krilencu.  It will
be better if you didn't stay at the hotel tonight.  Come.

INT. STATION WAGON - SAME TIME

Bond and Kerim sit in back.  Kerim fans his face with his hat.  Bond
glances back then forward again.

Bond

I see now why you keep the Rolls.

Kerim

One of my sons is driving it, with two dummies in the back... in the
opposite direction.  They'll follow it for hours.  You'll like my Gypsy
friends.  I use them like the Russians use the Bulgars.  I'm afraid it's
created a blood feud between them.

THE STATION WAGON - DAY FOR NIGHT

It continues on.

EXT. GYPSY ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

TWO BULGARS in dark clothes lurk in f.g. behind an archway, one of them
holding a walkie-talkie.

Hello, Krilencu?

EXT. GYPSY CAMP - MEDIUM SHOT

Krilencu listens on a walkie-talkie, surrounded by OTHER BULGARS.  He
glances at his watch, speaks into the walkie-talkie in Bulgarian, then
rises with the others and gets into a lorry which drives off.

EXT. GYPSY CAMP - HIGH ANGLE - SAME TIME

Bond and Kerim approach.  A GYPSY MAN comes running forward and
converses with Kerim in Romany.

CLOSER ANGLE

The Gypsy man finishes talking and runs off.

CLOSER ANGLE - BOND AND KERIM

Kerim

It seems we have come on the wrong night.  Two girls in love with the
same man have threatened to kill each other.  It must be settled in the
Gypsy way.  As I am an old friend of the family, I think we'll be
allowed to stay.

A GYPSY GIRL steps toward them speaking in Romany and gesturing forward.

Kerim

Must we talk about it now?

Bond

Or is it at the Russian Consulate?

They kiss again, lingering.

Tania

Umm... yes.

Bond

Yes.

	(he leans back)

I would need a plan of the place.  If you could get one, we can meet at
the Saint Sofia Mosque, like we were tourists.

Tania

Why don't you ask me that... later?

She embraces him, then runs a finger down his back until it touches the

Now what are you looking for?

We are now approaching the most interesting corner of Saint Sofia...
including these two great red porphyry columns stolen and brought from
Egypt.

Tania enters through a side door.  Bond enters behind the sightseers. 
He wears sunglasses and carries a bag.  As they walk away he turns to
one side.

GUIDE (O.S.)

In front of them, alabaster urn was brought from Bergama, a famous
historical city near Smyrna.  It dates back from the Alexander the Great
period.

Bond stops beside a towering column.

Hesitantly, Tania walks closer.  She stops and pulls her hair back from
her eyes and looks at him.  Bond takes off his sunglasses and looks
back.  Tania looks back.

Bond gestures with the sunglasses for Tania to move off.

GUIDE (O.S.)

About sixteen forty-eight, Sultan Murad the Fourth brought it from
Bergama.  It was used as an ablution fountain.  It contains a thousand
litres of water.  Right after the ablution fountain we are going to a
highly interesting  column over there...

Tania moves off and Bond does the same.

We CONTINUE WITH BOND as he passes more columns then reaches the base of
a huge pillar-complex.  Right ahead he sees Hassan, looking around the
far end of the complex.  Bond darts forward to conceal himself against
it.

HASSAN

His hand starts to pick up the compact at the base of the pillar.

Suddenly ANOTHER MAN enters.  His foot smashes down onto the hand
holding the compact and he bashes Hassan's neck with two Karate chops.

Well, he didn't die of old age.  All I know is that it saved me a job.

	 drawn map)

Once he'd seen the girl, she was obviously compromised and so...

Kerim

And he wasn't killed because of that!

Let's just say that Istanbul's a rough town.

TILT UP to TWO-SHOT of Bond and Kerim.

Bond

Now, she says she works there with the Lektor every day between two and
three.

Kerim

How is she going to get the machine over to us?

Bond

Well, she's leaving that to me.  She'll do anything I say.

Kerim laughs.  DOLLY BACK as he picks up the architect's drawing and
sits on the edge of his desk in f.g.

Kerim

Anything?  My dear James, you are not using this.

	(taps his head)

It all sounds too easy to me.

	(starts folding the

	 drawing)

We don't even know if she's telling the truth.

Bond

Well, I intend to find out.

Kerim

Where?  In the hotel?

Bond

No, she won't go there again.  Says it's too dangerous.

Kerim

The old game!  Give a wolf a taste then keep him hungry.  My friend,
she's got you dangling.

Bond

That doesn't matter.  All I want is that Lektor.

Kerim

All?

	(looks back at Bond)

Are you sure that's all you want?

Bond

Well...

They both grin, then Kerim laughs then Bond laughs.

EXT. BOSPHEROUS - DAY

A ferry boat passes by in the crowded harbor and toots its whistle.

ON THE FERRY BOAT

Bond walks upstairs onto a deck then along the deck.  He wears a hat and
sunglasses and carries a camera.  He stops, leans back against a railing
and removes his sunglasses.

Tania rounds a corner of the deck ahead of him.  She wears sunglasses, a
scarf and long coat.

Bond looks at her.  She looks back.  He approaches her but stops short,
turning to the railing and opening his camera case.  Tania walks up
beside him.

TWO-SHOT - BOND AND TANIA

Bond winds the camera.

Bond

Lovely view.

Tania

James, we must leave here now.  If that agent reports my seeing you...

Bond

Don't worry.  He won't.

Tania

But you don't understand  - - it's a danger.

Bond looks at her unconcerned.

He steps back and aims the camera at her.

Tania

James, look...

Bond

Smile!

He presses a button, then gestures to her to move back as a MAN walks
past them.

Bond

Another one.  Further back.

DOLLY IN as they move to a corner of the deck and the man walks off.

INTERCUT CLOSE-UPS - BOND AND TANIA

Bond

About the machine...

Tania

That's all you're interested in.  Not me.

Bond

Business first.

Tania

I know.  Once you have got what you want...

Bond

I haven't got it yet.  But if you tell me about the machine, well...
afterwards we won't always be working on the company's time.

Tania.

All right.  What do you want to know?

Bond glances around then lowers the front flap of the camera case,
revealing a tape recorder.

Bond

Talk into this.  Answer my questions quietly but clearly.

Bond

How long is the machine?

Tania

Like... like a typewriter.

Bond

Weight?

Tania

About ten kilos.  In a brown case.  Brown like your eyes.

Bond

Keep it technical.  Self-calibrating or manual?

Tania

Both.  With an in-built compensator.  James, couldn't we...?

Bond

Not now.  Talk into the camera.  How many keys?

Tania

Symbol or code keys?

Bond

Both.

				DISSOLVE TO:

A LARGER TAPE RECORDER

The reels are spinning.  PULL BACK to reveal:

INT. 'M'S' OFFICE - DAY

The tape recorder is on 'M's' desk and he sits listening.  Moneypenny
sits beside him taking notes.  Across the desk sit a NAVAL OFFICER, an
ARMY OFFICER and FOUR OTHER SUPERNUMERARIES.  'M' lights and puffs his
pipe.

Bond and Tania's voices come through the speakers:

Tania'S VOICE

There are twenty-four symbols, sixteen code keys.  It is inserted in a
slot.  And the message comes out on a paper roll from another slot on
the other side.  And the mechanism is... oh, James... James... will you
make love to me all the time in England?

Bond'S VOICE

Day and night.  Go on about the mechanism.

Tania'S VOICE

Oh, yes, the mechanism.  Once when it was being repaired I saw the
inside.  There were many perforated discs made, I think, of copper, with
a small light...

ANGLE ON 'M' AND MISS MONEYPENNY

Tania'S VOICE

Dooshka, tell me the truth.  Am I as exciting as all those Western
girls?

Miss Moneypenny blinks, then breaks into a cryptic grin.

Bond'S VOICE

Oh, once when I was with 'M' in Tokyo, we had an interesting experience.

'M' shuts off the machine.

'M'

Thank you, Miss Moneypenny.  That's all, that's all.

She gets up and exits past the men.  We hear a door close, then 'M'
re-starts the tape recorder.

BOND'S VOICE

Later, later.

IN MISS MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Miss Moneypenny flips on her intercom and sits down at her desk.  She
hears the tape playing in the other room.

Bond's Voice

Those copper discs, are they light?

Tania'S VOICE

Of course.  Light, light.  James, come closer.  I want to whisper
something.

Bond'S VOICE

Go on with what you were telling me... No, not that!  The mechanism!

'M'S VOICE (OVER INTERCOM)

Kerim walks up to Bond, a cigarette in a yellow holder in his mouth. 
Kerim takes the telegram, sits on the edge of his desk and reads.

Bond

Now all I have to do is to tell the girl the date.

Kerim

The thirteenth?

Bond

IN THE RECEPTION ROOM

Bond walks back to the clerk, who is still talking to the second man.

Bond

Excuse me.  You did say your cock was correct?

Clerk

Russian clocks are always  - -

A sudden explosion smashes through the floor behind Bond.  The clock
falls from the wall.  Debris cascades down from the ceiling.

Bond rises with a big grin.  He says something to himself and turns to
an archway behind him.

Embassy men run frantically around as Bond exits through the archway.

The clerk starts grabbing drawers from his desk.  Other EMPLOYEES run
behind him with drawers and files.

IN A HALLWAY

Smoke fills it.  Bond runs down the hall carrying a gas mask.

Bond

Is this the Lektor?

Tania

	 him the cord)

Yes!

Tania starts to cough.  Bond hands her the gas mask.

Bond

Here, take this.  It's only tear gas.

Tania

I thought it was for tomorrow, as today is the thirteenth, isn't it?

Bond

This is a hell of a time to be superstitious.

	(he shuts the case

	 and grabs the Lektor)

Come on!

He runs through the gateway; Tania follows holding the gas mask.

other.

IN THE FIRST COMPARTMENT (TANIA'S)

Kerim opens a connecting door to the other compartment, revealing Bond
and Tania.  Kerim hands Bond two passports.

Kerim

Your passports.  The pictures do not do you justice.  I have rarely seen
a handsomer couple.

Bond looks at them.  Tania looks over his shoulder.

Bond

	(reading)

Mister and Misses David Somerset.

	(to Tania)

Your name's Caroline.

He hands her a passport.

Tania

Caroline.  I like that name.

You're accompanying me on a business trip.  On the way back to
Derbyshire.

To our children?

Bond

No children.

DOLLY BACK as Bond and Kerim turn to the door to the corridor.

Tania

Not even one little boy?

Bond

Nyet.

Kerim

I like big families myself.  In fact, my whole life has been a crusade
for larger families.

Bond

So I've heard.

Kerim turns down the corridor.  Bond stops in the doorway.

Bond

Tania?

Tania

Yes?

Bond

Keep the door locked.  I'll knock three times.

Tania

Okay.

He shuts the door and she locks it.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Bond looks out the window.  Kerim takes out his yellow cigarette holder
and his cigarette case.

Kerim

I'll go see the conductor now.

Bond

You sure he'll cooperate?

Kerim

Oh, we've done business before.  He'll stop the train near the Bulgarian
frontier where my sons will be waiting with a car.  We'll be there...
about six o'clock.

A WOMAN IN A SCARF turns into the corridor and walks toward them.

Bond

And the airstrip?

Kerim

Twenty miles.

Bond and Kerim pause and back up.  She walks between them and down the
corridor then enters a compartment.

Kerim

The plane is chartered to Athens.  You'll be in London tomorrow.

Kerim places a cigarette in the holder and turns down the corridor.

Bond

We'll drink to that in London.

He knocks three times on the compartment door.

IN TANIA'S COMPARTMENT

She opens it to admit Bond.  He enters closes it behind him.  She wraps
her arms around him.

Tania

So, we are really on our way to England!

Bond

Yes, with a lovely two-day honeymoon before us.

Tania

Honeymoon?  And I have nothing to wear.

Bond

Ah!

He holds up her black ribbon and puts it around her neck.

Bond

Your trousseau!

Tania

	(holding the ribbon)

Oh, James!

Bond

	(holding up a finger)

Ah, one moment.

He backs away raising his jacket cuffs then holds up his hands as if to
say there's nothing there, then he disappears behind the door to the
other compartment.

Tania looks on in puzzlement.

Suddenly the door is kicked open revealing Bond holding up a blue
negligee.

Tania

Oh, no!  James, James!

	(she hugs him, then

	 glances down

	 surprised)

Oh, look!  Look!

She kneels in amazement to a suitcase and looks through the clothes in
it.

She rises holding another blue negligee.  She swings around then holds
it up against herself.  Bond takes the black ribbon from her hand and
holds it against her neck.

Bond

She laughs.

Benz stands at door to Tania's compartment, listening, then moves on. 
Kerim rounds the corner behind him and watches.

Benz pauses the next compartment door, listens and moves on.

Kerim watches closely, then knocks on Tania's door.

IN TANIA'S COMPARTMENT

Through the doorway to Bond's compartment we see her feet as she lies
with him in bed.

Bond (O.S.)

You're nearest.

Tania

Oh, all right.

Tania gets up and walks into her compartment.  She is weaering her
negligee and has her hair tied up in a bun.  She opens the door.  Kerim
enters and looks at her approvingly.

Kerim

Charming!  Charming!

Kerim turns to the doorway to Bond's compartment.  Bond emerges tying
his tie.

Kerim

Let's go to the restaurant car, James, for... that drink.

Bond

Surely.

Kerim

	(off to Tania)

Charming!

Kerim exits past Tania.  Bond follows putting his coat on.

Bond

We'll continue the fashion show later.

He goes out into the corridor and she shuts the door and locks it.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Bond and Kerim look out the window.

Kerim

Everything is arranged for me to stop the train.  We'll get off from the
restaurant car...

	(he nods down the hall)

It's up that end.

Bond

Fine, we'll meet you there at six o'clock then.

Kerim

Make it just a little later.  But there are slight complications.

	(he turns and looks

	 up the hall)

One of the Russian security men, Benz  - - he watches the airports and
the stations  - - he's on the train.

Bond

But he couldn't have had time to contact the Consulate before he
boarded.

Kerim

Well, just in case, I'll keep him company for the next two hours until
it's time to get off.

PAN on Kerim as he starts down the corridor.

Kerim

Perhaps you'd like me to introduce you?

BOND

Benz stands looking out the window.  He hears a knock at the door and
turns.

Kerim (O.S.)

Ticket control.

Benz walks to the door taking some money from his pocket.  He opens the
door then freezes.  Kerim's hand aims a gun at his stomach.  Benz backs
away, drops onto the couch and drops the as Kerim follows.

Bond shuts the door.  PAN OVER to Kerim.  He pulls Benz' handkerchief
from his pocket and stuffs it in his mouth.

Kerim

Do not be alarmed, my friend.  We will make you as comfortable as
possible.

Bond and Kerim pull Benz to his feet.  Kerim takes a gun from inside his
jacket then Bond pulls the jacket down over his arms.

Kerim

Now I'm sure Commissar Benz will have a much safer journey.

Bond pivots Benz forward.

Bond

I'm not mad about his tailor.  Are you?

Bond shoves him and he drops back onto the couch.

Kerim

You know, James, life in Istanbul will never be the same without you.

Bond

I'll see you in the restaurant car.

Bond walks off.  TILT DOWN with Kerim as he sits beside Benz and starts
to raise his yellow cigarette holder.

Kerim

I've had a particularly fascinating life.  Would you like to hear about
it?

Benz grunts.

Kerim

You would?

IN THE CORRIDOR

Bond walks away through a doorway into the next train car.  Grant
emerges from behind the doorway, wearing his gloves.  He glances back at
Bond then walks forward.

IN TANIA'S COMPARTMENT

She lies on the couch wearing a blue nightdress and looking at her face
in a mirror.  She holds a lock of hair under her nose like a mustache.

She hears a triple-knock at the door, jumps up and opens it.  Bond
enters looking at her and smiling.

Tania

Do you like it?

She walks toward the couch.  Bond follows.

Bond

Yes.  It does rather suit you.

Tania

I will save everything else for England.

Bond

Uh, it is four o'clock, you know.

Tania

It is not kulturny in the afternoon?

Bond

Yeah, that would be splendid.  But I've arranged to meet Kerim in the

Tania

Mmm, you go alone.  I will stay here.

Bond takes her cigarette, rises and walks to the window which is covered

Bond

My dear Mrs. Somerset, we're supposed to be a respectable English

We would certainly have tea in the restaurant car  - -

The blind rolls up with a loud snap that startles Bond.  Tania walks up

BOND

Now, listen...

He picks up his tie and passes her, smacking her bottom.

couch with a bullet-hole in his chest.  Near Kerim's face is his yellow
cigarette holder.

Bond kneels and lays his hand on Kerim's shoulder, surveying the scene,

This must be kept quiet until we reach Trieste.

Conductor

It will be difficult.

Bond

Kerim Bey was a very influential man.  He had many influential friends.

He gives some money to the conductor and puts the rest away.

Bond

Your father's dead.

Mahmet

Who did it?  Tell me.

Bond

Well, he took care of that himself.  The other man died first.

	(all business)

Now, listen.

Bond tosses his cigarette aside.  DOLLY IN closer.

Bond

I'll need some help to get across the frontier strip between Yugoslavia
and Trieste.  I want you to send a message to 'M' in London.  Tell him
to send someone from Station Y to meet me in Zagreb.  All right?

Mahmet

I will.

Bond

Good.

Bond nods to him, then PAN on Bond as he walks away.  Then he stops and
turns back.

Bond

Oh.

DOLLY BACK as Bond returns to Mahmet taking out Kerim's wallet and
cigarette holder.

Bond

	(handing them to

	 Mahmet)

You'll, uh  - - I think you'll want these.

COnductor (O.S.)

	(calling to Bond

	 in French)

Monsieur Somerset, the train is leaving!

Mahmet

	(to Bond)

Thank you.

Bond

	(backing away)

Ciao.

Conductor (O.S.)

	(in English)

The train is leaving!

Bond turns and walks off.  Mahmet turns the other way and looks at the
objects in his hands.  DOLLY BACK as he walks away.  Then HOLD on the
train.  We see Grant looking out through a window in a door of the
caboose.

The train starts moving.  Grant turns into the corridor.

EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT - SAME TIME

PAN on the wheels as they gather speed.

UP ANGLE ON THE TRAIN

Passenger windows fly by, many with people looking outside.

				DISSOLVE TO:

THE JOURNEY - MONTAGE - NIGHT

PAN on the wheels as the train speeds along.  Then DISSOLVE TO a wider
angle of the train continuing into the distance.  Then DISSOLVE TO a
deserted station as the train races by.  Then DISSOLVE TO the speeding

Meanwhile FADE IN a SUPERIMPOSITION of the map of Europe.  PAN across it
showing the route from Belgrade to Zagreb.

				DISSOLVE TO:

Grant steps to the door and opens it.

EXT. TRAIN - SERIES OF SHOTS - SAME TIME

- Grant steps onto the platform, looks around and walks off.

- Bond walks along an inside corridor glancing out the windows.

- A man in a business suit holding a briefcase stands in the station
waiting.  He is NASH.

ALONG THE TRAIN - TRUCKING SHOT

Grant puts a cigarette in his mouth and walks purposefully through the
station past many people.

He reaches Nash.  We see them speak and gesture but we don't hear them.

They start walking forward.  Grant tosses his cigarette aside, pulls a
pair of gloves from his pocket and puts them on.

They turn to the restroom.  Grant pats Nash on the back and Nash goes in
first.  Grant looks around then follows.

MEDIUM SHOT - THE TRAIN

Bond steps onto the platform, looks around and starts walking.

OUTSIDE THE RESTROOM

Grant emerges carrying the briefcase and donning Nash's hat.  He pulls
off the gloves and walks off.

ANGLE ON THE TRAIN - TRUCKING SHOT

Bond walks forward looking around.  Grant passes him.  Bond looks down
at Grant's briefcase.  Grant backs away a bit then stops and looks at
Bond.  He walks up taking a cigarette case from his pocket.

A gush of steam from the train drowns them out so we only see them speak
and gesture.

At the end of their conversation, a whistle sounds.  Bond gestures to
hurry.  Grant boards the train and Bond follows.  The conductor closes
the door and the train starts moving.

INT. TRAIN - CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Bond and Grant face each other.  A conductor guides some passengers in
b.g.

Grant

	(offering a handshake)

Nash.  Captain Nash.

They shake hands.

Bond

Bond, traveling as Somerset.

Grant hands him a card.

Grant

My card.

Bond looks at it  - - a touch of concern crossing his face  - - then
slips it into his pocket.

Bond

What kept you?

Grant

Oh, I'm so sorry.  I only got 'M's wire an hour ago.  I busted every
record getting here.

Bond

What were 'M's orders?

Grant

Only to, uh, contact you and the lady on the train.

Bond

Good.  Come this way.

Bond leads him to another car, then waits to let him go first.

Grant

Thank you.

Bond follows him down the next corridor.

IN TANIA'S COMPARTMENT

She opens the door to a triple knock.  Bond immediately enters followed
by Grant.

Bond

This is my wife Caroline.  Captain Nash.

Nash

	(taking off his hat)

Oh, uh, how do you do.

	(shakes her hand)

I'm so pleased to meet you.

Bond

This way, Nash.

Bond opens the door to his compartment and they go in.

Bond

Sit down, will you?

Nash

Thank you.

IN BOND'S COMPARTMENT

Bond closes the door.  Grant drops Nash's briefcase and hat onto the
couch, sits, crosses his legs and sighs.  Bond leans back against the
doorjamb.

Bond

Been long in Yugoslavia?

Grant

About three years.

Bond

Interesting work?

Grant

Yes, sometimes.  Well, you know how it is, old man.

Bond

You look very fit, Nash.

INTERCUT - BOND AND GRANT

Grant

Yes, I try to keep in shape.

They look at each other.

Grant

So what's our problem, sir?

Bond

Well, I can't risk taking this...

	(points to the Lektor

	 on the luggage rack)

... through the customs at the Yugoslav-Trieste border.

Grant

No stops till then.  We'll have to jump off.

Bond

	(nods)

Can you get us across?

Grant

Any of the opposition around?

Bond

Well, not in any condition to worry about.

Grant

Good.  We'll make it.  I know this territory like the back of my hand.

He glances down at the back of his hand.

TWO-SHOT

Bond watches him.

Grant

	(leaning forward)

Uh, sir, do you mind if we have a bite to eat first?  I've been on the
go since breakfast.

Bond

No, of course not.  Leave your things there.  We'll go to the restaurant
car.

Bond opens the connecting door.

Bond

Caroline, you go on with Captain Nash to the restaurant car.

IN TANIA'S COMPARTMENT

She rises and takes her coat as Grant walks in past Bond.

Bond

I'll join you there in a few minutes.

Grant

	(patting his shoulder)

Whatever you say, old man.

	(passing Tania)

Excuse me.

He opens the door for her and steps into the corridor.  She follows. 
Grant look back at Bond with a half-smile then closes the door.

Bond walks over and locks the door then goes back into his compartment.

IN BOND'S COMPARTMENT

Grant's hat and briefcase rest on the couch.  Bond sits beside them and
lifts the briefcase.  He turns the latches sideways and pops it open.

Inside are a man's shirt and a tie.  He reaches beneath them and sees a
revolver.  He picks it up, feeling its heft, then puts it back.

[END OF REEL 9.  START REEL 10.]

INT. RESTAURANT CAR

Grant sits with Tania at a table waiting.  He looks back at the entrance
then at his watch.

Grant

Excuse me.

He gets up and steps toward the entrance.  Just then Bond enters
carrying the Lektor.

Grant

Ah, there are you, old man.  I was worried something had happened to
you.

They walk back to the table.  Bond sits beside Tania, Grant across from
them.

ANGLE ON BOND AND TANIA

A WAITER walks up to their table.

WAITER

Pardon, monsieur.

He hands Bond a menu.

Bond

Thank you.

He hands a menu to Grant, off.

Grant (O.S.)

Thank you.

Bond looks at the menu.

Bond

I'll have the grilled sole.

He looks at Tania for approval.  She shrugs.

Bond

And for madam.

	(to Grant, off)

What about you, Nash?

ANGLE ON GRANT

GRANT

Yes.  That sounds very nice.  Make that three of those, will you?

WIDER ANGLE - THE TABLE

BOND

I'll have a bottle of the Blanc de Blanc.

Grant

Make mine Chianti.

Waiter

White Chianti, monsieur?

Grant

Uh, no.  The red kind.

Bond, unfolding his napkin, glances up at Grant.  The waiter walks away.

Grant

Well, enjoy your dinner, old man.  I think I've got the answer to our
problems.  Very simple, really.

Bond

Good.

				CUT TO:

We should reach the border in about an hour.

CLOSE SHOT - GRANT'S HAND

reaches for the salt but knocks over Tania's wine glass.

THREE-SHOT

Grant

Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Misses Somerset.  Most clumsy of me.

Grant dabs the spot with his napkin.

Bond

Waiter?!

WAITER (O.S.)

Oui, monsieur?

Grant picks up the wine bottle and Tania's glass, then glances sharply
back.

Grant

Waiter?!

Waiter (O.S.)

Tout suite, monsieur!

CLOSE SHOT - GRANT'S HAND

refills the glass and at the same time drops a white pill into it.

OVER GRANT'S SHOULDER

Bond eats as Grant sets down the wine bottle and glass.

WIDER ANGLE - THE TABLE

The waiter picks up something.

WAITER

Excuse me.  Merci.

He walks away.

Grant

You'll, uh... you'll find Trieste quite interesting.  Of course, it's
not London.

Grant lets out a little laugh and picks up his glass.

Grant

Cheerio!

Bond raises his glass.

Bond

Cheerio.

They toast each other, Grant letting out another little laugh, and they
drink.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - TANIA

absently picks up her glass, looks off at Bond then sips.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Bond walks down the corridor carrying the Lektor, opens the [unlocked]
door to Tania's compartment and goes it.  She follows, tipping from one
wall to the other.

Tania

I don't feel very well.  My head!

Grant holds her from behind.  Bond looks out from the compartment.

Grant

The lady's come over faint.

Bond

Bring her in here.

Grant

May I?

He guides Tania to the doorway.  Bond backs up and Grant walks her
inside.

IN TANIA'S COMPARTMENT

Bond takes her and lies her down on the couch.  She moans.

Bond

	(to Grant)

Let's go next door.

He opens the door to his compartment.

Grant

	(looking at Tania)

Exhaustion, I'd say.

Bond

Hmm.

Grant steps into Bond's compartment.  Bond turns off the light in
Tania's compartment then follows Grant, closing the door behind him.

IN BOND'S COMPARTMENT

Bond locks the door and turns his back on Grant.

Bond

What was it  - - the stuff you put in her drink?

Grant

Chloral-hydrate.  Quick but mild.

Bond takes out his pistol and turns, aiming it at Grant.

Bond

And?

Grant

	(raising his arms)

Take it easy, o-o-seven.

Bond glares at him.

Grant

My escape route's only for one.

	(smiles slightly)

What are you after, the girl or the Lektor?

Bond

	(relenting, stops

	 aiming at Grant)

All right.  What is your plan?

Grant

Explain it better on a map.

	(gestures with one

	 hand to his pocket)

All right?

Grant takes a map from his pocket, sits on the couch and opens the map
on Nash's briefcase.  Bond puts his pistol in his pocket and looks down.
 Grant points to the map with both index fingers.

Grant

Now, we're here, you see?

Bond crouches beside him.

Grant

When we reach there, there's a steep gradient.  The train slows down
there.

ANGLE ON THE MAP

Grant's left hand continues pointing to the map as his right hand comes
down to his leg.

Grant (O.S.)

We'll block the line.  Make for that main road.

TWO-SHOT

Grant

Pick up a car... there.

GRANT'S RIGHT HAND

goes to his ankle.  He takes a pistol from a holster under his pant leg.

Grant (O.S.)

A truck, in fact.

Bond (O.S.)

That must be about...

TWO-SHOT

Bond

... twenty miles from here.

Grant suddenly slams the butt of his pistol against the base of Bond's
skull.  Bond groans and drops to the floor.

Grant jumps up.

Bond rolls across the floor.

LOW ANGLE - BOND AND GRANT

Bond lies on his side in f.g.  Grant kicks his leg to see if he'll
react.

Then Grant reaches down, rolls Bond onto his back, puts his pistol to
Bond's temple, takes Bond's gun from his shoulder holster and slips into
his pocket.  He feels Bond's legs for more weapons, then takes his
cigarette case.

ANGLE ON BOND

Grant opens the cigarette case, sees only cigarettes, and slips it into
his pocket.  He takes cash from Bond's inside pocket.  Bond starts to
raise his hand.  Grant slaps it down.

LOW ANGLE

Grant pockets the money, then takes Bond's silencer from another pocket
and rises aiming his gun at Bond.

INTERCUT - BOND AND GRANT

Struggling, Bond sits up.

Grant

Keep still!

Bond looks back.

Grant

All right, get up on your knees.

Bond rises to his knees.

Grant

Put your hands in your pockets.  Keep 'em there.

Grant sits on the couch, still aiming his gun at Bond.

BOND

	(kneeling with his

	 hands in his pockets)

Red wine with fish.  That should have told me something.

Grant

	(slips the silencer into

	 his pocket and rests his

 	 free arm on his knee)

You may know the right wines, but you're the one on your knees.  How
does it feel, old man?

Bond

'Old man'?  Is that what you chaps in SMERSH call each other?

Grant

SMERSH?

BOND

	(looks up with realization)

Of course!  SPECTRE!  Then it wasn't a Russian show at all.  You've been
playing us off against each other, haven't you?

Grant stares back at him.

Bond

Then it was SPECTRE who killed the Russian agent in the mosque.  You?

Grant

Um-hmm.

Bond

Kerim and the other man?

Grant

Um-hmm.

Bond

And Nash?

Grant

Well, I don't mind talking.  I get a kick out of watching the great
James Bond find out what a bloody fool he's been making of himself.

He takes Bond's gun from his pocket, sets it on the couch, then takes
out the silencer.

Grant

We're pros, Mister Bond.

He attaches the silencer to Bond's gun.

Grant

We sweated your recognition code out of one of your men in Tokyo  - -
before he died.  I've been keeping tabs on you.  I've been your guardian
angel.  I saved your life at the Gypsy camp.

Bond

Oh, yes.  I am much obliged.

Grant

We were keeping you alive till you could get us the Lektor.

Bond

So you had me deliver it on a plate.  It's brilliant.  Go on, I'm
fascinated.

Grant

Now that we've got it, you and the girl are expendable.  Between here
and Trieste.

He picks up Bond's gun with his left hand and aims it at him.

Bond

The girl?  Isn't she working for SPECTRE, too?

Grant

No.  She thinks she's doing it all for Mother Russia.  She takes her
orders from Colonel Kleb.

Bond

Well, Rosa Kleb's Russian.  Head of operations for SMERSH.

Grant

Was.  Kleb works for SPECTRE now.  The girl doesn't know that.

Bond

Well then, why kill her?

Grant

Orders.

Grant slips his own gun into his pocket then reaches into another
pocket.

Grant

That's only half of it, old man.

Bond stares at him.  Grant takes out a roll of 8mm movie film.

Grant

Here's a roll of film.  She'll have this in her handbag.

He tosses the film onto the couch and takes an envelope from his pocket.

Grant

And on you... they'll find this letter.  It's from her.  Threatening to
give the film to the press unless you marry her for helping you get the
Lektor.

He sets the letter down.

Bond

What film?

Grant

Taken in the bridal suite at your hotel.  Something else the girl didn't
know about.  Or you.

	(he snickers)

[What a performance!]

Bond

Must be a pretty sick collection of minds to dream up a plan like that.

Grant

Can't you see the headlines?  'British agent murders beautiful Russian
spy, then commits suicide'?

Bond

Tell me.  Which lunatic asylum did they get you out of?

Grant

Don't make it tougher on yourself.

DOLLY BACK as Grant walks over to Bond and slaps his face hard.

Grant

My orders are to kill you and deliver the Lektor.  How I do it is my
business.  It'll be slow and painful.

Bond

How much are they paying you?

Grant

What's it to you?

Bond

We'll double it.

Grant

Your word of honour?  As an English gentlemen?

Bond just stares at him.  Grant glances down, smirks as if thinking,
then looks at Bond again.

Grant

The first one won't kill you.  Nor the second.  Not even the third.  Not
till you crawl over here and you kiss my foot!

Bond

How about a cigarette?

Grant

Not a chance.

Bond

I'll pay for it.

Grant

What with?

Bond

Fifty gold sovereigns.

Grant

Where are they?

Bond

Up there, in my case.

Grant glances up at the luggage rack.  Bond watches him.

Grant switches the gun to his right hand and takes the briefcase with
his left.  Bond keeps watching.

Grant

You show me.

He tosses the briefcase onto the couch.  It lands on top of Nash's. 
Bond takes his hands from his pockets and raises the case.  Grant
watches.

[END OF REEL 10.  START REEL 11.]

ANGLE ON BOND

over Grant in f.g. aiming the gun at him.  Bond opens the case, removes
the straps with the sovereigns and holds them out to Grant.

Bond

Here you are.  What about that cigarette?

REVERSE ANGLE - OVER BOND'S SHOULDER AT GRANT

Grant starts pulling a glove onto his left hand.

Grant

Throw 'em down there.

Bond tosses the straps onto the couch.

Grant

Any more in the other case?

ANGLE ON BOND

Grant in f.g. continues pulling on the glove [onto his right hand as he
holds Bond's gun with his left].  Bond stares at him.

Bond

I should imagine so.  It's a standard kit.

He sets Nash's case aside and turns his own case to face him.

Bond

I'll have a look.

ANGLE ON GRANT - OVER BOND'S SHOULDER

Grant finishes pulling the glove onto his right hand.  His left hand is
also gloved.

Grant

Put your hands back in your pockets!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - BOND

obeys and returns his hands to his pockets.

ANGLE ON GRANT OVER BOND'S SHOULDER

Grant

Keep them there.

He sits on the couch and turns Bond's case toward himself.

You won't be needing this, old man.

BOND'S POV - THE RAILROAD TRACKS - DAY FOR NIGHT

A truck with its hood up sits on a railroad crossing blocking the tracks
up ahead.  The train sounds its whistle.

BOND

puts on his hat.  DOLLY BACK as he shuts the door.

Bond

Tania!

He goes to her and grabs her shoulders.

Bond

Wake up!

He pulls her up by the collar.  She is barely conscious.

Bond

Wake up or I'll leave you behind!

She sinks back onto the couch, groaning.

He grabs her again and pulls her up into a sitting position.

BOND

Oh, Tania, wake up or I'll leave you behind!  Do you hear me?!

Tania

Don't leave me; never leave me.

EXT. RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY FOR NIGHT - SAME TIME

We see the truck now in f.g.  There is a bed of flowers in back.  The
driver  - - Rhoda  - - stands next to it waiving to the approaching
train to stop.  The train slows and sounds its whistle.

The train wheels grind to a halt.

IN TANIA'S COMPARTMENT

Bond lifts Tania to her feet and leans her against the wall.

Bond

Tania, this is Nash's escape route.  Do you understand?  We've got to
get off here.

He hands her a sweater from a coat-hook.

Bond

Take this.  Come on.

He picks up his briefcase and the Lektor and leads her out into the
corridor.

EXT. TRAIN CROSSING - DAY FOR NIGHT - SAME TIME

In my coat.  In the pocket.

Yes, we're here.  Near Istria.

Well, we've got plenty of fuel.  With a bit of luck we should be there

				CUT TO:

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD'S CAT

He strokes it.

Blofeld (O.s.)

Three men were found dead on the train at Trieste.  One of them was
Grant.

PULL BACK to reveal:

INT. BLOFELD'S CABIN ON HIS YACHT - DAY

Blofeld swivels forward to face Kleb and Kronsteen.

Blofeld

What do you have to say, Number Five?

Kronsteen

He was Kleb's choice.  Her people failed.

Kleb

	(to Kronsteen)

It was your plan!  They followed it implicitly.

Kronsteen

Impossible.  It was perfect.

Kleb

Except for one thing.  They were dealing with Bond!

Kronsteen

Who is Bond... compared to Kronsteen?

Blofeld continues stroking his cat.

BLOFELD (O.S.)

Exactly.  What have you to say to that, Number Three?

Kleb looks at him fearfully.

Blofeld presses a white button on his desk.

Morzeny enters through the doorway behind them.  DOLLY IN as he
approaches the desk.

Blofeld

Bond is still alive and the Lektor is not yet in our possession.  I have
already negotiated with the Russians to return it to them.  We've agreed
a price.  And SPECTRE always delivers what it promises.  Our whole
organization depends on our keeping those promises.

Morzeny  quietly puts his feet together and a knife shoots out of the
toe of one of his boots.

Blofeld

	(still stroking his cat)

I warned you.  We do not tolerate failure, Number Three.

Kronsteen looks smugly at Kleb.  Kleb sweats profusely.

BLOFELD (O.S.)

You know the penalty?

Kleb

Yes, Number One.

The boot with the knife leans back, preparing to strike.

Blofeld (O.S.)

Our rules are very simple.

Kleb keeps sweating.  Kronsteen turns smugly to Blofeld.  Blofeld keeps
stroking his cat.

Blofeld (O.S.)

If you fail...

Morzeny's boot turns sideways toward Kronsteen, and suddenly kicks him
in the ankle.  Kronsteen cries out in pain and doubles over.  Kleb looks
on, amazed.

Kronsteen rises, a look of total incomprehension on his face.  He starts
to fall then braces himself against the edge of Blofeld's desk.  DOLLY
BACK.  Kronsteen shakes his head at Blofeld in disbelief and slowly
sinks to the floor.

Blofeld

Twelve seconds.  One day we must invent a faster working venom. --
Number Three.

Kleb

	(snapping to attention)

Yes, sir.

Blofeld (O.S.)

I do not wish to have to tell the Russians that there will be another
delay.

Kleb

There will be no delay, Number One.  There's still time.

				CUT TO:

at her.

Tania

Which way are we going?

Bond

The shortest route.

	(holds up the chart)

Which is between those two mountains...

He points to mountains looming up ahead.

Bond

... and straight along the coast.

They look peacefully into the distance.

Suddenly a motorboat rounds a point in front of them, heading for them.

BOND

spins the wheel, turning back in the direction they came from, throwing
a wide wash behind.  They race ahead at full throttle.

They hear Morzeny's voice calling through a megaphone:

glances back then puts on even more speed.

Suddenly he sees another motorboat up ahead round a point and race at
him, then another.

You're trapped, Mister Bond!  You're trapped!  You cannot escape!  You
cannot escape!

Bond's boat speeds ahead, leaving a wide wake, with three motorboats
racing after it.  ZOOM BACK to an even wider angle.

grenade.

ON BOND'S BOAT

Tania looks back.  An explosion occurs right behind her.  The three
SPECTRE boats follow in b.g.

MORZENY'S BOAT

Morzeny continues on the megaphone.

Morzeny (filtered)

	(to the others)

You're trying to stop them, not to sink them!

ON BOND'S BOAT

Bond glances back.  Machine-gun fire and another explosion erupt behind
him.  Tania ducks and looks back.

MORZENY'S BOAT

comes right at them, the man on the bow firing his machine gun.

ON BOND'S BOAT

Bond glances back at the fuel drum.  Bullets puncture each of them and
fuel pours out.  Bond keeps looking.  More fuel.

He touches Tania's arm.

Bond

Here, take the wheel!

Tania takes the wheel.  Bond turns, unties the drums and pushes three of
them off the boat.  They splash into the water.  PAN BACK to show the
drums floating between Bond's boat and the others.

MORZENY

raises a pair of binoculars.  He sees the drums in the water.

[END OF REEL 12.  START REEL 13.]

Morzeny

	(to skipper)

Slow down!

The three boats pass one of the fuel drums.  ZOOM BACK to a wide angle.

Morzeny

Slow down all boats!  Green, go alongside, while we keep you covered.

BOND'S BOAT

Bond rolls the last fuel drum off the boat.  It splashes into the water.
 Bond starts to reach down.

Morzeny (O.S.)

Hands up, Mister Bond!

Bond raises his hands as Tania looks back.

Tania

Why are you giving up?  Without those drums the boat must be lighter. 
We can go faster.

Bond

Hand me that Very Pistol.

MORZENY'S BOAT

He calls to Bond through the megaphone.

Morzeny

Permesso, signor.  (By your leave, sir.)

Bond

	(in Italian)

Si, prego.  (Yes, please.)

Kleb shuts the door and walks off.

Bond

	(into phone)

And also, uh, get me the British Consul... Thank you.

He replaces the receiver.  PAN on him as he walks to a table where the
Lektor sits and shuts the case.  Kleb, behind him, is dusting a couch.

Bond picks up his shoulder holster, which hung over a chair at the
table, and walks into the bedroom putting it on.

DOLLY IN on Kleb.  She walks to the table and picks up the Lektor.

The phone suddenly rings again.  She sets the Lektor down and takes an
ashtray from the table.

BOND

emerges from the bedroom.  PAN on him as he grabs his coat from the
chair, passes Kleb holding the ashtray, goes to the phone putting his
coat on and picks up the phone.

Here, leave that!  I'll take it.
