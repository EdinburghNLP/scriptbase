                         FADE IN:

          INT. PASSENGER JET - EARLY MORNING

          Sleepy thick fatigue, the end of a red-eye flight. Most
          passengers still asleep, a few read, or stare blankly.
          In business class, A HUSBAND and WIFE, mid-30's. He's awake,
          reading a document. She sleeps nestled against his shoulder.
          He's trim, sharp, good looking in an academic way. Even in
          sleep, she's beautiful. Wide-mouthed and honey-haired.
          The plane's aspect SHIFTS, the pilot's voice comes on in
          German. The man lifts his window shade, peers out at the
          first rays of sun touching the skyline of Berlin.

          EXT. TEGEL AIRPORT, BERLIN - EARLY MORNING

          Halo of lights. Giant talons, the airplane's LANDING GEAR
          appears through cloud. Tires hit slick asphalt.

          INT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - SAME

          The couple. Dr. Martin Harris and Elizabeth Harris. WIDER: a
          German IMMIGRATION OFFICER glances up at MARTIN and LIZ. KA-
          CHUNK! KA-CHUNK! Stamps both passports, swipes the bar
          codes over a scanner, hands them back. Martin slips his into
          a leather briefcase.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - DAWN

          Raining. A melee of travelers and vehicles. Liz beside him,
          Martin wheels a baggage cart through the crush. An ATTENDANT
          ushers them toward a waiting cab and DRIVER...
          a CRASH of THUNDER -- the rain suddenly triples in
          strength. A DELUGE. The taxi driver hustles Martin and Liz
          towards his car. He shields his head with a newspaper,
          piling their bags into the trunk, cursing.
          Martin sets down his case, moves to help the driver...

          I/E. TAXI CAB - DAWN
          The DRIVER merges onto the autobahn. Liz yawns with jet-lag,
          studies Martin who stares out at the passing city.

                         LIZ
          Hey... You're gonna do great.
          You always do.

          I/E. TAXI/HOTEL IMPERIAL, BERLIN - MORNING
          Modern 'Deco Revival' hotel/conference center. A banner
          welcomes delegates to the World Biotechnology Forum. The
          Harris' taxi pulls up in the forecourt thick with red-eye
          travelers arriving for early morning check-in.
          Martin takes out his billfold.

                         MARTIN
          I'll do this. You check in.
          Liz pecks his cheek, gets out. Martin leans forward.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          How much do we owe you?

          INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME

          Liz presses up to the crowded desk. A busy RECEPTIONIST
          takes Liz's booking slip.

                         LIZ
          The Eisenhower suite. Dr. and
          Mrs. Harris.

          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT - SAME

          A BELLHOP holds a large umbrella up to the rain, loads the
          Harris' bags onto his cart. Shuts the trunk, the taxi pulls
          away. Heading for the entrance...

                         BELLHOP
          Welcome to the Hotel Imperial.
          Have you stayed with us before?

                         MARTIN
          No, this is our first visit to
          Berlin. We're --
          -- he stops short, staring at their bags, stacked on the
          luggage cart. He turns, tracks the their taxi, already
          pulling out of the drive...

          INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME

          a stab of concern on Liz's face.

                         LIZ
          What do you mean the suite may
          not be available?

                         RECEPTIONIST
          I have to check with the manager.
          Security inspections of the rooms
          are still being completed.

                         LIZ
          But we confirmed two months ago.
          Receptionist raises an apologetic hand as she attends to a
          ringing phone. Liz sighs, glances back toward the entrance.
          Suddenly curious as she sees...

          LIZ'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH THE GLASS WALL
          . Martin standing in the open door of the next taxi in
          line. He speaks to the bellhop who nods, quickly pushing the
          cart in through the doors, headed for Liz...

          I/E. TAXI/BERLIN - SAME
          Martin getting in, agitated.

                         MARTIN
          Tegel airport. Arrivals. Quick.
          The driver pulls out into traffic. The rain still heavy.
          Martin stares out at the wet city. Eyes track as the shadowy
          columns of the Brandenburg Gate pass by. He lets himself
          relax a little, enjoying this moment of forced calm.
          He catches sight of the driver in the rear-view. Young,
          female, shortish hair. Tomboy cute. Smart eyes, older than
          her years. Layers of clothing. GINA.
          She glances into the mirror, catches Martin watching her.

                         GINA
          Everyone says how much it's
          changed. Berlin.
          Eyes connect, brief. Wipers flip-flap.

                         MARTIN
          .I wouldn't know. First time.

                         GINA
          Yes, me too. I mean, I wouldn't
          know either. You're American?
          He looks back at her, inquisitive...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          For the airport, it's always
          Americans in the morning...
          Asians at night.

                         CONTINUED:
          Martin nods, pulls out his phone. Service dies as Gina
          downshifts, Doc Martins working the pedals, accelerates away
          from the large "Flughafen" (Airport) sign, down a cobbled
          road next to main route.

                         MARTIN
          I think you missed...
          He stops, smiles as he realizes she's navigated around a
          large construction back-up, saving them time.

                         GINA
          You do what you do, I do what I
          do, right?

                         MARTIN
          What do you do, when you're
          not...?
          She laughs. He smiles, nods. Okay, dumb thing to say.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Sorry, I didn't mean anything --

                         GINA
          It's okay. I know what you
          meant.
          Her eyes meet his in the mirror.
          She swings the taxi onto Wilhelmstrasse. Stops at a red
          light. Ahead, the Marshall Bridge over the River Spree.

          LIGHT TURNS GREEN
          Gina moves the taxi mid-stream in the traffic heading onto
          the bridge. Martin checks his phone, he's got service. He
          starts to dial...
          Suddenly -- the cars in front of her start VEERING WILDLY IN
          DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, just missing the boxed REFRIGERATOR
          tumbling off the truck in front of them. The box BURSTS
          open. Gina swerves to avoid it, CLIPS the corner...
          front tire BLOWS OUT... taxi skids crazily, HITS the
          CURB. Tires SHREDDING... shower of SPARKS. Taxi SLAMS over
          the curb, THROUGH the rail. Plunges off the bridge.

                         MARTIN'S FACE
          Strangely serene. Intense vivid IMAGES... the playing card
          'ACE TAXIS' logo on the dash... GINA'S EYES in the MIRROR...
          Silent free-fall dive. Timeless. Dreamlike.

          WHAM--! TAXI HITS THE WATER
          Martin's head SMACKS against the side window. Gina cushioned
          by the airbags, which she wrestles back. WATER SPRAYS IN.
          Gina can't open her door. Steel steering-lock on the floor.
          Grabs it, SMASHES the side window. Hauls herself out...

          INTO THE RIVER
          . gasping. On the bridge above, people frantically flag
          down traffic... Gina turns, sees the Taxi, midstream,
          sinking. Martin still in back, unconscious.
          No time. Gina gulps air, dives. She reaches into the front
          of the cab, grabs the steering lock, HAMMERS it against the
          passenger window, glances up:
          THE SURFACE, starts to recede as the taxi slips underneath,
          sinking...
          Gina hammers at the glass again, it BREAKS. Grabs Martin's
          limp body, drags him up to the surface.
          A CROWD ON the bank. People wading out to help. Taking
          Martin from her, carrying him up onto dry land. LIGHTS,
          SIRENS... The POLICE arriving, pushing back the crowd.
          PARAMEDICS quickly laying Martin out on the concrete.
          Everyone's focus on the unconscious man. Gina eases back...
          melts away into the growing horde of on-lookers as the
          paramedics rip open Martin's shirt...
          feeding a tube down his throat. Pushing on his stomach.
          DEFIBRILLATOR paddles. WHINE as defibrillators charge.
          A PARAMEDIC lifts Martin's eyelid, shines a flashlight...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- FAINT HALO OF LIGHT
          in a dark fog. Distant voices --

          SUDDEN SHIFT --.INTENSE FLASH OF MEMORY...
          UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL. Youthful MARTIN speaking on the
          spotlit podium. Intense, energized. A college age LIZ in
          the audience. LAUGHTER of rapt students. Loud APPLAUSE. A
          jovial older COLLEAGUE eagerly shaking Martin's hand...

          SMASH BACK TO THE RIVER BANK...
          Paddles on Martin's chest. Paramedic calls out:

                         PARAMEDIC
          Achtung!
          WHOMPF! The charge surges into Martin's body.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT...
          a CONSERVATORY. Martin as a CHILD. Fascinated,
          delighted as his FATHER shows him the opening bud of a
          blossom. Butterflies' wings SHIMMER in sunlight...

          WHOMPF! SECOND ARCING CHARGE...
          Martin's chest heaves up. Slumps back down...

          SMASH CUT INTO MEMORY -- TWO BODIES MOVING...
          . Liz and Martin making love. Passionate, intertwined.

          WHOMPF! ANOTHER SURGE OF ELECTRICITY...
          Martin's chest rising up...

          SMASH CUT AGAIN -- LIZ...
          . half-dressed, hair ruffled and wet. Towelling it.
          Turning toward us. Smiles. Her lips moving...

          WHOMPF! A FOURTH PULSE...
          Martin's body slumping back. Sudden QUIET now, the world
          removed. Just his face. His eyes.

          MARTIN (V.O.)
          They say your whole life flashes
          before you... but it's the little
          things... the details... the
          moments. Its like looking at a
          painting. Stand close, all you
          can see are the brush strokes.
          It's only when you step back that
          you get the whole picture...

          SLOWLY BECOMING...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- THE FILMY RED
          . of light seen from behind closed eyelids. Quiet...
          except for a distant sound. CRACKLING. Like falling rain.
          The sound growing. Close now. Filling our ears, as...

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          .a tiny pin-hole of light, TOO BRIGHT. GLIMPSES of a NURSE
          as she tears the wrapping off a fresh drip sac...

                         BLACK
          .A man's voice... distant. German words. Small, faded
          image of a German DOCTOR, speaking with the nurse...

          .again, a pin-hole of consciousness. The Nurse, taking a
          private moment, speaking in German on her cell-phone. The
          Nurse looks over, straight at us, realization in her face,
          she hurries from the room.
          We REVOLVE... finding... MARTIN HARRIS. Arms by his sides.
          A few days beard. A sutured cut on his temple. His eyes
          fluttering, barely open... then closing.
          Clipboard beside the bed. An admission form. In German.
          Where Martin's name should be: "unbekannte maennliche
          Person", and the SUBTITLE becomes our MAIN TITLE...

          'UNKNOWN WHITE MALE'...

          CLOSE - MARTIN'S FACE
          Squeak of a door. Distant FOOTSTEPS. Quiet again. Just the
          distant PULSE of his heartbeat. His eyes... flick OPEN.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. - HIS SURROUNDINGS...
          Vision BLURRED, BLINKING to focus. Scrubbed floor, white
          walls, Banks of drips and monitors, his possessions on a
          table near him...

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Konnen Sie mich horen?

          MARTIN'S EYES -- TRACKING OVER
          Daylight through a window. Sitting by the bed is a dark-
          haired man with a van Dyke beard. DR. FARGE.

                         FARGE
          Wenn Sie mich horen konnen,
          blinken Sie zweimal.
          He watches as Martin's eyes tilt. Look directly at him. A
          sound. A dry croak... slowly forms itself into speech:

                         MARTIN
          I... I don't... speak German...

                         FARGE

          . American...
          A beat. Farge signals the Nurse to come in. Speaks to him
          slowly and clearly in English:

          My name is Doctor Farge. You are
          in the Waldfriede Hospital. I'm
          the head neurologist here. You
          have been in an accident.

                         (BEAT)
          Can you tell me your name?
          Beat. Martin nods. Voice weak.

                         MARTIN
          Martin... Harris. Doctor...
          Martin Harris...
          Farge exchanges a look with the nurse. To Martin...

                         FARCE
          Where are you staying? Is there
          anyone here, in Berlin, that we

                         MIGHT --
          Martin suddenly looks around, struggles to sit up.

                         MARTIN
          My wife.. ?

                         (SUDDEN PANIC)
          Where's my wife? Liz...? Is she
          hurt? Where is she --?!

                         FARGE
          Doctor Harris, it's all right.
          The taxi you were in went into
          the river. You were the only
          passenger. Your heart stopped
          for six minutes. It is Thursday,
          November 27th. For four days you
          have been in a coma.

                         MARTIN
          Thanksgiving... but my wife...
          she's in Berlin with me. Where
          is she? Why isn't she here?

                         FARGE
          We didn't find any identification
          with you, Doctor Harris... the
          driver, who saved your life,
          disappeared soon after the
          accident and no one else has come
          forward. I must apologize, but
          we had no idea who you were.
          It sinks in. Martin shakes his head wretchedly.

                         MARTIN
          Oh, Jesus... Liz doesn't know...
          She'll... she'll be worried sick.

          Calm down, Doctor Harris, please.
          Where can we reach your wife?
          Does she have a cell phone?

                         MARTIN
          Yes... yes, she does... it's... I
          can't remember...
          His voice trails off. A long beat. Farge asks gently:

                         FARGE
          Can you tell me what you do
          remember, Martin? Do you
          remember what day it is?
          A beat. Giving it thought... then:

                         MARTIN
          Thanksgiving. You told me that.
          I remember... almost everything.
          But I don't know how I got here.
          Another beat. He shakes his head. Scared...

                         FARGE
          It's called retrograde amnesia.
          With severe trauma of this kind,
          memories get lost, or fractured.
          Most return... although it's
          unlikely you'll ever fully recall
          the events around your accident.

                         (BEAT)
          In the meantime, let us see if
          anyone has filed a report looking
          for a Martin Harris, okay?

                         MARTIN
          Yes, yes... okay.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK

          The light outside greying into dusk. On the TV, a German
          chef showing how Americans prepare Thanksgiving dinner. The
          NURSE comes in; starts to makes a note in Martin's chart.

                         MARTIN
          My wife...? Meine Frau... ?
          Beat. The nurse shakes her head, apologetic.
          Martin watches a FAMILY, a wife and children, pass his door,
          visiting another patient.
          He turns his head, stares at his belongings...

          them. A Rolex with a stainless steel band, a ballpoint pen,
          a wad of CASH in a billfold. Three hundred or so Euros, a
          small blue BOOK. Crinkled, water-stained.
          Painful effort, he rises, reaches out and picks up the watch.
          It's 6.48. He turns the watch over. An engraving on the
           backplate: "E.H. to M.H. 7.18.03".

          FLASH OF MEMORY...
          Snow falling outside a warmly lit living room. A fire
          crackles. Martin unwraps a present: The Watch. He turns it
          over, reads the engraving, smiles up at Liz across from him,
          beautiful, also smiling...

          BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          .She gave it to me, our
          anniversary.
          The Nurse smiles, shakes her head, not understanding.
          Martin sets the watch down, picks up the little blue book
          beside the watch -- 'Horticus' -- the classic botanical
          reference. He flicks through it, reads the handwritten
          inscription: "For Martin, that he may discover the worlds
          inside..." A distant smile...

          FLASH OF MEMORY -- GENTLE, LESS VIOLENT
          Martin as a child sits with his father in his father's study.
          His father shows him the illustrations in the new book.
          Martin's eyes are wide.

          BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM
          Martin starts to close the book, tracks some NUMBERS,
          handwritten on the endpaper. A beat.
          He shuts the book, glances at the TV, silently playing the
          local English language TV News: "Prince Fahad arrives in
          Berlin..." Biotech Forum logo. A striking 30-something
          Saudi man shakes hands with German dignitaries. A shot of
          the Hotel Imperial...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE, HOTEL IMPERIAL

          A high-end suite, empty, but with the signs of someone
          staying there. The phone rings... and rings...

          INT. NEUROLOGICAL WARD, RECEPTION AREA - MINUTES LATER

          Martin fully dressed. Farge has just hung up the phone,
          trying to reason with him.

                         FARGE
          -- you have to realize the risk --

                         MARTIN
          Doctor, I've been gone for four
          days. My wife is out there, in a
          city she doesn't know. She must
          be terrified... I need to find
          her before --

                         FARGE
          -- Let me call the hotel again.
          We can leave a message...

                         MARTIN
          Yes, fine, but look, I know her.
          She's looking for me. You're
          married, aren't you? What would
          you do?
          Farge tracks his own wedding band. A long beat. He sighs.
          Not happy about this at all.

                         FARGE
          This is my card. Any nausea,
          dizziness, difficulty with
          speech, you contact me
          immediately. Do you understand?

          EXT. HOTEL IMPERIAL FORECOURT - NIGHT

          A Taxi pulls up. Familiar biotechnology forum banner.
          Martin gets out, strong Deja Vu. Trying to orient.

          INT. HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS

          Eyes peeled for a possible glimpse of Liz, Martin heads for
          elevators. HOTEL SECURITY is everywhere. An entrance to a
          ballroom is flanked by guards, checking IDs and invitations.

          DING. Martin steps out into carpeted silence, makes his way
          down the hall to the 'Eisenhower Suite.' About to knock when
          he sees the door is ajar. A beat. Martin pushes it open...

                         MARTIN

          . hallway leads into the spacious sitting room. No one
          there. Draped over a chair, Martin recognizes Liz's jacket.
          Martin smiles, blinks against tears, he's home.
          Sound of MOVEMENT from the BEDROOM DOOR...

                         MARTIN
          Liz! I'm here, I...
          A HOTEL MAID appears from the bedroom door. Startled as she
          sees Martin...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          My wife... Meine Frau... I'm
          looking for Mrs. Harris...
          She suddenly gets him... nodding, pointing down.

                         MAID
          Ah. Entpfang... reception...

          INT. HOTEL IMPERIAL, MEZZANINE LEVEL - NIGHT

          World MUSIC. GUESTS flow in through the ornate doors. Martin
          moves among them. Significantly under-dressed in his
          tattered jacket, the sutured head injury. Almost at the
          doors... when a hotel SECURITY GUARD intercepts him.

                         GUARD
          Excuse me, sir. Do you have an
          invitation, sir?

                         MARTIN
          No... I mean yes...
          Distracted, still looking at passing faces...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I don't have it with me. My
          name's Harris, Dr. Martin Harris.
          I'm on the list. My wife is
          Elizabeth Harris.

          I'm trying to find her. I've
          been in the hospital.
          As the guard checks a screen, a crop-haired man in a cheap
          suit nearby tracks them: HERR STRAUSS, head of hotel
          security. He approaches, also checks the screen as the guard
          speaks to him quietly in German.

                         STRAUSS
          Dr. Harris. Do you have any
          other identification? Passport?
          Drivers license?

                         MARTIN
          I've already told this gentleman,
          I've been in the hospital. I was
          in an accident...
          Martin sees someone through the crowd...

          P.O.V. -- ENTERING FROM THE FAR DOOR
          a striking, intense-looking man with dark, wiry hair, a
          designer laptop bag slung over his shoulder. Smiling, arms
          around his two ten year old daughters, twin GIRLS, prettily
          dressed. Immediately the center of attention. People moving
          forward to meet him. Flashguns POP...
          MARTIN, raises his hand, calling out:

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Professor Bressler!
          Words lost in the noise. Martin pushes toward him. But:

                         STRAUSS
          I'm sorry, sir...

                         MARTIN
          That's Professor Bressler, right
          there. He knows me, he can
          confirm who I am.

                         STRAUSS
          If you would be patient, sir.

                         MARTIN
          No, I'm done being patient...
          Martin stops short. Staring past them:

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          That's her, that's my wife. Over
          there. By the buffet table.

          Liz. Looking superb in a black evening dress. In
          conversation with a group of men and women.

                         MARTIN
          Seeing her. The look on his face. Processing... an
          overwhelming mixture of confusion and relief.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          That's her. That's Liz, my wife.
          Strauss stares at him blankly. Martin starts to lose it.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Look I have been missing for four
          days and she has no idea what
          happened to me! So you need to
          take me to her, right now.
          Heads are turning. A beat. Herr Strauss mutters to the
          guard, then beckons Martin to accompany him inside.

          MARTIN AND STRAUSS
          thread through the crush. Martin ignoring the glances he's
          getting. His eyes fixed on Liz... her back to him. A glass
          of wine in her hand... her golden hair... the ivory skin of
          her shoulders. Strauss taps her on the arm. She half
          turns...

                         STRAUSS
          Excuse me Madam. Your husband is
          here. He needs to --

                         MARTIN
          Liz...
          Liz turns fully. That beauty. A flash of surprise as she
          sees Martin. His clothes. The suture on his head.

                          MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Oh, Jesus Liz, I --
          Moving in to embrace her... abruptly she steps away from him,
          a flustered look of confusion on her face. Beat.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Liz, I... I was in an accident.
          I was in the hospital, in a coma
          I'm so sorry, they didn't
          know who I was ---

                         LIZ

          Liz stares at him, nonplussed. Her group also staring.

                         MARTIN
          Liz...? Please. It's me.

                         LIZ
          And just who might 'you' be?
          Amused whispers. Martin, bewildered, growing angry.

                         MARTIN
          It's me. Martin. Your husband.
          Liz half smiles, glances around. Is this a joke? To the
          security guard, flustered:

                         LIZ
          This is a... misunderstanding.
          I... I don't know this man. This
          is my husband... Martin.
          She calls to a MAN nearby engaged in conversation. Mid-30s
          like Martin. Elegant, groomed, athletic... conspicuously more
          handsome in a chiselled way. Know him as MARTIN B.

                         MARTIN B

                         (COMING OVER)
          What's up?

                         STRAUSS
          You are Dr. Harris?

                         MARTIN B
          Last time I looked...
          He checks his name tag. There it is: 'Dr Martin Harris.'

          MARTIN B (CONT'D)
          Yeah... still me.
          More laughter. Martin pales. A beat. Turns to Liz.

                         MARTIN
          Is this some kind of a joke?

                         LIZ
          What are you talking about... ?

                         LIZ
          joke about what?

          I've been in the hospital for
          four days! Where were you? Were
          you even trying to find me --?!
          Moment's strained silence. Strauss unsure what to do,
          signaling a guard. Martin B steps in...

                         MARTIN B
          Look, You seem like you've had an
          accident, or perhaps --

          get him out of here?
          Martin rounds on Martin B. Jabs a finger.

          You. Whatever you think you're
          doing, you need to stop it.

          He tries to put his hand on her arm. Liz shies away. Martin
          B between them now. Martin shoving him back.

          Get out of my way --!
          Guard GRABS Martin's shoulder. Martin shakes him off. Guard
          grabs him again. Martin elbows him. A scuffle.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Liz --! Please...
          . Martin's hauled back... away from Liz.

          If you don't leave now, sir,
          we'll have to call the police.

          Great! That's the first good
          idea anyone's had. Call the
          police. Call the God damn Army!

          (to Liz, serious)
          It's not funny. I was hurt...
          Liz just stares at him, afraid, anchored to Martin B's arm.

          TNT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
          Seen through glass. A WALL OF MONITORS show images from
          around the hotel. Inside, Martin sits, surrounded.

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Martin rocks in a chair; restless, hands knotted. A FEMALE
          DETECTIVE watches him. An OLDER DETECTIVE is on the phone.
          Strauss sits near him, studying him, while a TECHNICIAN fast-
          forwards 4-PANE video of the hotel reception area, the drive
          in front of the hotel...

                         MARTIN
          There! Right there!
          ON THE VIDEO: Slowing to real-time. Liz, arriving at
          reception, speaking with the Receptionist, gesturing outside.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          That's Liz, and I... I must have
          been outside, I... I can't
          remember.
          The video plays on. Liz thanks the receptionist, leaves.

                         STRAUSS
          As you can see... you're not
          there.
          Martin STARES at him, helpless. The Older Detective hangs up
          the phone...

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          Immigration confirms the arrival
          of a Doctor and Mrs. Harris on
          November 23rd at 16.37. An hour
          later they checked into their
          suite at the Hotel.
          Martin breathes in. Chooses his words carefully.

                         MARTIN
          He's not Martin Harris. I am
          Martin Harris. The man
          downstairs is pretending to be
          me.

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          And this impostor... may I ask?
          Did he also steal your wife?

                         CONTINUED:
          Silence. Martin searching for a response. The hint of a
          smile on the female detective's face.

                         MARTIN
          He's forcing her... he must have--

                         STRAUSS
          -- but why? Exactly? .Why?
          There's no answer to that. Martin looks down. A beat.

                         MARTIN
          This... this is insane.
          He stares at their faces. He calms himself, trying to get a
          grip. A memory resurfacing...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          My lab number... at Dartmouth...
          Call my assistant, she can verify
          who I am. Call her right now...
          He picks up a pad, scribbles down the number. Beat. The
          female detective picks up the phone, dials. She switches to
          speaker. RINGING TONE. CLICK. A recorded message...

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Hello. This is 235-0535, the
          office of Doctor Martin Harris.
          If you're calling...
          The older detective presses "off". Martin recalling...

                         MARTIN
          it's Thanksgiving... no one's
          going to be there till Monday...
          (racking his brain)
          Rod... Rodney Cole... he's a
          colleague. A friend. I know his
          number... 603-389-4457...
          Female detective dutifully dials the number. RINGING again.
          CLICK of a machine. Then a jovial male voice:

          VOICE (O.S.)

                         (THROUGH PHONE)
          This is Doctor Cole. I'm having
          an out-of-office experience right
          now, so... leave a message.
          Click. Awkward SILENCE. Martin flailing...

                         MARTIN
          Professor Bressler, talk to him.
          He's why I'm in Berlin.

          no crime has been committed?

                         MARTIN
          But it has!... That man has taken

          see? You have to arrest him...

                         STRAUSS
          For what? Entering the country

          She is my wife!

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          Even if she is your wife, sharing
          a room with her is not illegal.
          Not in Germany.

                         FEMALE DETECTIVE
          (German, subtitled:)
          Look at her. Soon we'll have
          twenty more men claiming to be
          her husband.
          The room tries not to laugh, can't help smiling. The monitor
          image flips, now just a corridor.

                         MARTIN

                         (COLD)
          I'm sorry, I didn't realize this
          was funny to you.
          The Older Detective frowns, offended. The Female Detective
          speaks into her radio. Martin tracks, panicking.

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          Listen... you have no proof you
          are even American. We can arrest
          you only for that.

          I lost... I lost all my -- Wait,
          what are you doing...?
          The Female Detective listens to the radio response, nods to
          the Older Man who checks in with Strauss.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Oh God... You're going to arrest
          me. You're going to --

          On Monday, you can speak with a
          lawyer. Tell him who you are.
          The Older Detective confers with the Female Detective.
          ON THE MONITORS: the image from the Rose Room reappears: Liz
          and Martin B visible: laughing, drinking.
          Martin's gaze darts, panicked: The image. The detectives.
          Strauss. Martin... coming to a decision...

                         MARTIN
          (low, pained)
          I'm sorry... you're probably

          Faces look over, interested.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I... the accident. I haven't
          been remembering things, very
          well. Perhaps this is just...
          perhaps I'm confused.
          Martin remembers something, fumbles in his jacket and
          produces Farge's card.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          This is my doctor, at the
          hospital. He warned me this
          might happen. I should go back
          there. I'm really embarrassed...
          Strauss LEANS in, half convinced.

                         STRAUSS
          So... now you are saying that you
          are not Dr. Martin Harris?
          ON MARTIN. Eyes tight. Point of no return.

          EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE, HOTEL IMPERIAL - MOMENTS LATER

          Martin in a humiliated daze as TWO HOTEL GUARDS escort him
          out of a service entrance. Dirty pavement, a few bellhops
          smoke in the cold by a propped-open door. The guards move
          Martin along, out towards the hotel taxi stand.

          INT. TAXI CAB - SAME

          Martin climbs into the back seat. One of the guards hands
          Dr. Farge's business card to the driver, speaks to him in
          German. Door slams, cab starts to move.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- THE HOTEL
          Even as they pull away, several high-end Mercedes are
          sweeping up. SAUDI SECURITY get out of the first and last
          cars, check around before opening the doors of the center
          car. The man we saw on TV gets out. PRINCE FARAD, flanked
          by bodyguards and gorgeous female companions.
          The HOTEL MANAGER and CONFERENCE HEAD greet him, smiles and
          handshakes, they usher his entourage inside.
          Martin tracks the Prince, then FOCUSES BEYOND: A view into
          the hotel bar. Liz and Martin B entering...

                         MARTIN
          His gaze FIXED on them as the cab starts to move again...

                         MARTIN
          Wait! Stop! I've changed my
          mind...
          Martin thrusts a few bills forward, steps out...

          EXT. KONIGSTRASSE - NIGHT

          SCRRECH! A large brown Range Rover locks up tires as Martin
          steps out in front of it. A brief moment, Martin staring up
          into the tinted front glass... can't make out the driver.
          He holds up his hand, apologizing, makes his way to the
          street. weaving back through pedestrians, eyes fixed on the
          bar... FREEZES as he sees them.

          He leans into her, speaks quietly. She nods, intimate,
          smiles and shakes her head. What an evening...
          Liz and Martin B get up, leave. She takes his arm, intimate,
          heading out to the lobby. P.O.V. DARTING, SEARCHING... PICKS
          them up again in...
          . an EXTERIOR ELEVATOR rising up the side of the building.
          The two of them inside. Alone...

          EXT. BERLIN STREETS (VARIOUS) - NIGHT

          Martin walks fast, blind, lost. Miasma of LIGHTS and SOUNDS.
          Frozen MANNEQUINS in windows... the din of CLUBS and BARS...
          sex-shop neon SIZZLING. Nowhere to go but to keep going.
          The river. Martin gazes at the dark water...

          MARTIN'S P. O. V. -- SHOCK CUT -- MEMORY FLASH
          silent free-fall. WHAM! The taxi hits the water.
          The RATTLE of a U-BAHN TRAIN on a bridge snaps him back. Its
          PULSING LIGHTS STROBING like a silent movie.

          EXT. STREET PAY PHONE - NIGHT

          Faint VOICE in Martin's ear as Rodney Cole recites his
          message. Hands numb with cold, Martin pumps in change.

                         MARTIN
          Rodney it's me, Martin. Rod, I'm
          in Berlin for the conference, but
          it's Liz. She's... I'm in
          trouble, Rod...
          Phone issues a DEMAND for more money. Martin fumbles for
          change, drops a crumpled ball of Euros into the GUTTER.

          INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - ROSENTHALER PLATZ - NIGHT

          'Hotel' is a charitable description. Martin counts out
          sodden bills, hands them to a WOMAN behind the desk. She in
          turn gives Martin a form to fill.

                         WOMAN
          Fur Reisepaf3... passport...
          A beat. Martin looks at her, helpless. The woman sighs.
          Pushes back his money.

                         WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Nicht Reisepal3, nicht

          EXT. TRANSIT HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

          Martin exits, pulling dirty clothing closed against the cold.
          He scans the street, unnerved, frowns as he spots A BROWN
          RANGE ROVER, up the street, parked, idling. He squints,
          paranoid, checks the other way...
          His eyes lock on a lit S-BAHN station across the Platz.

          EXT. S-BAHN STATION BERLIN MITTE - NIGHT

          Martin pushes through the turnstiles, his footsteps echo in
          the empty tile corridor as his eyes play over the
          advertisements. Happy sexy Germans smile back at him... The
          SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS behind him, matching his. He slowly
          becomes aware, glances back.
          MARTIN'S P.O.V.: The empty corridor, curving away...
          Martin STOPS, listens... nothing. He starts to move again,
          aware that the delicate "click" of the following steps also
          begins again.
          UP AHEAD, the corridor straightens out at the train platform,
          several late-night travelers waiting. Martin begins to
          hurry... the FOOTSTEPS also increase in speed.
          Another sound: A TRAIN APPROACHING. Martin gives up cool,
          starts to run as the train barrels into the station, its
          noise eclipsing all sound. Doors open and Martin leaps in,
          turns to face the open door...
          .moments pass, the car's bell signals. Then a MAN appears,
          rushing from the corridor, one hand raised.

                         MAN
          (German, subtitled:)
          Please! Hold the door!
          He's mild-faced, glasses, carrying a shopping bag in one
          hand. He FROWNS as Martin does nothing to stop the door.
          The two men stare through the glass as the train begins to
          move. The man shakes his head: foreigners.

          INT. S-BAHN TRAIN - NIGHT

          Martin shivers with cold and exhaustion, eyes play over the
          few passengers in the car... a nondescript man a few benches
          down who stares at him, then back to his paper.
          Martin eyes him, paranoid. Slowly gives up, lets his gaze
          plays over the adverts. Times, dates... Nov 26th. Memories
          reawakened...

          the copy of 'Horticus,' looking for a blank page to write on.
          A piece of CARD falls from between its pages. Something
          printed on one side. Martin flips it over, scribbles on the
          other: "28th. Bressler. 12.30..." Other times, dates,
          numbers. Everything he can remember...
          Sudden overwhelming fatigue. The roar of the train. VOICES.
          Lights racing by the windows. Martin's eyelids droop.
          Flickering. Closing...

          INT. S-BAHN TRAIN - MORNING

          Martin's eyes creak open. The train is still moving, but
          everything has changed. Morning passengers crowd the car,
          giving him space. An AMERICAN COUPLE, their bags tucked
          tight. The WIFE staring down at him.

          INT. S-BAHN BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Martin runs water, combs his hair with his fingers. Tries to
          press creases out of his stained suit. He stares into the
          graffiti-stained metal mirror of the bathroom.

                         MARTIN
          Are you going to give up?

                         (BEAT)
          okay. Solve the problem...

          INT. INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT

          Martin sits in front of a stickered and stained monitor, eyes
          glued to the screen as he types in an URL. The Dartmouth
          Mail website appears. Martin types in his login, password.
          "Login failed. Please try again."

                         CONTINUED:
          Another attempt. Same results. He switches tactics. Types
          "Martin Harris" into Google... 605,000 results come back at
          him. On an impulse, he clicks "IMAGES."...
          .page after page of men young and old. Getting married,
          posing, partying, historical illustrations...
          Behind Martin, door jingles, a YOUNG MAN comes into the cafe,
          seats himself across and to the side of Martin.
          Martin focuses, tries 'Martin Harris, Phd'... Cursor clicks.
          A new window opens. 'The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in
          Drakea pollination.' 'Research Faculty information: Dr.
          Martin Harris...' Contact numbers. No picture.
          He stares in disbelief... suddenly becomes AWARE of the man
          across: Young, nondescript, his head bobbing gently to
          whatever his Ipod earbuds are playing, staring into his
          computer... The young man looks over, meets Martin's eyes,
          holds for a long moment, small smile, looks back.
          Martin studies him for a moment, forces his gaze back to the
          page, the negation of his life on a small screen.

          THE YOUNG MAN
          . Glances over again. Martin catching him.

                         MARTIN
          Can I help you? Hello?
          The guy points to his headphones, shrugs. Martin STARES at
          his screen, ears listening for the tell tale sound of music
          seeping from the earbuds... nothing.
          Martin rises suddenly, looks to the bored ATTENDANT who nods
          towards the back. Martin moves past college kids on
          Facebook, to a dim back corridor, a door marked "Manner," and
          what's he's looking for: a back door, cracked.

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT

          Martin slips into the alley, trots towards the street,
          glancing back. No one is following.
          He moves onto the street, waits at a light... eyes lock onto
          the familiar "Ace Taxi" logo of a taxi passing...

          SUDDEN FLASH OF MEMORY --: CARTWHEELING TAXI...
          Silent freefall dive. The 'Ace Taxis' logo... The face in
          the mirror. Looking back at him. Gina. Eyes meet...

          I /E. TAXI DEPOT - BUCHER STRASSE - EARLY MORNING
          Revving ENGINES. Echoing VOICES. Hunched against the
          drizzle, Martin pauses outside it. The playing card 'Ace
          Taxis' logo. Martin ducks under the open steel shutters...

          INT. 'ACE' TAXIS - DISPATCH OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

          The DEPOT MANAGER, a bully with a face like boiled meat,
          rants at Martin in German. BIKO, a gentle-looking Somalian,
          translates. His English is impeccable.

                         BIKO
          He says he doesn't care if she
          saved your life... the bitch cost
          him 20,000 Euros... the insurance
          won't cover the cab because she
          had no license... the driver who
          was letting her moonlight in his
          taxi, skipped town...
          The depot manager's rage reaches a Hitlerian climax...

                         BIKO (CONT'D)
          . He says illegal immigrants
          are destroying German society...

                         MARTIN
          So. I'm guessing he doesn't know
          where she is.

                         BIKO

                         (SMALL BEAT)
          No one knows where she is.
          Martin studies Biko, nods.

                         MARTIN
          Please thank him for his time.

          EXT. TAXI DEPOT BUCHER STRASSE - EARLY MORNING

          Biko exits the depot, starts to tuck in Ipod earphone when
          Martin catches up with him, meets his pace.

                         BIKO
          Hey, American. I'm sorry we
          couldn't help you --

                         MARTIN
          You know where she is. You
          paused. I could tell.

          Please, I just want to thank her.
          She saved my life.
          Biko eyes him, wary...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I thought, maybe she could use my
          help. Maybe I could give her
          some money...

                         (SOFTENING)
          I just want to thank her.
          Please.
          Martin puts out his hand, sincere. Biko sizes him up, then
          takes his hand, shakes it.

                         BIKO
          Solomon... Solomon Obiko. My
          friends just call me Biko.

                         MARTIN
          Martin. Martin Harris.

          INT. HASIR CAFE - CONTINUOUS

          Berlin's 'Little Istanbul'. A Turkish working man's joint.
          Steam rises around a busy food counter. Condensation on the
          windows.
          GINA picks up steaming food from the kitchen, drops it off
          with two Turkish men, chats with them briefly in fast
          Turkish. There's a bruise around her eye, now healing.
          She moves to the register where a beefy OWNER counts off a
          week's pay and stuffs it in an envelope for her. She thanks
          him in German, tucks it away and ducks behind the counter to
          steam milk for a coffee. Glances up... freezes.

          ACROSS THE COUNTER: MARTIN
          . Stares at her, gauging her reaction. A long moment, she
          looks back down to her work.

                         MARTIN
          You remember me. You know who I
          am.
          She finishes the Turkish coffee, starts another.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I was in your taxi.

                         GINA
          I don't drive a taxi.
          She takes the two drinks towards a table. He follows.
          Across the room, the owner eyes them.

                         MARTIN
          No, you do. I was in your taxi,
          we crashed. Why did you leave?
          Why didn't you talk to the
          police? Hey!
          She puts up a hand, calming him.

                         GINA
          Okay. Okay. How did you find
          me?

                         MARTIN
          Your friend, Biko.
          (cutting her off)
          It's not his fault. I told him I
          had money for you.

                         GINA
          Do you?

                         MARTIN
          No. I mean, not now. I --
          Gina laughs, shakes her head, tries to push by him. He gets
          in her way. Eyes from around the room track.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Please. Listen to me, I've been
          in the hospital, since the
          accident. My memory, it's... I
          don't remember what happened but
          something is going on and there
          are some people I need you to
          speak to. I need you to tell
          them what happened.
          Gina ducks back behind the counter.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Look, things have been happening
          to me. I think I'm being
          followed.
          That got her attention. Her eyes lift, scan outside.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You're my only link to before
          everything went...

                         GINA

                         (MOVING AWAY)
          Crazy?

                         MARTIN
          Yes, crazy... but it's true.

          You have to help me --
          She rounds on him. Patience snapping. Pushes through doors,
          gesturing him with her into...

          INT. KITCHEN, HASIR CAFE - CONTINUOUS

          .pots, pans, food bubbles. Immigrant cooks work, glace up
          but speak no English. Gina, really angry.

                         GINA
          What do you expect me to do? I'm
          an illegal, driving a taxi
          without a permit, in an accident
          without insurance. If the cops
          catch up with me they'll throw me
          in jail. If I'm in jail, I lose
          everything, understand? If I'm
          in jail, they deport me.

                         MARTIN
          You're not listening to me --

                         GINA
          No! It's you who is not
          listening. You're an American.
          Go to your fancy embassy. Go to
          the Police. There a million
          people here who will help you.

                         MARTIN
          But you know who I am.

                         GINA
          No, I don't. What's your name?

                         MARTIN
          Martin Harris, Doctor M --

                         GINA
          Okay, fantastic, you're Martin
          Harris. You're whoever you say
          you are. Yes, I picked you up
          and we crashed. It doesn't mean
          I know who you are!
          She backs off, a hand raised against him. He STARES after
          her, the truth of what she's said hitting him.

                         MARTIN

                         (SUDDENLY)
          Where was I going? In the taxi?

                         GINA
          What...?
          (beat, softening)
          To the airport. Arrivals. You
          were in a hurry.

                         MARTIN
          But I'd just arrived. It doesn't
          make any sense...
          She raises her hands, enough. He looks at her, takes in the
          bruise on her face.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You got hurt, too. In the crash.
          (off her shrug)
          Thank you. For saving my life.
          Thank you.

                         GINA
          You'd have done the same.

                         MARTIN
          No. You can't be sure how you'll
          act. Not until something like
          that happens.

                         GINA
          Well... I know me. I jump in
          without thinking. It causes me
          lot of trouble.
          She looks up at him. Meets his eyes square for the first
          time. Then...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          So please. Just leave me alone.
          He nods. She turns, pushes back into the restaurant. He
          watches her explaining to her boss... Then turns away,
          towards a back door.

          INT. US EMBASSY - MORNING

          Fluorescent lights. Linoleum floor. Martin sits in a small
          plastic chair filling out paperwork. Alone. The place is
          closing early for the long weekend.
          A man opens a door, looks at Martin.
          Martin Harris?

          INT. OFFICE. US EMBASSY - DAY

          MARC SPIEGLER is German, fluent English. Patient, but
          wishing he was on his way home as well. He looks over
          Martin's paperwork as Martin places his watch and the
          "Horticus" book on the table.
          Where the form asks for a complaint, Martin has written
          "Identity Theft."

                         SPIEGLER
          (not looking up)
          Have you contacted your Credit
          Card companies?

                         MARTIN
          No. You don't understand. As I
          explained to the last guar -- who
          went home by the way -- it's not
          about Credit Cards. Someone has
          taken over my identity. Someone
          is pretending to be me. Here.
          In Berlin.
          Spiegler nods, sensing this won't be an easy one.

                         SPIEGLER
          Did you contact the local
          authorities?

                         MARTIN
          Yes. They... They believe the
          other man. I need a new
          passport, papers to prove --
          Spiegler sighs, a mixture impatience and sympathy.

                         SPIEGLER
          Why do they believe the other
          man?

                         MARTIN
          Because... Because my wife. He's
          staying with my wife. They must
          be forcing her --
          Spiegler suppresses a small laugh, looks away.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You don't think I know how it
          sounds? Let me ask you this, if
          my wife was having some hot and
          heavy affair with another man,
          why not just leave me? Why this?
          After all, we're in Europe,
          right?

          Spiegler burns, nods.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Look, I need a passport.
          (tapping the forms)
          I need the documents that this
          embassy is supposed to provide.

                         SPIEGLER
          Do you know, the things people
          will do to get a US Passport...?

                         (BEAT)
          Anyway, we're closing until

          Monday?! They've kidnappedmy
          wife. You need to find out who
          this other man is, you need to be
          in contact with my wife --
          Spiegler exhales, cuttint Martin off. He picks up Martin's
          Rolex, glances at the initials. Looks at his copy of
          'Horticus', the inscription on the inside cover. As he does,
          a slip of paper comes loose, Martin picks it up.

                         SPIEGLER
          You understand, we're not a
          detective agency, we...
          Spiegler stops, sensing Martin isn't listening anymore.
          Martin's staring at the slip of paper where on one side is
          scribbled: "28th. Bressler. 12.30 pm..."

                         MARTIN
          I have a meeting with Bressler...

                         SPIEGLER
          What?

                         MARTIN

                         (COLLECTING THINGS)
          Never mind. You've been very
          unhelpful. Earlier a woman
          yelled at me because I had it so
          easy... being an American. Have
          a nice day...
          Spiegler watching him. Second thoughts. Consults his
          address book. Scribbles down a number...

                         SPIEGLER
          Hey. Martin Harris. Here...
          Martin takes it.

          An old friend. He needs work,
          and he's good at finding things.
          He may be able to help you.

          INT. ENTRANCE HALL, TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY - DAY

          Cavernous lobby, echoing VOICES and FOOTSTEPS. Ancient
          brickwork and tile contrast with new-age furniture and
          technology. An atomic clock reads 12.35. Martin heads to
          the desk.

                         MARTIN
          Excuse me. I need to find
          Professor Bressler's lab. I have
          an appointment at 12.30... I'm
          late...
          The female RECEPTIONIST behind the desk consults her screen.
          Beat. Frowns.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Your name please?

                         MARTIN
          Dr. Martin Harris. The professor
          knows who I am. We scheduled
          this meeting weeks ago.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          The professor knows you?

                         MARTIN
          Well, we haven't met, but we've
          been corresponding. He invited
          me here to discuss my thesis.
          Dr. Martin Harris...
          She frowns, rises from the desk.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Wait here please.

                         MARTIN
          Is there some sort of problem?
          No answer, she disappears into a back office. Martin shakes
          his head, exasperated. He scans the building plan on the
          wall... 'Bressler. L.P - Molekulare Botanik - 305'...
          Suddenly about-turns, heads for the stairs. The woman out of
          the office. SEES him.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Nein... eingang ist verboten:

          She quickly grabs the phone on the desk, speed-dialing.

          INT. BRESSLER'S LABORATORY - MORNING

          Surreal. Rows of head-height CORN in a large humid chamber
          under bright lights. Above, ancient rusting girders and
          brick. Insects HUM. RESEARCH STUDENTS clip seed spikelets,
          bagging and logging the samples.
          Martin slips quickly in through a door, unseen. Heat and
          moisture hitting him. Above the drone of bugs... VOICES.
          Martin tenses. He recognizes one of them...

          MARTIN B (O.C.)
          Drakea, named after Anthea
          Drake, the English botanist who
          wondered how it manages to
          reproduce when it doesn't appear
          to attract any insects...
          A wave of anger... that's Martin's work he's discussing!

          THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAB - MARTIN B WITH BRESSLER...

                         BRESSLER
          It's puzzling, one wonders how --
          Bressler stops talking. Stares past Martin B at MARTIN,
          heading toward them down a corn row, eyes burning.

                         MARTIN
          Professor Bressler...
          Martin B turns, sees him. His eyes harden. But it's
          Bressler who speaks first. Alarmed, indignant:

                         BRESSLER
          This laboratory is a restricted
          area. Who are you?

                         MARTIN
          It's all right, Professor...

                         MARTIN B
          What the hell are you doing here?

                         BRESSLER
          You know this man?

                         MARTIN B
          -- how did you get in here? Are
          you absolutely out of your mind?

                         MARTIN
          Professor. He is not Martin
          Harris. I am Martin Harris.

                         CONTINUED:
          That's a conversation stopper. Bressler looks to Martin B...
          who shakes his head, embarrassed. Martin pointing:

                         MARTIN B
          oh, Jesus...
          A phone RINGS somewhere in the room. It's picked up.

                         BRESSLER
          So what is this? Some sort of
          hybridized propagation? There
          are two Martin Harrises?

                         MARTIN B
          No... let me explain. This man
          showed up at the hotel last
          night. Security had to remove
          him. The police were called...

                         MARTIN
          I called the police, you
          sonofabitch --!

                         MARTIN B
          -- seems he checked himself out
          of the hospital. He was in an
          accident of some sort.
          . one of the research students CALLS to Bressler in German.
          Martin catches the word "polizei". A surge of panic. He
          looks around. Sees a straw he can grasp at...

                         MARTIN
          Drakea Drakensis... Miss Drake
          was wrong...
          . the PLANT SAMPLE on the table behind Bressler.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          A single insect was attracted,
          but she couldn't see it. It's
          too small and it moves too fast.
          Thynnidae. It's a kind of wasp,
          but it looks like an ant. Only
          the males have wings. The orchid
          re-produces the pheromones of the
          female wasp to lure it in. It's
          a trick. It's pretending to be
          something it isn't...
          Bressler looks to Martin. Surprised... curious now. Martin
          sees his opening. Hope in his voice...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          We talked... you and I... on the
          phone...

          we discussed your interest in
          alternative forms of propagation.
          I told you about my father, a
          school teacher... his passion for
          science... how he passed that on

          I said I'd like to do the

          about your children... Two
          girls... right? Yeah... their --
          His voice falters... tails off into silence. Searching his
          memory. Expression shifting to one of panic...

          You... you told me their names...
          I can't... I know them... I...

          ... Laurel, and Lily.
          Martin frozen as Martin B goes on...

          MARTIN B (CONT'D)
          Twins... ten years old. The same
          age I was when I told my father I
          wanted to be a botanist. We
          discussed that on the phone,
          Professor... how I'd never seen
          him so happy.
          Martin sways on his feet, sweat beading...

                         MARTIN
          No! That wasn't you. Don't you

          Martin B suddenly seems to SNAP.

          MARTIN B (CONT'D)
          This is my wife we're talking
          about! My father, whom I loved.
          You may think it's funny, but
          it's my life. Whatever sick
          pleasure this gives you -- I'm
          tired of it. I'm done. You need
          to... STOP.
          Martin just STARES at the Martin B who's shaking, upset.
          Like looking in a mirror that has taken your emotions.

                         MARTIN

          cards, New Hampshire driver's license... a PHOTOGRAPH in the
          wallet's plastic sleeve...
           Martin sees the photograph. His EYES WIDEN...

          TAKES SHAPE. A familiar bearded FACE...

          INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, WALDFRIEDE HOSPITAL - DAY

          DR. FARGE fans a penlight across Martin's eyes. Propped
          up on a gurney. Flinches at the glare.

                         FARCE
          The police brought you here. The
          mistake was mine. I should never
          have let you leave.
          Martin blinks, bleary. Farge talks briefly to the nurse in
          German. She nods, starts prepping a hypodermic at a table.
          Farge looks back to Martin. Explains gently:

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          Confusion... memory loss... the
          complete or partial loss of
          identity... these are common
          stages in recovery. Some
          temporary, others longer term.
          We're going to do an MRI. Try to
          find out what's happening.
          Martin stares out the window, not fighting, hardly listening.
          A bird alights on a branch.

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          The mind is like a jigsaw puzzle.
          The pieces fit together to create
          the person we are. With major
          trauma, the puzzle is shattered.
          But the brain's ability to
          recover is remarkable. The mind
          needs a narrative, an identity...
          a soul. Without memory, without
          a past, we are nothing. In the
          coma state, memories are rebuilt.
          In some cases the pieces move.
          In others they go missing. And
          sometimes... completely new
          pieces are found.
          The bird flies off. Martin's eyes track... empty.

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          Comas sometimes perform a kind of
          alchemy. A patient awakes
          convinced of a reality that was
          previously only fantasy.

          feels like, to become insane?

          Martin looks over, Farge almost RECOILS at the intensity in
          Martin's eyes. Fear. Loss. Anger.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)

                         (ALMOST CALM)
          It's like a war, between what you

          He taps his forehead.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          .and what you believe.
          His hand moves down his body to his chest, taps his heart.
          He LEANS towards Farge.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          .who do you think wins?
          Martin SMILES. Tight, hurting, fatalistic. Farge, almost
          afraid, nods to the nurse who slips the needle in.

          sound DEAFENING. Scanner moving over him...
          Martin's eyes empty... far far away.

          SMASH CUT INTO MEMORY - FRACTURED IMAGES...
          Undulating bodies moving over each other, Martin and Liz
          making love. Urgency building. Suddenly SHIFTING...

          . Martin B and Liz drinking in the hotel bar... she leaning
          over, whispering to him, intimate.

          BACK TO SCENE -- SUDDEN QUIET
          an abrupt jolt. Electric WHINE. Platform moves, sliding
          Martin out of the tube. His eyes open, take in the room.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- TWO ORDERLIES
          .tending to him. One raises a needle, injects a CLOUDY
          SUBSTANCE into Martin's IV bag...
          .The MRI Control Booth, empty. Martin squints, a little
          confused. He raises his eyes, looks into the face of the man
          from the Internet Cafe! Call him JONES.

                         MARTIN
          his mind struggles to compute. The sudden overwhelming
          realization that he's not insane. This man is HERE. His
          eyes DART as the other orderly glances over, the man from the
          train tunnel. Call him SMITH. He smiles at Martin, polite,
          nondescript. Ghostly in his disinterest.

                         JONES
          Hello, Martin. This won't take
          very long.
          Martin tries to raise up but can't move -- his arms and legs
          are like lead. He opens his mouth to call out, his voice
          barely a murmur. His eyes lock on the IV bag, the steady
          drip... drip... down the line into his body...
          The two men quickly lift Martin, hefting him face-down onto a
          gurney. One arm dangles.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V.-- STRAIGHT DOWN
          -- The Men's shoes, thick soled, black. Linoleum Tile.
          Wheels of the gurney.
          -- Jones, stuffing his clothes and effects into a plastic
          bag, tossing them under the gurney. Smith pushing...

                         NURSE
          (German, subtitles:)
          Excuse me, where are you taking
          this patient?
          Martin's vision RACKS, traces the Nurse's white sneakers,
          standing in the now open doorway to the room. Martin STRAINS
          to yell, to speak, nothing. He can just move his head enough
          to eyeball the IV. Drip... drip... drip...

          We have instruction to move this
          patient to the American Hospital
          at Wiesbaden. Here are the
          papers.
          The rustle of paper. Martin CONCENTRATES, eyes on the IV
          tube, hanging between the bars of the gurney and his arm.
          Great Effort, He LEANS, pinching the tube closed.
          CLOSE ON THE IV: The drips... stop.

                         NURSE
          (German, subtitles:)
          I'm surprised I wasn't
          informed... Let me check with --
          A SOUND, like paper torn quick...
          and THE NURSE FALLS TO THE FLOOR, STARING UP AT MARTIN,

          HER THROAT CUT.
          Martin gazes down at her in HORROR as she bleeds out, staring
          upwards at him, the light in her eyes dying.
          Around him Smith and Jones start to MOVE, locking the door,
          opening cabinets, working fast, Martin's eyes lock on: a pair
          of scissors, tucked in her apron.
          Eyes watering, adrenaline surging, Martin WILLS his hand to
          reach down, palm the scissors, just as the Nurse's body is
          dragged away, leaving a trail of red...

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

          The MRI ROOM door opens, the two 'orderlies' wheel the barely
          conscious Martin out into the corridor. Behind them, the
          room is spotless.
          They round a corner, almost at the EXIT... Doors ahead BLOW
          OPEN. Doctors, Paramedics rushing forward with various
          WOUNDED on gurneys. Something big has happened.
          Smith and Jones eye the madness coming their way, command
          decision, they duck into

          INT. PATIENT'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          . where a feeble OLD MAN mumbles at them from his bed.
          They ignore the man, go about checking Martin. Jones lifts
          his head, pries open one eyelid after the other while Smith
          ties down his arms, covers him with a sheet.

                         CONTINUED:
          Suddenly, the door OPENS. A DOCTOR, breathless.

                         DOCTOR
          (German, subtitles:)
          You two. We need help!. Right
          now!
          (off their hesitation)

          COME ON! NOW!
          No choice. They exit after the doctor, Jones glancing back
          at Martin as the door swings shut behind them.
          A beat. The covered shape on the gurney starts to MOVE.
          Martin's hand saws back and forth, using the scissors to cut
          the straps that bind him.
          ACROSS, the Old Man tracks the motion... scared.
          Success! A strap gives way. Martin paws the blanket weakly
          away. Feels along his arm, and pulls out the IV. Blood
          drips. He rises up, trying to orient...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- FLARED, DISTORTED
          . the old MAN staring at him... DAZZLING daylight framed by
          a window... strange reverberating ECHOES...

                         MARTIN
          . pulls himself upright. Tries to stand, but his body is
          like Jello. Reaches out, grabs the leg of a steel equipment
          trolley which TEETERS... CRASHES to the floor, showering
          Martin with a CASCADE of instruments and dressings.

          INT. RECOVERY ROOM (ALONG CORRIDOR) - SAME

          ALARMS RING. Emergency team clusters around a lifeless
          PATIENT, working fast. Smith and Jones, resentfully holding
          drip bags. They heard that. Turn, eyes meeting. Set down
          their drip bags. Edge back toward the door...

          INT. HALLWAY, HOSPITAL - SAME

          Smith and Jones, hurrying down the hall. Quick check
          into the patient's room reveals Martin GONE, the old man
          GESTURING, panicked...
          They moves on, fast, around a corner into...

                         CONTINUED:

          A FAMILIAR FIGURE
          shuffling towards the doors! Given away by the plastic
          bag and the hospital gown showing under the jacket.
          BAM! Entrance doors SLAM OPEN. PARAMEDICS charge in,
          wheeling in MORE ACCIDENT PATIENTS on a gurneys past Martin
          as he exits. Smith and Jones break into a run, trying to
          press through TWO MORE CREWS coming through with more CRASH

          VICTIMS...

          EXT. HOSPITAL E.R. ARRIVALS - SAME

          CHAOS here. Ambulances arriving, departing. Crews slamming
          their rigs closed, taking off, SIRENS WAILING. Other
          arriving with wounded...
          Smith and Jones rush out of the hospital doors, pull up. The
          many ambulances, the crowds... no sign of Martin.

          I/E. AMBULANCE/ BERLIN STREETS - SHORT WHILE LATER
          Cop cars and fire trucks surround an accident scene where a
          truck has side-swiped a trolley-car. Ambulance pulls up
          behind them. PARAMEDICS jump out, one of them pulling open
          the back doors...
          startles as he finds Martin, now dressed back in his
          clothes, a reassuring hand held up, climbing out unsteadily:

                         MARTIN
          It's okay... I'm fine...
          Paramedic would do something, but his colleague's YELLING at
          him to hurry. Just has to watch Martin go...

          EXT. FRIEDRICHSTRASSE, BERLIN MITTE - DAY

          . weaving down the busy sidewalk, buffeting against annoyed
          shoppers. Looks behind to see if he's being followed.
          Nobody. Keeps pressing on, finally arriving at

          A FOOD CART
          tended by a Middle-Eastern Man who stares at Martin.
          Martin eyes warm Gyros and Souvlakis, rummages for money...
          comes out with just a slip of paper with writing on it: The
          slip the man from the embassy wrote on.
          He focuses, his mind clearing: A name: Jurgen. An address.
          It's something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          A CORONER's hand slides a zipper closed, past the lifeless
          eyes of the Nurse.

          ACROSS THE ROOM
          The two DETECTIVES from the Hotel Imperial sit with Farge who
          pours himself a drink with remorseful hands. The entire
          scene in German, subtitled:

                         FARGE
          .The man's condition was
          unusual, yes. But there was
          nothing to indicate violence.

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          Is he still dangerous?
          Farge watches the Coroner wheel away the Nurses's body.

                         FARGE
          To someone who threatens that
          fantasy...? Yes. I believe he
          is.

          INT. S-BAHN - NIGHT

          Metro train car almost empty, save for a few noticeably down-
          at-heel passengers. Martin looks up at the map.

          EXT. MARZAHN, EAST BERLIN - NIGHT

          Bleak, uniform blocks of Communist-era housing. Graffiti-
          covered walls: hammers and sickles, swastikas... Martin stops
          outside one, checks the address on the card.

          INT. APARTMENT BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

          Urine stench. Water pooling on concrete. 'Gebrochen' sign
          blocking off the elevator. Martin climbs the steps.
          Approaching FOOTFALLS, SHOUTS from above. A group of young
          SKINHEADS thunders past him, on downward...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          INT. FIFTH FLOOR, APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

          Martin presses a bell. Hears it RINGING. No answer. A door
          behind him OPENS. A grey-haired LADY peers out. A beat.
          Martin tries the BELL again. COUGHING from inside, the sound
          of a LOCK. The door half opens...
          revealing ERNST JURGEN. Piercing eyes in a face far
          older than its sixty-some years. Frayed suit jacket, stained
          shirt; grey hair yellowed by nicotine.

                         JURGEN
          Alles in ordnung, Frau Brunner.
          He smiles. Frau Brunner retreats back behind her door.
          Jurgen turns to Martin. Eyes reading him.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Come in. Come in.

          INT. JURGEN APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Jurgen leads Martin down a hallway piled with books.

                         JURGEN
          Siegler used to work for me.
          Did he tell you that?
          His laughter becomes a COUGH that racks his body. Lets it
          pass, before ushering Martin into a tiny living room.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Sit down...
          Points Martin toward a battered chair. opens a bottle of
          cheap brandy, pours two glasses. Turns to find Martin
          looking at FRAMED PHOTOS on the sideboard...
          . a YOUNGER JURGEN in East German army uniform... in a
          large office... smiling beside a Russian-made sedan...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          The Staatssicherheit. The
          Ministry for State Security.

                         MARTIN
          That's where Spiegler worked for
          you? The secret police?

                         JURGEN
          A true believer, like the rest of
          us. Now look at him. I should
          have had him shot.
          Another laugh, more COUGHING. Hands Martin a brandy.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          He forgot. Germans are experts
          at forgetting. We forgot we were
          Nazis. Now we've forgotten forty
          years of Communism. All gone.
          But it's not just history that's
          forgotten. It's people, too.
          He sinks into a chair. Tired smile.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          But enough of me...

          LATER -- SMOKE RISES FROM A CIGARETTE
          Jurgen jots notes in a pad. Hand unsteady, he perches his
          cigarette on the ashtray, picks up the 'Horticus'.

                         MARTIN
          I always have it with me. It was
          a gift from my father...
          Jurgen flips it open. Notices the inscription, the NUMBERS
          written inside the front endpaper. A beat.

                         JURGEN
          These mean anything to you?

                         MARTIN
          No. It's my wife's handwriting.

                         JURGEN
          So, they mean something to her.
          He looks to Martin. Direct.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Her involvement in this. There
          must have been something... in
          the past... some indication?
          A beat. Martin shakes his head, at a loss. Jurgen leafs
          on... the piece of CARD drops from between the pages. Jurgen
          picks it up. Martin's notations from the night before in the
          train: times... dates... places.

                         MARTIN
          My schedule... for this week.
          It's everything I remember.
          Jurgen turns over the card. German print. A cheery cartoon
          Uncle Sam: 'Uncle Sam's Bowling & Billiards'.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          My friend Rodney Cole told us to
          go, said it was a blast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          LATER STILL -- JURGEN
          Tapping his pencil on the pad... intrigued.

                         JURGEN
          Passport, credit cards, family
          photos... things like these take
          time to prepare. You say this
          man has detailed knowledge of
          your research, of your
          relationship with...

                         MARTIN
          Professor Bressler. He knows
          everything...

                         JURGEN
          Including the fact that you were
          going to have a random accident
          that would allow him seamlessly
          to take your place? These people
          may be good, but they're not God.
          The question is, why would they
          want to take your place? What
          could they gain from being you?

                         MARTIN
          They tried to kill me.

                         JURGEN
          Yes, did you a favor I'd say.
          Now you have... Redlichkeit...
          Now you know you are right.

                         MARTIN
          Do you believe me?
          A beat. Jurgen pours them both another brandy.

                         JURGEN
          In the Stasi, we had a basic
          principle: Ask enough questions
          and a man who is lying will
          eventually change his story. But
          a man who tells the truth cannot
          change his, however unlikely his
          story sounds. I believe you are
          telling the truth, Doctor Harris.
          A long beat. Jurgen closes the notebook.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          I'll start by calling these
          numbers again... as you say, it's
          Thanksgiving...

          and there's the time difference,
          so it may take time to make
          contact. And then there is the
          question...

                         MARTIN
          of money... ?

                         JURGEN
          Yes. Of money.
          Martin takes off his Rolex. Sets it on the table.

                         MARTIN
          It's all I have. I'll pay you in
          cash as soon as I can.
          Jurgen nods, picks up the watch. Turns it, looks at the
          engraving on the back. As Martin turns to leave...

                         JURGEN
          Doctor Harris...
          A wince of pain as Jurgen gets up. Lifts a tea tin off the
          shelf. Opens it. Takes out a hundred Euros...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          A loan against your guarantee.

                         MARTIN
          Thank you.

                         JURGEN
          I'll need twenty-four hours.
          Call me tomorrow afternoon. Do
          you have a place to stay?
          A long beat. Off Martin's FACE...

          INT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT

          Gina is cleaning up for the night, counting her tips, jotting
          numbers in a small notebook. The television plays the
          evening news quietly. In a corner, her boss is tallying the
          days receipts at a table.
          Gina ducks under the counter, calls out to a man who's parked
          in a corner seat, out of sight.

                         GINA
          (Turkish, subtitled:)
          Hey, friend. We're closing...
          The man looks up: It's Martin. He's exhausted, wet. His
          eyes full of need and fear.

                         GINA (CONT'D)

                         (STEPPING BACK)
          I thought I told you to --

                         MARTIN
          I'm sorry. Please. I had
          nowhere else to go...
          She starts to respond, holds it back. Nods.

                         GINA
          I know the feeling.

                         MARTIN
          I just need to know. The man you
          picked up, the man who's life you
          saved. That was me, right? It
          was me.
          She looks down at him, moved. Eyes track his wedding ring.

                         GINA
          You're married. What about your
          wife?

                         MARTIN
          I... don't know.

                         (BEAT)
          Can you imagine what it's like,
          to wake up one day, and your
          life... has been erased.
          Beat. He starts to rise, collect himself.

                         GINA
          It was you. Martin Harris. You.

                         MARTIN

                         (NODDING)
          Thank you.
          He starts to go. She puts a hand on his arm. He stares at
          it. Human contact.

                         GINA
          Don't be an idiot. Come on...
          He hesitates, then lets her lead him out of the cafe.
          In the corner, the owner watches them go. The TV NEWS
          changes, flashes a special. The Owner looks up:
          ON TELEVISION: Martin's face, caught by a camera at the
          hospital. Juxtaposed next to it, a smiling picture of the
          Nurse. German text scrolls: "Wanted for Murder..."
          The Owner's hand moves, picks up the phone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

          E/I. STREET / RANGE ROVER - NIGHT
          The Brown Range Rover idles on the street. Exhaust plumes.
          Inside, two figures statue in silence. Smith and Jones.
          Waiting. The engine idles, the vents blow heat. Suddenly,
          an ELECTRONIC SCRAMBLER on the dashboard SQUAWKS in German.

          EXT. BERLIN STREETS - NIGHT

          Martin and Gina walk side by side, unused to the company.

                         GINA
          So, how long are you married?

                         MARTIN
          .Five years.

                         GINA
          Where did you meet her?

                         MARTIN
          Yale... I was a teaching
          assistant. Liz heard me lecture.

                         GINA
          And there's no way she just
          didn't... recognize you?
          He shakes his head. They reach the cement steps of an
          overpass, climb.

                         MARTIN
          .You don't have to believe me.
          It's crazy, I know.
          Gina pauses, stares through chain-link at the cars below.

                         GINA
          Everyone has a story... Where
          they came from, where they are
          going, what happened to them.
          Why they're not happy, or
          alone.
          ( l ooking over)
          Who cares what I believe. It's
          bullshit. All that matters is...
          (pokes his chest)
          Who you are, what you do, right
          now.
          She reaches in her jacket. Opens the notebook she was
          writing in. Columns of figures.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          This is me. 2,259 Euros and
          counting. The number's the only
          thing that changes. I reach
          4000, I can buy papers...

                         (BEAT)
          Or maybe I'll come home one day
          and find a stranger who claims to
          be me. I'd like that. Walk
          away. Leave it all behind.

                         (BEAT)
          You could do that.
          Martin shakes his head.

                         MARTIN
          I'd still have my memories.

                         GINA
          You see? We're different. You
          like your memories. very
          American of you.
          He nods. She shrugs, turns away.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Come on...

          INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Key in the lock, door opens. Gina shows Martin in.
          Run-down but clean. Rainwater seeps in through the window.
          Martin sits, watches Gina as she goes to a sideboard and
          uncorks a bottle. Pours Martin a glass of clear liquor.

                         GINA
          Slivovic.

                         MARTIN
          Thank you.
          He takes a sip. Then another. Gina watching him. Muffled
          TV and arguing VOICES in Turkish from the floor below.

                         GINA
          The walls are made of
          cardboard... but it's home.
          Another smile, tired. A long beat. Abruptly, Gina gets up
          and leaves the room. Sound of drawers opening.

          GINA (O.S.)(CONT'D)
          You can sleep on the floor in
          there. I have an extra mattress.

          She reappears... tosses something to Martin. A sweater, a
          pair of man's jeans. Before he can speak...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Don't ask.

          EXT. INTERNET CAFE, STRAUSBERGER PLATZ - NIGHT

          Night-owl STUDENTS and BACK-PACKERS at rows of terminals,
          fingers tapping. The unlikely figure of Jurgen waits in the
          line at the counter. Signs in, gets his swipe key.

          AT A COMPUTER TERMINAL
          Moment's thought, Jurgen types Martin Harris Ph.D into the
          search window. Hits return.
          CLOSE on the list, the same Martin got. No pictures.
          Jurgen writes something in his notebook. Types again...
          'World Bio-technology Forum' homepage. Schedule...
          delegates... speakers... photo of Bressler, sub-heading:

          Sudden shift of focus, someone approaching the podium.
          Security move to intercept. EXPLOSIVE FLASH of a grenade.
          Blood on the lens, hand-held pandemonium.

          INT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT

          The Cafe Owner is still watching the local news, looking for
          another glimpse of Martin. Door jingles. He glances over to
          see two men, one holding up a POLICE Badge.

                         CAFE OWNER
          (German, subtitled:)
          You guys are quick...
          The BADGE lowers. It's Jones. Looks utterly nonthreatening,
          plain. But the Owner's voice falters.

          INT. GINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Martin sets the borrowed clothing down on the bed, looks
          around himself as he takes off his jacket.
          Intimate, to be in here. Photographs on a cluttered vanity:
          Old country, Bosnia. Men in suits and women in long dresses.
          Children, a boy and two girls... Gina?

          IN THE KITCHEN
          Gina goes to the fridge, removes a pot of plain stew and sets
          it on the stove. She uses a spoon to pull off a chunk of
          fatty meat. Drops it on a chipped plate and opens the
          window...
          leaning out into the rain, Gina reaches up, slides the
          plate onto a sloping roof above. Excited YOWLS as stray cats
          come running from every direction.
          Gina ducks back inside, pulls the window shut, glances
          towards the cracked door to her bedroom as she ducks into the
          bathroom, turns on the hot water...

                         GINA

                         (CALLING OUT)
          The light's bust so you have to
          leave the door open if you want
          to see anything. Don't worry, I
          won't peek.

          EXT. GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          The RANGE ROVER pulls up outside the building.

          INT. GINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Martin takes off his shirt, lays it down. Notices several
          charcoal drawings, tucked behind a radiator. He pulls a few
          out. A lonely man in the park. A woman with her child.
          Dark, shadowed... Beautiful.
          Gina clears her throat. Martin looks over, sees Gina
          standing in the doorway, realizes.

                         MARTIN
          Oh. I'm sorry, I just... I'm
          sorry. Did you do these?

                         GINA
          I give you a place to stay, it
          doesn't give you the right to --

                         MARTIN
          No, you're right...
          (putting them back)
          I'm sorry. They're beautiful.
          You should --

                         GINA
          I should what? Have been an
          artist? Perhaps in Bosnia...
          (beat, quoting him)
          "Can you imagine what it's like,
          to wake up one day. And your
          whole life... has been erased?"
          He STARES at her, moved. That connection again. He looks
          away. Looks back again...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          What is it?

                         MARTIN
          Your eyes... It's the one thing
          I remember about the accident.
          Your eyes in the mirror...
          He tails off. Face-to-face...
          BANG! BANG! Pounding on the door. Gina motions Martin out
          of sight as she opens the door...
          .It's Biko, the soft-spoken Somali taxi-driver. He grins.
          Tries teasingly to peek past her into the apartment.

                         BIKO
          You got company?
          She puts her foot against the door, inscrutable. Biko drops
          a set of keys into her hand.

                         BIKO (CONT'D)
          Bring it back to my place. Leave
          the keys on the TV. And don't
          forget to reset the meter.

                         GINA
          You're the best.
          She pecks him on the cheek. Biko pushes in the door, just a
          little, but enough to catch Martin, in his undershirt,
          carrying the rest of his clothes, halfway to the shower.

                         MARTIN
          I'm... I'm just going... in here.
          Biko looks at Gina, raises an eyebrow.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         GINA
          Yes, that's right. I sleep with
          every married American you send
          my way -- Thank you for that, by
          the way.

                         BIKO
          Hey, no need to explain to me.

                         GINA
          Get on your way! Go!
          She pushes him out, closes the door. The stew has started to
          SMOKE. Gina moves it off the burner.

          IN THE STAIRWELL
          Biko trots down stairs, laughing to himself. Passes two men,
          working on the PHONE BOX tucked below the stairs.

                         BIKO
          (German, subtitled:)
          Hey, while you're at it, check
          the line to number eight. She's
          always getting bad service.
          One of the men lifts his face. It's JONES. Biko takes them
          in, their clothes... frowns.

          EXT. PAY PHONE, KARL MARXSTRASSE - NIGHT

          Jurgen making a call, rain dripping off his coat.
          "The Eye". Banks of CCTV SCREENS monitoring Tegel's
          passenger areas. Night-shift STAFF sip coffee.
          An incoming CALL. DESK OFFICER answers. Calls to an older
          UNIFORMED MAN, who picks up, punches a button.

          JURGEN (O.S.)
          (German, subtitles:)
          Hans. It's Colonel Jurgen. From

          INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Gina punches PLAY on an old boom-box and a cool Bosnian hip-
          hop groove plays. She spoons some of the stew into a bowl,
          sets it on the table.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Martin lets the hot water run over his head, drip across his
          face, allowing himself a tiny moment of relaxation.

          IN THE KITCHEN
          BANG! BANG! Knocking on the door again. Gina puts the bowl
          in the sink, heads for the door.

                         GINA
          Just a moment, Biko. And you're
          going to be late --
          She throws open the door... SMITH and JONES press in! Jones
          clamping a hand over her mouth.
          Watching them work is awe-inspiring, chilling. There's no
          wasted motion whatsoever. Their faces calm, observant.
          Jones holds Gina, gun covers the dark entrance to the
          bathroom where the shower still runs as Smith turns the music
          up LOUD, then opens the oven, blows out the pilot light,
          turns on the gas...
          CLOSE ON THE GAS -- A hazy layer, rippling over the floor...
          Smith grabs a candle off Gina's table, lights its wick,
          sets it on top of the stove.

          IN THE DARK BATHROOM
          PRESSED against the wall, trapped, fully aware of what's
          _ going on, Martin. He's pulled on clothes. By looking in the
          small mirror over the sink, he can see the men going about
          their work. He can see their weapons.
          His eyes SEARCH for anything useful, anything at all.
          There's nothing. He reaches towards the small window to the
          exterior. It swings open, revealing the FIRE ESCAPE beyond.

          IN THE APARTMENT
          The gas HISSES as it spills into the room. Smith grabs the
          bottle of alcohol, douses Gina as with one hand Jones
          produces a hypodermic...
          . A LOW THUMP from the bathroom. Smith REACTS instantly,
          KICKS in the bathroom door, gun lined...

                         CONTINUED:
          . on NOTHING. The empty shower runs. The window to the
          exterior swings gently.

                         GINA
          Terror-stricken, realizing Martin has abandoned her.
          Jones nods to Smith who goes out the door, covers the hall.
          Jones FLIPS Gina onto her stomach, presses her face to the
          floor, pulling down the top of her pants as he prepares to
          inject her with the hypodermic.
          She struggles, SCREAMS IN RAGE, chokes on the gas. Her EYES
          WIDEN as Jones slides the needle in, starts to PRESS...
          . CRASH! Martin blasts in from the fire escape, through
          the window nearest them, catching Jones in the face, cutting
          his face. He tumbles over -- his gun sliding away...

          MARTIN AND JONES
          . Tumble together, SMASH into the sideboard which
          collapses, splintering into the kitchen.
          Martin tries to hit Jones who easily deflects the blow, leaps
          cat-like to his feet, moving towards his gun as Smith re-
          enters, weapon drawn, and FREEZES, his eyes tracking:
          THE CANDLE, teetering on the stove... now falling over...
          rolling...
          Jones, Smith, Martin... all track the candle, its progress
          towards the edge of the stove...
          Jones and Smith RUN towards the door. Martin grabs Gina,
          HAULS her towards the bedroom as the candle falls...
          KABOOM --!!! GAS EXPLODES. Doors SPLINTER outward...
          . BLAST hurls Gina and Martin onto the bedroom floor.
          Martin covering Gina. PRESSURE WAVE sweeps over them,
          burning debris raining.

          FRACTURED VISION... TINNITUS DAZE...
          Fires spreading, the main room beyond the bedroom an INFERNO.
          Martin pulls Gina up. They move to the window and the fire
          escape. Gina begins to slide it open...

                         MARTIN
          No, look!
          She tracks his gaze: Down below, Jones exits the building,
          looks up amidst other onlookers. Wipes blood from his face.
          Martin looks around, wild, for anything, his gaze settling
          on: the far wall. Flames FLARE in, growing.

          With a ROAR Martin rushes the wall, IMPACTS it with his
          shoulder, goes right through!

          INT. NEIGHBORING APARTENT - NIGHT

          LANDS HARD in a small empty bedroom, Turkish decorated.
          Drywall and plaster everywhere. Gina follows him through as
          they thread through the abandoned flat out into...

          INT. STAIRWELL, GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Martin and Gina slip out a door, into a crowd of immigrant
          families, other residents fleeing down the stairwell. Smoke
          is thick, flames roar.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- SMITH
          Laying in wait near the entrance to Gina's place. Hand
          tucked in his coat. Gaze RACKS, looking for another way...

                         MARTIN
          We have to go up...
          He starts to pull her, but she's FROZEN, staring in horror.
          Martin tracks her gaze: Biko's body, tucked under the
          stairs. Lifeless eyes stare back.

          EXT. GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          Immigrant families emerge from the flaming building. Jones
          stands next to the Range Rover, eyes tracking the crowd, the
          upper floors, now engulfed in flame...

          EXT. ROOF TOP, GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          Martin and Gina emerge at the top, run to the edge. He
          LEANS... reaching across to the next building...
          BELOW HIM: Five flights down. A mortal fall.
          Martin's hands grip a ledge, pull him over. He reaches back,
          pulls her across. They keep moving...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

          EXT. STREET, KREUZBERG DISTRICT - CONTINUOUS

          Crowds parting as FIRE TRUCKS scream around the corner.
          Smith comes out, the last to exit the building. He meets
          eyes with Jones, satisfied.

          DOWN THE STREET
          Martin and Gina emerge from the neighboring building. See
          Smith climbing into the Range Rover.
          Martin takes Gina's arm, steers her away. Notices an old
          Mercedes Diesel taxi at the curb, covered in debris. Biko's.

                         MARTIN
          The keys. Where are the keys?
          Gina stares at him, lost. Martin reaches into her pockets.
          Finds Biko's keys. He HAULS broken panes, debris off the
          car, manages to get it open. He bundles her inside.

          INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

          Martin fumbles the key into the ignition. He turns it.
          Warning light delay as the diesel's glow-plugs warm up.

                         MARTIN
          C'mon. C'mon...
          IN THE REARVIEW: The Range Rover, making a U-Turn, heading
          their way...

          INT. RANGE ROVER - SAME

          Jones drives, Smith shotgun. They cruise slowly, keeping an
          eye peeled. Pass the debris-covered taxi, empty. They keep
          moving, gaze still tracking. Smith pops his cell phone.

          I./E. TAXI/KREUZBERG DISTRICT STREETS - SAME
          Crouched down, Martin watches in the mirror as the Range
          Rover turns a corner. He restarts the engine, puts the car
          in gear and pulls them away from the curb.
          Gina still in stunned silence. Wipes tears and grime off her
          face. She looks across at Martin. He glances up at the
          mirror...
          sudden change in his expression. Gina turns, sees...

                         CONTINUED:

          BEHIND THEM -- THE BROWN RANGER ROVER
          Four cars back. Jones driving. Smith riding shotgun. Faces
          expressionless as they swerve out into traffic, deftly cut
          back in one vehicle closer to Martin and Gina.
          Gina turns back to Martin. Eyes wide. This can't be
          happening. Adrenaline clearing her mind...

                         GINA
          Left --! Turn left...
          Martin spins the wheel. Taxi swerves across oncoming traffic
          into a SIDE-STREET. Gina waving frantically...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Left again! Left again! Now
          right. Here. HERE!
          Just in time, Martin pulls a right. Cab drifts, SLAMS a wall
          side-on... bounces back into the center of the road.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Jesus!
          A look from Martin: What? Gina glances behind. No sign of
          them. Moment's relief. Turns to her right. Sees the RANGE
          ROVER racing down the parallel side-street...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          They're going to cut us off!
          Right. Turn right -- !
          Martin SCREECHES into a turn. Heads for the parallel alley.
          Range Rover FLASHES through the intersection just ahead.
          Taxi cuts across feet behind them...

          IN THE RANGE ROVER
          Jones spots the taxi in the mirror. BRAKES, high speed
          180... races back up the alley.

          IN THE TAXI
          Martin floors the gas. SCREAMS out into oncoming traffic,
          across a red light. Zig-zags past cars. Edge of control.
          Zooms through open gates into...

          EXT. VOLKSPARK CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

          Tree-lined avenue. Closed GATES at the far end...
          . Range Rover moving fast down the street alongside the
          cemetery. Suddenly cutting left across traffic. Bounces
          over the curb, full-speed into the grounds. 4WD slaloming
          past gravestones, rapidly closing on the taxi...

                         CONTINUED:
          Closed gates ahead. No choice. Martin puts his foot down.
          SMASHES through the gates. Flying hinge SLAMS the windshield
          -- glass instantly spidering opaque...
          Martin driving blind. Careens against the embankment,
          WHIPLASHES up, spin on its axis. Rolling...
          over the edge of the embankment, TUMBLING over and over.
          SLAMS DOWN right way up, axles crumpling. QUIET. Steaming
          HISS of the engine.
          Martin's hands still locked on the wheel. Gina next to him.
          Martin shoves open the door. Clambers out.

          EXT. BERLIN RAIL YARDS - CONTINUOUS

          A maze of tracks and power lines below street level. S-Bahn,
          U-Bahn, high-speed ICE trains, freight... tracks
          disappearing in each direction into tunnels. A sound.
          Martin turns, looks up...
          THE RANGE ROVER, Jones at the wheel... SPOTS THEM. Engine
          GUNS, Range Rover plunges headlong down the embankment...
          Whistling ROAR... as a HIGH SPEED TRAIN hurtles out of the
          one of the tunnels. Martin grabs Gina's hand.

                         MARTIN
          C'mon...!
          Running side-by-side. Train horn BLASTS as they cross right
          in front of it as the Range Rover, cut off, SPINS 90 degrees,
          races down the tracks alongside it.
          Martin and Gina scramble across tracks, towards a tunnel...
          . the Range Rover passes the back of the train. HARD
          right, over the tracks. Too Fast. The car catches air...
          . BELLIES down hard onto the next set of tracks. Front
          tire EXPLODES... . Range Rover SPINS... rear wheels SLAM into
          the track. Another tire BURSTS. Scraping STOP, car
          straddling the rails. Jones shifts into reverse. Rims SPIN
          against metal.

          ACROSS THE TRACKS
          . Martin and Gina sprinting towards the tunnel. Smith
          jumps out of the Range Rover, lines his weapon. BLAM! BLAM!

          INSIDE THE TUNNEL
          Martin and Gina hit the ground, bullets chipping ceramic off
          the walls. Up ahead, illuminated, some utility stairs. Gina
          GASPS air, spent. Martin looks behind them...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SMITH IN SILHOUETTE. COMING IN AFTER THEM.
          Martin GRABS Gina, pulls her after him.

          IN THE RANGE ROVER -- JONES
          Jams shift into 'drive.' Pedal to metal. Four wheel drive
          rims SCREAM on the rails, inches forward. Almost off the
          tracks. A vibration. Jones looks around...

          FREIGHT CARS -- LUMBERING RIGHT FOR HIM...
          Shunted by a rear engine; no way the driver can see him.
          Scrambles for the door. Too late - !
          . FREIGHT TRAIN PLOWS INTO THE RANGE ROVER! Coupling
          smashes through the window. Impales the car, CRUSHING Jones,
          pushing the mangled wreck along the tracks...

          INTO THE TUNNEL
          Range Rover scraping along the wall in a tail of SPARKS.
          Smith dives out of the way. Car wreck and freight cars
          THUNDERING past him...
          .toward Martin and Gina, pelting full-speed... almost on
          them... last second, they DIVE into the alcove... through the
          steel door into the utility access STAIRS.
          Gina doubled, gasping for breath... but they've got to keep
          going. Both staggering up the zig-zag iron steps...

                         SMITH
          Jumps up. Sprints after them. Through the steel door...

          INT. UTILITY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

          Smith sprinting up to a landing. Another landing. Narrow
          tunnel. Booming ECHOES. Rush of AIR. Smith dashes around a
          corner. Slows...

          INT. 'U-BAHN' STATION - CONTINUOUS

          . breathless. Station JAMMED with SOCCER FANS. The bars
          have let out. Faces painted. Singing, drinking, a swarming
          party. A train just emptying, the mass crowding out.

                         UP AHEAD
          Martin and Gina, squeezed together between laughing faces,
          drunken youth, singing, chanting...

          Gina struggling to catch her breath. Relief. Shock. Grief.
          Anger. Martin, looking at her. He knows what she's feeling.
          She meets his eyes a moment, glances back...
          .sees Smith, caught in the crowd, but pushing his way
          towards them.

                         GINA
          Come on...
          They push their way forward through the crush.

          EXT. S-BAHN TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

          The crowd dissipates into the night. Gina takes Martin's
          hands, pulls him along a street of neon club signs, lines of
          youth waiting to get in.
          BEHIND THEM. Smith emerges from the station, tracks them.

          EXT. BERLIN STREET - NIGHT

          Gina hurries them past bars and clubs. They come to a door
          crowded with youths, Middle-Eastern and Balkan.
          Gina pulls Martin to the front. Unfriendly eyes STARE down
          Martin, the huge BOUNCER nods recognition to Gina.

          ON THE STREET
          Smith stops, takes in the many clubs, the various Bouncers
          guarding their doors. Looks down at his boring suit, nods
          defeat. Turns and walks away.

          INT. 'SHINE' NIGHT CLUB- NIGHT

          The club is barely-lit, punctuated by beams of moving light,
          constant music. The bar a glowing oasis. Gina leads Martin
          through. They pass down through old WWII bomb shelter
          construction, through curtains, into...

                         CHILL SPACE
          Even darker, only small glowing lights, candles, neon tubing
          casts shadows. Quiet almost, only the dull 'thud" of the
          bass reaches them.
          He puts a hand on her shoulder... she pushes it off.

                         MARTIN

          . and she LOSES IT. Flies at him, slapping clumsily. Like
          an enraged child. Martin grabbing her... holding her tight.
          Bodies pressed together... as her anger and fear and grief
          dissolve into sobbing...

                         GINA
          His family is in Africa. The
          money will just stop coming...
          they'll never know why...
          . Martin calming her, stroking her head. Her hand finding
          his, gripping it tight, wanting the contact. Martin looking
          down at the face buried in his chest. Feeling versus memory.
          Gina... Liz... Torn.
          A long beat. Her control returning. And her strength. She
          separates from him.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          You saved my life.
          No response. Eyes locked.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          .You never know, what you will
          do, until the time comes, right?
          Martin looks down, unsure. She stays on his face. Looking
          for... Her eyes shift:

          ACROSS THE SPACE
          A young Serbian MANAGER speaks with a female BARTENDER. Both
          cool, young, tough. Gina makes eye contact, heads nod in
          recognition.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Wait here...
          Martin watches her go, speak with them through low light and
          smoke. His gaze wander... into the strobing lights...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- SUDDEN CUT -- MEMORY FLASH
          .all WHITE. It's snow, drifting down... settling on a
          small idyllic home. Picket fence. Lights glow inside...
          . Suddenly INSIDE. Liz sits on the edge of a bed, glass of
          red wine in her hands. Martin enters the frame, his clothing
          and hands covered in drywall dust.

                         LIZ
          Are you ready... ?
          Liz rubs dust off his face, leans in to kiss him...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          INT. SHINE NIGHT CLUB- NIGHT

          Martin's eyes flick open and the SOUND and LIGHT of the club
          come flooding back in...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- GINA. UNDRESSING
          Low, moving lights pass across her body, wifebeater
          undershirt and jeans. She unzips the jeans, pulls them down
          long legs, pulls off the wifebeater, no bra...
          . hesitates. Looks back, sees that Martin is watching her.
          Beat. Beat. Lights catch glimpses of her body, her breasts,
          the arch of her back.
          She turns slightly away from him, pushes a pile of borrowed
          clothing towards him. A heavy coat, some jeans.

                         GINA
          .Put these on.
          She pulls a mod shirt on, glances back as he now undresses.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Were you happy?
          He looks up, shirt in his hands. She doesn't waiver.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Your marriage? Was it happy?

                         MARTIN
          .Yes. I think so... I don't
          remember... how it felt exactly.
          She approaches him, leans in so she can see his eyes...

                         GINA
          So why would she do this to you?

                         MARTIN
          .For the same reason I would.
          If I thought it was the only way
          to protect her.
          Gina nods, distant. Martin presses on, difficult.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I keep having a dream. Liz is in
          the bedroom of our home, although
          it's different somehow. Her
          hair's different... she's
          smiling, about to say something.
          Then it ends. I can remember
          places, details...

                         CONTINUED:

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I just can't remember... how I
          felt.
          He stops. Just the low pulsing BEAT from the other room The
          lights revolving over them.
          Gina watching him. Looking back at her. That connection
          again. He looks away.
          She shakes it off, produces a borrowed joint, offers it to
          him. He shakes his head no. She shrugs, sparks it. Inhales
          deeply, eyes close. She leans back.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You'll need to get out of town.
          There's a man who's helping me.
          He can --

                         GINA
          (seems to ignore him)
          In Bosnia... It was not like you
          probably imagine. It was nice.
          .there were cherry blossoms.

                         (BEAT)
          One day, I was sixteen. My
          sister and my brother came to me
          and said hey let's play hide and
          seek, down by the creek. He had
          ten Marka for whoever won. It
          was amazing, the way he just said
          it...
          Beat. She raises the joint, hits it again. Her eyes open,
          but she's deep in the memory and it's intense.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          .So I went down to this place I
          knew, under the small bridge over
          the creek. And I hid and waited.
          Not really that long... Then I
          went back home, to find my
          brother and collect my money.

                         (BEAT)
          He, and my father and my uncle
          were dead. And so was my mother.
          My sister was alive... for a
          little while.
          She turns her head, eyes blaze straight at Martin.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          It was not enough, to kill us.
          They wanted us to remember, every
          day, for the rest of our lives.

                         MARTIN
          We're you...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         (BEAT)
          No. No one touched me. But
          now... I'm not going anywhere.
          I'm not running anymore.
          She nestles in under his arm. Closes her eyes. He lets his
          hand gently stroke her hair.

                         MARTIN
          I won't let anything happen to
          you.

                         GINA

                         (SMILES SLEEPY)
          Liar... Say it again.

                         MARTIN
          I'll protect you.
          She opens her eyes again, looks up at him, smiles, on her way
          to sleep.

                         GINA
          .Cool.

          CHILL SPACE - LATER
          Gina sleeps, at peace. Martin leans over the one object he
          has left, his copy of "Horticus." He studies the number
          markings on the flap, working...

          EXT. BERLIN VELODROME - DAY

          Vast windowless cylindrical building on the city's edge.

          INT. BERLIN VELODROME -- DAY

          Cheering CROWD; a sound like THUNDER. A massive indoor
          STADIUM, CYCLISTS racing on a reverberating wood track below
          a suspended lighting rig the size of a spaceship.
          MARTIN at the counter of a busy bar. Jeans, T-shirt, Bomber
          Jacket. Different look, to say the least. Across the bar,
          GINA nurses a coffee. They exchange looks, briefly. A
          familiar grey-skinned figure settles next to him: JURGEN.

                         MARTIN
          Thank you for coming.
          Martin glances around, edgy. Jurgen watches him, glances at
          Gina long enough to let Martin know he's spotted her.

                         CONTINUED:

                         JURGEN
          You know, the most dangerous man
          in the world is the man who feels
          that he is drowning. He will
          drag under anyone who tries to
          help him.
          Jurgen sets his newspaper on the bar. A picture and article
          about the murdered nurse. Martin's picture, fuzzy.

                         MARTIN
          (nods, bitter)
          I... I didn't do it.
          Jurgen studies him, hard. Looks back at Gina.

                         JURGEN
          You said you had something.
          Martin feels in his pockets, takes out the copy of
          'Horticus', turns to the numbers on the end papers.

                         MARTIN
          These numbers, are a code. The
          first number refers to the page
          of a given book. The second to a
          specific line on that page. The
          third number to words on that
          line. If I didn't have the exact
          edition of the book, the code
          would be unbreakable.

                         JURGEN
          (nodding, impressed)
          And what do the numbers refer to?

                         MARTIN
          That's where it breaks down --
          the words are the Latin names of
          two plant species... Calochortus
          Albus... and Umbellularia
          Californica. Fairy Lantern...
          and California Bay. Both common
          flowering plants...

                         JURGEN
          Not part of your work? Or
          Professor Bressler's?
          Martin shakes his head. Jurgen grunts. Pencils notes...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Your thesis. The one you sent
          Bressler. What was the title?

                         JURGEN
          And it was after reading it that
          he invited you here. Correct?

                         MARTIN
          Correct. Yes. Look --

                         JURGEN
          Did you ever know someone called
          Laurence Darnell?
          Martin looks at him quizzically. Shakes his head.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          He was a graduate student at the
          University of Wisconsin. He died
          in an auto accident earlier this
          year. He was doing research very
          similar to yours.
          Jurgen studying him closely. Martin shakes his head.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          What is Professor Bressler's
          relationship with Prince Fahad?

                         MARTIN

                         (SHRUGS)
          Fahad's sponsoring the Forum,
          Bressler's the keynote speaker.

                         JURGEN
          So they're not close?

                         MARTIN
          In a way... they're opposites.
          Bressler wants to end world
          hunger. Open research...
          universal access to all his data
          on crop cultivation...

                         JURGEN
          But Fahad's just a businessman.

                         MARTIN
          They're both progressives. Fahad
          knows we'll need food long after
          oil. New agricultural patents
          are worth billions...

                         JURGEN
          But his progressiveness has cost
          him... his own people hate him...
          the attempts on his life...

                         MARTIN
          He's got balls, that's for sure.
          Another beat. Jurgen slides the 'Uncle Sam' bookmark card
          from the pages of the 'Horticus'... turns it over, Martin's
          remembered schedule scribbled on the back.

                         JURGEN
          There's a cocktail party, before
          Bressler's speech tonight?

                         MARTIN
          It's in our suite. Champagne and
          hors d'oeuvres for Bressler and a
          few of his guests.

                         JURGEN
          Is Fahad going to be there?

                         MARTIN
          Yes. Bressler invited him...
          Martin trails off. Starting to get there...

                         JURGEN
          Martin Harris... with just a few
          guests, in a confined space with
          Prince Fahad. For some, that
          might be a very good reason to
          want to be you.

                         MARTIN
          Oh, Jesus... You can't --
          Jurgen flips his notebook shut. Gets up.

                         JURGEN
          -- I need a few more hours. You
          need to go somewhere you will not

          IN DEEP FOCUS behind her, Martin B comes out of the bathroom,

          a printed monograph; the other a photocopy in brads.

          A WHILE LATER -- JURGEN AT A DESK
          He finishes reading the printed monograph. Closes it.
          Looking down at the cover... "The role of Gorytini and
          Thynnidae in Drakea pollination" by Martin Harris, PhD.
          He slides the bound photocopy next to it. "The process of

          Wisconsin. A long beat. The two titles side-by-side.
          Sudden thought... Jurgen takes something out of his pocket;
          the card that was inside Martin's 'Horticus'. The scribbled
          schedule notations on one side... turns it over: the bowling
          alley's Uncle Sam logo. Jurgen holds closer, studying it.
          His mind clicking...
          . printed German text. A number: 21. And right at the
          bottom, a small time-clock stamp...

          EXT. TIERGARTEN PARK -- DAY

          Martin and Gina stand amidst a flow of tourists and locals,
          near the entrance to Berlin's equivalent of Central Park and
          its zoo. Across, the Weinhaus Restaurant is a fin-de-siecle
          style brasserie bordering the avenue.

                         GINA
          Why here?

                         MARTIN
          .The zoo. She loves Polar
          Bears. I never knew exactly why.
          Gina nods, looks over to the restaurant. Looks back at
          Martin who hasn't moved. She checks her watch.

                         GINA
          Okay, go. You're going to be
          late for your date.

          73.

                         CONTINUED:
          Martin nods, heads into the park. Long, curving paths
          bordered by green. A labyrinth.

          AT THE PARK'S ENTRANCE
          Gina watches, sunglasses on, as a taxi pulls up and a wiry
          haired man steps out, pays the driver. Lap-top bag over his
          shoulder. BRESSLER.

          FEW MOMENTS LATER
          Another taxi arrives, Liz and Martin B get out.

                         MARTIN
          This shouldn't take long. I just
          need to see what Bressler wants.
          Liz's gaze settles on the painted sign for the zoo.

                         LIZ
          Take your time, I want to see the
          zoo anyway.
          ON LIZ. Memory, or nostalgia, touch her cool face.

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          I love the Polar Bears...
          Martin B nods, watches her go. He checks his watch and heads
          inside.

          OPPOSITE SIDEWALK -- AMONG THE SHOPPERS
          GINA, doing her best to casually window-shop at a designer
          storefront. Stolen glance across the street...

          INT. WEINHAUS HUTH RESTAURANT - SAME

          The WAITER offers to take Bressler's lap-top bag. Bressler
          politely declines him...
          The waiter nods, leaves. Bressler opens the computer bag,
          checks on the lap-top inside. Zips it back up. Positions
          the bag by his elbow. Smiles to Martin B.

                         BRESSLER
          I thought we might have a table
          for three, in case you still had
          your alter ego with you.

                         MARTIN B
          No, thank God. I assume he's
          safely back in the hospital.

                         BRESSLER
          Well, it's a lesson. You never
          know what people will do. All my
          work used to be on-line, my e-
          mails on an open server. A year
          ago, someone broke into my office
          and stole my computer. I believe
          they were after my research.
          Luckily, I split my data up and
          double encrypt it until I put it
          all together and make it public.
          That's why this stays with me
          until tonight's over...
          Martin B nods, starts to look at his menu...

                         BRESSLER (CONT'D)
          Now what was so important that it
          could not wait until this
          evening?
          ON MARTIN B, REALIZING he's been played. A single BLINK. A
          beat. When he looks up, he's cool.

                         MARTIN B
          I hope you can forgive me. It
          was something you said...

                         (BEAT)
          .It's been tormenting me.
          UNDER THE TABLE. Martin B has his phone out and is TEXTING,
          blind...

          SMITH sits on a bench near a pond, tossing bread crumbs to
          ducks. His phone chirps, he checks it and is MOVING...

          Gina ducks into a store doorway. Takes out her cell phone...

          . the other cell phone in MARTIN'S hand. He answers it...

          GINA (O.S.)
          They just sat down.
          Martin's gaze doesn't waiver. Up ahead of him, glimpsed
          through the crowds... Liz.
          He follows, watching, transfixed.

          CLATTER of falling pins... 'Uncle Sam' logo. Juke box Elvis
          serenading desultory daytime bowlers. Jurgen hands the
          TICKET from Martin's book to a bored ATTENDANT.
          She goes away... returns a moment later with a purple bowling
          TOTE BAG. Plonks it on the counter. Rips off a ticket
          counterfoil - '21'. Checks the time-stamp...

                         ATTENDANT

                         (GERMAN: SUBTITLED)

          A beat. Jurgen pays her, picks up the bag...

          EXT. ENTRANCE TO TIERGARTEN ZOO - DAY

          Parents buying tickets... excited kids push through the
          turnstiles under the gilded elephants of the entrance.
          Liz buys a ticket. Passes beneath the elephant gate.
          Martin starts to move forward... then DOUBLES BACK as Smith
          arrives, hurrying, again checking his phone. He pushes to
          the front of the line, pays his way in, eyes searching.
          Martin moves out behind him, hat pulled low.

          INT. DESIGNER STORE/TIERGARTEN STRASSE - SAME

          Watchful staff; soothing music. Gina at a rack of dresses,
          anxiously looks out of the window, staring at Martin B and
          Bressler in the restaurant, a silent heated exchange...

          INT. WEINHAUSE RESTAURANT - SAME

          Bressler in high form, reacting --

                         BRESSLER
          No! God NO! You're focusing on
          the science, but this...
          (patting his laptop)
          .this is history. You open the
          research before it's finished,
          the conglomerates gobble it up.
          In the entire history of human
          development, name me one time
          when business has ever acted
          except in its own self-interest.

          Martin B catches a waiter's eye, signals for the check.
          Bressler catches this, looks to Martin B, questioning.

                         MARTIN B
          I'm sorry, it's my fault.
          Another appointment I forgot.

                         BRESSLER
          It doesn't matter.
          (jumping back in)
          But see you, you say I am too
          cautious. It's an idiot thing to
          say. I'm a realist!

          EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME

          Liz wanders past some flamingos, checks a sign, heads in
          another direction.
          Behind her, Martin keeps his distance, keeps his eyes on
          Smith who's shadowing Liz, one path over...

          Bressler. I just --

                         BRESSLER
          Don't be stupid. You can't

          this is good discussion. But
          please, Dr. Harris -- Power is an

          his phone, tucks it away.

          Martin B striding through the park toward the zoo...

          P.O.V. -- LIZ PAUSED AT A GLASS WALL -- GETTING CLOSER
          Her slim shoulders; her hair tucked into a scarf against the
          rain, silhouetted in front of an underwater view. The giant
          Polar Bear swims, inches in front of her.
          LIZ'S FACE. Her eyes, soft. A smile... which fades as she
          senses a presence. Turns. FACES us.

                         MARTIN
          Standing across from her in this protected space. A strange
          numbness. Doesn't know where to start...

                         MARTIN
          . Liz.
          Just that syllable. She stares back, features tense.

          Smith's path has veered him away from Liz's. Frustrated,

          Martin B waiting in the ticket line at the gates...
          Gina approaches, breathless. Sees Martin B. Hangs back
          from the ticket line. Spots a large party of school kids.
          Gina steps past the line, confidently joins the group... just
          another parent. Swept through the turnstiles. Behind her,
          Martin B steps up to the ticket window.

                         LIZ
          Your briefcase. It got left

          Martin B's here. He's on his way...
          What can he do? He knows he can't stay. Suddenly, Liz moves

          Smith and Martin B converge from opposite directions on Liz,

          DETAIL SHOT -- TWO PRINT-OUT SCANS...
          from the security camera at airport Immigration. A
          couple at a desk. Liz and Martin. Unmistakably Martin.

                         JURGEN
          hears the phone START RINGING again inside his apartment.
          Fumbles in his pocket for the key.

          INT. JURGEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Jurgen grabs the phone. Puffing:

          My name's Rodney Cole. You left
          a message on my phone. There
          were two from Martin as well.
          What kind of trouble is he in?

          INT. LEHRTER BAHNHOF TRAIN STATION, BERLIN DAY

          Trains rumble and whoosh. Booming ANNOUNCEMENTS. Hurried
          commuters pushing past...
          . RODNEY COLE -- he's the academic colleague we've seen in
          Martin's memory flashes -- an avuncular man about ten years
          Martin's senior. Talks on a cell phone:

                         COLE
          Oh my God... that's unbelievable,
          the poor man. Well here's the
          good news -- I've just arrived in
          Berlin... yes, I've been teaching
          in Leipzig, at the Hochschule fur
          Technik. I came up for the last
          day to hear Bressler's speech...

                         (LISTENS)
          I'll come right over, it's not

                         (INTO PHONE:)
          I appreciate it, Herr Cole...
          Puts the phone down. A beat. Another look at the airport
          scans of Martin. Studying them a moment.
          Jurgen opens the bowling bag, up-ends it onto the table.
          Bowling shoes, a shirt, a hand towel...
          Taking a knife from the counter, Jurgen cuts around the
          bottom of the bag... lifts away a false floor. Reaches
          inside. The contents hidden from us... a shadow of tension
          crosses his face. Then a slow, enigmatic smile.

          A LITTLE LATER -- A KETTLE BOILING...
          . the mournful HOWL of its whistle. Jurgen turns off the
          gas. Spoons Nescafe into a mug. Opens a closet, reaches
          over a musty clutter of jars and boxes...
          finds a rusted sugar tin. Inside is a single ancient
          sachet of sweetener. A beat, pensive. He tears it open,
          adds it to the Nescafe. He looks up. Listening for...
          anticipating...
          . the lively KNOCK at his door.

                         THE HALLWAY
          Jurgen opens the door... it's RODNEY COLE, grinning...
          shaking rain from his coat.

                         COLE
          Herr Jurgen?

                         JURGEN
          Dr. Cole... Please, come on in.
          Jurgen ushers him in. Leads them into the living room.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Drink? I've a bottle labelled
          'brandy', which is more than
          likely hair lacquer... or some
          vodka my neighbor gave me after
          it made her husband go blind.

                         COLE

                         (LAUGHING)
          No, thank you...

                         JURGEN
          Maybe some coffee? I'm making
          some for myself.

                         COLE
          I'm good. Thanks.
          Cole looks around the tiny apartment. Sees the framed photos
          on the mantel. Looks closer.

                         COLE (CONT'D)
          You were in the military?

                         JURGEN

          Wow, wait till I tell my son. He
          loves all that Cold War stuff.
          Look at that car. What is that?

                         JURGEN
          A 'Zil'. Suspension of a donkey
          cart and smelt like a tannery.
          Vanished as quickly as the Wall.
          Cole studies the other pictures. Notices Martin's Rolex
          beside them. Jurgen pours the kettle into his mug.

                         COLE
          So. This business with Martin.
          A hell of a thing. How did he
          find you?

                         JURGEN
          Quite by chance, as it happens.

                         COLE
          Sounds like he was damn lucky.
          So, what can I do to help?

                         JURGEN
          Come with us to the authorities.
          Help them confirm his identity.

                         COLE
          The authorities? Jesus, it's
          that bad? A guy comes to you
          with a story like that. What
          made you take the case?

                         JURGEN
          Curiosity...

                         COLE
          Curiosity? Is that all?

                         JURGEN
          Professional curiosity. There's
          not much in this world left to
          interest an old spy like me...
          Cole's face tightens... his back still toward Jurgen.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          . a few questions I still think
          over. One in particular. From
          when I worked for the Aufklarung:
          our foreign intelligence wing.
          Cole still hasn't moved. Discreetly slips open a button on
          his jacket. Jurgen cradles his coffee, steam rising.

          There was this rumor. Of a US
          based assassination unit called
          Section 15. Freelance, deniable.
          They'd work for whoever would pay
          -- public sector, private sector.
          Second-to-none in their planning
          and efficiency. They never
          failed. What's more, they were
          invisible. They'd strike, and
          nobody would even know there had
          been foul play. It was only
          rumor, of course...
          Cole turning to face Jurgen. Smile gone. Glint of a gun
          inside his packet. Jurgen looking steadily back at him.
          Takes a deep gulp of coffee.

                         COLE
          You had fifteen minutes after I
          called. Why didn't you run?

                         JURGEN
          Where would I run from Section
          15, Mr. Cole? I can hardly walk.
          The edge of a smile, another large gulp of the coffee.
          Jurgen sets down the cup. He wheezes...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Before I could get Chesterfields,
          I smoked sixty machorkas a day.
          Filthy Soviet things. Killed
          more Russians than Stalin. My
          doctors assure me I'll soon be
          joining their list of casualties.
          Cole looking back at him, impassive.

                         COLE
          I want to know how he found you.
          I want every number, every source
          you've contacted on his behalf.

                         JURGEN
          And then what? We shake hands
          and you go away?
          Cole reaches a hand inside his jacket...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          There's no need for that.
          Beat. Cole's eyes flicker. Jurgen's body tightening... the
          coffee... the empty sachet of sweetener...

                         (CONTINUED)

          Cole looks at Jurgen. A moment's glimmer of respect. He
          doesn't move. His gaze lingering. Understanding.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          You never think... you'll have
          the courage to use it.

                         COLE
          But we do. The best of us.
          Jurgen coughs again. Suddenly sways. Puts a hand out to
          steady himself. Knocking over the mug of coffee...
          as the cyanide sweeps through him. Trembling hands clasp
          the edge of table. Building force. Shaking. His piercing
          eyes never leaving Cole... through the pain:

                         JURGEN
          Tell me... if he remembers
          everything. What then...?
          No answer. Jurgen's hands slip. He slumps forward, his head
          hammering down onto the table. A final convulsion. Then
          he's still.
          A long beat. Cole buttons his jacket. Slips on some gloves.
          Gently lifts Jurgen's head from the table top, rests it on a
          forearm, as though Jurgen were asleep rather than dead.
          Restoring some dignity to him.
          Cole goes to the mantel, wipes off the one framed photo he
          picked up. Takes Martin's Rolex, drops it into his pocket.
          He turns, casting an expert eye over the apartment... The
          legs of the stove... ever so slightly askew...
          The phone RINGS... RINGS... Cole ignores it, moves forward.

          I./E. "JET EXPRESS" BUS/AUTOBAHN - LATE AFTERNOON
           Martin hits re-dial on his cell. Listens, frustrated. The
           phone RINGING and RINGING. He flips it shut. Gina's eyes
           meet his. A long beat. She looks back out the window.
           Sleeting rain streaks the glass. Endless grey city-scape.
          He tracks a clock: 1:40. Looks back at Gina who senses his
           gaze, keeps hers straight out.

          INT. JURGEN APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON


          COLE -- THE STOVE PULLED AWAY FROM THE WALL
          He finds a section of loose KICK-BOARD. Carefully pries it
          away. Reaches into the hole: The PHOTOGRAPH of Martin and
          Liz, arriving. And Jurgen's NOTEBOOK.

          I/E ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOON
          Cathedral-like, overcrowded. Inaudible PAs. Carts loaded
          with luggage. Watchful POLICE and SECURITY.
          Martin and Gina, heads down under caps, navigate a surge of
          passengers rushing out of the doors, clutching bags,
          competing for taxis in the pouring rain...
          Martin stops. Deja-vu overload. His fractured memories.
          Past and present merging. The FACES. The SOUNDS...
          An AIRPORT SECURITY Man glances over, concerned. Gina tracks
          the attention, moves into Martin, fake-romantic, her face
          close to his...

          GINA (O.C.}
          Martin. C'mon...
           Gina touching his face. Bringing him back. He glances to a
          clock on the wall: 2:10...

          INT. LOST AND FOUND TEGEL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

          Martin and Gina wait at a counter. Clock reads 2:25. A
          WOMAN returns with a leather briefcase. A name tag on the
          handle. 'Dr. M.A. Harris'. Martin stares at it... reaching
          for memories. The woman checks her computer.

                         WOMAN
          May I see some identification?
          She looks up. Martin's expression distant...

                         GINA
          He doesn't have any. He was in
          an accident, that's why the bag
          was unclaimed...

                         MARTIN
          The combination. For the lock.
          It's 2... 8... 0... 6...
          A beat. The woman and Gina both looking at Martin. The
          woman enters the numbers. The locks pop open. She lifts the
          lid, picks something up. A pause... then her expression
          softens. She turns it toward Martin...

                         THE BRIEFCASE
          Filled with personal effects. Sitting on top a US passport.
          A long beat. Martin's hands unsteady as he opens it...

          His photo. And his name... Doctor Martin Harris.

          INT. AIRPORT CAFE -- LATE AFTERNOON

          Noisy and busy. Gina uneasy... watching Martin as he
          carefully examines each item in the case. Everything
          familiar, yet strange. His, but somehow not his.
          a copy of 'Scientific American' magazine, a comb, some
          gum, a Newark Airport parking ticket. His published paper --
          the same edition Jurgen found at the library.
          his leather wallet. Martin studies it. Identical to the
          one Martin B had. Opens it...

          CLOSE -- THE WALLET
          New Hampshire Driver's license. Credit cards. Martin
          fumbles inside a pocket, pulls out...
          . the EXACT SAME PHOTO we saw in Bressler's lab of a
          younger Liz with a younger Martin B in Paris. Except this
          time it's a younger Martin beside Liz-in the photo.

                         MARTIN
          gazing at it. He runs his fingers over its dock-eared
          corners, every bump and crease. Looks up to find Gina
          watching him. A long, awkward pause. She reaches over.
          Takes the photo from him. Studies it.

                         GINA
          Can you remember now... how you
          felt?
          Martin's silence hangs in the noise and activity around them.
          Gina handing back the photo. He stares down at Liz again as
          Gina stands, start to collect her things...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          We shouldn't stay here, it's not
          safe for you...
          Her voice trails off as she looks at Martin, really sees him
          in this moment. He looks up at her, torn, back down at the
          pictures, the relics of his life, his memories, spread out in
          front of him. He glances at the clock: 2:55...
          Gina tracks his gaze... gets it, takes a step back...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Oh, God. I'm an idiot. She's
          meeting you here.

          you wanted. You don't need me
          anymore and in case "we've"
          forgotten, I take care of myself
          very well.
          She starts for the door. Martin getting up...

                         MARTIN
          Gina stops, turns. A beat. Sadness, anger.

                         GINA
          One kiss and suddenly...
          Everything that's happened? To
          Biko? To us? -- I know, she's
          your wife. Like I said, I'm an
          idiot.

                         (BEAT)
          Goodbye, Martin.
          She turns away again. Martin, frozen, watches her go.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME

          Gina keeps walking. Pouring rain... ROAR of traffic. No
          look back. She joins the line waiting for taxis.

          INT. AIRPORT CAFE - SAME

          Martin still sitting there. The photo of him and Liz in
          Paris. Sudden decision, snaps the briefcase shut...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          EXT. AIRPORT TAXI RANK - SAME

          Gina almost at the head of the taxi line. A glance back.
          People... vehicles... no sign of Martin.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME

          Martin out of the doors. Eyes frantically searching for
          Gina. In the distance... he sees her...

          EXT. TAXI RANK, TEGEL AIRPORT - SAME

          Gina at the front of the line. A taxi pulls up. She steals
          a last look back at the terminal...

          TAXI DRIVER (O.S.)

                         (GERMAN: SUBTITLED)
          Hey, lady. You ready...?
          Gina's face suddenly lighting up... she can see Martin!
          Spins back to the TAXI DRIVER...

                         GINA
          Wait. There's another passenger.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME

          Martin weaving quickly through the crowds toward her... BUMPS
          PAST a man who looks back, his face lighting up...

                         MAN
          Martin. Martin...?
          Martin hesitates, turns. Sees...
          RODNEY COLE. Beaming smile. Martin stares at him,
          bewildered.

                         COLE
          Jesus, Martin, how are you doing?

                         MARTIN
          Rodney? What are you doing here?

                         COLE
          You called me, remember? You
          left a message on my machine.

                         MARTIN
          Yeah... but how did you know --?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         CONTINUED:
          Cole suddenly right up close. Presses a rolled newspaper
          into Martin's side. Cold steel of a concealed Qun.

                         COLE
          Stay one step ahead of me. Any
          move, I'll shatter your spine.
          His voice flat with menace. Martin's mouth opening...

                         MARTIN
          What are -- ?

                         COLE
          -- Go...
          Martin glancing round. Cole jerks him back, guiding him
          toward the passenger pick-up zone.

          EXT. TAXI RANK. TEGEL AIRPORT -- SAME

          Gina looking back around. Bemused. Martin vanished again in
          the crowd. Then a sudden stab of alarm...

          GINA'S P.O.V. -- MARTIN... MOVING FAST
          A man she doesn't know carrying his case... headed toward a
          parked commercial van. Driver waiting for them. She
          recognizes him... SMITH. Martin hustled into the back... Van
          door shuts. Engine starts. A VOICE snaps us...

          . BACK TO SCENE -- THE TAXI DRIVER...
          standing in front of Gina -- losing patience.

                         TAXI DRIVER

                         (GERMAN: SUBTITLED)
          Miss. I ain't got all day.
          Mind racing. Beat. Points to a suitcase a few yards away.

                         GINA
          Help me with my bags, please.
          The driver goes to fetch the case. Is stopped by its OWNER.
          Raised voices. Moment's confusion. Then...
          .the SQUEAL of TIRES. The taxi driver spins around to see
          Gina gone and his own taxi pulling away. He YELLS after her,
          furious. But she's off in traffic...

          I/E. VAN/BERLIN CITY MOTORWAY - DUSK
          Smith drives. Deadly silence. Martin motionless. Cole
          opposite him with the gun, impassive.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         CONTINUED:
          Interior goes dim as Smith takes a hard right, into an
          ABANDONED PARKING STRUCTURE, taking a ramp, spiraling up.

                         MARTIN'S EYES
          dart between Cole and Smith. Heart racing. Struggling to
          make sense of things. Cole studying him in quiet amazement.
          Shakes his head. Thinking out loud...

                         COLE
          My God... she's right. You're
          completely gone. You really
          think you are Martin Harris.

                         MARTIN
          What the hell Rod! You're my
          oldest friend! You know who I
          am. It's me... it's not that
          other guy. He's not --

                         COLE
          -- Martin Harris? You're right.
          He's not. He's the guy who took
          over for you after you went
          missing.
          Exasperated, Cole leans forward. Spelling it out.

          COLE (CONT'D?
          But you're not Martin Harris
          either. There is no Martin
          Harris.
          Martin staring at him. Blank. Confused. Scared.

                         COLE (CONT'D)
          Martin Harris doesn't exist. You
          invented him. He's your legend.
          A fiction you created. You made
          him up as a cover to get Bressler
          to invite you to the
          conference...

                         MARTIN
          No... That's insane. Liz, she----

                         COLE
          'Liz'...? Your "wife"? How do
          you think she feels about all
          this? You two were a good team,
          then you go and get Norman
          fucking Rockwell on her.

                         MARTIN
          That's not... she...

                         COLE
          -- they aren't real memories.
          Don't you get it? Martin Harris
          is a fabrication... but you've
          one and filled in the caps,
          invented a whole damn life for
          him. They could write a textbook
          about you! Jesus --!
          Martin's face. Spinning. Refusing to believe. The Van
          SCREECHES to a stop, Smith gets out pops the doors. The
          distant sound of the city traffic, a light wind, whistling.

          INT. TAXI CAB - SAME

          Gina, driving through traffic, searching, no sign of the
          van... then her gaze LOCKING ACROSS THE RIVER, four stories
          up on a parking garage: The white van.
          She hauls the wheel over, Taxi sliding through a U-turn.

          EXT. TOP STORY PARKING GARAGE - SAME

          Martin is tossed out onto the asphalt. Picks himself up,
          trying to orient...
          The structure abandoned, broke. No side rails, just pavement
          to the edge. Trash and graffiti everywhere. Desolate.
          Cole approaches, losing it now. Boiling with rage:

                         COLE
          All that studying... planning.
          Hell, you even had us take out
          that kid after we ripped off his
          thesis. A year of prep and you
          try to screw it up... . we do
          everything to bring you back in,
          but you go on trying to screw it
          up. Do you know how much time
          you've wasted? It's Thanksgiving
          for Christ's sake! I should be
          eating turkey with my kids, not
          here cleaning up after some wacko
          who bumps his head and decides
          his cover story's for real.
          Martin's eyes... staring back at him. Crumbling...

                         MARTIN
          But... I... who am I...?
          A pause. Cole shakes his head, pats him on the cheek.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         CONTINUED:

                         COLE
          You. You were my best boy.
          .suddenly Cole SLAMS a fist into Martin's stomach. Martin
          doubles over. Cole WHIPS the gun across his FACE. Kicks him
          AGAIN. Martin on his hands and knees, spits blood. Cole
          glaring down at him. Disgusted.
          Smith covers Martin as Cole moves into the van, empties out a
          junkie's works: dropper with needle, bottle top, cotton
          balls, lighter. Expertly cooks up a fix of brown heroin.
          Draws it into the syringe, glancing back:

                         COLE (CONT'D)
          Look at you now. Nobody. A no-
          one. Just another dead junkie...
          Streak of CONCERN as the sound of tires screeching reaches
          them. Cole looks up in time to see Gina's taxi, rounding the
          ramp, accelerating towards them!
          Smith steps forward, gun raised, firing!

          INT. TAXI CAB - SAME

          Gina DUCKS as bullets pierce the front windscreen. The image
          of Smith, firing, grows large...

          BAM! -- IMPACT!

          EXT. TOP STORY, PARKING GARAGE - SAME

          Taxi catches Smith, carrying into the van, crushing him as
          the two vehicles slide towards the edge...
          Cole is HURLED across the van like a rag-doll, his legs are
          crushed between buckling rows of seats as...
          . The van SLIDES with the TAXI'S IMPACT... front wheels
          pushed off the garage edge... teeters, see-sawing.
          Gina scrambles from the wrecked taxi. Runs toward Martin,
          lying on the ground. Pulls Martin away, arm around him...

                         MARTIN
          Wait! WAIT!
          Martin breaks free, walks unsteady to the rear of the van,
          locks eyes with Cole, trapped, clawing towards the back...
          Martin puts a hand out... and takes his briefcase.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Is it true...?

                         COLE
          Caught, the van TEETERING... Sneers at Martin, starts to
          speak.. Eyes go WIDE as...
          THE VAN... TIPS... FALLING off the edge, Smith's body going
          with it... disappears. A moment of calm silence and then
          CRUNCH! A dull sick crash as the Van hits below.

                         MARTIN
          Stares down at the wreck. Mind spinning... Gina comes up,
          touches his shoulder.

                         GINA
          Martin...
          He turns, MOVES. She chases after him...

          EXT. GRUNERSTRASSE - CONTINUOUS

          Pouring rain. Vehicles hiss over the bridge. Gina catches
          up to Martin. Her voice straining above the traffic:

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Martin! Stop! Martin, what's
          wrong... ? Martin!

                         MARTIN
          . Jurgen... we were going to
          meet... I have to see him.

                         GINA
          We've got to go... leave Berlin.
          We've got to get out of here...!

                         MARTIN
          I have to!
          Martin's face. Blood streaking in the rain. Absolute. A
          long beat. Gina takes a deep breath.

          INT. CAFE ADLER - AFTERNOON

          A cafe looking onto the Kochstrasse, Checkpoint Charlie.
          Rain mists the windows. Mostly empty...
          TWO FIGURES, sitting in the shadows. Martin and Gina. He
          STARES down, lost, shivering -- not from the cold.

                         GINA
          Martin...?

          95.

                         CONTINUED:
          He glances up, lost, looks away. Gina takes his hand in
          hers, presses it to her lips. Holds it. Places it against
          the skin of her neck and collar bone. Stares at him.
          He looks up... the intimacy. From far away:

                         MARTIN
          he told me I'm one of them...
          the things he said... the things
          he said I've done...
          (beat, anguish)
          How can I be that person?

                         GINA
          Listen to me. You're not.
          You're not...
           Martin, looking up at her, lost. His eyes back to the clock
          on the wall: 6.15... Martin closes his eyes. Gina reaches
          out. Quiet. Gentle:

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Martin. He's not coming.
          A long beat. He nods, heavy-hearted. She's right. As they
          stand to go... door JINGLES...

          P.Q.V. -- IN THE DOORWAY
           a FIGURE peering around anxiously .. FRAU BRUNNER --
          Jurgen's neighbor, breathless determination as she hurries
          over. The bowling tote b in her hands.
          She thrusts it at Martin, talking rapidly and urgently in
          German. Gina translates...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          She's sorry she's late. She says
          Jurgen gave it to her. He said
          that you'd know... that Martin
          Harris would know what to do...
          Slowly, almost dazed, Martin takes the bag. Frau Brunner
          looking at him intently, still talking...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Herr Jurgen told her to wish you
          good luck... that it was a
          pleasure knowing Dr. Harris.
          Martin looks at her, nods slowly. A beat. Finally...

                         MARTIN
          Thank you.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Frau Brunner nods. A pause. Then she turns, bustles away
          out the door, into the rain. Martin looks at Gina. In the
          half light of the cafe window, he unzips the bag...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- INSIDE THE BAG...
          Shoes... towel... shirt... digs down, pushing them aside.
          The floor of the bag neatly cut out. Revealing...
          A hidden compartment. Thick roll of BILLS... Euros, US
          dollars, Swiss francs... and TWO PASSPORTS...
           Canadian. He takes one out, flips it open. An entry stamp:
          'Berlin... August 28th.' Finds the photo page...
          It's him. Martin! But fair-haired, and in horn-rimmed
          glasses. The name... 'Tim Carmichael'... a Canadian citizen.
          The second passport...
          'Rachael Carmichael'. It's Liz... with short, dark hair.
          The Liz from his recurring memory.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          No... No...

          SUDDEN P.O.V. MEMORY FLASH -- HITTING HARD, CLEAR...
          Liz towels short dark hair. Door of a hotel bathroom. Liz
          turning... smiling. Embroidered on the towel... the 'H...
          I...' now visible in detail: 'Hotel Imperial'...

          BACK TO SCENE -- MARTIN RISES FAST
          His chair falling. Gina moves to help, he pushes her away.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          No! Leave me alone.
          He stumbles away, pushing towards the bathroom.

          INT. CAFE BATHROOM - SAME

          Martin lurches in, locks it, goes to the small sink, STARES
          at himself in the mirror.

                         MARTIN
          No...

          SUDDEN P.O.V. MEMORY FLASH -- PUSHING OPEN...
          the door to the Eisenhower suite bedroom... moving
          through the suite... towards the bathroom...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         CONTINUED:

          SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN
          He puts hand out against the memory, covers his reflection.
          His eyes stare back at him all the same...

          SUDDEN SUPER-INTENSE MEMORY FLASH... CLEAREST YET...
          .Liz towelling short, dark hair. She smiles up. Lips
          moving...

                         LIZ
          Are you ready...?
          .and MARTIN ENTERS THE FRAME, hair cut and colored
          differently. There's drywall dust on his hands and clothing.
          As he leans to kiss her, we CONTINUE...
          .INTO THE BATHROOM... to a wall beside the shower... panels
          cut away, exposed plumbing. Something integrated into the
          wall behind the pipes. MOVING CLOSER...
          Semtex plastigue... circuits and wires... diiï¿½ video
          timer connected to a high-tech DETONATOR...

          SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN
          Shaking his head, knowing. Tears streak, he wipes them away,
          hard. His fingers find his shirt pull it open...
          .STARES at his own body in the mirror. Fingers trace a
          scar across his chest, a healed knife wound. Three small
          raised bumps on his torso: healed bullet wounds.
          He blinks. His breath flows out of him. Surrender.

          INT. CAFE ADLER - MOMENTS LATER

          Gina, uncertain, with the passport... looking at the small
          photograph of 'Tim Carmichael'... notices Martin's paper in
          the case, the one he was reading on the airplane. Pages
          splayed... underlined.
          Cautious... she removes the document. Opens to the end.
          Paragraphs, underlined. A biography of sorts...

          HER P.O.V. -- GLIMPSES OF LINES:
           "Martin Harris, principle biography... married to Elizabeth
          Terman, August 12, 2002. Martha's Vineyard... Father died,
          Sept 9, 1987 of a Heart attack... Encouraged scientific study
          from an early age... Elizabeth... loved DaVinci..."

          MARTIN (O.S.)
          I made him up... I made him up to
          kill a man I've never met.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         CONTINUED:
          Gina STARTS, puts the paper down. Martin is at the table,
          looking down at her. His emotions sick, his gaze rotten.

                         GINA
          The entry stamp in your passport.
          You were in Berlin three months
          ago...
          Martin, like a statue. Voice, dead.

                         MARTIN
          Prince Fahad is going to be
          assassinated today. There's a
          bomb in the suite. I put it
          there.
          A long beat. Gina's eyes meet his, brief, scared. Sudden
          shift. Martin stuffs the cash back in the bag. Grabs her by
          the arm, propels them both outside...

          EXT. KOCHSTRASSE - SAME

          Martin pushes them into the alley next to cafe, jams the bag
          into her arms.

                         MARTIN
          Take this... get out of Berlin.
          Gina shaking her head.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Take it and go! Get as far away
          from me as you can.

                         GINA
          I'm not leaving you! Listen to
          me: Maybe you're not the man who
          went into the water. But you are
          the man I pulled out...
          Martin, staring into his reflection on the wet street...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Martin, there's no way you can
          show your face at the hotel.
          Everyone is looking for you. I

                         CAN --
          WHAM! MARTIN LURCHES UP AT GINA! He SLAMS her back against
          the brick wall, his hand around her neck, cutting off her
          air, literally lifting her feet off the ground.

                         MARTIN

                         (THE MONSTER)
          Look at me. Look at me...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CONTINUED:
          Gina SPUTTERS, tries to draw air. Her eyes LOCK on his.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          .Is this what you want? Is
          this the person you still want to
          help.

                         (SQUEEZING TIGHTER)
          You should have let me drown...
          She sputters, eyes start to roll back in her head, losing
          consciousness. Martin RELEASES and she drops in the dirt
          water of the Alley, hands and knees, GASPING for breath.
          Martin stares down at her. He picks up the bag, drops it in
          front of her face...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Pure instinct and adrenaline. Gina grabs the bag, stumbles
          across the street, HORNS BLARE as cars swerve to avoid her...
          And she's gone.

          EXT. BERLIN STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON

          Martin walks... numb. He waits at street corners, crosses
          with lights, moves through the city...

          EXT. MARSHALL BRIDGE - SUNSET

          Martin stands at the broken railing where Gina's taxi plunged
          into the water seven days ago. The tire marks are there.
          The railing is half-repaired, half taped off.
          He stares down into the oily black water, toes near the
          edge... weight shifting... then his knees give. He sits
          hard, his hands moving uselessly, almost on their own.
          Tears flow freely. Sobs RACK his body.

          PULLING WAY BACK -- ACROSS THE STREET
          . to where Gina stands, hidden in shadows. She's followed
          him here. Now frozen, watching him suffer.

          E/I. HOTEL IMPERIAL & CONFERENCE CENTER - NIGHT
          Lit up for the big night. Taxis and limos pulling in. In
          the lobby, beautiful people mingle with the celebrities of
          science. Herr Strauss scans the crowd, watchful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Two attentive SECURITY GUARDS scan monitors, roll through
          different views of the hotel.
          ON MONITORS: Crowds pass through security on their way into
          the conference room. Outside, a line of Mercedes pulling up.
          Fahad entering the building, surrounded by his entourage of
          security and beautiful women.

          E/I. SERVICE ENTRANCE, HOTEL IMPERIAL - SAME
          The same entrance Martin was led by before. Two BELLHOPS,
          wearing only T-shirts, enjoys smokes in the crisp night air.
          One tosses the butt, reaches for his jacket... it's gone.

                         PASSING INSIDE
          Martin, buttoning the last button of the jacket, moves into
          the hotel. No longer lost. Here to make amends.

          INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - SAME

          PRINCE FAHAD, flanked by his entourage, arrives at the door
          to the Eisenhower Suite. Hum of a party from within.
          Security KNOCKS. Beat... Liz opens the door. Radiant.

                         LIZ
          Your highness... we're honored
          you could attend this evening.

                         FAHAD
          (kissing her hand)
          The honor is all mine.
          Liz BEAMS, gestures him into the room filled with a dozen or
          so notable guests. Martin B engrossed in a conversation...

          BRESSLER (O.S.)
          Look, I probably have it
          somewhere... Perhaps my wife --
          BRESSLER, held at the door by Fahad's security, searching his
          pockets for an invitation.

                         BRESSLER (CONT'D)
          I'm late. Very un-German of me.

                         FARAD
          (to his security)
          I don't think the professor needs
          an invitation. He is, after all,
          the reason we are all here.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         CONTINUED:
          Bressler steps in, takes Liz's outstretched hand. He looks
          her up and down. Matter-of-fact.

                         BRESSLER
          Now I can see why somebody would
          pretend to be Martin.
          Liz laughs, her face lighting up... then chillincj as
          Bressler's TWO DAUGHTERS appear behind him, smiling shy.

                         LIZ
          .I didn't realize the girls
          were coming this evening.

                         FAHAD
          But of course. Lily and Laurel
          are the real reason any of us put
          up with Leo at all.
          Fahad bends down and the girls run to him, a familiar face.
          Fahad hoists one up, takes the other by the hand.
          ON LIZ. Hard beat. Looking to Martin B who stares back,
          cool. Liz nods, accepting the casualties. She takes
          Bressler's coat, reaches for his computer bag.

                         LIZ
          Let me take these...
          Bressler hesitates a moment, then lets go...

                         BRESSLER
          Separation anxiety. Just leave
          it there, if you could.
          He gestures to a sideboard in open sight.

                         LIZ
          Of course...

          LIZ -- WITH HIS BAG
          She turns, hangs up his coat. As she does so... her fingers
          slip inside the laptop bag. Slide a tiny Bluetooth
          connection card into the computer's bus port.
          Liz turns away. Smile gone. Moves down the hall towards...

                         BATHROOM
          Same P.O.V. we've seen in Martin's flashes. SMASH CUT...

          INSIDE THE BATHROOM WALL
          The BOMB. Semtex... circuit boards... a TIMER vamped from a
          DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDER. A sleeping monster.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          The Security Guard on the monitors squints, watches a
          "Bellhop" moving down a hall. Something about the way he
          moves... ZOOMING in on him.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          (German, subtitled:)
          Where is Herr Strauss...?

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE BEDROOM - SAME

          Liz closes and locks the door. Sits at the desk at another
          laptop, firewire plugged into a Linksys antenna.

          CLOSE -- THE COMPUTER
          Liz's fingers tap the keyboard. The 'desk-top' divides in
          two... files headlined in German; Bressler's computer.
          'Password blank' pops up. First encryption.
          Liz opens a new copy of 'Horticus' to a marked page. Finds
          the words. Types in: 'Calochortus albus'. Another 'password
          blank' flashes up. Second encryption. Liz types:
          'Umbellularia Californica'. Screen blanks, then refreshes.
          Padlock icon gone... Liz quickly drags them across to her
          desktop. Spinning egg-timer symbol. Files transferring...

          INT. 14TH FLOOR, HOTEL IMPERIAL - SAME

          Elevator doors open, letting out a few guests and Martin. An
          arrow indicates "EISENHOWER SUITE."
          He starts to move, clearing a corner, up ahead the entrance
          to the suite... OOOFF! The wind taken out of him as four
          BURLY MEN in suits SCOOP him by his arms...

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - BEDROOM - SAME

          Egg-timer disappears... 'file transfer complete'. Liz shuts
          the laptop. Slips it in a case.
          She picks up the REMOTE CONTROL for the suite's plasma TV.
          Selects 'Menu', thumbs in a ten digit code. Points the
          remote at the wall. Tight pause... Presses 'enter'.

          INSIDE THE BATHROOM WALL -- THE DIGITAL TV TIMER

          SUDDENLY COMES ALIVE, 00:08:00, 00:07:59, 00:07:58...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - SAME

          Bressler's daughters, shyness gone, play hide--n--seek amidst
          the grown ups. Bressler steps away from Fahad, heads over to
          his computer. Stops as Liz comes out of the bedroom.

          BRESSLER (O.S.)
          Ah, Mrs. Harris...

                         LIZ
          Checking on your baby again?

                         BRESSLER
          I can't help it.

                         LIZ
          Why don't you just wear it? As a
          nerdy accessory? Here, turn
          around.
          Liz picks up the bag. Adjusts the strap... slipping out the
          Bluetooth. Places the bag over Bressler's shoulders.

                          LIZ (CONT'D)
           There. Perfect.

          TIMER COUNTING DOWN: 00:05.12., 00:05:11...

          INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          Elevator doors open on an ELEGANT COUPLE who step forward
          revealing... Gina, at the back at the elevator. She's
          transformed: An elegant designer dress, plunging neckline.
          As she moves forward, toned legs flash from a high slit in
          the dress. She's graceful, beautiful, heads turn...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Martin is pushed roughly into a chair facing a displeased
          HERR STRAUSS. A GUARD handcuffs his wrist to the chair.

                         MARTIN
          You're not listening! There is a
          bomb, in the Eisenhower Suite. I
          put it there.

                         STRAUSS
          But isn't that the suite 'you'
          are staying in, 'Dr. Harris'...?
          Or wait, you're not Dr. --

                         MARTIN
          I've told you! There's no time
          to explain this...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         CONTINUED:
          Strauss rises, starts to turn away. Martin's gaze lands on
          one of the VIDEO MONITORS. Eyes lock:
          P.O.V. -- ON THE MONITOR: Gina, beautiful, approaching the
          Eisenhower Suite.

                          MARTIN (CONT'D)

                         (SUDDENLY)
          I can prove it. Pull up your
          lobby recordings from August 27
          of this year.
          Strauss, startled by the ferocity in Martin's voice.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Do it. NOW. Do it or many
          people will die. I'm not lying.
          A beat... Strauss nods to one of his technicians who starts
          to type into a console...

          INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          Gina reaches the door to the suite, stopped by security.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          Invitation?
          She meets the guard's gaze with cool superiority. Her eyes
          flick to Fahad across the room.

                         GINA
          Are you serious...? Why don't
          you ask the Prince?
          The guard hesitates, unsure... it's all she needs. She moves
          by him, into the room.

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE - SAME

          Gina quickly takes in the suite. Far away, Bressler and
          Fahad, engrossed in conversation. One of Bressler's
          daughters, LILY, peeking out from under a table. At the bar,
          Martin B, drinks in his hands, turning towards her...

          towards the back. He begins to follow... hesitates...
          He looks back, to the picture windows. Empty now.

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          Martin, sweating, nervous, eyes flicking to the monitors as
          the technician brings up the reception video, starts fast-
          forwarding through footage. Images go by, almost too fast...

                         STRAUSS
          .What exactly are you hoping to
          find?
          Martin ignores him, his eyes TRACKING.

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Fahad finishes a joke. Laughter. Martin B still scanning
          the room... Gives up, turns to meet Liz already there with
          their computer case and a sportsbag. She hands him the
          sportsbag, they wordlessly leave through the rear door...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Unseen by anyone, a monitor shows Liz and Martin B, entering
          an emergency stairwell, hurrying. Martin's eyes scan...

                         MARTIN
          There! Stop!
          The technician freezes the image: A dapper couple, checking
          in. He wears a sportsjacket, light-haired, horn-rimmed
          glasses. She's got short dark hair.
          Martin points. Strauss leans in, sensing it.

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Gina approaches Bressler and Prince Fahad, intense, urgent.
          Fahad's SECURITY reads her expression, GRABS her arm.

                         GINA

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Sir! Your highness! You're in
          danger here. There is a bomb in
          this room!
          Bressler and the Prince look over, confused, interested...
          . and Fahad's Security ACTS. A gun lined on Gina, pushing
          her back. Two men grab the Prince, pushing back other
          guests, hustle him toward the suite's emergency exit,.

          Champagne crystal, hors d'oeuvres and furniture FLYING.
          Fahad in the middle, looking back as he's swept out, captive
          to his own security...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          The image ROLLS FORWARD, slowly: The man at the counter
          kisses his wife's hair, glances upwards... It's MARTIN.

                         MARTIN

                         (QUIET)
          Do you see...?
          Beat. Beat. And then MOTION on the monitors: The Prince
          and his detail, rushing down a corridor. Strauss tracks...

                         STRAUSS
          (German, subtitled:)
          Sound an alarm. Evacuate the

          You and-you, you're with me.
          We'll meet the Prince at the
          loading docks.
          (to a Guard)
          You, take him downstairs.
          Strauss and his men flood out. The guard pulls keys, starts
          to uncuff Martin from his chair.

          INT. EMERGENCY STAIRCASE - SAME

          Martin B and Liz stop in their tracks. Doors opening ABOVE.
          Sound of panicked guests pouring onto the stairs.
          . Liz's face. Ice cold. Processing. Deciding. Hands
          Martin B the computer, takes the sportsbag from him.

                         LIZ
          Stop the timer. I'll finish it.
          Martin B nods, takes the stairs back up two at a time,
          shouldering his way past the folk streaming downward...

          TIMER COUNTING DOWN: 00:2:05., 00:02:04...

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          ALARMS BLARE! Lights flash. Guests press out. A German
          voice comes over speakers, advising people to leave...
          Gina moves towards the exit, turns to see Bressler standing
          in the middle of the room, one daughter in his arms,
          frantically searching for the second.

          Professor! Over here!
          Gina at the table she saw Lily at before, lifts the
          tablecloth to find a frightened little girl staring back.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          It's okay, come on...
          The girl, convinced, swept into Gina's arms. She and
          Bressler head for the door, each carrying a child.

          INT. MEZZANINE FLOOR - SAME

          Confusion, alarm. People doubling back down the stairs.
          Automated evacuation ANNOUNCEMENTS...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Guard begins to cuff one of Martin's arms. Martin faces the
          monitors, SMILES as he sees Fahad's people meet up with
          Strauss at the loading dock, hustle Fahad into a Limousine...
          ANOTHER MONITOR: Martin B, rushing back upstairs.
          Martin watches... interested... eyes track... narrow.
          ANOTHER MONITOR: Gina and Bressler, running into a corridor
          with the two girls. Martin smiles a little, relieved...

          Lily, Laurel...
          The smile... dying. Realization...

          Flowers... Passwords...
          He SCANS the many monitors, LOCKS onto: Liz, moving down a
          corridor, purposeful.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Fahad was never the target. It's
          Bressler! You have to tell

          The guard shoves him against the console, starts to cuff his
          other arm. Martin LURCHES back, both of them tumbling over.
          Martin scrambles for the door...

          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Martin stumbles out into a crush of panicked stragglers,
          ducks down, lost in the press. Moments after, the guard
          appears at the door, speaking into his radio...

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Martin B rushes into the room. Stops. Like Pompeii: a party
          abandoned. Furniture upended. Guests. All gone.
          Urgently searching for the remote. Down on his hands and
          knees. Looks at his watch. Pales...

          INTO THE BATHROOM -- MARTIN B
          . KICKS at the wall. No good. RIPS the heavy cistern lid
          off the top of the toilet. SMASHES it against the plaster.
          Dents... dust... beginning to give...

          Gina and Bressler come out onto the floor with the girls,
          heading to the bottleneck at the exits...

          LIZ, moving purposefully towards the group, closing, her hand
          in the unzipped top of the sportsbag slung over her shoulder.
          Glimpse of an oiled-black Uzi machine pistol.

          FAR ACROSS THE LOBBY
          The other direction. Martin appears, handcuff dangling from
          one wrist. He SCANS frantic through the bottlenecked crowds.
          SEES Gina and Bressler! Martin starts forward, ducks back as
          Strauss re-enters, commanding his security.

                         BEHIND THEM
          Liz closes, tracking, finger flicks off Uzi's safety.

          next to her Bressler comforts his daughters as BEHIND THEM
          Liz moves closer, closer...
          . Suddenly seeing Martin. A decision, sudden SHIFT. Liz
          passes, brushing Gina lightly as she goes.
          GINA, registering the touch, looks up at the woman walking
          away from her now recognizing Martin, pressing through the
          crowd towards her. Gina's face lighting up!
          MARTIN, pushes by a group of people, closing towards Gina and
          suddenly Liz is in his arms, grasping him, romantic...

          Martin stares at her in horror as she beams up at him. One
          hand caressing his cheek...
          .her other hand pressing a knife against his chest.

                         GINA
          Seeing Martin and Liz, embracing. Confused. Alarmed. Hurt.

          LIZ AND MARTIN
          Liz still hugging him tight, whispering hard, her free hand
          sliding something metallic into his pocket.

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          Hello, Martin. I just placed a
          gun in your jacket pocket. One
          bullet. There's really only one
          person, one right way to kill
          Bressler now, isn't there? The
          crazy man whose been stalking
          him, the crazy man who pretended
          to be Martin Harris...

                         MARTIN
          No...

                         LIZ
          Oh, and after you've shot him,
          point the gun at the Police.

                         MARTIN
          I won't do it...

                         LIZ
          God you're weak. The 'Martin' I
          knew wouldn't have been able to
          go on living like you are.

          I'll kill them all. Bressler,

          with the gun... In Martin's face: horror, deadly
          conviction... Time SLOOOWS. Sound AMPLIFIES...

          Food-laden serving carts, cook-tops, pots and pans, knives.
          Falling plaster and debris... deserted.
          Liz walks through, brisk, angry. Dress torn, a cut across
          her forehead. She stops at a disposal chute, disposes of the
          sportsbag. Reaches high under her dress, comes out with a
          knife, starts to toss it as well...
          .She STOPS. Looks up, into the distorted mirror of the
          stainless steel surface in front of her.

                         LIZ
          .Hello, Martin.
          REVOLVING... to find Martin there. Bleeding, hurt, covered
          is debris, but holding the gun on her in unsteady hands.

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          Be careful, that might go off.
          She turns to face him. Hair slicked, clothes drenched.
          Stunning despite everything

          Five years as a team... and you
          end it like this.
          Her hand almost casually moves back, the knife still seated
          in her palm. Martin tracks it, steadies the gun.

                         MARTIN
          Don't. Keep your hands where I
          can see them. Please...
          GROANING from the hotel structure. Plaster and cables fall,
          SPARK across the floor. Martin FLINCHES, tries to keep
          steady. Liz is steady, cool. Laughs a little.

                         LIZ
          You know, working with you... it
          almost wasn't work. We were so
          good... You, were so good. At
          the job. At other things...

          'Liz?'... Don't you want to know
          y real name? Don't you still
          want... me?
          She leans forward, just a breath. Warmth radiating, Martin
          stepping back...

                         MARTIN
          Please, just stop, Liz...
          Her face, reading him. His fear, his uncertainty... She
          smiles, just a little... Liz throws the knife! Martin FIRES
          as the blade sinks into him, sending him reeling back onto
          the floor.

                         MARTIN
          His hand going to the knife sunk in his shoulder, SCREAMING
          in agony as he rips it out, looking up at...

                         LIZ
          A soft distance in her face. A small hole in her chest, just
          below her beautiful collar bone. Her eyes find him, focus,
          smile...

                         LIZ
          You'll never know. You'll never
          know who you are...
          A long beat. We're not sure when exactly the life goes out
          of her eyes. Finally, Martin pulls himself forward. Gently
          closes her eyelids.

          EXT. HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          Police keeping people back. FIRE TRUCKS everywhere, jets of
          water fighting back the flames. A collective GASP...
          as the bomb-damaged corner of the hotel starts to FOLD
          INWARD in a spray of dust and smoke.

                         GINA
          moves through the crowd, anxiously searching the stream of
          people still pouring from the building...
          She JUMPS as a hand takes her arm. Turns her. Martin. she
          stumbles back, hands raised against him. Fear, betrayal,
          love... Him standing there, empty, bleeding...

          114.

                         CONTINUED:
          Gut instinct wins. She takes a step towards him, he pulls
          her tight to him. Holds on. All he has. All he knows.

          IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE
          Hotel survivors... Bressler: shaken, oblivious that he's the
          epicenter and object of the destruction all around him...

          BECOMING...

          CLOSE ON A TV... BACKGROUND NOISES...
          Echoing CHIMES of a PA calling platforms... an espresso
          machine nearby. ON SCREEN, CNN... the Hotel Imperial. Day-
          after shots of the blown-out 14th floor.

                         TV ANCHOR
          Less than twenty-four hours after
          the failed assassination attempt
          on the Saudi prince...
          Image switches to Fahad seated in a PRESS CONFERENCE where

          . Nobel laureate Professor Leo
          Bressler announced the

          propagating, drought tolerant and
          pest resistant... To be made

          Rapturous applause. Standing ovation...

          INT. LEHRTER BAHNHOF TRAIN STATION, BERLIN - DAY

          . FINDING two figures nestled among the travelers... Martin
          and Gina, seated close. The two of them, gentle. Small
          touches. Getting used to peace...

                         GINA
          Hey... Do you know? What you
          would have done...?
          He looks back at her, starts to speak. An ANNOUNCEMENT cuts
          through, their train leaving. They stand, move off...

                         CONTINUED:
          as we CRANE UP SLOWLY above the crowds streaming along a
          platform to board an inter-Europe express -- families,
          business travelers, soldiers on leave... ordinary people...
          another day in their lives...

          MARTIN (V.0.)
          They say your whole life flashes
          before you... but it's the little
          things... the details...
          Gina reaches out, takes Martin's arm. Draws him closer.

          MARTIN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I don't know who I am now, what I
          would have done. But one thing's
          for sure... I'm not the man I
          was. And I'm going to try my
          best to find some sort of
          redemption, for what he did.
          Because maybe, just maybe...
          Slowly we LOSE THEM among the sea of bobbing heads...

          MARTIN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I can become the man I was
          always meant to be.

                         FADE OUT
