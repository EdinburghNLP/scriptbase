                                                     CLOSE ON:
          
          The face of MINERVA "MINI" DROGUES, 18, watching something.
          She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering
          across her eyes. She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty
          mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly
          still that of a girl.
          
          -                    MINI (V.O.)
                    I know what you're thinking. Don't
                    bullshit me, because I do... You're
          -         thinking, oh dear lord in heaven,
                    please, I'm begging you. I'll gouge
          -         out my eyes with the straw in my
                    drink right now. I'll jam every
                    last kernel of popcorn into my
          -         mouth until I suffocate, just not
                    another fucking teenage coming-of-
                    age story.
          
          We pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that
          awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. Though tall
          and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a
          "FUCT" T-shirt and jean shorts.

                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Well, relax...no prom night
                    highjinks, no nerds becoming
                    popular and no Shakespeare set in
                    high school...I promise.

          CLOSE ON: THE TV SCREEN. "When Animals Attack" is on. In a
          series of quick cuts:
          
           A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant.
          
           A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a
          shark he and his buddies thought was dead.

           A pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm.
          
           An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a
          just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his
          skull.
          
                               MINI (V.O.)
                    Since it happened, everyone's
                    asked me how it all started.
          
                                                                     2.
          
          
          
          Mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. We
          now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-appointed
          Studio City hillside home.

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM- EVENING- A PARTY.
          
          TEENAGERS OF PRIVILEGE and their UPTIGHT PARENTS are milling
          around, dancing and chatting as A DEEJAY spins tunes.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    I suppose the obvious answer is my
                    eighteenth birthday...
          
          Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and
          halter top. She clearly understands how to the drive the boys
          crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who
          stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER-
          AEROBICIZED MOTHERS.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    See, I was blessed with a terrific
                    mom. Not only is she a lush, but
                    she also hates me.
          
          Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her
          that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. The
          blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing
          for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    A few days before the party, I
                    overhear her on the phone ordering
                    me a male stripper. Nothing says "I
                    love you" like ten inches of man
                    meat in your face.
          
          Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    And knowing dear old ma, she'll try
                    and nail him after the party...in
                    my bed.
          
          Mini's friend KAYLA, a little rounder, but also brash, comes
          dancing over. She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini,
          almost challenging her.
          
          MIKE RUDELL, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their
          display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his
          imagination.

                                                                     3.
          CONTINUED:
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       That guy? Our neighbor Mike Rudell,
                       big shot TV producer and the guy my
                       mom screws whenever the batteries
                       run out.
          
          Kayla and Mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way,
          clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable.

                               MINI
                       Yo, bee-ach!
          
                                 KAYLA
                       Yo, birthday bee-ach!
          
                                   MINI
                       Is it on?
          
                                 KAYLA
                       Oh, it's on!
          
                                 MINI
                       That's my girl!
          
          Mini grabs Kayla and dips her low.
          
          INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER.
          
          Kayla instructs some CATERERS to start wheeling a giant
          birthday cake into the living room. The caterers look
          confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey,
          starting to wheel the cake down the long hall.
          
          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          The cake emerges from the hallway. The caterers begin singing
          "Happy Birthday", as Diane turns to see it and her eyes flash
          rage. As Diane comes storming over, we switch to SLOW MOTION.
          
                                  MINI (V.O.)
                       See, to understand me, you need to
                       understand that life, in my
                       opinion, is all about new
                       experiences. "Firsts" is what I
                       call them.
          
          As she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on
          Diane's face grows stronger with every step.

                       Somewhere around fourteen, when I
                       had my first...rhymes with duck, I
                       realized that the goal of life, any
                       life, should be to cram as many
                       "firsts" into it as possible.
          
          We switch back to real time.
          
                                 DIANE
                       What the hell are you doing? I said
                       wait until-
                           (looking around)
                       She's not even here, you morons!
          
          A YOUNG CATERER'S face turns white.
          
                                 CATERER
                       But, but her friend said--
          
          POP! Suddenly the lid to the cake flies off and from behind
          we see A NUDE MINI rises out of it like Venus on the half
          shell.
          
                                   MINI
                       SURPRISE!
          
                                                     MINI'S POV:
          
          A collection of reactions from the party goers: The mothers
          are numb, the fathers pretend to be disturbed, while copping
          looks, and her friends are in stitches. Some are even waving
          dollar bills.        M
                                  MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                       That was definitely a first, but
                       more importantly, it was the first
                       time I really understood my
                       potential...And that's when it all
                       started.
          
          Mini leans over and gives her STUNNED mom a big hug.

                           (doing her best Donna
                             Reed)
                       Oh, Mom, this is the best birthday
                       ever!
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
          
          INT. MINI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mini stands in a bathrobe with a towel around her head,
          having just taken a shower. She removes the towel to reveal
          she's just changed her hair color to FLAMING RED.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    That little stunt got me grounded
                    for a week, but it was worth it.
          
                                                   CUT TO:
          
          Mini blow drying her hair.
          
                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    See, I just don't understand people
                    who live their lives as one big
                    routine.
          
                                                   CUT TO:
          
          Mini evenly spreading the base to her make-up.
          
                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    They're basically saying "I'm not
                    worthy of a unique experience on
                    this earth."...Well, sorry, but I
                    am.
          
                                                   CUT TO:
          
          Mini applying blush to her cheeks.
          
                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    The law of firsts has served me
                    well, because it's liberated me
                    from the usual pathetic, repetitive
                    concerns of high school.
          
                                                   CUT TO:
          
          Mini applying eye liner.
          
                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I simply don't care if I'm popular,
                    because if I did, then I'd be
                    constantly stressing about whether
                    my clothes are cool enough, or if
                    Troy, the "gay but he doesn't know
                    it yet" quarterback, is gonna call.
          
                                                                      6.
          
          
          
          INT. THE HALLWAY OF MINI'S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Mini and Kayla walk down the crowded halls attracting lustful
          looks from some of the more aggressive boys.
          
          They approach a group of FOOTBALL PLAYERS.
          
                              KAYLA
                        (whispering, worried)
                    Oh, God, it's Troy.
          
                              MINI
                    Just keep walking and don't look at
                    him.
          T
           ROY, a cocky, chiseled, all-around nightmare, sticks his
          tongue in his cheek, simulating a blow job.
          
                              TROY
                    Yo, Kayla, I got some more of what
                    you were looking for Saturday
                    night.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Ahh...The joys of the American
                    educational system.
          
          Kayla puts her head down, her face turning red, as Mini stops
          to address Troy and his posse.
          
                              MINI (CONT'D)
                        (suddenly brightening)
                    Actually, Troy, I think you
                    confused her with that senile,
                    toothless grandmother of yours.
          
          "Ooohs" and "Aaahs" erupt from the onlookers as Troy looks
          concerned his ambush has backfired.
          
                              TROY
                    Yo, Mini, why don't you use that
                    mouth for something useful and suck
                    my dick?
          
          More students start to gather, overhearing them.
          
                              MINI
                    Actually, now that you mention it,
                    I can't think of anything I'd
                    rather do than suck your dick.

          Troy looks around, surprised and emboldened by her
          declaration.
          
                                 TROY
                       Well, it's all for you, babe.
          
          Mini moves closer, looking him right in the eye.
          
                                 MINI
                       Really?

                           (daring her)
                       If you can fit it all in.
          
          The crowd has now swelled to a few dozen, as everyone is
          riveted by the exchange. Suddenly, Mini starts unzipping his
          fly.
          
                                 TROY (CONT'D)

                       I'm going to suck your dick, Troy,
                       you said I could.
          
          Troy tries to push her away, but she's got a grip on his
          belt. Everyone watching is almost speechless at first, but
          then giggles start to erupt.
          
                                 TROY
                       Yo, this ain't funny!
          
                                  MINI
                       No, Troy, I want to suck your dick
                       right now!
          
                                 TROY
                       Jesus, Mini, come on, get off!

                       No, Troy! You said I could, now
                       come on!
          
          She gets down on her knees, struggling to get a hand in his
          pants. The crowd howls with approval, as they almost can't
          believe their eyes.

          Troy finally pushes her off, humiliated, and runs down the
          hall as the mob laughs at him. Kayla looks at her gratefully
          and smiles.

          Diane's eyes narrow, as it's clear Mini knows exactly where

                    My mother moved out to LA from Ohio
                    when she was twenty to become an
                    actress. Even though she was a
                    total flatliner, somehow she
                    managed to land a few bit parts on
                    soaps...without screwing anyone.
          
          INT. A HALLWAY OF THE HOUSE - LATER.
          
          Mini walks along the corridor in a pair of "fuck me" pumps,
          as the doorbell is heard ringing.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    When she gets really sauced, she'll
                    pop the tapes in and make me watch,
                    then I'll threaten to call the
                    suicide hotline.
          
          She continues through the living room towards the door,
          hiking her mini skirt up a little.

                    After a few years, she got
                    desperate and spread 'em for this
                    fat, ugly producer when he promised
                    to give her a role in some bullshit
                    cable series that was basically
                    softcore porn. She got knocked up
                    with me and he told her she
                    couldn't be on the show, unless she
                    hoovered me out.
          
          She reaches the front the door.

          She opens the door to reveal a delivery boy, JIMMY 20's, with
          six cases of liquor stacked on a handcart.

                    She was gonna do it, too, at least
                    that what's she told me when she
                    was feeling particularly loving.
                    But then she heard rumors the show
                    wasn't gonna fly and realized
                    eighteen years of child support
                    beat thirteen weeks on "Skin
                    Tight", so I got to stick around.
                    ...Bad choice.
          
          Mini opens one case, takes out a bottle and heads out of the
          kitchen.

                    Anyway, what Mom didn't count on
                    was the prick having a heart attack
                    and croaking a year after I was
                    born.
          
          She pours it into a martini glass and drops an olive in.

          shirt in. He looks a little startled to see her up.
          
          SLEAZY GUY #4
          
          Oh...Uh, hi, uh, tell your mom I, uh, had a good time.
          
                              MINI
                    Oh, I will...Like some coffee for
                    the road?
          
          The guy looks at her a little surprised, then smiles.
          
          SLEAZY GUY #4
          
          Sure...thanks, kid.
          
                                                     CUT TO:
          
          Mini watching the PORSCHE PULL AWAY from the curb. In her
          hand, she holds a bottle of MAXIMUM STRENGTH EX-LAX.
          
                                                     CUT TO:
          
          SLEAZY GUY #4 driving down the freeway, drinking coffee from
          a paper cup. Suddenly, a look of absolute dread overcomes
          him.
          
          INT. DIANE'S APARTMENT - LATER.
          
          Diane emerges from her bedroom in her bathrobe, looking
          disheveled. She glares at Mini, who sits at the kitchen
          table eating her cereal.
          
                              DIANE
                    Do you want to live in this shit
                    hole your whole life?
          
          Mini just stares at her.
          
                              DIANE
                    Then stay in your fucking room
                    until they leave. Got it?
          
          Mini says nothing. Suddenly, Diane picks up a SMALL PIECE OF
          POTTERY from the coffee table and throws it at Mini's head.
          Mini ducks as it SMASHES behind her on the wall.
          
                                                                  14.

                    So it pretty much went on like that
                    until...
          
                              MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mini? Diane? I'm home.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)

                    Martin.

          INT. A HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mini, Diane and MARTIN TANNEN, 45, a trim executive in an
          Armani suit and $300 haircut, mingle at a large corporate
          cocktail party. Martin, a man who understands, in his world,
          style over substance is a way of life, works the crowd
          effortlessly.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    He didn't want kids, but needed a
                    ready-made family to help project
                    an image of stability for his
                    corporate outings...We finally got
                    out of Reseda...

          Mini at the bar, stealing the drink of a TROPHY WIFE who has
          turned her back on it, to make a point to her OLDER HUSBAND.

          LATER. Martin finishes talking to a client and heads out on
          the balcony to get some air, where he sees Diane kissing a
          HANDSOME YOUNG EXECUTIVE off to the side. Martin stiffens as
          he watches in SLOW MOTION her tongue slip into his mouth.
          
                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Then he figured out what he had
                    married...by then it was too late.
          
                                                                  15.
          
          
          
          INT. THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Martin puts his keys and cell phone on a table near the door.
          
                              MINI
                        (breezing past him)
                    You're home early.
          
                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    First time in three months he's
                    walked in before Letterman. He
                    totally forgot my birthday party,
                    and right now I'm thinking his pin
                    cushion must have given him the
                    walking papers or...found a new
                    pin.

                    About the same...
          
          They head back into the living room.
          
                              MINI
                    Protecting all those poor
                    defenseless oil companies from
                    those big bad environmentalists?

                              MINI (V.O.)
                    He's a partner at a public
                    relations firm, which is ironic
                    because I can't remember the last
                    time he and my mom were seen in
                    public together...or had relations.
          
          He plops down on the couch, taking an electronic organizer
          out of his breast pocket.

                       No, she went to a party off
                       Beachwood. She was in one of her
                       "happy moods", so I doubt she'll be
                       sleeping here...
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Oh.

                           (innocently)
                       If you were thinking of inviting a
                       guest over.

                       I wasn't, but thanks for the
                       concern...You're going out on a
                       school night?
          
                                 MINI
                       Yeah?
          
          Martin punches a few buttons on the organizer, his mind
          clearly elsewhere.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Mmm...Is your homework done?
          
                                 MINI
                       Haven't even cracked a book.

                       Mmm...
          
          INT. MINI'S BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini double checks her purse for everything: lipstick,
          compact, Altoids, a flask of liquor and a string of condoms.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Considering how many guys my mom
                       has done in his bed, you've got to
                       admire his resolve. He could've
                       left her years ago, but with no pre-
                       nup, he loses half and he just
                       won't give in.

          EXT. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini walks out the front door, revealing an impressive front
          of the house with stone pillars and a brick circular drive.
          Martin's MERCEDES 500 SL COUPE and Mini's BMW Z3 convertible
          sit in the open garage.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Their arrangement actually keeps
                    everything very calm.
          
          Mini gets into her BMW.
          
          EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT
          
          The BMW drives down the street, weaving in and out of
          traffic.             M
                               MINI (V.O.)
                    As I said, the rule of firsts
                    guides my life. Once you've gotten
                    into every club in town and had
                    enough Ivy League lawyers cum too
                    fast, drastic measures are called
                    for.
          
          EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
          
          Mini walks past the neon covered shop windows.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    I thought it would be a goof if I
                    put a photo ad in one of those 25
                    cent "outcall" massage newspapers
                    they sell around town. But I just
                    got a bunch of pervs breathing
                    heavy on my voice mail. So I went
                    to an escort service, and when they
                    found out I was 18, they told me
                    they had two tricks in the same
                    hotel that night...if I was up to
                    it.
          
          She passes OLDER PROSTITUTES soliciting cars that have slowed
          down for a peek.

                    Would you look at them?
          
          One of the prostitutes gives her a threatening look.

                       It's pathetic. I mean, she's got to
                       be, what? At least twenty
                       eight?...In dog years.
                           (pausing)
                       Oh, wait, that would make her four.
          
          She arrives in front of the HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL.
          
          INT. A HALLWAY OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT
          
          Mini walks down a hall and stops in front of a room and
          knocks. She looks around trepidatiously, as she waits for an
          answer. The door opens and a MIDDLE AGED MAN opens the door.
          He's very well groomed in a creepy middle american way. He
          could be a serial killer or...
          
          INT. A HOTEL ROOM - LATER.
          
          Mini pulls her red top on and heads for the door, as the man
          sheepishly follows her.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       My first night as a call girl was
                       a serious let down. It turns out
                       both guys were in town for the
                       "Promise Keepers" convention.
          
          She reaches the door. He opens it and points to the room
          across from his. Mini walks across and knocks.
                               M
                                  MINI (V.O.)
                       The first one got so excited I
                       didn't even get a chance to get my
                       panties off before he creamed
                       himself.
          
          A HEAVIER MAN in a denim shirt opens it.
          
          INT. THE OTHER HOTEL ROOM - LATER.
          
          The heavier man is on his knees, weeping as he hugs Mini
          around the waist.

                       And the other said I looked so much
                       like his niece, he started
                       whimpering and praying for
                       forgiveness.
          
          She rolls her eyes in frustration.

          EXT. FOUNTAIN AVENUE - NIGHT
          
          Mini drives home, suddenly a SIREN is heard and she sees the
          FLASHING LIGHTS of a cop car behind her. Mini pulls over
          looking pissed.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Time to bat the eye lashes...
          
          The cop car pulls up behind her and a FEMALE COP WITH A BUZZ
          CUT gets out, approaching the car. Mini looks in her mirror,
          with a sly smile. The cop reaches Mini's door and looks down
          at her, clearly attracted to her.
          
          EXT. A BACK ALLEY OFF FOUNTAIN - NIGHT
          
          THE POLICE CRUISER is parked with its lights off.
          
          INT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          THE FEMALE COP is lying on the seat with her legs spread, as
          Mini goes down on her. The woman is clutching the steering
          wheel with her left hand and the seat with her right, hanging
          on for dear life as Mini rocks her world.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    This? Are you kidding? My first
                    woman and my first cop?...It
                    would've been perfect if she hadn't
                    wanted to cuddle afterwards.
          
          INT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - LATER.
          
          Mini unlocks the door and walks in to find Diane passed out,
          face-up on the sofa in a loosely-tied bathrobe. At the sound
          of the door, Diane looks up.
          
                              DIANE
                        (slurring)
                    Oh...wha- what are you doing here?
          M
           ini stops and looks at her mother, absorbing her insightful
          question. Mini sighs and heads for the bedroom.
          
                              DIANE
                    Did you have fun, dear?
          
                              MINI
                    Yeah, I turned two tricks and went
                    down on a dyke cop.

                       Thass nice...
          
          Mini heads down the hallway.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       God, what's gotten into her? She
                       was almost warm and fuzzy.
          
          INT. MINI'S BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini walks in and stops dead in her tracks. A GREASY-HAIRED
          NAKED MAN lies passed out on her bed. His body hair is thick
          and matted. His genitals are covered by her pillow, which he
          cradles like a teddy bear.
          
          Mini's jaw tightens slowly.
          
          INT. THE LOBBY OF THE PENINSULA HOTEL - NIGHT
          
          Mini walks through the lobby past TWO BUSINESSMEN sitting at
          the bar, chatting up TWO VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMEN in their mid
          twenties.
          
                                  MINI (V.O.)
                       After that night, things really
                       picked up.
          
          The men's eyes instinctively follow Mini, as their dates
          exchange a glance of annoyance.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       My one rule which the agency wasn't
                       too happy about was, of course,
                       only firsts, no repeat customers.
          
          EXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING IN SHERMAN OAKS - DAY
          
          This time Mini walks in, dressed like a normal high school
          student, past a SECURITY GUARD.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       But believe me, they didn't have
                       too much trouble honoring that
                       request.
          
          INT. AN IMPRESSIVE CORNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mini is led in by a SECRETARY who presents Mini to one of the
          PENINSULA BUSINESSMEN sitting behind a large oak desk.

                       I'd make house calls to offices at
                       lunch hour and we'd say I was
                       someone's niece or cousin in town
                       on vacation.
          
          The man stands up and greets her like she's family, and then
          quickly shuts the door.
          E
           XT. A HOUSE IN THE HILLS - NIGHT
          
          Mini arrives in her convertible and gets out dressed in a
          cheerleaders uniform.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       And then when football season
                       started, Saturday through Monday...
          
          INT. THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          A HUSKY MAN in a football jersey opens the door to find Mini
          waving her pom poms with a Texas sized grin on her face.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       I was busier than Domino's.
          
          INT/EXT. A MULTI LEVEL PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Mini drives into the garage.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Then one Thursday night I get a a
                       last minute gig at a fuck pad in
                       Westwood that some executive keeps
                       so "wifey" doesn't find the motel
                       bills on the gold card statements.
                       They say I'm just his type...young.
          
          INT. THE LOBBY OF A MODERN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Mini walks quickly through the lobby.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       They tell me he's not big on the
                       chit-chat and he loves paying extra
                       for the stuff we charge extra for.
          
          INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini knocks on the door.

          INT. THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          The executive "convenience" apartment is cold, sterile and
          clearly just used for short amounts of time. Mini opens the
          door, passing the closet, the bathroom door and then stops
          suddenly as she sees...
          
          MARTIN, her stepfather, sitting up in bed.
          
          She quickly turns away before he sees her face.
          
                                    MARTIN
                       Hello?
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Can you fucking believe it?
          
          Mini goes back towards the front door, panicking. She
          absently hangs her jacket up in the closet, to buy some time.
          
                                  MINI
                       Uh...hi,
                           (quickly adopting a
                            southern accent)
                       Sorry, I'm Mlate.

                                 MINI
                       Mind if I freshen up?
          
                                    MARTIN
                       Sure.
          
          Mini ducks into the bathroom.
          
          INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mini shuts the door, turns on the light and looks at herself
          in the mirror. She's almost white from the shock. She looks
          down at the counter.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       My own dad! My first thought was
                       "how sick is he?" But then I
                       started thinking...I'm one to talk,
                       and...well...

                       Why not? I mean, he isn't my real
                       dad...and talk about a first. The
                       more I thought about it...
          
          A wicked glint dances across her eyes.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       ...the more turned on I got. Then I
                       thought that if my mother could do
                       some strange guy in my bed, I could
                       do her strange guy in this bed.

                       you mind turning the lights off,
                       I'm kinda new to all this and a
                       little shy.
          
                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                       No, that's fine, but can we get
                       this show on the road?
          
                                 MINI
                       Sure can, in two shakes of a lamb's
                       tail.
          
          INT. THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Martin turns the light off next to the bed. A little bit of
          light from the street sneaks in around the edges of the
          blinds. After a second, the door opens and Mini comes out in
          a bra and panties.
          
          Mini crosses the room slowly and sits on the edge of the bed,
          letting her hair fall over her face. Martin tries to pull her
          hair away from her eyes, but she turns away, playfully
          shaking her head "no".
          
          She reaches down and touches him through the sheet. He looks
          up at her, clearly excited, but she keeps her gaze down. He
          reaches over to the nightstand and picks up his wallet.

                       You do know that's extra?

                       your eyes.
          
          Martin furrows his brow, disappointed.
          
                                  MINI
                       Come on.
          
          He obeys.

                       Now just keep them shut for a
                       while.
          
          Mini pulls the sheet back, revealing his body to her. She
          starts kissing his chest, inhaling deeply. She looks up at
          his expectant face, intoxicated with her power. Her mouth
          starts to move down his chest. Martin lets out a small,
          almost self-conscious gasp.
          
                                                       FADE OUT:
          
          INT. THE ROOM - LATER.
          
          It is still dark as Martin and Mini lie under the sheets,
          post coitus in the "spoons" position. Martin has a dreamy,
          satisfied look on his face. Mini smiles to herself.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       I can't believe I pulled that off.
                       Keeping my face hidden actually
                       wasn't that hard, and he pretty
                       much let me do whatever I wanted.
          
                                                                   25.
          
          
          
          INT. THE BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini is getting dressed.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    And you know what?...He was damn
                    good. I don't why Mom is throwing
                    the cat all over town, when she can
                    have this every night.
          
          INT. THE BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          The room still dark, Mini emerges from the bathroom, dressed.
          
                              MARTIN
                    I...
                        (searching)
                    that was...you were really good.

                        (southern accent)
                    Thanks, Sugar.
          
                              MARTIN
                    I'd like to see you again,
                    but...uh...I never got your name?
          
          Even in the dark, he looks a little embarrassed. Mini smiles.

          INT/EXT. UPPER LEVEL OF THE BUILDING'S PARKING GARAGE-
          
          LATER.
          
          Mini walks to her car, giddy with excitement.

                               MINI (V.O.)
                    I literally couldn't feel the
                    ground under my feet. A first to
                    top all firsts. I knew I'd tell him
                    one day, but I wanted to savor it
                    for a while.
          
          She reaches her car and looks for her keys in her purse. Her
          eyebrows furrow as she has trouble finding them. Suddenly,
          she realizes they aren't there. She freezes.

                       Ginger! You forgot your...
          
          Startled, her head whips around to see Martin walking towards
          her, carrying her jacket. He stops, the realization setting
          in.
          
                                    MARTIN
                       ...Jacket.
          
          Seconds go by as Mini allows a pathologically triumphant
          smile to spread across her mouth.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Here's to immediate gratification.
          
          Martin starts to look nauseous, as Mini walks slowly over and
          gives him a deep, wet kiss right on the mouth.
          
                                 MINI
                           (whispering)
                       You were great.
          
          Martin just stares straight ahead, numb. After another moment
          he walks to the railing of the garage, staring down at the
          street below.
          
          MARTIN'S POV: A few cars rush by on the street below. It
          appears to be about a three or four story drop.
          
          He looks back at Mini. He starts to lift a leg over the
          railing.
          
                                 MINI
                       Uh, that fall probably won't kill
                       you, and considering what a caring
                       nurturer your wife is, I don't
                       think that's a risk you can afford
                       to take.
          
          Martin looks down at the street for another moment.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       God, what a drama queen. Don't let
                       this little act fool you. He'd
                       never let mom get all his money.
          
          He glances back at her, looking tortured.

                    relations brain working overtime to
                    figure what the appropriate
                    response should be to fucking your

          INT. AN ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP - LATER.
          
          Martin and Mini sit at a booth. Martin stirs his coffee
          looking shell shocked. Mini devours a plate of Belgian
          waffles covered with whipped cream.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    We spent the next few hours just
                    sitting there. I don't think we
                    said three words. I think he was
                    trying to find a way to justify the
                    whole thing, but it was actually
                    one of the sweetest nights I ever
                    spent with a guy.
          
          EXT. VENTURA BLVD- JUST BEFORE DAWN.
          
          Mini drives home with the top down.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    He told me it was a monumental
                    mistake and that we should both
                    never mention it again. I told him
                    that was fine.
          
          INT. THEIR KITCHEN - MORNING
          
          Mini sits at the table eating cereal. Martin enters, looking
          a little guilty as they exchange an awkward glance.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Suddenly, he started coming home
                    every night and even started really
                    asking me about my homework.

          Mini looks up at him, raising her eyebrows.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       I'd be happy to help you with it,

                       you help me pick a good mutual
                       fund?

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Martin watches television next to Diane, who's passed out
          with an empty bottle of vodka sitting on the coffee table. A
          BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION is open as well. Martin
          looks over at Diane, pokes her to make sure she's truly
          blitzed, checks his watch and stands up.

           NT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mini lies in bed under the covers, reading. The door to her
          room opens. She looks at the clock. It reads: 12:15am. Martin
          enters.

                       It took exactly one week.
          
          INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          The lights are off, and the two of them are going at it under
          the covers.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       In the beginning, I was concerned
                       this would violate my rule as he
                       technically was a repeat customer,
                       but then I realized this was my
                       first affair, and with my
                       stepfather no less. To be perfectly
                       honest...I loved it. Talk about
                       electric, knowing at any moment she
                       could walk in was better than any
                       drug. It reminded me of when I was
                       young and brought guys home after
                       school.

                              MINI (V.O.)
                    At first, we were very discreet,
                    only doing it when Joan Crawford
                    wasn't home or was completely
                    comatose.
          
          INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mini and Martin post coital, catching their breath, as they
          both stare at the ceiling. Martin looks over at her and they
          share a conspiratorial smile.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Then we got bolder, doing it before
                    she would pass out. I think we were
                    seeing exactly how far we could
                    push the envelope.
          
          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - EVENING
          
          Mini and Martin poke their heads out from the hallway that
          leads to Mini's bedroom. Diane is watching TV with a martini
          glass in her hand.

                    Mini?
          
          Mini and Martin stop at the sound of her voice, they look at
          each other, realizing Diane's right outside.
          
                              MINI

          Suddenly, the door flies open, as Martin ducks under the
          covers. Diane stands there with a drink in her hand and what
          appears to be cocaine residue under her nostrils. She appears
          truly wired and incoherent, it's unclear whether she's even
          noticed someone else in the bed.

                                 DIANE
                       Have you seen Martin? I think he
                       was in his study a half hour ago.
          
                                 MINI
                       Uh...can't say that I have.
          
                                 DIANE
                       Well, I assume he's gone out, so
                       I've invited Ricardo over for
                       a...cocktail. You know how children
                       make him uneasy, so I'd appreciate
                       if you and...
                           (pointing to Martin under
                            the sheet)
                       ...your friend could either stay in
                       here or use the back door when he
                       arrives.
          
          For a moment, Mini can't believe her mother appears to have
          no problem with there being a man in her bed.
          
                                 MINI
                       Oh...sure, no problem.
          
          Diane shuts the door.
          
                                 MINI
                       Okay, she's gone.
          
          Martin pokes his head out of the covers. The two of them
          share a smile, not believing their luck. They start to laugh
          and then after a moment she kisses him deeply and they resume
          where they left off.

                       Looking back, that may have been
                       the moment we fell in love.

          Mini tries on a cocktail dress, as Martin looks on, giving
          his approval.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    We became inseparable.
          
          EXT. THE TANNEN'S POOL - DAY
          
          Mini sits at the pool side table, as Martin helps her with
          her homework.        M

                    Mom thought it was cute how we had
                    suddenly grown so close, and
                    thought it was wonderful how Martin
                    had taken an interest in my
                    education.
          
          From inside the house, Diane is seen lighting a cigarette,
          looking out at them and smiling.
          
          CLOSE ON HER HOMEWORK: Mini has drawn a dirty cartoon which
          indicates how well endowed he is. She jots down an arrow next
          to the words "actual size".
          
          Martin blushes, averting his eyes.
          
          EXT. THE OUTDOOR PATIO AT IL CIELO RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          The two of them sit at a romantic table in the candlelight,
          as A WAITER refreshes their wine.

                    Now that we were spending time
                    together, I actually started to
                    find out what Martin was like for
                    the first time.
          
          Martin tells her something and they both crack up.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    He wasn't the drip I thought he
                    was.
          
          EXT. VENICE BEACH - SUNSET
          
          The two walk hand in hand, stopping to watch the drum rhythm
          circle filled with LOCAL PERCUSSIONISTS and ON LOOKERS moving
          to the throbbing beat.

                       He was funny, charming, sweet and
                       even a little shy.
          
          Mini jumps into the circle, dancing along with the other
          revelers. Martin is content to watch, until she runs to the
          edge of the circle and pulls him in. Reluctantly, he begins
          to move with her and slowly start to enjoy himself.
          
          EXT. OCEAN AVENUE- SANTA MONICA- EARLY EVENING.
          
          Mini and Martin walk close together, but not the way couples
          do.

                       Being seen in public was no sweat,
                       as long as we didn't act like a
                       couple.

          Martin's Mercedes snakes through an "s" curve, as the lights

          of the city twinkle in the background.

                       This went on for two months, before
                       we had the talk we both knew was
                       coming.
          
          The car pulls off the road at one of the tourist overlook
          areas with a view of the city.

          Martin pulls up the parking break and turns to her.

                       and Pasadena. He must be incredible

          Martin and Mini exchange a smirk. She turns towards them,
          eyes ablaze.
          
                                 DIANE
                       I could use a little help in here!

          Mini and Martin walk in to see Diane on all fours, looking
          under one of the sofas. Her panties are blatantly visible
          from under her mini-skirt. Mini and Martin exchange a smirk.

          Martin tries not to let on how much he's enjoying this.
          Completely frustrated, Diane stops looking and heads for the
          "key" bowl by the door.

          She slams the door behind her. Mini looks at Martin with a
          sly grin then removes a cell phone from her pocket and dials
          a number. As she waits for an answer, she twirls DIANE'S KEY
          RING around her finger.

                       know it's late notice, but I'm
                       going to have to cancel our
                       appointment. What? No, of course, I
                       realize I'll still have to

          INT. THE "OFFICE" OF ANTON MICHELLE - LATER.
          
          ANTON MICHELLE, 30, the very muscular "it boy" masseuse is
          furiously fucking JEANETTE LANG, a similarly hyper-
          aerobicized wife, on his massage table.
          
          He's bent her over the table and is taking her from behind
          when, suddenly, the door flies open. They both look up to
          see...DIANE with a stunned expression.
          
                                 DIANE

          Diane looks at Jeanette, her eyes narrowing.
          
                                 DIANE

                       Yes, I call her after you call me.
          
          Jeanette nervously tries to wrap the massage towel around
          herself.
          
                                 DIANE
                       Why, you sneaky little bitch!
          
          Suddenly, Diane LUNGES for Jeanette, grabbing her by the hair
          and pulling her off the table. Jeannette shrieks as Anton
          struggles to pull up his pants and pry them apart.

          her meat for her, as Mini pours her some red wine.

                       twenty to life! When I told Margo
                       and Penny about her little stunt,
                       they both said they'd have ripped
                       her eyes out. She'll be lucky if
                       anyone speaks to her again.

          FIVE DELIVERY VANS from Rosa Angelica are parked outside as
          FIVE DELIVERY BOYS unload their cargo. It appears that they
          have brought the entire inventory of Rosa Angelica. DOZENS OF

                    about yesterday?

                    Well, it was after lunch and you
                    had washed your pain killers down
                    with some wine. You mumbled
                    something about a party before you
                    took a nap.

                    more mixing pain killers and
                    alcohol.

          Mini leads Carlos back to his vans, just Martin's Mercedes
          pulls up. Diane turns around to see his car and a look of
          dread strikes her.

                    convincing he is.
          
          Martin gets out of the car, surveying the damage. A look of
          pure indignant outrage overcomes him and it's impossible to
          tell this is an act.

          A strung out Diane sits on the couch, smoking and nursing a
          Vodka tonic. THE DOORBELL rings and Diane reacts like a dog
          in a thunderstorm, a jolt of fear coursing through her body.

          Mini and Kayla sit in a history class, looking dreamily at

                    At this point, dear old mummy was
                    so spooked, I was actually afraid
                    she might stop drinking. So I
                    needed a back up plan, to keep
                    her...off-balance.

          Mini quickly picks the flimsy lock on the medicine cabinet
          with a paper clip. She quickly looks through the bottles.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Which leaves me free to help myself
                       to the candy store.
          
          Mini finds what she needs and holds it up to read the label.
          
          CLOSE ON: THE LABEL indicating "RITALIN" and the dosage.
          
          Mini quickly closes the cabinet, walks out and stuffs the

                       My fears of mom giving up the sauce
                       were unfounded. Actually, she
                       started drinking more.
          
          She then takes a few tablets of Ritalin and grinds them up
          with their coffee grinder. She pours that into the blender
          and puts the lid on.

                       I want to talk to you about juries,
                       will you come and talk to me about
                       juries?

                                 DIANE
                       I'd like to be on a jury and say
                       "guilty!" or "sidebar!" What do
                       you think goes on in all the
                       sequestered situations? Do you
                       think any of the jurors have sex
                       with each other? I was once on an
                       episode of Love Boat, playing the
                       role of "Bikini Girl" and my line
                       was "I'll have another," it was
                       with "Isaac" at the pool bar. I had
                       to suck one of the associate
                       producers off to get the line, but
                       it got me my SAG card, so I guess
                       it was worth it.

                       queen I broke my face on and..
          
          The two men try to ignore her, but she keeps following them.

                    Listen, great job, but you need to
                    give me more warning. I was at

                    opportunity. You always said you

          I'm going to have to ask you to leave the mall. We'll walk
          you to your car.
          
                                 DIANE
                       No! I can't leave, he knows where I
                       live!
          
          SECURITY GUARD #1
          
          Maam, you're going to have to leave.
          
                                 DIANE
                       Did you hear me?! He knows where I
                       live!
          
          SECURITY GUARD #1
          
          Who knows?
          
          She hands him the phone.
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                       Him!
          
          The security guard puts the phone to his ear. The BEEPING
          sound of a hang up is heard. He nods to his partner, as he
          removes a walkie talkie.
          
                                 SECURITY GUARD #1
                           (into walkie talkie)
                       Yeah, this is Franklin, we've got a
                       code 7, get an EMS unit over here.
          
          The two guards grab her. She drops the phone and starts
          scratching at one guard's face. The other pepper sprays her,
          as she falls down, howling.
          
                                 DIANE
                       What are you doing?!
          
                                 SECURITY GUARD #1
                       Sorry, Maam, this is for your own
                       protection.
          
          RING! The phone is like a jolt of electricity through her
          body. Diane kicks and punches at the guards.
          
                                 DIANE
                       It's him! Answer it! Answer it! He
                       said he was gonna kill me!
          
          The guards finally tackle her, getting handcuffs on.
          
                                 DIANE
                       He, he knows where I live!
          
          THE OTHER SHOPPERS watch for a moment and lose interest,
          writing her off as just another LA kook.
          
          MINI watches from the upper level, quite satisfied.
          
          INT. MARTIN AND DIANE'S BEDROOM - LATER.
          
          Diane lies in bed, half awake, watching TV. A scotch and soda
          rests in her hand.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       After her performance at the mall,
                       I'm sure she would have qualified
                       as "committable". But that wasn't
                       enough, I wanted her to beg the
                       boys in the white coats to take her
                       away.

          Mini pokes her head in the door of the room.

                                  INI
                       Mom, we're going to get some
                       dinner. Do you want us to bring you
                       back something?
          
                                 DIANE
                       You're leaving? Both of you?
          
                                 MINI (O.S.)
                       For the last three days she hasn't
                       left the house.
          
                                 DIANE
                       Why don't we just order in?
          
                                 MINI
                       Mom, we can't stay in here forever.
                       Do you want to come with us?
          
          Diane considers the question by looking at her face in the
          bed side mirror. It's still puffy and blotchy from the pepper
          spray.
          
                                 MINI
                       Mom?
          
          She looks up at Mini.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Ah...vanity, the most predictable
                       of sins.
          
                                 DIANE
                       I...can't. You two go.
          
                                 MINI
                       Okay.
          
          EXT. THE BACKYARD - LATER.
          
          It is dark and quiet, as the evening dew rises on the lawn.
          
          INT. MARTIN AND DIANE'S BEDROOM - LATER.
          
          Diane is almost asleep when the phone next to the bed RINGS,
          waking her up. She stares at it for a moment, trying to
          decide if she should answer it. On the forth ring, she
          answers.

                                 DIANE
                       Hello?
          
          A DIAL TONE rings in her ear. She hangs up the phone. A
          second later it RINGS again. She waits two rings and then
          answers. Again a DIAL TONE.
          
          Now a bit freaked, Diane is fully awake and staring at the
          phone, waiting... PLINK! Something small hits the window
          across the room. Startled, she turns her head towards it.
          
          DIANE'S POV: Through the window, in the distance by the
          hedges a BLACK CLAD FIGURE is visible, wearing a ski mask and
          goggles. In the figure's right hand there is a gleaming,
          sharp kitchen knife.
          
          She can't believe her eyes.
          
          HER POV: The figure stands silently, bringing the knife up,
          indicating that he's going to cut her throat.
          
          Eyes wild with panic, Diane picks up the phone and dials 911.
                               D
          The phone dials and she waits.
          
                                  IANE
                       Please, please, oh god.
          
          She looks back out the window: THE HOODED FIGURE walks out of
          the bushes and heads towards the house.
          
                                 RECORDED VOICE (V.O.)
                       You have reached 911, if this is an
                       emergency, please remain on the
                       line...
          
                                 DIANE
                       Oh god, oh god!
          
          Diane realizes she doesn't have time to wait and runs out of
          the room, leaving the phone off the hook.
          
          INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Diane stumbles down the hallway, almost tripping on the steps
          down to the living room. She goes straight for the phone on
          the end table next to the couch. She picks it up.
          
                                 RECORDED VOICE (V.O.)
                       Please continue to hold, your call
                       will be answered...

          CONTINUED:
          
          She hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway, but as
          she does, she sees reflected in a wall mirror: ANOTHER BLACK
          CLAD FIGURE outside the living room window, but this one
          holds a HAND AXE.
          
          She turns around to look out the window. THE FIGURE raises
          the axe slowly.
          
                                 DIANE
                       No...no...help! Help!
          
          She heads towards the front door to scream for help, but the
          axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door, making it
          unsafe for her to even try. Her face dissolves into utter
          despair, as she stumbles out of the room.
          
          INT. THE FAMILY DEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          Diane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked. She
          clicks the lock shut, just as THE FIRST FIGURE with the knife
          appears in the door frame.
          
                                 DIANE
                       Oh, God! Help! Someone!
          
          Diane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses
          of the goggles.
          
                                 DIANE
                           (softly )
                       No, please, no.
          
          She slowly backs away from the door, as the figure tries to
          open it. The door frame rattles on its track, as the figure
                               D
          violently tugs at the handle.
          
                                  IANE
                       Help! Someone please, help me!
          
          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          She runs back in, checking THE WINDOW. It's clear. She
          decides to check the front door. She runs over and looks out
          the peep hole.
          
          PEEP HOLE POV: It appears clear.
          
          She starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the
          slit in the door, leaving the chain on.
          
          THROUGH THE SLIT: everything looks good.
          
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          She opens the door and looks towards the front gate, which is
          open. She looks as if she's thinking of making a dash for the
          gates. Just then, from behind the gate, steps the AXE
          WIELDING FIGURE.
          
          It shakes a finger "no" at her, as it walks towards the
          house. Terrified, she slams the door, locking it behind her.
          She instinctively pushes her back against the door, hyper-
          ventilating. She looks up at the ceiling, her eyes filling
          with tears.
          
                                 DIANE
                       Please God, please God...please!
          
          She looks around the room, searching for options. Suddenly,
          her eyes bulge as she sees THE KNIFE WIELDING FIGURE standing
          not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen.
          
          Diane screams and runs back down the hallway, towards the
          bedroom. The knife wielding figure follows behind her. She
          looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the
          shoulder. She shrieks and struggles out of it's grasp before
          running in the bathroom and slamming the door.
          
          INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Diane throws her weight against the door, struggling to keep
          the intruder out. She looks for anything to help her, and
          then sees in the window to the bathroom...THE AXE WIELDING
          FIGURE standing silently, staring back at her.
          D
           iane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears. She looks up
          again at THE WINDOW: It's empty. The pushing on the door
          suddenly stops, but Diane is so disturbed, she doesn't notice
          through her sobs.
          
                                                     CLOSE ON:
          
          A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVED HANDS puts the bedroom phone back on
          its cradle.

          INT. DOCTOR HOGGLY WOGGLY'S TYLER TEXAS BARBECUE - LATER.
          
          Mini and Martin laugh and giggle at the enormous slabs of
          beef put in front of them.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)

          INT. THE HALLWAY OF THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - LATER.
          
          Mini and Martin walk down the hallway towards the master
          bedroom.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    And we returned home expecting to
                    find her blabbering like a three
                    year old.
          
                              MINI
                    Mom, we're home!

                    Diane, honey, we brought you a
                    pulled pork plate!
          
          They reach the door to the bathroom. It's still closed.
          Martin and Mini exchange a look, not believing that Diane
          could still be in there.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Honey? You okay?...Honey?
          
                               MINI
                    Mom?
          
          Martin tries the door. Diane still appears to be leaning
          against it. He pushes hard on the door, opening it a few
          inches. Mini reaches in and shoves Diane over so they can can
          open the door. She appears drugged. They lay her flat and try
          to wake her up.

                       I picked that prescription up three
                       days ago. It was probably more than
                       half full.
          
          The two of them look at each other, studying each other's
          reaction. Seconds go by as both wait for the other to make
          the first move.

                       ambulance?
          
          The suggestion hangs in the air, as Martin feels Diane's
          wrist again.

                              MINI
                    Look, if we're going to screw up
                    the details we might as well call
                    San Quentin and tell them to fire
                    up the dutch oven.
                        (off his confusion)
                    The gas chamber?
                        (exasperated)
                    Martin, please, I can't explain
                    everything.
          
          Mini holds a chic black Chanel suit up to the full length
          mirror.
          
                                                   CUT TO:
          
          Mini applying make-up and lipstick to Diane's face in front
          of her vanity mirror. Martin holds Diane's head still.
          
                              MARTIN
                    I don't think this is a good idea.
          
                               MINI
                    Have you lost your mind, "Mr.
                    Public Relations"? What's the one
                    thing all her friends are going to
                    be talking about when they find
                    out?
                         (waits for his answer)
                    "How did she look"? Do you think
                    anyone will think twice if the
                    answer is "fabulous"?
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
          
          INT. THE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The door to the dark garage opens and Mini turns on a light.
          Martin, carrying Diane (now dressed in the suit) over his
          shoulder, struggles through the doorway.
          
          INT. DIANE'S JAGUAR- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini props Diane up in the driver's seat and begins touching
          up the make-up. She ties a silk scarf around Diane's neck,
          ever so elegantly. Satisfied, she turns the ignition key and
          lowers all the power windows in the car. She looks up at
          Martin.
          
                              MINI
                    Well, if you've got anything to say
                    to her, now would be the time.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Could you just pretend to have a
                    little remorse?
          
          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mini and Martin walk through the door to the garage and close
          it behind them. The hum of the car engine can he heard
          through the wall.
          
          INT. THE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Diane sits in the driver's seat, as THE EXHAUST PIPE spews
          E
          fumes into the sealed garage.
          
           XT. THE HOUSE - LATER.
          
          The garage door is open and Diane's body is visible on the
          garage floor as Martin and Mini kneel beside her. The wail of
          an ambulance siren is heard as it pulls up in front, cutting
          the engine. Mini comes running outside in tears.
          
                              MINI
                    Help us, please! My mom, I think
                    she's dead!
          
          INT. THE GARAGE- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          TWO PARAMEDICS try to revive Diane, having laid her out on
          the floor of the garage. Mini sobs hysterically, as Martin
          hugs her.
          
                              MINI
                    Mommy, wake up!
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                 MARTIN
                       It's okay, sweetheart, everything's
                       going to be okay.
          
                                 FIRST PARAMEDIC
                       Mr. Tannen, I think you should take
                       your daughter in the house.
          
                                 MINI
                       Oh, please, don't let her die!
          
          EXT. THE HOUSE - LATER.
          
          Two POLICE CRUISERS are parked outside as Diane's body, now
          wrapped in a body bag, is being wheeled into the ambulance.
          
          A FEW "LOOKY LOOS" are standing at the gates to the house,
          interested to see what's happened.
          
          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - LATER.
          
          One of the paramedics fills out a report on a clipboard in
          the background, as Martin continues to comfort Mini. A MAN,
          30, with a slightly weary look, walks in the front door
          wearing an off-the-rack grey suit and barber shop haircut.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Mr. Tannen?
          
          Martin looks up.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Yes?
          
                                 MAN
                       I'm Detective Bill Garson, LAPD.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Yes?
          
                                 GARSON
                       I'm sorry to be here right now, but
                       whenever there's an apparent
                       suicide we are required to do an
                       investigation to rule out homicide.
          
                                 MARTIN
                           (clearly surprised)
                       Oh...uh...right.
          
                                 GARSON
                       It's really just a formality.

                       My mother just killed herself! They

                                 MINI
                       Tell him to leave! This is

                       Of course we--

                       Thank you.
          
          Mini looks at Martin, relieved.
          
                                 GARSON
                       But I do need to ask just a few
                       simple questions before I go.
          
                                 MINI
                       Didn't you hear him?! He said--

                           (sharply)
                       Mini, it's okay...just go lie down
                       for a moment.
          
          INT. THE GARAGE- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Martin stands in the garage with Garson, going over what
          happened.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       So after dinner and the movie, we
                       came home at around 11:30 and found
                       her in the garage. I turned off the
                       car and opened the garage door to
                       let out the exhaust.

                                 GARSON
                       What about trying to revive your
                       wife?
          
          Martin seems a bit taken aback by the question.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Of course, we did that too, but I
                       couldn't feel a pulse. Mini took a
                       course at school in CPR and tried
                       that, but...
                           (taking a breath)
                       it didn't work.
          
                                 GARSON
                       So your wife did this sometime
                       between 8:00 and 11:33 when you
                       placed the 911 call?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Yes.
          
                                 GARSON
                       May I ask why you left your wife
                       alone when she had been acting in
                       such an unstable state?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       We never thought she'd do anything
                       like...this. After the episode in
                       the mall, Diane hadn't left the
                       house for three days and my
                       daughter and I just needed a break.
                       It's been a very stressful time.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Of course. So this was your wife's
                       car?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Yes.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Was it in the garage when you left
                       for dinner or did she drive it in?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       What?
          
                                 GARSON
                       Was it in the garage when you left?

                              MARTIN
                    Oh, well...after she was brought
                    home from the mall, the car was
                    towed here and we put it in the
                    garage.
          
                              GARSON
                    And no one drove it during those
                    three days?
          
                              MARTIN
                    No, Mini and I have our own cars.
          
                               GARSON
                    We are going to have to impound it
                    for a few days to take it to the
                    crime lab.

                    Sure.
          
                              GARSON

                              GARSON
                    A suicide note? The deceased
                    usually leaves one.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Oh...right, no...not yet. But we
                    haven't really looked.

                    Mind if I take a look around?
          
          Martin hesitates for just a split second.
          
                              MARTIN
                    No...of course not.
          
          INT. MINI'S BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini and Martin whisper together.
          
                              MINI
                    Who cares if we didn't leave a
                    note? Just relax.
          
                              MARTIN
                    But they said it's--

                    So what? He'll do his little dance
                    and chalk it up to another failed
                    actress who realized after forty
                    she might as well be dead.

                    The sweatsuits and goggles.
          
                              MINI
                    I already snuck out the back and
                    threw them in Mike Rudell's garbage
                    cans.

                       After the funeral, I felt it would
                       be good idea if we took a vacation
                       and went somewhere where we could
                       act like a real couple for the
                       first time.

                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Martin agreed and let me pick the
                       place. I chose Las Hadas in
                       Mexico, because that's where Dudley
                       Moore and Bo Derek did it in Ten.

                       I figured sugar daddy/younger woman
                       would be old news down there.
          
          A few other OLDER MAN/YOUNGER WOMAN couples lounge near them,
          mixed among more traditional pairings.

          MARIACHIS play a sexy Mexican ballad as Mini, wearing a thin
          sundress, dances very close with Martin.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       I could feel that Martin had let
                       the whole thing with the cops go.
                       It had been two weeks since Mom's
                       death and it already felt like it
                       happened a year ago.
          
          EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT
          
          Mini lies on top of Martin on a lounge chair. They both stare
          up at the stars. The gentle breaking of waves further adds to
          the tranquility of the evening.

          Martin and Mini look up to see MIKE RUDELL, their producer
          neighbor, peering at them in the dark. He has an arm wrapped
          around the waist of A YOUNG BLONDE who is clearly Playmate
          material.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       I swear I thought Martin was going
                       to wet himself.
          
          Mini quickly sits up, trying to make it look like innocent
          father/daughter closeness.
          
                                 MARTIN
                           (extremely tense)
                       Oh...hi, Mike, what, what are you

                       were coming here for a little R&R,
                       and I suddenly realized I hadn't
                       taken a vacation in god knows when.
                       Jennifer, this is my neighbor
                       Martin Tannen and his daughter,
                       Mini.
          
          Martin barely looks at Jennifer as he shakes her hand. She
          looks equally uncomfortable.
          
                                 MINI
                       I'm sorry, but, Jennifer, have we
                       met? You look so familiar.
          
          Jennifer looks quite uneasy, as she forces a smile.

                    way, I guess I'm fair game.

                    ...don't hesitate to ask. Remember
                    I'm just right across the fence.
          
          The meaning is not lost on Martin.

          Martin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very
          unhappy. From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a
          bikini.

                    riot.
          
          Martin looks up from the book, looking around suspiciously.
          Suddenly, Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the
          mouth. He instinctively pulls back.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Suddenly, Martin was acting like he
                    really was my father.
          
          Just then, Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area, waving
          at them. Mini's head is not close enough for the scene to
          look incriminating, but Martin is too spooked to know the
          difference.

                    What little sex we were having    was
                    getting dull.

                       I was bored. I became concerned
                       that in my world of firsts I had
                       achieved my greatest first...

                       As for school, well, I was just in
                       no state to return to my studies
                       after the trauma of my mother's
                       death.

          Mini answers it, having removed her Marilyn wig, but still in
          the sequined dress. Detective Garson stands at the door,
          looking her up and down. Mini hides her surprise well.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Uh oh.

                       And "yes", I remember you, you were
                       the big hearted lug who wanted your
                       questions answered while my mother
                       was still warm.

                       Again, I am sorry about that night,
                       but it is policy that we get the
                       preliminary facts as soon as
                       possible.

          Mini leads him in.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       I know, it's stupid as hell to talk
                       to a cop without a lawyer, but I
                       didn't want to look jumpy and my
                       first real interrogation? I could
                       feel something tingle deep inside.
          
          Mini and Garson take a seat. Mini lights a cigarette. Garson
          looks over her outfit again.

                       Perfectly legal. So, anyway, we got
                       the preliminary coroner's report.
                       Although the pills knocked her out,
                       she died of the carbon monoxide
                       poisoning from the exhaust.

                       Well, it's just a little unusual
                       for a suicide victim to use two
                       methods. Her choices seemed, I
                       don't know how to put it...
                       improvisational.
          
                                 MINI
                       Well, maybe she wanted to drift off
                       before the fumes got her? She
                       clearly put some thought into that
                       outfit.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Clearly...But dying from carbon
                       monoxide poisoning is actually
                       pretty painless, you just basically
                       pass out.
          
                                 MINI
                       I doubt she would have had an
                       intimate knowledge of how car fumes
                       feel when you choke on them.

                       I suppose you're right...Also we
                       checked the phone records and there
                       was a 911 call placed at 8:12. It
                       was a hang up and when the 911
                       dispatcher called back a few
                       minutes later, there was no answer.

                       exciting thing I've done in a
                       while, but even I know when the

          MIKE RUDELL looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of
          his home. He's dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is
          smoking a pipe, which he raises in greeting. His eyes are
          locked on hers.

          Martin looks at Mini, trying hard not to allow his anger to
          escape for a second.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Fair enough.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Terrific...now, the preliminary
                       blood report indicated she had
                       ritalin in her system.
          
          Mini's eyes shift between Garson and his note pad.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       I wasn't aware my wife was taking
                       ritalin.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Neither was her physician, he had
                       never prescribed it.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Well, as you may have discovered by
                       now, my wife had substance abuse
                       problems, I'm sure there were many
                       drugs she took without a
                       prescription.
          
                                 GARSON
                       I know, but it's an odd drug to be
                       taking. It's mostly given to adults
                       and children with Attention Deficit
                       Disorder to calm them. But in
                       people who don't need it, it has
                       the reverse effect, making them
                       incredibly hyper and agitated.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Again, Detective, I really can't
                       say why she was taking these drugs.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Fair enough...Mr. Tannen, were you
                       and your wife close?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       No...we led, for the most part,
                       separate lives. We had decided to
                       stay together for Mini.

                              MARTIN
                    Listen, Detective Garson, I must
                    admit I don't see the relevance of
                    these questions. Diane was an
                    extremely disturbed person. Haven't
                    you interviewed enough people who
                    saw her at her worst?
          
                              GARSON
                    Yes, but what I'm still unclear
                    about is her time of death.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Well, that makes two of us...
                    Again, detective, we were out for

                    After dinner you saw a movie that
                    night?

                              MARTIN
                    Yeah, he slides down Washington's

          His face and shoulders glisten with sweat, as she lifts one
          leg around his waist and then the other. As she straddles
          him, their hips rocking together, she puts her arms around
          his neck and leans all the way back, her hair hanging down in
          ecstasy.
          
          As she pulls herself back up, her eyes scan the room.

                    Was there any question?
          
          Mini's eyes move quickly enough past him that it's ambiguous
          to him whether she spotted him or not.
          
          Martin watches as Mini leans in and in SLOW MOTION gives her

          Mini's car pulls into the driveway. She gets out, looking
          rumpled.
          
          INT. THE KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini walks in to find Martin, sitting at the table in a
          bathrobe. He's reading the paper, with a cup of coffee. Mini
          opens the fridge and removes a carton of orange juice, taking
          a big slug.
          
                              MARTIN
                    A phone call would have been
                    appreciated at some point. I was
                    worried.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Worried that refugee from a J.Lo
                    video rode me `til the tires fell
                    off?

                       Uh...Martin, I'm not sure you're
                       aware, but at this point you can't
                       be my dad and my lover. Where I go
                       and how late I stay out is my
                       business.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       I wasn't saying that as a dad.
                           (very sincere)
                       Before your mother and I...grew
                       apart, I would worry if she was out
                       late.
          
                                  MINI
                       Well, that's sweet, but I'm not her
                       and I can assure you I won't end up
                       passed out in some greaseball's
                       fuck pad with my panties around my

                       What the hell's gotten into you? I
                       just expressed concern for you and
                       you turn around and threaten me?
                       Mini, in a relationship, it's okay
                       to worry about someone else.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       I kind of have to admire this. He
                       really is one of the world's
                       premiere bullshit artists.

                       Haven't you ever been in a
                       relationship?
          
          The questions hangs in the air. Mini looks down, almost
          ashamed.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       My god, you haven't.
          
          She tries to hold back the tears as she looks up.

          INT. AN ELEVATOR - MORNING
          
          Martin rides up in the elevator with other OFFICE WORKERS.
          His eyes look tired from staying up all night.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Fake tears aside...he actually was
                    my first relationship. Which, in
                    itself, was significant, because I
                    had always felt that by living my
                    life by the rule of firsts, I would
                    never be able to find someone who
                    could accept me on those terms.
          
          INT. MARTIN'S OFFICE - MORNING
          
          He strides off the elevator sending "hellos" and nods to his
          employees, as he passes the large corporate logo: "BOYD,
          MATHER, TANNEN & ASSOCIATES".
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    And I was willing to give him the
                    chance to be that person...
          
          He reaches his desk, where his YOUNG SECRETARY, LOIS, is
          waiting with an envelope.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    ...if he could just hold it
                    together.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Morning, Lois.

                    Mr. Tannen, this just arrived for
                    you.
          
          She hands him a manila envelope marked "MARTIN TANNEN- VIA
          MESSENGER". He takes it from her and walks into his office,
          sitting down. He opens the package to find an 8x10 glossy
          photo of:

                       That's when things started to get
                       interesting.
          
          Martin looks up, the empty look in his eyes revealing a
          terrified mind already calculating the potential outcomes. He
          examines THE ENVELOPE. There is a SPEEDWAY COURIER STICKER,
          but no return address.
          
          INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
          
          Martin angrily honks his horn in slow traffic as he talks on
          his cell.

                       Lois, I need you to re-schedule the
                       Chapman meeting...
                           (listening)
                       I know...Tell him...tell him it's
                       an unavoidable emergency.
          
          INT. SPEEDWAY COURIER - DAY
          
          Martin stands at the front desk, talking to A CLERK.

                       What do you mean you don't keep
                       records on who your senders are?
          
                                 CLERK
                       When it's paid cash, we only keep
                       records on packages, not envelopes.
          
          EXT. THE SPEEDWAY BRANCH - CONTINUOUS
          
          Martin walks outside, frustrated. His cell goes off and he
          answers it.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Yeah?
          
                                 LOIS (O.S.)
                       Mr. Tannen, I just spoke to Mr.
                       Chapman...he told me to tell you
                       that he's going to be seeking a new
                       firm to handle his company's needs.

          Martin hangs up the phone, as he looks up, he sees across the
          street a large sign on a modern office building: RUDELL
          WORLDWIDE ENTERTAINMENT.
          
          Martin closes his eyes, trying to remain in control.

          Martin walks into the office to find his partners, STEVE BOYD
          and CHARLES MATHER waiting for him. Martin looks surprised
          and concerned.

          The color drains from Martin's face.

          Martin sits in the traffic on Beverly Glen. The veins in his
          neck are starting to bulge as he stares straight ahead.
          Suddenly, he starts pounding on the steering wheel.

                       shit!
          
          Just then, he looks over to the next car. A three year old
          GIRL in the back seat holds up her "PO" TELETUBBY DOLL to
          show him.

                       the only person at the resort who
                       knew who we were!

                       He could go to the cops and tell
                       them you threatened him, then
                       they'd really start investigating
                       us. It's just one photo and you
                       can't even really tell if it's me.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       That son of bitch just cost me the
                       firm I worked fifteen years to
                       build.
          
                                 MINI
                       Well, if you start waving that
                       thing around, he's gonna cost you a
                       lot more than that.
          
          INT. THEIR BEDROOM - LATER.
          
          Mini lies awake, looking annoyed as Martin keeps turning and
          shifting in bed.

                       Martin didn't sleep at all that
                       night and made damn well sure I
                       didn't either.
          
          EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF MIKE RUDELL'S HOUSE - MORNING
          
          Mini walks up the long driveway.

                       With Mommy Dearest out of the way,
                       I decided to take the matter of
                       Rudell into my own hands. I knew
                       Martin wouldn't approve, but at
                       this point...action had to be
                       taken.
          
          She arrives at the front door and rings the bell.

                       disorient him and then kill him...
          
          The door opens and Rudell stands before her in the same plush
          bathrobe.

                       redecorated.

                       It was just finished. I'm sorry
                       your mother never got to see it
                       completed.
          
                                 MINI

                       It's been hard, but I guess I've
                       just been telling myself that she's
                       probably much happier where she is
                       now.

                       Well, that too, but "correct" was
                       the word I was thinking of. Do you
                       like the show?

                       how you never know if the couples
                       will decide to stay together.

                       Sure, those dates are really quite
                       harmless. You just spend an evening
                       with the person. We prep you on
                       what to say before the show.

          Rudell lets his eyes take a walk all over her. Mini, keenly

                       Well, um...this may sound strange,
                       but you haven't seen any suspicious
                       looking people around our house

                    mean, certainly older men and

                    Oh, it wasn't like we were naked or
                    anything. I mean, of course, he's

                       been paying for it in one form or

          He accidently gets some whip cream on his nose. Mini reaches
          over and wipes it off, licking her finger clean. Rudell tries

          They approach TROY, the football player she humiliated

          Mini and Kayla walk in with other students. Her teacher,
          Warren Bishop, comes over to her immediately.
          
                                 BISHOP
                       Mini, I've got a message for you to
                       go to the principal's office right
                       away.
          
          INT. THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER.
          
          Mini is led in by A SECRETARY, as Detective Garson sits in a
          chair next to PRINCIPAL PATTY ANDREWS, 50.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Then things got interesting again.
          
          Mini immediately sizes up the situation and takes on the
          appropriate concerned tone.

                       Detective Garson, is everything all
                       right?
          
          CLOSE ON: A VIDEO MONITOR.
          A
            black and white surveillance tape of one of the school's
          hallways is seen.
          
                                 GARSON (O.S.)
                       Mini, this tape was shot a week
                       before your mother's death.
          
          The door to the nurses office is seen opening and Nurse
          Hauptführer walks out.
          
                                 GARSON (O.S.)
                       The next day, the school nurse
                       reported two bottles of Ritalin
                       missing from the medicine cabinet.
          
          A few seconds later, Mini is seen entering the nurse's
          office, checking over her shoulder to make sure no one saw
          her. THE TAPE FREEZES, then fast forwards. Mini is seen
          leaving the office, stuffing something in her pocket.
          
          INT. AN EMPTY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          A TV and VCR sit on a rolling cabinet in the corner, as
          Garson puts down the remote and looks at Mini. Principal
          Andrews is not pleased.
          
                                 GARSON
                       We've lifted two prints from the
                       door and the inside of the medicine
                       cabinet. They don't match the
                       nurse.
          
                                 PRINCIPAL ANDREWS
                       Mini, is there something you'd like
                       to say to Detective Garson?
          
          Mini eyes remain calm.
          
                                 MINI

                       Führer sucking down her afternoon
                       fix of Smirnoff, or don't you have

                    Detective Garson, I assume, there

          Martin gets off the elevator and heads across the lobby.
          GARSON and A UNIFORMED OFFICER approach him. Martin looks a
          little unnerved to see them.
          
                              GARSON
                    Ah, Mr. Tannen, we were just coming
                    up to see you. Have you got a
                    minute?
          
                              MARTIN
                    Detective, I told you no more
                    questions without my lawyer.
          
                              GARSON
                    I think you'd better call him.
          
          INT. AN INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER.
          
          Martin sits at a table, conferring with his lawyer, NED
          VOLANT, an impeccably dressed operator with a mane of thick,
          heavily gelled hair. Garson sits across from them.
          
                              GARSON
                    There's a small discrepancy that I
                    can't quite figure out and I was
                    hoping you might be able to explain
                    it.

                       didn't die from the pills. She
                       wasn't conscious past 9:30, but it
                       was the fumes that killed her.

                       I'm sorry, but this is harassment.
          
                                 GARSON
                       See, here's what I needed to ask
                       you. The gas tank in the Jag was
                       almost full, just a gallon had been
                       used.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       And?
          
                                 GARSON
                       Well, if she was unconscious by
                       9:30, that means the car must have
                       been running for at least two hours
                       when you found her. An unconscious
                       person can't turn on a car, right?
          
                                 VOLANT
                       Detective, with all due respect,
                       could you get to the point?
          
                                 GARSON
                       Well, here's where I get confused,
                       see, that particular model idling
                       for two hours will burn at least
                       four gallons of gas.
          
          Martin tries to remain calm, as the panic starts to settle in
          for a long stay.
          
                                 GARSON
                       So, there's really no way the tank
                       could be almost full if it was
                       running for two hours. Is there?
          
          He looks at Martin, waiting for an answer.

                    So, I guess what I'm asking is,
                    whose idea was it to put her in the
                    car?
          
                              VOLANT
                    Martin, don't say anything.
          
                              GARSON
                    Now, Mr. Tannen, you clearly had
                    the most to gain from her death,
                    but I've learned from a number of
                    your wife's friends that she and
                    Mini had a strained relationship.
          
                              VOLANT
                    Again, Detective, my client won't
                    be answering anything, so let's
                    just cut the cat and mouse.
          
                              GARSON
                    I'd like Mr. Tannen to know that if
                    he's trying to be a protective
                    father by covering up something
                    Mini did, I'd be careful. The
                    district attorney is viewing this
                    case as an opportunity to show the
                    public that the rich don't get away
                    with murder in this town.
          
          Martin whispers something in Volant's ear and he in turn,
                               V
          whispers back.
          
                               OLANT
                    Does this mean he's offering Mr.
                    Tannen immunity if he says he was
                    protecting his daughter?
          
          Garson takes a sip of water, as Martin anxiously waits for
          his answer.
          
                              GARSON
                    It's a strong possibility. But he
                    wants Mr. Tannen to know he will go
                    for the maximum sentence if he
                    doesn't. No manslaughter, no plea
                    bargains, nothing.
          
          Martin's eyes shift slightly.
          
                                                                  104.

                    library with the candlestick.
          
          Garson smiles at Mini, admiring her resolve.
          
                              PELHAM
                        (nervously)
                    Uh...Miss Drogues, as your lawyer-
          
                              MINI
                    Don't wet your pants, I know when
                    to shut up and swallow...
          
          Mini takes out a sip a water, letting a trickle of liquid
          roll down her chin.
          
                              MINI
                    ...my tongue.
          
          Even Garson appears a little intimidated by the overt
          flirtation.

                    Look, the fact that the marriage
                    was unhappy and there was no pre-
                    nup gives all the motive to Martin.
          
                              MINI
                    So you want me to say it was his
                    idea?
          
                              GARSON
                    If it was his idea, give me one
                    reason you should take the fall?
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    At that moment I knew we had him.
                    If he was trying to get me to rat
                    on Martin, he didn't have enough to
                    charge either one of us.

                       So if I tell the jury it was his
                       idea and I was scared for my life,
                       because he said he'd kill me if I
                       ever told anyone, then I walk?
          
          Garson instinctively leans forward in his chair, just a bit.
          Mini stares into Garson's eyes, unflinching. She looks around
          the room, weighing her options. Pelham attempts to whisper
          something in her ear. She waves him off.

          INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
          
          Mini and Martin drive home together. There is an icy chill
          between them, as Martin looks over at Mini.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       I never doubted for a minute you
                       were going to hold firm. Not a
                       second. I hope you know that?
          
                                 MINI
                       Oh, I knew...I knew.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Good. You realize, we've got to
                       rely on each other?
          
                                 MINI
                       Who else do we have?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Exactly. We're almost home free. My
                       lawyer says that gas gauge theory
                       is circumstantial as hell. I've
                       only got one concern now.
          
                                 MINI
                       What?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Rudell. If a jury knew we were a
                       couple, we've both got a motive and
                       that changes everything.
          
          Mini puts her hand on Martin's, reassuringly.

                       Garson had succeeded in planting
                       the seeds of distrust.
          
          MINI turns around and Martin ducks into a boutique.

                       what some might call...
          
          A few seconds later, Martin walks out of the theater, wearing
          dark glasses and a hat. He follows them.

          Mini and her male counterpart are just a bit better looking

                       remain virgins until marriage, I

                    special.

                    Let me tell you, Becky, you're in
                    for a wild ride from this Bronco.

                              BECKY (O.S.)
                    You slept with her?!
          
                              MINI
                    God, Martin, it was a one time
                    thing. He was a virgin, how could
                    I say "no"? Believe me, she'll
                    thank me after their wedding night.
          
                              MARTIN
                    You had me come home early to-
          
                              MINI
                    Don't be jealous. It won't happen
                    again. It was just a goof.
          
          Martin stands there, speechless, while ON THE SCREEN:
          
          BECKY dissolves into a puddle of tears as Jason tries to
          console her. Suddenly, she runs off stage.
          
          MARTIN picks up the remote and hits "mute".
          
                              MARTIN
                    Rudell? He let you go on?
          
                              MINI
                    Yeah, I thought it would be fun. I
                    wasn't really supposed to, you
                    know, "go all the way" but-
          
                              MARTIN
                    I can't believe you...th-that
                    couple, you ruined their
                    relationship.

                    Excuse me, but the show is called
                    Absolutely Positive for a reason.
                    Clearly, the only thing Jason was
                    positive about was-
          
                               MARTIN
                    You're a sick little twist, you

                    I need some air.
          
                              MINI
                    Oh, by the way, some intern from
                    your office stopped by earlier
                    today with something. It's on the
                    desk.
          
          Martin walks over to the desk and picks up an envelope marked
          "MARTIN TANNEN". He opens it to find...
          
          AN 8x11 PHOTO of him and Mini kissing passionately on the
          beach in Mexico. This time there is no question as to the
          nature of their relationship. Scrawled across the bottom in
          black marker is: "REMEMBER, I'M JUST ACROSS THE FENCE".
          
          Martin's eyes scan the photo, a look of resignation setting
          in.
          
                              MINI
                    What is it?
          
          Martin slowly holds it up for her to see.
          
                              MINI
                    Oh, my god.
          
                              MARTIN
                        (very evenly)
                    I think it's time I had a little
                    chat with our neighbor
          
                              MINI
                    No, this is exactly what he wants!
                    What if he's working with Garson?
          
                              MARTIN
                    Then he can't blackmail me. Wait
                    here, I'll be right back.
          
          Martin heads for the back door.
          
                              MINI
                    No, please, don't do this! Let me
                    go with you!
          
                              MARTIN
                    I said wait here.
          
          Mini jumps up and runs over to him, grabbing his wrist.

                       He'll never leave us alone, you
                       realize that?
          
                                 MINI
                       No! Let me talk to him, he promised
                       me he wouldn't hurt us!

                       A few days ago!

                       I was doing it for us! I figured he
                       wouldn't turn us in if I...

          Martin explodes, punching Rudell in the mouth, sending him
          staggering backwards inside.

          Mini stands at the window, nervously waiting on the phone.
          She looks out THE WINDOW at the fight beginning in Rudell's
          house.

          Rudell struggles to his feet and charges Martin, shoving him
          against his wet bar. Rudell grabs a glass and smashes it
          over Martin's face, grinding the glass into his face.

          Martin screams in agony and throws Rudell off him. Rudell
          crashes into a glass coffee table, smashing it to pieces.
          
          Martin tries to pick the glass out of his eyes, as Rudell
          gets to his feet and grabs one of metal legs of the shattered
          coffee table.

          He rushes Martin, clubbing him in the head with it. Martin
          crumples to the floor and Rudell starts kicking him. Martin
          grabs Rudell by the ankles and flips him.
          
          The two men grapple on the floor.

          Rudell and Martin crash through the plate glass window on to
          the brick patio. Martin gets to his feet first and grabs a
          golf club propped up on a chair next to the putting green.

          Rudell struggles to his feet, just in time to see the
          pitching wedge heading straight for his ribs. THWACK! Martin
          catches him square and he goes down like a sack of potatoes.
          Martin starts hitting him with one swing after another.

          another.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       You son of a bitch! How's that

          Martin bends down and grabs Rudell's hair, twisting his head
          around so he can look him in the eye. In the distance a SIREN
          is heard getting closer.

          Martin smashes his face into the patio. Rudell lets out a
          moan, grasping at the ground, trying to get up, but his legs
          don't obey him. Martin stands up and grabs the club, raising
          it with both hands above his head for a final swing.

          He turns around to see Mini, tears coming down her cheeks,
          standing ten feet away. The SIRENS suddenly stop.

          He raises the club again. Mini runs for him, grabbing his arm
          before it comes down.

          Martin turns around to see TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS with their
          guns drawn. Martin looks down at Rudell, gasping for air, his
          face covered in blood. He looks at his own blood-soaked
          clothes, the reality hitting him.

          Martin obeys and Mini runs into the arms of the second
          officer. The first one moves quickly to Martin and shoves him
          on the ground.

                       Why?
                           (taken aback)
                       Mini, if he recovers, he may try to
                       blackmail you with those pictures.
          
                                 MINI
                           (nonchalant)
                       Oh...I wouldn't worry about that.
          
                                  MARTIN
                       But if the D.A. got those pictures,
                       you could-
          
                                 MINI
                       I'm pretty sure he won't be doing
                       anything with them.
          
          He looks suddenly very worried.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Mini, you're not thinking of
                       sleeping with him to keep him
                       quiet? Because I've met people in
                       here who could help us with him, if
                       it comes to that.
          
                                  MINI

                                 MARTIN
                       They know people on the outside we
                       could...pay to make sure he doesn't
                       try to take advantage of you.
          
                                 MINI
                       Oh, gosh, that's so romantic. It's
                       like you're a real life criminal
                       with connections and everything,
                       but I'm a little surprised you
                       haven't figured it out yet.
          
                                  MARTIN
                       What?

          Mini's eyes glint ever so slightly, as she examines Martin's
          face, almost as if he's an animal at the zoo.
          
                              MINI
                    Oh...wow, like I thought you were
                    just playing along `cause I'm your
                    only link to the outside world, but
                    you really don't know?
          
          Martin furrows his brow, confused.

                    Rudell didn't send those pictures.
          
          He suddenly becomes very still, as Mini's lips curl in a thin
          smile.
          
                              MINI
                    You remember, Aurelio?
          
          Martin looks at her blankly.

                    Our cabana boy from Mexico?
          
          Suddenly, it hits him.   He looks almost nauseous.
          
                              MINI
                    What a sweetie, I thought I might
                    have to fuck him, but just giving
                    him the camera was enough.
          
          His knuckles tighten around the phone.
          
                              MARTIN
                    You...you...

                    It was pretty clear Garson wasn't
                    gonna give up, and sooner or later
                    he'd find enough to charge us. It
                    just seemed ridiculous that we'd
                    both end up suffering.
          
          Martins jaw tightens as his pupils go black.
          
                              MINI

                    if you thought of it first...you
                    know I'm right.
          
          The veins start to bulge in his arm holding the phone.

                    are pretty much out of the
                    question, I thought it would be
                    cool if we tried a little prison
                    phone sex.

                    to come back for a few weeks.

                    wouldn't be single in here for
                    long.
          
          A PRISON GUARD appears behind Martin's stall.

          The guard moves to take the phone from him. Martin clutches
          it to his head.
          
                              MARTIN

                    things!
          
          The guard struggles to rip the phone away, but Martin holds
          on for dear life.
          
                              MARTIN
                    I'm gonna kill you! Do you hear me,

          Finally, the guard smashes Martin with a billy club, sending
          him sprawling on the floor. Martin screams behind the glass,
          but cannot be heard, as the guard hog ties him and drags him
          away by his feet.
          
          EXT. A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY - DAY
          
          SENIORS in gowns sit awaiting their diplomas, as PARENTS sit
          in the audience, fanning themselves with programs. Mini
          stands at the dais, addressing the class.

                    few months of my life have been
                    very difficult. I don't know how I
                    would have gotten through it
                    without all of you. I really think
                    it is a testament to the love in
                    this institution, that I stand
                    before you today, as the first
                    straight "C" student in school
                    history voted Valedictorian.
          
          A FEW CHEERS go up from the rowdier students.

                       Again, to Marvin Tepperman, the
                       real valedictorian, he deserved
                       this and I want to wish him a
                       speedy recovery. I spoke to his
                       doctors today and they say, with
                       medication and therapy, Marvin
                       should be able to attend Harvard
                       this fall.

                       While I may not have excelled in
                       the classroom, I think my recent
                       experiences in that bigger
                       schoolhouse we call "life", have
                       taught me a few lessons that I'd
                       like to share with my fellow
                       graduates.

                       open up a world of new experiences
                       you can't even imagine.

                       forget your family, your parents.
                       Don't forget they're people too,
                       and while we may not always agree
                       with them, remember to love them
                       when they need love.
          
          A few PARENTS look almost surprised to hear positive things
          said about them.
