    INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - DAY                                      1

    "HEAD OVER HEELS" by the Go-Go's plays as we wind through a
    flock of abstract, silky, golden strands -- PULLING BACK, to          
    discover that the strands are hair on a BLONDE GIRL's head.           
    But not just any blonde girl, a girl in Delta Gamma, the
    blondest, most beautiful sorority at USC.

    We PULL BACK further to see that she's signing a handmade
    card. She holds it up ~ OVER HER SHOULDER, we see hearts              
    and glitter surrounding and "Good Luck Tonight!" and "Elle            
    and Warner forever!."

    She carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across
    the hall, into the room of --

    THREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS, who stop practicing their pom-pom
    routine to sign the card. As they finish, we follow the Card
    Girl out and into the room of --

    A BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a
    Stairmaster as "General Hospital" plays on a tiny TV. She
    signs the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, to           
    the room of--

    A BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long
    enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her
    neck. She hands the card back and we head into the room of --

    A BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a
    glass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE         
    GIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being
    signed, as the drinks go the other.

    Once the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we
    follow her out of the room and down the hall until she
    reaches the very last and biggest door --
    She puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides
    the card under the door.

    INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS                   2


    The CARD slides into the pink room, hitting the feet of
    UNDERDOG, a tiny chihuahua ~ who picks it up in his mouth
    and trots it over to a pair of perfectly pedicured feet in
    strappy sandals.

    An equally perfectly manicured hand with a "Sisters Forever"
    charm bracelet dangling from the wrist, scoops up Underdog.

                                                                 2.

    As he rises, we RISE WITH HIM, passing toned, waxed, tanned
    legs in pink Prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs
    encased in a spaghetti-strap top -- until we finally reveal a
    magnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet, beautiful
    face. This is ELLE WOODS, 21, the Goddess Queen of Delta
    Gamma. She talks on a pink, fuzzy phone.

                        ELLE

                  (into the phone)
              I love you, too!
    Behind her, a "Go USC" banner is pinned to the pink wall. A
    stack of "Cosmopolitan"s and "Glamour"s teeters on the
    dresser. The closet overflows with trendy, designer clothes
    in a predominance of pink.

                        ELLE (CONT'D)

                  (continuing; into phone)
              I'll see you tonight.
    She hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy, kissing Underdog's
    head and taking the card out of his mouth. She reads it,
    touched.

                        ELLE (CONT'D)

                  (continuing)
              "Elle and Warner forever". Aww...
    Underdog yips.

                                                                   2


3   INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - SAME TIME


    A Delta Gamma/Sigma Chi barbecue in full swing. Beautiful
    college students drink beer and mingle, trying to figure out
    who they're going to sleep with next.
    The main wall of the living room has been designated as a
    "Model Wall" of Delta Gamma girls -- ELLE smiles at us from a
    Hawaiian Tropic ad and a Miss June USC calendar photo. A
    cover of an Italian Vogue shows a blonde sexpot MARGOT; a USC
    cheerleader poster displays a hard-bodied non-blonde SERENA
    in a pom-pom pose.
    Serena walks up, fending off an admirer.

                        SERENA

              Jeremy, enough! I am not going to formal
              with you.
    Jeremy slinks off as Margot arrives, agitated.

                        MARGOT

              Can someone please tell Rick that he is
              not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?

                     ELLE (O.S.)

          You guys are so sweet!

ELLE, a vision of fluffy blondeness, runs down the stairs
toward Serena and Margot, holding the card.

                          ELLE (CONT'D)

          But I ' m not positive it's gonna happen
          to n i g h t --

                  . SERENA

          Helloo...he just had lunch with his
          grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".

                    MARGOT

          Why else would she have flown in from
          Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a
          six carat diamond.

                     ELLE

               (excited)
          You think?

                     SERENA

          I can't believe you're getting engaged!

           ·    .           .

The three girls jump up and down, squealing and hugging.

                     ELLE

          C'mon ·-- you have to help me pick out the
          perfect outfit.

As they head toward the door, Elle spots AMY, a shy girl in a
Delta Gamma Pledge sweatshirt, standing alone.


                     ELLE (CONT'D)

               (continuing)
          Amy, what's wrong?


                    AMY

          I don't really -- know anyone.


                     ELLE

               (teasing)
          That's because you spend too much time in
          the library. Come with me.
               (to Serena and Margot)
          I'll meet you outside.
As they go, Elle leads Amy over to a group of jovial Sigma
Chi brothers.

            Bra ndon , Jason, Grant --this is Amy.
            Why don't you tell her about the time you
            guys went golfing naked?

Elle winks at Amy and.heads off as the guys launch into their
story.

                      BRANDON

            It was classic.     Jason hit with wood all
            day.

                      GRANT

            And we never ran out of balls --
Amy laughs.

INT. SUNSET PLAZA BOUTIQUE - DAY


Serena and Margot watch as Elle stands in front of a mirror,
trying on a Herve Leger white mini-dress. Sexy and ultra-
tight.                                               ;


                      ELLE

            Too demure?


                        MARGOT

            I think you should go with red. It's the
            color of confidence.

                        ELLE

            Well, I don't want to look like I know
            what's coming. . .

                      SERENA

            I don't understand why you're completely
            disregarding your signature color.
She holds up a tiny pink slipdress.

                       ELLE

            He's proposing! I can't look like I
            would on any date. This is the date. The
            night I'll always remember. I want to
            look special. Bridal . . . but not like I
            suspect anything.

ACROSS THE STORE


A SALESWOMAN looks at her cohort.

                          SALESWOMAN

                  (sot.to)
             There ' s nothing I love more than a dumb
             blonde with daddy's plastic.
She grabs a dress off the Clearance Sale rack, ripping off
the "HALF PRICE" TAG.


ON ELLE AND THE GIRLS


                      . SERENA

             I can't wait to see you wearing The Rock!

Elle looks at them, suddenly concerned.

                         ELLE

             Wh at if -- you know -- it's not the
             night?


                       MARGOT

             Why else would he be taking you to The
             Ivy? You've been dating for a year --
             it's not like he's trying to impress you.                     


                        SERENA                                              

             Elle, you've heard the man pass gas in                         
             his sleep. That practically means you're                       
             pre-engaged.                                                  '"
The Saleswoman approaches with the dress, kiss-assy smile on
her face.

                        SALESWOMAN

             Did you see this one? We just got it in
             yesterday.
Elle fingers the dress, then the new price tag, looking back
at the saleswoman, excited.

                       ELLE

             Is this a low-viscosity rayon?

                        SALESWOMAN

             Uh, yes -- of course.

                       ELLE

             With half-loop top-stitching on the hem?

                        SALESWOMAN

                  (smiling a lie)
             Absolutely. It's one of a kind.

^       Elle hands the dress back to her, no longer pretending to be
         excited.


                                  ELLE

                        It's impossible to use a half-loop
                        topstitch on low-viscosity rayon. It
                        would snag the fabric. And you didn't
                        just get this in, because I remember it
                        from the June Vogue a year ago, so if
                        you're trying to sell it to me at full
                        price, you picked the wrong girl.

         The saleswoman slinks off, embarrassed.


                                   MARGOT

                             (to the saleswoman)
                        Nice try...

         Elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips
         on her Manolo Blahnik sandals, doing one last mirror check,
         smoothing down her golden mane.


                                   ELLE

                             (dramatically)
                        Girls, this is it. In a few hours, I'll
                        be the future Mrs. Warner Huntington III.

         Elle, standing nearby with Margot and Serena and several
         other DG's, smooths down her dress and takes a deep breath,
         o pening the door to find --

         WARNER HUNTINGTON, III, 21, tall, chiseled and outrageously
         handsome. He takes her in, a smile spreading across his
         face.


                                   WARNER

                        You're beautiful.


                                   ELLE

    kiss. After a moment,-Warner extracts himself.

               You ready?

    Her face is awash with devotion.


                          ELLE

               I am so ready.


7   EXT. THE IVY - NIGHT


    Warner and Elle are seated at a cozy table on the patio.
    Elle takes a sip from her freshly poured champagne flute.
    Nervous and excited.

                          ELLE

               Here' s to ~ us.
    Warner is slower to sip his.

                         WARNER

               The reason I wanted to come here tonight
               was to discuss our future.
    Elle is on the edge of her seat.

                          ELLE

               I ' m fully amenable to that discussion.

                         WARNER

              I mean, we're having a lot of fun now --
              but things are gonna be different when
              I ' m at Harvard Law school is a completely
              different world. I need to be serious.

                            ELLE

               Of course.

                            WARNER

              My family expects a lot from me. And I
              expect a lot from me. I .plan on running
              for office some day.

                         ELLE

              And I fully support that.

               But the thing is, if I ' m gonna be a
               senator by the time I ' m thirty -- I can't
               keep dicking around.

                         ELLE

               I completely agree.

                           WARNER

               T hat 's why I think it's time for us to--
     Elle takes a deep breath, filled with anticipation.

     Elle's champagne glass drops from her hand and CRASHES onto
     the patio.

                          ELLE

              What?
    Elle starts to flush, completely caught off guard.

                          WARNER

               I ' m sorry, Elle, I just --

               I thought you were proposing.

                         WARNER

               Proposing?! Elle, If I ' m going to be a
               politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not
               a -- Marilyn.

                             ELLE

               You're breaking up with me because I ' m
               too -- blonde?

    Her tears start.

                             ELLE

                  So when you said you'd always love me,
                  you were just "dicking around"?
    Warner looks around the restaurant nervously.

                             WARNER

                  I do love you, Elle. I just can't marry you.
                  You have no idea the pressure I ' m under. My
                  family has five generations of senators. My
                  brother is in the top three at Yale Law. He                ·
                  just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for crissakes.            
    Elle stares at him aghast, tears streaming down her face,
    then pushes her chair away from the table and walks out.

                             WARNER (CONT'D)

                       (continuing)
                  It's not like I have a choice, sweetheart                  

    He follows her out.

8   EXT.' STREET - NIGHT                                                 8

    Elle teeters down the sidewalk as best she can in her three                  
    inch heels, sobbing. Warner pulls up alongside her in his
    convertible Saab.

                             WARNER

                  C'mon.   Let me take you home.

                             ELLE

                  No.

                             WARNER

                  Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
    Elle stops, thinks a minute, then gets in, still crying.
    Catching her poofy little purse in the door. She re-opens
    i t, yanking the purse back in. Warner pulls out.

9   EXT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - USC - NIGHT                                 9

    Warner pulls up in front. It's a starry, romantic night.
    Everything should be perfect. It's not.
    Elle sits, still in shock, as tears continue to eke out.

                             WARNER

                  Elle, believe me, I never expected to be
                  doing this, but I think it's the right
                  thing to do.

               How can it be the right thing if we're
               not together?

                         WARNER .

               I have to think about my future. And what
               people expect from me.

                          ELLE

               So you're breaking up with me because
               you're afraid your family won't like me?
                    (through her tears)
               Everybody likes me!

                         WARNER

               East coast people are different.

                          ELLE

               Just because I ' m not a Vanderbilt, all of
               a sudden I ' m white trash? I grew up in
               Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from
               Aaron Spelling! I think most people
               would agree that's way better than a
               Vanderb ilt --

                         WARNER

               I told you, Elle.       I need someone --
               serious.

                          ELLE

               I ' m seriously in love with you -- Isn't
               that enough? He looks away.

                              WARNER

               I ' m sorry.
     She gets out of the car and drags herself up the stairs to
     her sorority house. When she's at the top, she turns back to
     look at him. His perfect cheekbones highlighted by the
     streetlamp.
     He meets her eyes, pained, but determined.       Then pulls away,
     leaving her there.

     Elle walks down the pink and green carpeted hall, dazed and
     tear-stained.
     Margot and Serena emerge from the bathroom, post-shower.
     Getting ready for a night out.

     Elle slumps down in an inflatable chair, hugging her knees
     and cowering in a wretched little ball. Underdog stares at
     her, concerned.
     Serena and Margot stand in the door.

                  liked me! She said I looked like Britney
                  Spears. Why would you say that to

     Chi t-shirt, clutching a Gund teddybear. Depressed and
     looking like hell, she speaks to an unseen confidante.

                I just love him so much! I loved him the
                first moment I saw him. He's beautiful
                and smart and someone I totally respect.
                And I did everything I could to make him
                love me, but it wasn't enough. Now what
                am I supposed to do? I planned my whole
                future around him. My life was going to
                be all about Warner. Now what's it going

     Elle lets out a wail, realizing what she'll be missing.                 
     Serena shoots Margot a stern look.

16   INT. UPSCALE MANICURE SHOP - DAY                                   16   


     A row of uniformed manicurists and their classy clients.                
     Chattering away. Therapy in full session. Serena sits in
     front of her regular nail technician.


                          SERENA

               It was awful. We all thought she'd be
               the first to walk down the aisle and now
               she's totally adrift.

     The nail technician shakes her head in shared girl-power-
     angst -- looking over at Elle, who sits in the waiting area,
     shell-shocked, but showered.                                            

     Elle picks up the only magazine left on the table -- "Town &
     Country". She wrinkles her nose. An OLD LADY next to her
     reads "Seventeen". Elle looks at her, begrudging the access
     to teen beauty tips, and flips through "Town & Country"
     n oisily until she freezes on-- the Engagement Section. She
     gasps.

                          ELLE

               Oh, my God!                    .
     She looks at a PHOTO of a horse-faced YOUNG WOMAN standing
     next to a THREE-YEARS-OLDER VERSION OF WARNER. She turns to
     the old lady next to her.

               No.

               It's Warner's older brother!


                           OLD LADY

               Who?

     Elle continues, undaunted.

     She turns to the old lady.

               This is the type-of girl Warner wants to

               be serious.
     The old lady looks at the picture.

                            OLD LADY

               Butt ugly?

                         ELLE

               No -- a law student.
     Elle rushes out.   Serena looks after her.

               Elle?
                    (turning back to her nail
                     technician)

                Yes, but your major is Fashion
                Merchandising. Harvard won't be
                impressed that you aced "History of
                Lycra". What are your backups?

                           ELLE

                I don't need backups.      Harvard is the
                school I' m going to.
      He decides to humor her.

                          ADVISOR

                Well, then. You'll need excellent
                recommendations from your professors, a
                heck of an admissions essay and at least
                a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.

     books, the framed photo of Warner, and Underdog.
      There's a KNOCK at the door as Serena and Margot peek inside,
      gasping in horror at the sight of books.

               Once Warner sees me as a serious law
               student, he'll want me back. It's a
               completely brilliant plan!

                          MARGOT

      Elle sits in front of Amy, as Amy quizzes her with practice
      LSAT questions. Books are piled high around them.
      Elle gazes out the.window to see ---Warner and some BARE-
      CHESTED FRATERNITY BOYS carrying a keg across the quad. Her
      eyes light up and she looks at Amy pleadingly. Amy shakes her
      head no. Elle slumps, then rises and goes to the window,
      closing the shades and getting back to work.

                I feel confident using legal jargon in
                daily life.

      ON VIDEO, Elle walks across campus with Underdog in her
      purse, feigning staged innocence. A RANDOM FRAT BOY pinches
       her butt. She slaps his hand, dramatically.

      "LSAT EXAM -- Sections 1-6" is scrawled on the chalk board.

      Elle sits in an auditorium with about 90 other students, LSAT

      she's practically getting a forehead wrinkle.

     Elle swerves around to pull up next to Dylan McDermott.      They
     scream at him as Serena videotapes.

                           ELLE

                Dylan!   We love you!
     Dylan McDermott burns rubber as he flees.

     Amy rushes in with a stack of mail, waving an LSAT envelope
     as she calls out.

                            AMY

               It's here!
     Elle rushes down the stairs as the other Delta Gammas gather
     around. Elle takes the envelope and says a quick prayer.

               One seventy-five...one seventy- five...

     She opens it and stares at it for a long moment. Then turns
     it to the crowd and raises it above her head in triumph. The
     girls immediately begin jumping up and down as group joy
     ensues. Underdog yips with pride. The MONTAGE ENDS.

33   INT. HARVARD LAW ADMISSIONS OFFICE - DAY                       33


     ON THE TV, Elle stands up in the Jacuzzi.

                           ELLE

                    (on TV)
               And that's why you should vote for me.
               Elle Woods. Future lawyer. For the Class
               of 2003.
     The video is PAUSED, as three ADMISSIONS GUYS in their 4.0's
     sit at a table piled high with applications, the DEAN OF
     ADMISSIONS at the head of it. STUNNED SILENCE fills the room.
     Finally one of them speaks.

                         ADMISSIONS GUY #1

               That was certainly a very --
                   (adjusting himself)
               Imaginative essay.

                          ADMISSIONS GUY #2

                    (to the Dean)
               She does have a 4.0 from USC and she got
               a one-seventy-nine on her LSATs.

                         DEAN OF ADMISSIONS

               A fashion major?

                         ADMISSIONS GUY #3

               Well, we've never had one before...
               aren't we always looking for diversity?

                         AMISSIONS GUY #1

               Her list of extracurriculars is
               impressive.
     The Dean looks at her application.

                         DEAN OF ADMISSIONS

                   (unimpressed)
               She was in a Ricky Martin video --

                          DEAN OF ADMISSIONS

                    (reading on; skeptical)
               She also designed a line of faux fur
               panties for her sorority's charity
               project --


                          ADMISSIONS GUY #3

               Then she's a friend to animals as well as                    
               a philanthropist.

               I think it's obvious that she's a very
               well-rounded individual.
     He points to Elle -- freeze-framed in her bikini-top on
     video, on the TV. The admissions guys look to the Dean.      He
     folds.

     confused.

               It's a perfectly respectable place...


                          DANIEL

               Sweetheart, you don't need law school.
               Law school is for people who are boring
               and ugly and Serious. And you, button/
               are none of those things.

     Sapphire is in agreement.

               You were first runner-up in the Miss
               Hawaiian Tropic contest. Why throw all
               that away?

      Pale, studious LAW STUDENTS clad in earth tones, move into
      their dorm, carrying in their spartan belongings (coffee
      makers, books, computers).
      In the distance, a HAPPY POP SONG (perhaps "Heaven Tonight by        
      Hole) is heard. As it gets louder, heads turn to see --              
      A silver, convertible Boxster driving up, Elle at the wheel,/        
      MUSIC BLASTING. A large MOVING VAN follows the Boxster.              
      Peop le lean out of their windows, buzzing with interest as--
      Elle's car stops in front of the dorm. She hops out,
      scooping up Underdog and looking every inch the LA-Fred-Segal-
      glamour-queen, as she looks around with a smile.
      Elle looks at Underdog.

                           ELLE

                We're here!
      She bends down to pour some Evian into his inflatable doggy
      dish, inadvertently revealing cleavage to a passing
      BESPECTACLED BOY (several yards away).
      He trips, dropping his I-MAC. It shatters into a million
      pieces.
      Not noticing/ Elle stands and turns to two MOVING GUYS/ who
      are hauling a pink, faux-fur love seat and a potted palm tree
      out of the truck.

               I've got an MBA from Wharton, worked on
               Wall Street for four years, mushed in
               three ididarods and I ' ve figured out how
               to crash the stock market in Sri Lanka if
               any of you want to get together later.

               Sweet.    What about you?
     He looks at Elle.   She sits up straight.


                           ELLE

               I ' m a Gemini. I have a Bachelors degree
               from USC, where I was Sigma Chi
               Sweetheart and president of Delta Gamma,
               and last year '· -- I was Homecoming Queen .

     She smiles, as the group leader nods, waiting.

               Oh!

               Two weeks ago, I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred
               Segal -- and talked her out of buying a
               truly heinous angora sweater! Whoever
               said that orange is the new pink is
               seriously disturbed.

     She looks around, pleased. Enid' snickers as the rest of the
     group stares at Elle, dumbfounded.


38   INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - DAY                                        38

     A grey, dingy, cell-block style room -- now crammed with
     Elle's clothes, the pink fluffy love seat and potted palm,
     along with an Elliptical Cross-Trainer, pink flamingo party
     lights and a neon pink margarita glass sculpture.

     Elle tries to shove a large law textbook into her tiny Prada
     backpack to no avail. She gives up and tosses the book onto
     the bed where Underdog leaps away to miss being squished.


                          ELLE

               Wish me luck, Underdog. It's my first
               class as a serious law student.

     She kisses him and looks down at her completely inappropriate
     skimpy Gucci outfit, which she accents by putting on trendy,
     wire-rimmed glasses.

39   INT. LAW SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY                                      39

     Elle heads for a classroom, amidst a crowd of students who
     eye her like she's an alien. She rounds a corner, seeing --

     WARNER, in all his handsome glory, looking over his schedule.
     She starts toward him, as if pulled by a magnetic force.
     Arrogant Aaron sees her passing by.


                             ARROGANT AARON

     Elle keeps going, not even noticing him. Eyes only for
     Warner. Arrogant Aaron stomps away, pissed at the perceived
     blow-off.

     As Elle gets closer to Warner, she opts for wandering past
     him, seemingly oblivious to his presence.


                          WARNER

                    (stunned)
               Elle?!

     Elle turns, ultra-nonchalant.


                          ELLE

               Warner?! Oh my God, I completely forgot
               you were going here!

     He looks at her, confused.    People walk by, staring.


                         WARNER

               What're you talking about? You're not
               here to see me?


                            ELLE

               No, silly.    I go here.


                          WARNER

            Students file in and take their seats. Elle enters, looking
            around nervously at the imposing auditorium. Arrogant Aaron,
            next to her, leans over.

            PROFESSOR ELSPETH STROMWELL, a tough-as-nails Grande Dame in
            her 50' s , addresses the class. Laptops abound -- except for
            Elle, who has a fuzzy pink notebook and a pen with a pink
            plastic heart on the end.

                                    PROFESSOR STROMWELL

                      A legal education means you will learn to
                      speak in a new language. You will be
                      taught to achieve insight into the world
                      around you, and to sharply question what
                      you know.
            Everyone soaks this up.        Including Elle.




                                                                  (C ONT IN UED )

                Well, I recommend knowing before
                speaking.. The law leaves much room for
                interpretation -- but very little for
                self-doubt.

     As she turns away --


                            PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D)

                     (continuing)
                And you were right. It was Aristotle.

     The class half-laughs in relief.

                No, I don't.


                           PROFESSOR STROMWELL

                to leave and return to class only when
                she is prepared?

     Elle can't believe that this girl would betray her. Having
     no choice,, she gathers her purse and goes, completely

     Elle looks at her schedule.

                  Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes
                  people with an opinion. Sit in the back
                  for Royalton. He tends to spit when he
                  talks about products liability.
     Elle makes a face.      He smiles.   Liking her.

                Oh, and getting one of Stromwell's daily

                acing the mid-term. But you didn't hear

     A female hand snakes around Warner's chest from behind.
     Warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his

     Sarah, the horrible girl herself, holds out her hand to Elle,
     full of contempt.

     Elle stares at her. Sarah tucks a piece of her mousy brown
     hair behind her ear and there it is -- The Rock.

     Elle drives, wiping the tears from her face. She spots
     something off to the side and SWERVES her car toward it, a
     gasp of hope escaping her lips.

                          ELLE

                Definitely! I love him!
     Paulette looks at her.

45   INT. DORMITORY - WARNER'S ROOM - DAY                          45

     Elle knocks on Warner's door, bottle of wine and two glasses
     in hand.

                            ELLE

                Warner?
     When she gets no answer, she write a message on his memo
     board -- CLOSE ON-- "Call me! Love, You Know Who".
     She leaves the wine bottle and two glasses and goes.

46   EXT. HARVARD LAW CAMPUS - DAY                                 46      

     Elle is in her push-up bikini, reclining in her beach chair,
     pink frozen margarita in one hand, Underdog in the other, law
     book in her lap, pretending to study.
     We PULL BACK to reveal that she's sitting on the sidelines of
     a touch-football game that Warner is playing with a group of
     other 1-L's.
     Warner scores easily because the other male eyes are all on
     Elle. He shakes his head and smiles.




                                                                   41.





47   INT. CRIMINAL LAW CLASS - DAY                                   47


     Elle sits, glaring at Sarah, who keeps waving her "The Rock"
     in Elle's direction, as she plays footsie with Warner.

     PROFESSOR DONOVAN -- 40s, a big fan of himself, salt and
     pepper hair, no time for bullshit -- stands before the class.

                          PROFESSOR DONOVAN

                I should warn you that in addition to
                competing against each other for the top
                grade in this class, you'll also be
                competing for one of my firm's highly
                coveted four internship spots next year
                where you will get to assist on actual
                cases. Let the bloodbath begin. Now,
                let's commence with our usual torture --
     He looks around.


                          PROFESSOR DONOVAN (CONT'D)

                    (continuing)
               Ms . Woods --

     Sarah and her bitchy, clone-like friend CLAIRE exchange
     knowing glances.


                          SARAH

               This should be amusing.

                ·        PROFESSOR DONOVAN

               Would you rather have a client who
               committed a crime malum in se or malum
               prohibitum?


                          ELLE

               Neither.


                          PROFESSOR DONOVAN

               Why not?


                          ELLE

               I'd rather have a client who's innocent.

     Elle smiles, proud of her answer. The class snickers. Warner
     frowns.


                          PROFESSOR DONOVAN

      .        Dare to dream, Ms. Woods. Ms.
                Knottingham? Which would you prefer?

                              SARAH

                   Malum prohibitum. Because the client
                   would've committed a regulatory
                   infraction as opposed to a dangerous
                   crime.
         Elle raises her hand.

                              PROFESSOR DONOVAN

                   Yes?   Ms. Woods?

                            ' ELLE                '    ..

                   I changed my mind. I ' d pick the
                   dangerous one.
         She looks pointedly at Sarah.

                               ELLE (CONT''D)

                         (continuing)
                   I ' m not afraid of a challenge.
         Sarah glares back at her. Warner looks between the two of

                  The Harvard Public Interest Law Association meeting is       
O        underway. Warner .listens intently, A few seats away, Elle
         appears to be taking notes.
         C L O SE ON--her "notes" -- "I'm free for dinner tonight. Meet
         me at The Cask & Flagon at 8."                                        
         She folds the note and sticks it in Underdog's mouth, then points
         him toward Warner. Humiliated but dutiful, Underdog bounds off.
         CLOSE ON -- Underdog, as he carries forth his mission,
         arriv ing at Warner's feet. UNDERDOG'S POV -- Warner
         discreetly takes the note from him, then looks over at Elle,
         who feigns interest in the meeting.

    49   INT. CASK & FLAGON RESTAURANT - NIGHT                            49   

         Elle waits for Warner, alone at a table. Checking her watch
         to see it's 8:45, she tries not to be sad.

    50   INT. HARVARD LAW LIBRARY - DAY                                   50   

         Warner and his study group, Sarah and Claire included, sit at
         a table, going over their outlines. Elle walks up to the
         table, holding a basket of muffins, bright smile on her face.

     '        I ' m here to join your study group. And
                look! I brought sustenance!
     She holds up the muffins as the others look up, frowns all
     around.

                            WARNER

                    (nervously looking at Sarah)
               Elle, what're you doing here?
     Elle pulls up a chair from another table and holds up a
     muffin.                       '

               Who's first?
     She sits down next to Warner.

                          SARAH

               Our group is full.

                         ELLE

               Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?

                            CLAIRE

               No, it's like a smart people thing.     And
               like Sarah said, we're full.

                         WARNER

               Come on ~ we can make room for one more.
     Sarah looks at Warner with evil eyes.

                            SARAH

               We've already assigned the outlines, and
               everyone has started theirs',

               Besides, you wouldn't let the fat guy
         _    join.

                         WARNER

               He tried to watch me take'a shower!
     Sarah looks at Elle.

                          SARAH

               The answer is no.
     Warner looks at her, feeling guilty. He shrugs an "I'm
     sorry", but Elle's perkiness has gone.

      to her chest as she goes.

                Then I guess I'll leave you alone.
      She walks away, completely deflated, passing by the RAGING
      FEMINIST STUDY GROUP. Enid calls out.


                          ENID

                Maybe there's a sorority you could join
                instead.
     Elle stops and looks at her.

                     (to Enid)
                You know, if you'd come to a Rush party,
                I would've at least been nice to you.


                          ENID

                Before you voted against me and called me
                a dyke behind my back?


                          ELLE

                I don't use that word. Only mean people
                use that word. You must've heard it from
                Sarah.                     .
     She looks back at Warner's table and walks off. As she does.,
     she's nearly mowed down by a gaggle of NERDS led by DORKY             
     DAVID, who knock the muffins out of her hands. She stands             
     there, even more depressed.

     Two feet in high heels and fishnet hose stride purposefully
     up the sidewalk.                                    .
     A perfect butt wearing a bunny tail wiggles up the steps.


56   INT. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSE - NIGHT                                   56


     A party filled with people who are no fun to party with.
     NAMETAGS denote which famous defendant everyone is dressed as.
     Menenedez's, Tonya Harding's, and Buttafuco's pepper the room.

     Elle, decked out in a Playboy Bunny costume -- looking sexy
     as hell -- strides in. People roll their eyes and ignore
     her. Elle continues on.

     NEARBY -- Enid, dressed as Lizzie Borden, axe in hand/ is in
     the midst of a tirade against some guy dressed like William
     Kennedy Smith.


                         ENID

               The English language is all about subliminal
               domination. Take the word "semester". It's a
               perfect example of this school's
               discriminatory preference of semen to
               ovaries. That's why I ' m petitioning to have
               next term be referred to as Winter Ovester.

     The guy backs up in fright. As Elle passes, Enid looks over.

                           ENID (CONT'D)

                    (continuing)
               Hey , Elle-- I've been meaning to ask you
                    (re her boobs)
               -- are those real?

     Elle snorts.


                         ELLE

               Enid, please -- silicone is so 90's.



                                                           (CONTINUED)

     She keeps walking.

     Sa rah -- dressed as Hester Prynne -- and Claire --as Joan of
     Arc -- sip wine.


                           ELLE

                     (continuing; sarcastic)
                Thanks for inviting me, girls. This party
                is super fun.

     They roll their eyes, checking out her Bunny costume.

                           SARAH

                You're supposed to be dressed as a famous
                defendant.

     Elle smiles at Sarah.


                          ELLE

                I am. Didn't you hear about the Playboy
                Bunny who slit her ex- boyfriend's new
                fiancee's throat with a broken wine
                glass? It was tragic.

     She grabs a glass of wine and moves on.

58   EXT. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT                         58


     Elle walks onto the back porch and finds Warner --dressed as
     O.J. in a USC football uniform, number 32, with a ball and
     chain on his foot.


                              ELLE

                Hey, O.J.

     Warner turns. He looks around for Sarah.      Not seeing her, he
     smiles at Elle, admiring her costume.


                             WARNER

                Wow.    You're a walking felony.


                              ELLE

                Thank you.     Having fun?


                              WARNER

                Now I am.

                          ELLE

                    (flirty)
               I feel like we've barely spent any time
               together since we got here.

                          WARNER

               That's because I spend all my time with
               case studies and hypos.

                          ELLE

               Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing
               all this and Donovan's internship next
               year.

                          WARNER

                    (scoffing)
               Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get
               the grades to qualify for one of those
               spots . You're not smart enough.
     She can't believe he's saying this.   He realizes he's gone
     too far, and back-pedals.

                         WARNER (CONT'D)

                   (continuing)
               I didn't mean --

                          ELLE

                    (cutting him off)
               Am I on glue, or did I not get into the
               same law school you did, Warner?

                           WARNER

                     (covering)
               We ll , yeah, but --

                          ELLE

               But what? We took the same LSAT, we take
               th e same classes --

                         WARNER

               I just don't want to see you get your
               hopes up. You know how you get.
     She stares at him.   Realizing the awful truth.

                         ELLE

               I'11 never be good enough for you, will

               I?

     When he doesn't answer, she walks back into the house.




                                                                       50.

     A group of tipsy ILs stand around.
     bowl filled with cash.

                           ENID

                I give her two more weeks.

     She throws a twenty into the bowl.      '    ·.   .

                           DORKY DAVID

                Two and a half?

     He throws in his twenty as well.


                          SARAH

                If she spreads her legs, maybe --


                            ARROGANT AARON

                     (adjusting his crotch)
                Only if I ' m feeling generous.


                         ELLE (O.S.)

               What is this?

     They turn around to find Elle standing there.


                          CLAIRE

               We're betting on how much longer you're
               going to last.

                           ELLE

                    (stung)
               What?


                          SARAH

               Look around, Elle.      Do you actually think
               you belong here?

     They all stare at her.


                           ELLE

                    (hurt)
               Why wouldn't I?


                          ENID

               Because the rest of us provide some
               worthwhile value to society?


                         ARROGANT AARON

               Hold on, now -- every society needs a
               bimbo. Who are we supposed to sleep with
               after we get rich?

     Elle looks like she's been slapped. The others laugh at
     Aaron's esteemed wit.


                          ELLE

                You know what? All of you can just kiss
                my ass.
     She yanks off her Bunny tail and throws it at them. Hurt and
     anger in her eyes. Then walks out of the room.


'                          ELLE (CONT'D)

                     (continuing; to herself)
                You're about to see just how valuable
                Elle Woods can be.
     She stomps out of the house.

     Elle, still in her Bunny suit, minus the tail, stands in
     line, paying for the laptop. People gape at her, but she's
     oblivious in her resolve.

     EMMETT walks up behind her in line.   He clears his throat,
     trying not to look at her costume.

     Elle turns, seeing him.


                             ELLE

                Don't ask.

                           EMMETT

     struggles to forge on, despite her instinct to stop and
     repair it.

                           PROFESSOR DONOVAN

                And the purpose of "diminished capacity"
                is?
     She swallows nervously, then speaks.

                          ELLE

                To negate mens rea?
     Donovan nods affirmatively and continues.      Elle hides a
     smile.

     Elle reaches for a book on a high shelf, but she's not tall
     enough. She tries a running start and leaps for it. Still
     missing it.

     upon a picture of a NAKED MAN. Oh, the horror. She throws it
     down in disgust as if her eyes have been burned.
     Looking around, Enid sees Elle smiling and waving at her from

               Meaning you need -- reasonable belief

     Stromwell is somewhat impressed, but doesn't show it.


                          PROFESSOR STROMWELL

               And what kind of evidentiary support does
               this case require? Let's ask Mr.

     THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see Elle and Paulette sitting in the
     empty salon, laughing and clinking cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon
     as they toast Elle's small victory. We PULL BACK, leaving
     them laughing, as the MONTAGE ENDS.

     "THE STATE V. LATIMER" is written on the board. A pony-
     tailed, less made-up Elle takes notes on her lap-top, as
     Warner makes an argument.


                              WARNER

             . According to Swinney v. Neubert, Swinney,
              who was also a private sperm donor, was
               allowed visitation rights as long as he
               came to terms with the hours set forth by
               the parents. So, if we're sticking to
              past precedent, Mr. Latimer wasn't
               st al ki ng -- he was clearly within his
               rights to ask for visitation.


                          PROFESSOR DONQVAN

               But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor,
               and in our case, the defendant was a
               habitual sperm donor, who also happens to
               be harassing the parents in his quest for
               visitation.

               Although Mr. Huntington makes an
               excellent point, I have to wonder if the                       
               defendant kept a thorough record of each                       
               sperm emission made throughout his life?

     The class titters.    Elle grows annoyed.

                    (bemused)
               Why do you ask?

     Elle's hesitancy is replaced by conviction.

                             ELLE

               Well, unless the defendant attempted to                        
               contact every single one-night- stand to
               determine if a child resulted in those
               unions -- then he has no parental claim
               whatsoever over this child. Why this
               s p e rm ? Why now?      '

                  abandonment.

     Warner's mouth hangs open. As does Sarah's and the rest of
     the class. Donovan smiles.

     cashmere twinset and wrinkles her nose, but throws it over
     her arm anyway.

     The elevator door opens and Warner and Elle emerge. Elle is
     sporting her new, boring "lawyer" clothes. Warner is baffled
     and impressed by her transformation.

     Professor Donovan opens his briefcase as Elle, Sarah, Enid
     and Warner hang on his every word.

               We're defending Brooke Windham, whose
               very wealthy husband was found shot to
               death in their Beacon Hill mansion.

                         SARAH

               Gold digger?

                           PROFESSOR DONOVAN

               You'd think so, since the stiff was
               sixty, but she was rich on her own. Some
               kind of fitness empire. You can buy her
               exercise tapes on infomercials.
     Elle frowns.

                           ELLE

               Wait a minute -- are we talking about
               Brooke Daniels?
     Donovan checks his papers.

               You know her?

               She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge
               class or anything -- she graduated ,five
               years ahead of me. But I used to take her
               class at the LA Sports Club. She's
               amazing!
     The others looks at each other and roll their eyes.

                          PROFESSOR DONOVAN

               Amazing how?


                         ELLE

               She could make you drop three pounds in
               one class. She's completely gifted!

                           PROFESSOR DONOVAN

               Well, in all likelihood, she's completely
               guilty as well. She was seen standing
               over her husband's dead body.

               he'd been dead thirty minutes dead when
               the cops arrived -- giving Brooke plenty
               of time to stash it.

                "Oh, look! There's something on the
                floor that I need to pick up!" Bend...                    
     She slowly BENDS down, as if to pick up something, sticking          
     out her tush, knee cocked. She slids her hand down her               
     cocked leg until her hand touches the floor and she SNAPS            
     back up, boobs a'bouncing.

                Good. Now this time, put a little arch in
                your back and maybe get your footing more                 
                solid.

     Donovan, the FEMALE DA, the associates, the interns and a

                          CHUTNEY

               I got out of the shower," walked
               downstairs, saw her standing over my
               father, and called the police.


                         DONOVAN

               Did she have a weapon in her hand?


                          CHUTNEY

               No.


                          DONOVAN

               Was there any reason for you to believe
               she had discarded a weapon?

                          CHUTNEY

               Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.


                          DONOVAN

               Was there any evidence that Mrs . Windham
               shot him?

                          ENRIQUE

               I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body
               of Mr. Windham.

                          DONOVAN

               Was she carrying a weapon?

               No, she was crying her eyes out.

     Donovan smiles.

                          DONOVAN

               So she was distraught that her husband
               was dead?


                          ENRIQUE

               Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet,
               wonderful woman I know. I have loved her
               since the day she hired me. She could
               never do something this awful. I know
               this because we are very close.

     The others shift uncomfortably, then look at each other. Then.,
     back at Enrique and his shiny, unbuttoned-to-show-his-pecs
     shirt. The DA smiles.

                I have made my fortune on my ability to
                teach women how to perfect their bodies
                with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.

                           ELLE

                I know!   You helped me go from a six to a
                four!
     Brooke starts to cry again.

     Elle hugs her to her chest, consoling her.

95   INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN - LIBRARY - DAY            95


     The associates and interns sit at a table piled high with
     research, as Donovan goes over his notes.


                           DONOVAN

..              We've got two interviews tomorrow that
                Dick and Bobby are gonna handle, and the
                ex-wife in an hour.
     He looks up.


                           DONOVAN (CONT'D)

                     (continuing)
                Sarah, can you grab me some coffee?

     Sarah rises, and fetches the coffee from the side table.


                            DONOVAN (CONT'D)

                     (continuing)
                And according to this communique from the
                prison, our client apparently had a visit

                Anyone you know?

     Elle looks up, caught.   The others looks at her.


                           ELLE

                I went to get her alibi.

     Emmett looks over, surprised.

                           DONOVAN

                Did you get it?


                             ELLE

                        But I can't tell you what it is.
                Yes.

     The others can't believe this.

                           DONOVAN

                Why the hell not?

                         ' ELLE

                I promised her I ' d keep it secret. I
                can't break the bonds of sisterhood!

     Now he's pissed.

                           DONOVAN

                Fuck sisterhood. This is a murder trial,
                not some scandal at the sorority house.
                I want the alibi.

     Sarah sets Donovan's coffee down.     Watching to see what Elle
     will do.


                          ELLE

                I can't give it to you. All I can tell
                you is that she's innocent.

     An ASSISTANT pokes her head in the room.


                           ASSISTANT

                Mr. Donovan? Mrs. Windham Vandermark is
                on line two.

     Donovan rises, still annoyed.


                           DONOVAN

                Someone reason with her while I take
                this.

     He walks out.     The others look at Elle.


                          BOBBY

                Are you crazy? Tell him the alibi.


                            ELLE

                Then we're not very good lawyers.

     Emmett hides a smile.     Warner leans over to Elle.   Sarah is
     nearby, listening. ·

                           WARNER

                Think about yourself.


                           ELLE

                I gave her my word, Warner.

     Sarah watches -- seeing both Warner and Elle in a different
     light.

     Donovan storms back in.


                           DONOVAN

                The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with
                the fact that her interview is today.
                She's at a spa in the Berkshires.                             


                           GERARD

     Elle shrugs and looks at Donovan.

                I can go if you want.

     pointed "Get the alibi" look.

     Emmett drives, Elle is shotgun.

                           ELLE

                Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.


                           EMMETT

                Uh, for starters, she won'-t give us an
                al i bi --

                           ELLE

                Aside from that.


                           EMMETT

                She's completely untrustworthy.


                           ELLE

                Why?


                           EMMETT

                She married an old man, she's made a
                living on telling women they're too fat,
                she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping
                Network...

                          ELLE

                A) He's an old man with a really big
                penis. B) She never told me I was fat.
                And C) Victoria Principal sells on that
                network.

                           EMMETT

                And D) Brooke is obviously hiding
                something.

                          ELLE

                But maybe it's not what you think.

                           EMMETT

                Bu t maybe it is--         .

     They're quiet for a moment.     She looks at him.


                           ELLE

                You're kind of being a butt-head right

                How do you figure?


                           ELLE

                Because people aren't always what they
                seem to be and you refuse to see that.
                Have a little faith. You might be
                surprised.
     They're quiet again while he thinks about this.         He looks
     over at her.

                          EMMETT

                I can't believe you called me a butt-
                head. No one's called me a butt-head
                since ninth grade.


                           ELLE

                Maybe not to your face...

     She gives him a teasing smile.        He smiles back at her,
     shaking his head.

                the way in the pool house.


                             EMMETT

                I ' m sure that was very awkward for
                Chutney.
                      (sotto)
                Much as it is for me, hearing you tell
                about it.

                           MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK

                But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.

                           EMMETT

                Why do you say that?

                          MRS . WINDHAM VANDERMARK

                Haven't you seen the cabana boy?

                           MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK

                Like I said, I've never met Brooke, but I
                have seen her from a distance. When I ' d
                come over to pick up the alimony check
                that Heyworth forgot to mail every month,
                she'd be out by the pool, with Mr. Hot
                Pants hovering over her with some pink
                drink.


                            EMMETT

                Hovering?


                           MRS . WINDHAM VANDERMARK

                I didn't stick around long enough to
                watch him stick his swizzle stick in her
                mouth, but I ' d bet my next check that
                that ' s where he was about to put it .

                           EMMETT

                How can you still believe she's innocent?


                           ELLE

                You're going to trust the word of a woman
                who named her child after a condiment?
                She's ly-ing.

                           EMMETT

                And you know this for a fact?


                         ' ELLE

                Did you see the icky black color of her
                hair?

                            EMMETT

                So?

                            ELLE

                I never trust a woman who's not blonde.
                Except for my friend Serena, but that's
                only because she's a blonde at heart.
                That's the whole reason I ' m starting the
                Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
     He looks at her and laughs.

                            EMMETT

                The what?


                          ELLE

                Blondes are discriminated against
                worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people
                are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy
                pool boy and shooting her husband. If
                she was a mousy brunette, it would be,
                "Oh, the poor widow."

                          EMMETT

                You're serious?
     She's fired up now.


                            ELLE

                You should see the way I ' m treated in
                class! I'm a complete source of mockery.
                This is why the Blonde Legal Defense Fund
                is needed.
     He goes along with it, won over by her enthusiasm.

                          EMMETT

                Okay, how would it work?


                                                             (CONTINUED)

               It would be a full-service law firm, by
               and for blondes, providing positive
               blonde role models and community outreach
               in high blonde areas. I mean, think
               about it -- name one blonde intellectual
               role model.

                          EMMETT

               -- I can't.

                         ELLE

               That is a direct result of anti- blonde
               discrimination!

                          EMMETT

               Wait -- Hilary Clinton.

                         ELLE

               If she were a true blonde, she would've
               left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't
               let their husbands get fellated by
               brunettes and live to tell about it.
     Emmett frowns.

                          EMM E T T

        .     In that case, maybe Heyworth got ---
               fellated --by a brunette and Brooke
               caught him.

                         ELLE

               Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think
               a sixty-year-old man can take? ·.

                         EMMETT

               That's not really a topic that keeps me
               up at night -- but maybe it should.
     Elle digs in her purse.

                         ELLE

               Speaking of that ·-- I bought you some
               seaweed cream while we were at the spa.
     She hands it to him.    He keeps his hands on the wheel, not
     taking it.

                 Fine. Sorry I brought it up.

      She puts the cream back in her purse.        They ride in silence
      fo r a moment. Then --

                me don't go out with losers like you.                      

      Her friends snicker. Elle stops at this and sighs,                   
      acknowledging to herself that she has to help this guy.   She        
      turns and marches back, SLAPPING Dorky David across the   face.      
      Dorky David is stunned, as is the Freshman Girl.

                 Mr. Salvatore, can you tell us what this                      
                 is?

      We PULL BACK to reveal that the DA is holding it up as she          
      questions Enrique.                                                   


                           ENRIQUE

                My uniform.

                           DA JOYCE RAFFERTY

                This is the uniform that Mrs. Windham
                asked you to wear while cleaning her
                pool?

                            ENRIQUE

                Yes.

                           DA JOYCE RAFFERTY

                And are you or are you not, having an
                affair with Brooke Windham?

      Enrique shifts in his seat.


                           ENRIQUE

                Define affair.

                          DA JOYCE RAFFERTY

                Have you inserted your genitalia into
                hers?

                          DONOVAN

                Objection --


                           DA JOYCE RAFFERTY

                     (to Enrique)
                Have you and Mrs. Windham had sexual
                relations?


                            ENRIQUE

                Y es!   Okay? Yes!
      The courtroom gasps. Elle looks over at Brooke, who's
      shaking her head, outraged.

105   INT. COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER                                105

      Everyone files out.    As Brooke is being led away, she turns        
      to Elle.                                                            

                              BROOKE

                I'm not having an affair with Enrique --                  
                you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep
                with a man who wears a thong! I just
                liked watching him bend over to clean the
                f i lt e r --

                            ELLE

                 I believe you! Don't worry.

      Brooke is taken away.


106   INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT                                   106


      Elle, in sweats and a pony-tail, pours over a mammoth-sized
      deposition. A KNOCK sounds.

                              ELLE

                 Come in.

      Sarah enters.


                              SARAH

                      (re the depo)
                 You done with that yet?
      Elle hands the deposition over.

                          ELLE

                Take it. I've read it twenty times.
      She grabs another one off of the stack and begins reading.
      Sarah lingers.

                              SARAH

                I believe her, too. I don't think she's
                having an affair with Enrique.

                          ELLE

                Too bad you and I are the only ones.

                             SARAH

                 I ' m still can't believe you didn't tell
                 Donovan the alibi.
      Elle looks up, defensive.

                           ELLE

                 It's not my alibi to tell --

                              SARAH

                      (interrupting)
                 I know. I thought that was very --
                 classy of you.          .

                              ELLE

                      (surprised)
                 Really? Thanks.
      Sarah starts to go, then stops.

                                 SARAH

y                   Have you ever noticed that Donovan never
                    asks Warner to bring him coffee? He's
                    asked me at least a dozen times.
          Elle shrugs.

                              ELLE

                    Men are helpless.     You know that.                      
          Sarah lingers, leaning on the edge of the couch.

                              SARAH

                    Warner can't even do his own laundry.

                                 ELLE

                    I know.     He has it sent out.

                               SARAH


                                                                          -

                    Did you know he got wait-listed when he
                    appli ed? His father had to make a call.

                               ELLE

                         (stunned)
                    You're kidding!
          A KNOCK sounds on the open door and Margot and Serena poke
          their heads in.

                                 MARGOT AND SERENA

                    Surprise!


                               ELLE

                    Oh, my God!                       ' -.
          Sarah watches as Elle jumps up to hug the girls, who each
          have a bottle of Veuve Cliquot in their hands.

                               ELLE (CONT'D)

                         (continuing)
                    What're you doing here?!

                              SERENA

                    We're on our way to the bridal show in                    
                    New York so we thought we'd rescue you                    
                    from law school for the night.

                               MARGOT

                         (tempting her)
                    We have a limo downstairs and lots more
                    of these.
          She wiggles her champagne bottle.

                             ELLE

                 You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle
                 of a trial.

                              SERENA

                 At the office ~                                                
      Margot and Serena look over at her.                                       

                             MARGOT

                 Oh, how sweet!        You made friends with a
                 nerdy girl.

                             ELLE

                 Margot!

                            SERENA

                 Bring her, too.
                      (to Sarah)
                 C'mon. You can wear one of Elle's
                 outfits.

                               SARAH

                 T ha t ' s okay --

                             MARGOT

                      (to Elle)
                 Speaking of which, can you please put on
                 some party clothes? You look like
                 someone rolled you in something sticky
                 and dragged you through a K-Mart.

                            ELLE

                     (torn)
                I can't believe you guys are actually
                here -- but this case is important. I'll                        
                make it up to you after finals, okay? I
       --      promise. I really want to do a good job.
      Margot and Serena stare at her, realizing she means it.

                           SERENA

                 Okay. . . Call us if you change your mind.
      They start to head out. Margot hands Sa-rah the bottle of champagne.

                             MARGOT

                 Here.

      She spots The Rock on Sarah's finger and grabs her hand.


                            MARGOT (CONT'D)

                      (continuing)
                 Jesus. Talk about a Rock. You must be
                 better in bed than you look.

      Elle hustles them out the door.

                            ELLE

                 I'll call you as soon as it's over, okay?                  
                 Sisters forever?

                 Sister forever.                                            
      She shuts the door behind them.    Then looks at Sarah.


                            ELLE                                            

                      (continuing)
                 Sorry about that.

      Sarah sets down the Veuve.


                            SARAH

                 Save it.

      She smiles at Elle.

                            SARAH (CONT'D)

                      (continuing)
                 We'll drink it after we win.

      Elle smiles .


107   INT. BEAUTY OASIS - DAY                                         107   

      Paulette arranges a nail polish display by the door.


                            UPS GUY (O.S.)

                 I've got a big one for you.
      Paulette freezes and slowly turns to find UPS Guy holding out
      a big package.


                           UPS GUY (CONT'D)

                 Can you sign?

      He hands her the computerized tablet and as he does, the pen
      velcroed to the side falls off.
      Paulette watches as it FALLS IN SLO-MO. Realizing that now            
      is the perfect time to try the Bend & Snap.

      She bends slowly, tush out, knee cocked. She grabs the pen
      and as she prepares to Snap back up, UPS Guy leans over to
      help.

                            UPS GUY (CONT'D)

                      (continuing)
                 Got it?
      Not realizing he's leaning over, she SNAPS back up --
      CLOCKING him in the NOSE with her head.

      He reels backward, holding his nose, blood flowing as
      Paulette stares at him-in horror.


                              PAULETTE

                 Oh my God!

108   INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                               108

      Elle waits in line for the water fountain, talking on her
      cell phone.

                            ELLE

                      (into phone)
                 You broke his nose?!

      We INTERCUT with Paulette as she watches- UPS Guy being
      carried out by paramedics on a gurney. The ladies of the
      shop flutter around him, concerned.


                           UPS GUY

                 I 'm okay --


                            PAULETTE

                 I think he noticed me, Elle --
                      (sobbing)
                 But only because I maimed him!


                              ELLE

                      (consoling)
                 I'll be over right after the trial, okay?
                 We're about to cross- examine Enrique.
                 And don't worry! My friend Serena barfed
                 on a guy during "The Blair Witch Project"
                 and end up dating him for three months.
      She hangs up. Enrique cuts in front of her in line for the

      He finishes getting his drink and turns, looking at her.

      He walks past, as.Elle gapes at him.     Realizing.

      Elle grabs Emmett's arm as he whispers with Donovan.


                             ELLE

                He's gay!    Enrique is gay!


                             EMMETT

                What?!
      She grabs Warner as he's passing.


                           ELLE

                Warner, what kind of shoes do I have on?

      He looks down at her Prada sandals.


                             WARNER

                Pink ones.


                             ELLE

                See?

      Donovan frowns, not seeing.

                           DONOVAN

                What are you talking about?


                             ELLE

                He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover!
                He's making it up. Whoever killed
                Heyworth is paying him off.

                             EMMETT

                Back up.     How do you know he's gay?

                             ELLE

                Gay men know designers.     Straight men
                don't.
      She points at Warner, who shrugs. Brooke leans over.

                          BROOKE

                What's going on?

                           ELLE

                Enrique's gay. I ' m sure of it.'

                He did leave a Cher tape in the pool
                house once --
      Donovan scoffs.

                          DONOVAN

                While I appreciate your masterful legal                   
                theory, I have a murder trial to attend                   
                to.
      He grabs Emmett's arm and pulls him aside as they confer on
      more serious matters. Emmett looks at her as if to say
      "Sorry", before he looks back at Donovan.
      Brooke looks at Donovan, then back at Elle, rolling her eyes.
      Elle sits down, pissed. Warner is next to her.

                          ELLE

                Thanks for the backup.

                          WARNER

                How was I supposed to know what kind of
                shoes you had on?
      She looks at him like he's a complete idiot, as the judge
      takes his seat.

110   INT. COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                          110


       Donovan is in front of Enrique, who is at the stand.               

                          DONOVAN

                Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that
                you and Mrs. Windham were having an
                affair?

                          ENRIQUE

                Just the love in my heart.
      Women in the audience openly sigh.     Elle makes a puke
      gesture. Enid concurs.
      Donovan smiles a smug smile.

                          DONOVAN

                If that's all the proof that he has, your
                Honor, I think I'm done here.
      Emmett stands.

                          EMMETT

                I have a couple of questions, Your Honor?


                                                           (CONTINUED)

      Donovan glares at him.

                              EMMETT (CONT'D)

                        (continuing; sotto to Donovan)
                   Give me two minutes.

      He approaches Enrique and starts firing questions at rapid
      speed.

                              EMMETT (CONT'D)

                        (continuing)
                   Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?


                              ENRIQUE

                Yes.


                              EMMETT

                Where?


                           ENRIQUE

                A restaurant in Oakland.      Where no one
                would recognize us.


                           EMMETT

                And how long have you been sleeping with
                Mrs. Windham?


         .                 ENRIQUE

                Three months.

                           EMMETT

                And what is your boyfriend's name?


                              ENRIQUE

                Chuck.
      The audience lets out a gasp.      Elle looks up, shocked, then
      delighted.

      Enrique begins to sweat.


                               ENRIQUE (CONT'D)

                         (continuing)
                   I ' m sorry, I misunderstood.   Chuck is
                   just a friend.

      CHUCK, scrawny and angry, stands up in the audience.


                            CHUCK

                If I ' m just your friend, why have we been
                doing the slippy-slap every night for the
                past six months?

      The courtroom ERUPTS and the judge bangs the gavel.

      Elle smiles victoriously from her seat.   Emmett grins back at
      her.
      Donovan shakes his head, smiling in amazement.

111   EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                           111

      Elle and Emmett walk down the stairs together in high
      spirits. Donovan catches up.


                            DONOVAN

                 Good work today, Ms. Woods.


                              ELLE

                 Thank you!

      He walks on.   She looks at Emmett, excited.   He high-fives          
      her.

      Paulette is closing up as Elle follows her around.

                      (in a giddy, rush)
                 And after they set his nose, he came back                  
                 for his truck and I offered to drive for
                 him since he was still on pain-killers
                 and we spent the whole afternoon
                 together! He was unconscious for part of                   
                 it, but it was really fun!


                             ELLE

                           ELLE

                 Great. Donovan actually said the words
                 "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me
                 seriously! Can you believe it?


                            PAULETTE

                 Of course I can believe it. You're going                   
                 to make a great lawyer.                                    

      Paulette looks at Elle. Emotional.

      Elle passes Sarah, who carries a stack of depos into the                
      conference room to Dick and Bobby.

                           SARAH

                 He's already got his coffee -- maybe he                      
                 needs a donut.                                               
      They share a smile as Elle walks over to Donovan's glass-                   
      walled office and knocks on the door. Nervous.

                               DONOVAN

                 Come on in.

      He beckons her inside, and she goes, shutting the door behind
      her.

                   what makes a good lawyer. And on top of
                   that, you gained the client's trust and
                   kept it.. That' s what makes a great

                   Wow. That means so much to me to hear you
                   say that.
      Donovan walks around his desk and sits in the chair opposite
      her.

                             DONOVAN

                   I think it's time discuss your career                      
                   path. Have you thought about where you                     
                   might be a summer associate?

                   You know what competition is really
                   about, don't you?
      Eager for his knowledge, Elle is on the edge of her seat. He

115   OUTSIDE DONOVAN'S OFFICE                                              115

      Sarah walks down the hallway, glancing in Donovan's office to see --

      H E R POV --


      Donovan's hand sliding up Elle's skirt.         She shakes her head
      in disgust, & heads off- NOT SEEING

      Elle stares at Donovan in horror, then grabs his hand --
      stopping its journey upward.


                                 ELLE

      Elle rises, stung.       She stares at him for a beat.

                     realized her professor is a pathetic
                     asshole.

      She walks out.


                                DONOVAN

                          (calling out)
                     Too bad. I thought you were a law
                     student who wanted to be a lawyer.

      Elle keeps walking.




                                                                   101.





117   INT. AUSTEN, JARET, PLATT ETC. - ELEVATOR - MOMENT LATER      117    


      Elle is in the elevator. Flushed and upset. As the doors
      start to close, Sarah sticks her arm in, blocking them.

                          SARAH

                You almost had me fooled.

                           ELLE

                What?

                          SARAH

                Maybe you should sleep with the judge
                too. Then we can win the case.
      Sarah steps back, letting the doors shut.                                

118   INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT                                    118


      Elle stomps out of the elevator, as Emmett gets in.


                           EMMETT

                I'm quitting.
      She marches past.   He follows, catching up.                             

                          EMMETT

                Whoa -- Why?

                          ELLE

                Law school was a mistake.   Getting this
                internship was a mistake.

                          EMMETT

                What're you talking about? You earned
                it-
      She snorts.

                          ELLE

                I didn't earn anything. I got this
                internship because Donovan liked the way
                I looked. Which he made clear .tonight                         
                when he tried to feel me up.                                   
      Emmett looks pissed as he processes this.

                         . ELLE

                Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my                    
                destiny as a useless bimbo and join the

                What if you're trying to be something you
                are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.                           

      She stops, giving him a sad smile.

      with a manicure.

                What's the point of staying? All people
                see when they look at me is blonde hair
                and big boobs. No one's ever going to
                take me seriously. The people at law
                s chool don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't
                even think my parents take me seriously.
                They wanted me to grow up and become a
                Victoria's Secret model who marries a
                rock star. Now, for the first time, it
                seemed like someone expected me to do
                something better with my life than wear
                underwear for a living. But I was kidding
                mys elf -- Donovan didn't see me as a
                lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass.

                The hell with law school. I just came to
                say goodbye.


      IN A NEARBY CHAIR


      Professor Elspeth Stromwell spins around, nails drying,
      facing Elle.

                          PROFESSOR STROMWELL

                If you let one stupid prick ruin your
                life, you're not the girl I thought you
                were.

      Elle looks at her, shocked, as Professor Stromwell stands and
      goes.

                Enrique Salvatore has been discredited as a witness.

                          REPORTER #2 ON TV

                Did you go in there knowing how you were
                going to discredit Mr. Salvatore?


                           DONOVAN ON TV

                Absolutely. It's a little thing I like
                to call strategy.

      He gives the reporters a smug smile.


      IN THE WAITING ROOM

      Brooke looks away from the TV. Emmett is next to her,
      prepping her for the following day.

                 I don't think you heard me. You're fired.
                 She's my lawyer.

                            JUDGE

                 Counselors, now.    All of you.
      Elle, Donovan and Emmett head up, as does the DA.      Elle hands
      the judge the case book.

                            ELLE

                 Elle Woods, your honor. Rule 3:03 of the                     
                 Supreme Judicial Court states that a law                     ·
                 student may appear on behalf of a                            
                 defendant in criminal proceedings.                           


                             DA JOYCE RAFFERTY

                      (stoked)
                 I have no problem with this.


                             DONOVAN

                 I do.   I'm not allowing it.


                            ELLE

                      (pointedly)
                 But you agreed last night. In the
                 office? When we were discussing my
                 "career"?

      The implication lingers in the air, as Donovan glares at her.


                            JUDGE

                      (reading the casebook)
                 The ruling also states that you need a
                 licensed attorney to supervise you. Mr.
                 Donovan?


                            DONOVAN

                 That, I won't agree to.

      Emmett steps forward.


                             EMMETT

                 I ' m supervising, Your Honor.                               

      Elle smiles at him. Donovan looks from Emmett to Elle,
      completely derailed.


                            JUDGE

                 Well, then, Ms. Woods.    Proceed.

      Elle walks back to the table with a grin.       Warner looks shocked.

                 Enjoy prison.

      The judge looks at Brooke.

                 Mrs. Windham, you do realize what you're

      Elle looks at her, surprised.


                            JUDGE

                 Ms. Woods, call your first witness.


                            ELLE

                 I'd like to recall Chutney Windham as a
                 defense witness.
      The crowd murmurs.     Donovan rolls his eyes.

                 First, your Honor, I ' d like to point out                   
                 that not only is there no proof in this                      
                 case, but there's a complete lack of mens                    
                 rea, which by definition tells us that                       
                 there is no crime without a vicious will.

                I am aware of the meaning of mens rea.                     
                What I am unaware of is why you're giving                  
                me a vocabulary lesson instead of                          
                questioning your witness.                                  
      Flustered, Elle turns to Chutney.

                Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived                      
                back at the house? Was your father there?                     

                          CHUTNEY

                Not that I saw. But like I said, I went
                straight upstairs to take a shower.           '   ,

                          ELLE

                And when you came downstairs, what happened?

                          CHUTNEY

                I saw Brooke standing over his body,
                drenched in his blood.

                          ELLE

                But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?

                          CHUTNEY

                No, she'd stashed it by then.
      Brooke rolls her eyes.

                          EMMETT                                              

                Move to strike that from the record, your                     
                Honor. Speculation.

                            JUDGE

                Stricken.
      Elle mentally kicks herself for not doing this herself.                  
      Eirimett gives her a reassuring nod. She takes a deep breath,       ·     
      then continues on.

                            CHUTNEY

                 No.   I was in the shower.

                            ELLE

                 So at some point in the -- twenty
                 minutes? -- you were in the shower, your
                 father was shot?

                            CHUTNEY

                 I guess.
      Elle paces a bit. Underdog watches from her purse on the
      table, intrigued by her line of questioning.

                           ELLE

                Your father was shot while you were in
                the shower?

      Gerard looks at Emmett.

                           GERARD

                Where's she going with this?


                           EMMETT

                Have a little faith.


                           ELLE

                But you didn't hear the shot, because you
                were in the shower.

                          CHUTNEY

                    (annoyed)
                Yes. I was washing my hair.

      Elle's onto something, but not sure what.                           .    


                           ELLE

                Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd
                been doing earlier in the day?


                           CHUTNEY

                I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the
                gym, got a perm, and came home.


                           ELLE

                Where you got in the shower.


                             CHUTNEY

                       (impatient)
                Yes.


                           JUDGE                                               

                I believe the witness has made it clear                        
                that she was in the shower.                                    
      People start to murmur.    Donovan snickers.    Sarah looks
      worried.                                                                 

                           ELLE

                Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a                .       .
                perm before, Miss Windham?


                             CHUTNEY

                       (confused)
                Yes.

      The beginnings of a smile start to spread across Elle's face.

                 math.

                              ELLE

                 You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy
                 Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we                   
                 all told her not to ~ curls really                          
                 weren't the right look for her --
                      (chummy)
                 She didn't have your bone structure.

       Chutney almost smiles.

                              ELLE (CONT'D)

                        (continuing)
                 But, thankfully, that same day, she
                 entered the Pi Kap wet t-shirt contest
                 where she was completely hosed down from
                 head to toe.

       Donovan shakes his head at her incompetence.

                              DA JOYCE RAFFERTY

                 Objection.    Why is this relevant?
       Emmett clears his throat, worried. Elle turns around, giving
       him a "trust me" look. Then turns back to the judge.


                            ELLE

                      (to the judge)
                 I have a point. I promise.


                            JUDGE

                 Then make it.

       Elle looks at Chutney.                                   ..           


                            ELLE

                 Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's
                 curls were ruined when she got hosed
                 down?


                            CHUTNEY

                 Because they got wet.


                           ELLE

                 That's right. Because isn't the first
                 cardinal rule of perm maintenance that
                 you are forbidden to wet your hair for at
                 least twenty-four hours after getting a
                 perm at the risk of de-activating the
                 ammonium thiglycolate?

       Chutney pales.

                 Yes --
      Elle continues.


                             ELLE

                 And wouldn't someone who's had -- thirty
                 perms ? -- throughout her lifetime, be
                 well aware of this rule?

      Chutney doesn't answer.     She just glares at Brooke.

                            ELLE (CONT'D)

                      (continuing)
                 And if you, in fact, were not washing
                 your hair, as I suspect you were not,
                 since your curls are still intact,
                 wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

      Chutney continues to glare.

                            ELLE (CONT'D)

                      (continuing)
                 And if you in fact, heard the gunshot,
                 then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had
                 time to hide the gun before you got
                 downstairs. Which would mean that you
                 would've had to have found Mrs. Windham
                 with a gun in her hand to make your story
                 sound plausible. Isn't that right?


                           CHUTNEY

                 She's younger than I am. Did she tell
                 you that? How would you feel if your
                 father married someone younger than you?


                           ELLE

                 You, however, had time to hide the gun,
                 didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your
                 father?

      Brooke looks at Chutney in horror, realizing.


                            CHUTNEY

                 I didn't mean to shoot him --                                ·

      She pulls off her engagement ring.

130   EXT. HARVARD LAW SCHOOL QUAD - DAY                           130   

      "Welcome Law Students Class of 2004" banners hang over
      orientation tables. Nervous first year students stand in
      line.
      We PAN ACROSS a row of club tables -- passing "Harvard Law         .
      Journal" and "Environmental Law Association" ·-- until we           
      reach a table that proudly bears the banner of "Blonde Legal
      Defense Club".
      Elle, in a red 2L t-shirt, stands behind the table,

                                                                             

      straightening some flyers. UNDERDOG is plopped down on top
      of the stack. Elle turns to see EMMETT next to her.

                   Is he the only one?

                             EMMETT

                   What do you think?
      They kiss.

      Elle smiles, turning back as A NERVOUS 1L GIRL steps up.

                             NERVOUS 1L GIRL

                   Do you have to be blonde to sign up?

                Only blonde at heart.
                     (to the girl next to her)
                Right?
      Elle smiles and looks down at -- the NEWLY BLONDE SARAH.
      Sarah returns the smile as we PULL BACK to see a CROWD of
      first year girls gathered around Elle's table, rushing to
      sign up. Ready to be as blonde as they can be.
